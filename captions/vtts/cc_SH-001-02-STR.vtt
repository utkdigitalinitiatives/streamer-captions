00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600


2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.570
What, Lucius, ho!

3
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.070
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.430
give guess how near to day.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.800
Lucius, I say!

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.630
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.770
When, Lucius, when?

8
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.030
Awake, I say!

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.300
What, Lucius!

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.930
Call'd you, my lord?

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.670
Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.270
When it is lighted, come and call me here.

13
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.900
I will, my lord.

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.070
It must be by his death, and, for my part,

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.100
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,

16
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.200
but for the general.

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.800
He would be crown'd:

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.630
how that might change his nature, there's the question.

19
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.030
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder

20
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.430
and that craves wary walking.

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.830
Crown him that,

22
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.270
and then, I grant, we put a sting in him

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.000
that at his will he may do danger with.

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.200
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power,

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
and, to speak truth of Caesar,

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
I have not known when his affections

27
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.500
sway'd more than his reason.

28
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.400
But 'tis a common proof

29
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.930
that lowliness is young ambition's ladder,

30
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.830
whereto the climber-upward turns his face;

31
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.900
but when he once attains the upmost round,

32
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.070
he then unto the ladder turns his back, looks in the clouds,

33
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.670
scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend.

34
00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:02.130
So Caesar may; then, lest he may, prevent.

35
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.570
And, since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is,

36
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.070
fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,

37
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.770
would run to these and these extremities;

38
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.330
and therefore think him as a serpent's egg

39
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.030
which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,

40
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.330
and kill him in the shell.

41
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.130
The taper burneth in your closet, sir.

42
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.830
Searching the window for a flint

43
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.070
I found this paper thus seal'd up,

44
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.600
and I am sure it did not lie there when I went to bed.

45
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.630
Get you to bed again, it is not day.

46
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.630
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.300
I know not, sir.

48
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.500
Look in the calendar and bring me word.

49
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.930
I will, sir.

50
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.470
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself.

51
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.770
Shall Rome, et cetera.

52
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.700
Speak, strike, redress!"

53
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.030
"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake."

54
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.230
Such instigations have been often dropp'd

55
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.370
where I have took them up.

56
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.000
"Shall Rome, et cetera."

57
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.600
Thus must I piece it out.

58
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.830
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe?

59
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.030
What, Rome?

60
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.430
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome

61
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.930
the Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.

62
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.900
"Speak, strike, redress."

63
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.600
Am I entreated to speak and strike?

64
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.970
O Rome, I make thee promise, if the redress will follow,

65
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.570
thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

66
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.530
Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

67
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.030
'Tis good.

68
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.100
Go to the gate, somebody knocks.

69
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.100
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar I have not slept.

70
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.500
Between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion,

71
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.170
all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream;

72
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.470
the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council,

73
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.800
and the state of man, like to a little kingdom,

74
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.100
suffers then the nature of an insurrection.

75
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.770
Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,

76
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.870
who doth desire to see you.

77
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.030
Is he alone?

78
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.400
No, sir, there are more with him.

79
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.700
Do you know them?

80
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.630
No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,

81
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.870
and half their faces buried in their cloaks,

82
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.830
that by no means I may discover them by any mark of favor.

83
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.130
Let 'em enter.

84
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.430
They are the faction.

85
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.700
O Conspiracy, shamest thou

86
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.500
to show thy dangerous brow by night,

87
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.100
when evils are most free?

88
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.500
O, then, by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough

89
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.570
to mask thy monstrous visage?

90
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.000
Seek none, Conspiracy; hide it in smiles and affability;

91
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.730
for if thou path, thy native semblance on,

92
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.000
not Erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee

93
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.130
from prevention.

94
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.370
I think we are too bold upon your rest.

95
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.770
Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?

96
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.530
I have been up this hour, awake all night.

97
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.170
Know I these men that come along with you?

98
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.270
Yes, every man of them, and no man here but honors you,

99
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.430
and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself

100
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.730
which every noble Roman bears of you.

101
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.600
This is Trebonius.

102
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.400
He is welcome hither.

103
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.930
This, Decius Brutus.

104
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.000
He is welcome too.

105
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.100
This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

106
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.870
They are all welcome.

107
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.670
What watchful cares do interpose themselves

108
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.800
betwixt your eyes and night?

109
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.430
Shall I entreat a word?

110
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.970
Here lies the east.

111
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.770
Doth not the day break here?

112
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.630
No.

113
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.070
O, pardon, sir, it doth,

114
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.830
and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day.

115
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.970
You shall confess that you are both deceived.

116
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.100
Here, as I draw my sword, the sun arises,

117
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.330
which is a great way growing on the south,

118
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.100
weighing the youthful season of the year.

119
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.900
Some two months hence up higher toward the north

120
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.530
he first presents his fire,

121
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.830
and the high east stands as the Capitol, directly here.

122
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.400
Give me your hands all over, one by one.

123
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.230
And let us swear our resolution.

124
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.700
No, not an oath.

125
00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.030
If not the face of men, the sufferance of our souls,

126
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.070
the time's abuse--

127
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.270
if these be motives weak,break off betimes,

128
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.870
and every man hence to his idle bed;

129
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.070
so let high-sighted tyranny range on

130
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.630
till each man drop by lottery.

131
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.500
But if these, as I am sure they do,

132
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.570
bear fire enough to kindle cowards

133
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.600
and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women,

134
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.700
then, countrymen, what need we any spur but our own cause

135
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.100
to prick us to redress?

136
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.470
What other bond than secret Romans that have spoke the word

137
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.930
and will not palter?

138
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.930
And what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged

139
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.170
that this shall be or we will fall for it?

140
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.830
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,

141
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.530
old feeble carrions

142
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.670
and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs;

143
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.100
unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt;

144
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.370
but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise,

145
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.370
nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,

146
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.600
to think that or our cause or our performance

147
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.930
did need an oath;

148
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.530
when every drop of blood that every Roman bears,

149
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.300
and nobly bears, is guilty of a several bastardy

150
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.030
if he do break the smallest particle of any promise

151
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.400
that hath pass'd from him.

152
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.100
But what of Cicero?

153
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.430
Shall we sound him?

154
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.470
I think he will stand very strong with us.

155
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.330
Oh, let us not leave him out.

156
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.630
No, by no means.

157
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.270
O, let us have him,

158
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.400
for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion,

159
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.400
and buy men's voices to commend our deeds.

160
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.600
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;

161
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.370
our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,

162
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.300
but all be buried in his gravity.

163
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.670
O, name him not; let us not break with him,

164
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.530
for he will never follow anything that other men begin.

165
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.070
Then leave him out.

166
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:28.130
Indeed he is not fit.

167
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.970
Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?

168
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.170
Decius, well urged.

169
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.170
I think it is not meet Mark Antony,

170
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.270
so well beloved of Caesar, should outlive Caesar.

171
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.570
We shall find of him a shrewd contriver;

172
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.070
and you know his means, if he improve them,

173
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.000
may well stretch so far as to annoy us all,

174
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.470
which to prevent, let Antony and Caesar fall together.

175
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.870
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,

176
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.400
to cut the head off and then hack the limbs

177
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.100
like wrath in death and envy afterwards;

178
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.670
for Antony is but a limb of Caesar.

179
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.830
Let's be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.

180
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.330
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,

181
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.770
and in the spirit of men there is no blood.

182
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.270
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,

183
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.130
and not dismember Caesar.

184
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.330
But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it.

185
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.030
And, gentle friends, let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;

186
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.000
let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,

187
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.370
not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;

188
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.030
and let our hearts, as subtle masters do,

189
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.400
stir up their servants to an act of rage

190
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.200
and after seem to chide 'em.

191
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.370
This shall make our purpose necessary and not envious,

192
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.700
which so appearing to the common eyes,

193
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.170
we shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.

194
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:55.830
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,

195
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.030
for he can do no more

196
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.070
than Caesar's arm when Caesar's head is off.

197
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.270
Yet I fear him,

198
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.670
for in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar--

199
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.130
Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.

200
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.270
If he love Caesar, all that he can do is to himself,

201
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.170
take thought and die for Caesar.

202
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:11.830
And that were much he should,

203
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.300
for he is given to sports, to wildness, and much company.

204
00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.230
There is no fear in him-- let him not die,

205
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.930
for he will live and laugh at this hereafter.

206
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.800
Peace, count the clock.

207
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.530
The clock hath stricken three.

208
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.630
'Tis time to part.

209
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:32.970
But it is doubtful yet

210
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.570
whether Caesar will come forth today or no,

211
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.400
for he is superstitious grown of late,

212
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.130
quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy,

213
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.570
of dreams, and ceremonies.

214
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.100
It may be these apparent prodigies,

215
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.400
the unaccustom'd terror of this night,

216
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.530
and the persuasion of his augurers

217
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.070
may hold him from the Capitol today.

218
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.230
Never fear that.

219
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.600
If he be so resolved, I can o'ersway him,

220
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.500
for he loves to hear

221
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.030
that unicorns can be betray'd with trees,

222
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.600
and bears with glasses, elephants with holes,

223
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.370
lions with toils, and men with flatterers;

224
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.770
but when I tell him he hates flatterers,

225
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.430
he says he does, being then most flattered.

226
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.870
Let me work; for I can give his humor the true bent,

227
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.430
and I will bring him to the Capitol.

228
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:20.730
Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

229
00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:21.930
By the eighth hour.

230
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.330
Is that the utter most?

231
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.330
Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

232
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.830
Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,

233
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.630
who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.

234
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.600
I wonder none of you have thought of him.

235
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.270
Now, good Metellus, go along by him.

236
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.800
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;

237
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.370
send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

238
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:41.830
The morning comes upon us.

239
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.500
We'll leave you, Brutus, and, friends, disperse yourselves,

240
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.330
but all remember what you have said

241
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.000
and show yourselves true Romans.

242
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.470
Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;

243
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.800
let not our looks put on our purposes,

244
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.830
but bear it as our Roman actors do,

245
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.700
with untired spirits and formal constancy.

246
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.300
And so, good morrow to you every one.

247
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.430
Boy.

248
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.430
Lucius.

249
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.770
Fast asleep?

250
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.270
It is no matter.

251
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:38.100
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;

252
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.670
thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,

253
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.700
which busy care draws in the brains of men;

254
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.830
therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

255
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.100
Brutus, my lord.

256
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.930
Portia, what mean you?

257
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.400
Wherefore rise you now?

258
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.000
It is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition

259
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.330
to the raw cold morning.

260
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.600
Nor for yours neither.

261
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.970
You have ungently, Brutus, stole from my bed;

262
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.230
and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose

263
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.100
and walk'd about, musing and sighing, with your arms across;

264
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.130
and when I ask'd you what the matter was,

265
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.930
you stared upon me with ungentle looks.

266
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.470
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,

267
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.470
and too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.

268
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.130
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,

269
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.100
but with an angry wafture of your hand

270
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.100
gave sign for me to leave you.

271
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:13.270
So I did, fearing to strengthen that impatience

272
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.670
which seem'd too much enkindled,

273
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.800
and withal hoping it was but an effect of humor,

274
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.130
which sometime hath his hour with every man.

275
00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:28.930
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,

276
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.000
and, could it work so much upon your shape

277
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.830
as it hath much prevail'd on your condition,

278
00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.600
I should not know you, Brutus.

279
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:46.030
Dear my lord, make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

280
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.800
I am not well in health, and that is all.

281
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:56.000
Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,

282
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.900
he would embrace the means to come by it.

283
00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.400
Why, so I do.

284
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.170
Good Portia, go to bed.

285
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:08.130
Is Brutus sick, and is it physical to walk unbraced

286
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.270
and suck up the humors of the dank morning?

287
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.600
What, is Brutus sick,

288
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.600
and will he steal out of his wholesome bed

289
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.000
to dare the vile contagion of the night

290
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.300
and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air

291
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.370
to add unto his sickness?

292
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:32.470
No, my Brutus, you have some sick offense within your mind,

293
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.070
which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of;

294
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.470
and, upon my knees, I charm you, by my once commended beauty,

295
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.800
by all your vows of love

296
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.470
and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one,

297
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:51.230
that you unfold to me, yourself, your half,

298
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:57.530
why you are heavy and what men tonight have had resort to you;

299
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.200
for here have been some six or seven,

300
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.370
who did hide their faces even from darkness.

301
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.870
Kneel not, gentle Portia.

302
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:13.400
I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.

303
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.170
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,

304
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.230
is it excepted I should know no secrets that appertain to you?

305
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:36.030
Am I yourself but, as it were, in sort or limitation,

306
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.500
to keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,

307
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.370
and talk to you sometimes?

308
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.800
Dwell I but in the suburbs of your good pleasure?

309
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:50.370
If it be no more, Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

310
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.470
You are my true and honorable wife, as dear to me

311
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.300
as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart.

312
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:03.170
If this were true, then should I know this secret.

313
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.100
I grant I am a woman,

314
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.900
but withal a woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.

315
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.130
I grant I am a woman,

316
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.000
but withal a woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.

317
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.100
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,

318
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.070
being so father'd and so husbanded?

319
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.370
Tell me your counsels.

320
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.700
I will not disclose 'em.

321
00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.930
I have made strong proof of my constancy,

322
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:34.270
giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh.

323
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.730
Can I bear that with patience and not my husband's secrets?

324
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.900
O ye gods, render me worthy of this noble wife!

325
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.600
Hark, hark, one knocks.

326
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.270
Portia, go in awhile,

327
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.730
and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart.

328
00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.170
All my engagements I will construe to thee,

329
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.770
all the charactery of my sad brows.

330
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.570
Leave me with haste.

331
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.400
Lucius, who's that knocks?

332
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.330
Here is a sick man that would speak with you.

333
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.170
Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.

334
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.830
Boy, stand aside.

335
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.030
Caius Ligarius, how?

336
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.400
Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.

337
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.870
O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, to wear a kerchief.

338
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.100
Would you were not sick.

339
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.470
I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand

340
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.900
any exploit worthy the name of honor.

341
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.870
Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,

342
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.370
had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

343
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.000
By all the gods that Romans bow before,

344
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.430
I here discard my sickness.

345
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.070
Soul of Rome.

346
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.170
Brave son, derived from honorable loins.

347
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.430
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up my mortified spirit.

348
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.000
Now bid me run, and I will strive with things impossible,

349
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.170
yea, get the better of them.

350
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.600
What's to do?

351
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.930
A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

352
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.070
But are not some whole that we must make sick?

353
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.570
That must we also.

354
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.530
What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee,

355
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.770
as we are going to whom it must be done.

356
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:36.570
Set on your foot, and with a heart new-fired I follow you,

357
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.970
to do I know not what;

358
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.230
but it sufficeth that Brutus leads me on.

359
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.870
Follow me then.

360
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.300
Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.

361
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.100
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,

362
00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.200
"Help, ho, They murther Caesar."

363
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.470
Ho there.

364
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.630
My lord?

365
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:05.670
Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,

366
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.000
and bring me their opinions of success.

367
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.200
I will, my lord.

368
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.070
What mean you, Caesar?

369
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.570
Think you to walk forth?

370
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.900
You shall not stir out of your house today.

371
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.330
Caesar shall forth:

372
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.600
the things that threaten'd me ne'er look'd but on my back;

373
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.830
when they shall see the face of Caesar, they are vanished.

374
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.370
Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,

375
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.730
yet now they fright me.

376
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.270
There is one within,

377
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.230
besides the things that we have heard and seen,

378
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.200
recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.

379
00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.430
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;

380
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.670
and graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;

381
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.030
fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,

382
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.170
in ranks and squadrons and right forms of war,

383
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.800
which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;

384
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.470
the noise of battle hurtled in the air,

385
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.630
horses did neigh and dying men did groan,

386
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:58.330
and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.

387
00:21:58.330 --> 00:21:59.600
O Caesar!

388
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.500
These things are beyond all use, and I do fear them.

389
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.230
What can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?

390
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.970
Yet Caesar shall go forth,

391
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.430
for these predictions are to the world in general as to Caesar.

392
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.800
When beggars die, there are no comets seen;

393
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.630
the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

394
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.900
Cowards die many times before their deaths;

395
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.400
the valiant never taste of death but once.

396
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.370
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,

397
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.470
it seems to me most strange that men should fear

398
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.800
seeing that death, a necessary end,

399
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.430
will come when it will come.

400
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.470
What say the augurers?

401
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:42.970
They would not have you to stir forth today.

402
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.070
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,

403
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.700
they could not find a heart within the beast.

404
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.430
The gods do this in shame of cowardice.

405
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.370
Caesar should be a beast without a heart

406
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.230
if he should stay at home today for fear.

407
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.430
No, Caesar shall not.

408
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:05.870
Danger knows full well

409
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.030
Caesar is more dangerous than he.

410
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.900
We are two lions litter'd in one day,

411
00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.500
and I the elder and more terrible.

412
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.070
And Caesar shall go forth.

413
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.170
Alas, my lord, your wisdom is consumed in confidence.

414
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:20.430
Do not go forth today.

415
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.900
Call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own.

416
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.070
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,

417
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.530
and he shall say you are not well today.

418
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.370
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

419
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.000
Mark Antony shall say I am not well,

420
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.700
and, for thy humor, I will stay at home.

421
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.000
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.

422
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.300
Caesar, all hail!

423
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.670
Good morrow, worthy Caesar!

424
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.430
I come to fetch you to the Senate House.

425
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:54.600
And you are come in very happy time

426
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.530
to bear my greeting to the senators

427
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.500
and tell them that I will not come today.

428
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.730
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:

429
00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:04.130
I will not come today; tell them so, Decius.

430
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.330
Say he is sick.

431
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:06.830
Shall Caesar send a lie?

432
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:10.300
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far

433
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.030
to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?

434
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.630
Decius, tell them Caesar will not come.

435
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.530
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,

436
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.870
lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.

437
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.330
The cause is in my will: I will not come.

438
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.730
That is enough to satisfy the Senate.

439
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.930
But, for your private satisfaction,

440
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.430
because I love you, I will let you know.

441
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.500
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;

442
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.630
she dreamt tonight she saw my statue,

443
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.300
which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,

444
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:46.000
did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans

445
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.470
came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.

446
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.470
And these does she apply for warnings and portents

447
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:54.830
and evils imminent, and on her knee

448
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.830
hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.

449
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.100
This dream is all amiss interpreted;

450
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.400
it was a vision fair and fortunate.

451
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.670
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,

452
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.270
in which so many smiling Romans bathed,

453
00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.700
signifies that from you great Rome shall suck reviving blood,

454
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:15.000
and that great men shall press for tinctures, stains,

455
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.900
relics, and cognizance.

456
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.070
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

457
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.830
And this way have you well expounded it.

458
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.130
I have, when you have heard what I can say.

459
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.130
And know it now, the Senate have concluded

460
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.700
to give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.

461
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.530
If you shall send them word you will not come,

462
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.930
their minds may change.

463
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.130
Besides, it were a mock apt to be render'd,

464
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.600
for someone to say "Break up the Senate till another time,

465
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.300
when Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."

466
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.830
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper,

467
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.100
"Lo, Caesar is afraid"?

468
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.270
Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love to your proceeding

469
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:03.970
bids me tell you this, and reason to my love is liable.

470
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.730
How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia.

471
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.530
I am ashamed I did yield to them.

472
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.400
Give me my robe, for I will go.

473
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.700
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

474
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.900
Good morrow, Caesar.

475
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.830
Welcome, Publius.

476
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.970
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?

477
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.870
Good morrow, Casca.

478
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:27.300
Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy

479
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.000
as that same ague which hath made you lean.

480
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.630
What is't o'clock?

481
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.970
Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

482
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.300
I thank you for your pains and courtesy.

483
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.170
See, Antony, that revels long o' nights, is notwithstanding up.

484
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.370
Good morrow, Antony.

485
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.000
So to most noble Caesar.

486
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.400
Bid them prepare within.

487
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.130
I am to blame to be thus waited for.

488
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:52.770
Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,

489
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.770
I have an hour's talk in store for you;

490
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:56.970
remember that you call on me today;

491
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.170
be near me, that I may remember you.

492
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.630
Caesar, I will.

493
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.130
And so near will I be that your best friends

494
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.800
shall wish I had been further.

495
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.700
Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,

496
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.900
and we like friends will straightway go together.

497
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.630
That every like is not the same, O Caesar,

498
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.370
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.

499
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.970
"Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;

500
00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.500
"come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna;

501
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.030
"trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber;

502
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.570
"Decius Brutus loves thee not;

503
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.030
"thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.

504
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.700
"There is but one mind in all these men,

505
00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.600
"and it is bent against Caesar.

506
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.270
"If thou beest not immortal, look about you.

507
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.670
"Security gives way to conspiracy.

508
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:52.670
"The mighty gods defend thee.

509
00:27:52.670 --> 00:28:01.970
Thy lover, Artemidorus."

510
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.200
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,

511
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.200
and as a suitor will I give him this.

512
00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.430
My heart laments that virtue cannot live

513
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.870
out of the teeth of emulation.

514
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:14.400
If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;

515
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.300
if not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

516
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.570
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;

517
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.630
stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.

518
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.070
Why dost thou stay?

519
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.830
To know my errand, madam.

520
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.170
I would have had thee there, and here again,

521
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.730
ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.

522
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.530
O constancy, be strong upon my side!

523
00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.130
Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!

524
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.100
I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.

525
00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.170
How hard it is for women to keep counsel.

526
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.130
Art thou here yet?

527
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.470
Madam, what should I do?

528
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.830
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?

529
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.870
And so return to you, and nothing else?

530
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.800
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,

531
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.530
for he went sickly forth; and take good note

532
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.300
what Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.

533
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.230
Hark, boy, what noise is that?

534
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.070
I hear none.

535
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.230
Prithee, listen well.

536
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:20.370
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,

537
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.800
and the wind brings it from the Capitol.

538
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.370
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

539
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.600
Come hither, fellow; which way hast thou been?

540
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.130
At mine own house, good lady.

541
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.430
What is't o'clock?

542
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.830
About the ninth hour, lady.

543
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.870
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?

544
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:43.170
Madam, not yet.

545
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.230
I go to take my stand to see him pass on to the Capitol.

546
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:46.870
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?

547
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:49.070
That I have, lady.

548
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.970
If it will please Caesar to be so good to Caesar as to hear me,

549
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.430
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

550
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.470
Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?

551
00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:05.030
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.

552
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.300
Good morrow to you.

553
00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.700
Here the street is narrow,

554
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.700
the throng that follows Caesar on the heels of senators,

555
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.430
of praetors, common suitors,

556
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.030
will crowd a feeble man almost to death.

557
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.930
I'll get me to a place more void

558
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.570
and there speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

559
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.730
Ay me, how weak a thing the heart of woman is!

560
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.500
O Brutus, the heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!

561
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.470
Sure, the boy heard me.

562
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:53.700
Brutus hath a suit that Caesar will not grant.

563
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.870
O, I grow faint.

564
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:06.430
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord; say I am merry.

565
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:20.700
Come to me again, and bring me word what he doth say to thee.

566
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.700
