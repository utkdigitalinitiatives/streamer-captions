00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470


2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.170


3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.800
in motion of no less celeritythan that of thought.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.970
Suppose that you have seen thewell-appointed king

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.870
at Hampton pier embark hisroyalty

6
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.100
and his brave fleet with silkenstreamers

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.570
the young Phoebus fanning.

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.670
Play with your fancies,

9
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.670
and in them behold upon thehempen tackle

10
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.600
ship boys climbing.

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.770
Hear the shrill whistle

12
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.800
which doth order give to soundsconfused.

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.700
Behold the threaden sails,

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.170
borne with the invisible andcreeping wind,

15
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.800
draw the huge bottoms throughthe furrowed sea,

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.770
breasting the lofty surge.

17
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.870
Oh, do but think you stand uponthe rivage

18
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.200
and behold a city

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.330
on the inconstant billowsdancing,

20
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.630
for so appears this fleetmajestical,

21
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.200
holding due course to Harfleur.

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.230
Follow, follow.

23
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.300
Grapple your minds to sternageof this navy,

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.570
and leave your England, as deadmidnight still,

25
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.370
guarded with grandsires, babies,and old women,

26
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.770
either past or not arrived atpith and puissance,

27
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.700
for who is he whose chin

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.070
is but enriched with oneappearing hair,

29
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.230
that will not follow

30
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.370
these culled and choice-drawncavaliers

31
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.370
to France?

32
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.530
Work, work your thoughts,

33
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.870
and therein see a siege.

34
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.070
Behold the ordnance on theircarriages,

35
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.000
with fatal mouths gaping ongirded Harfleur.

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.300
Suppose the ambassador from theFrench comes back,

37
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.770
tells Harry that the king

38
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.830
doth offer him Katharine hisdaughter

39
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.270
and with her, to dowry,

40
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.500
some petty and unprofitabledukedoms.

41
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.600
The offer likes not,

42
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.870
and the nimble gunner

43
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.830
with linstock now the devilishcannon touches,

44
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.530
and down goes all before them.

45
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.430
Still be kind,

46
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.670
and eke out our performance withyour mind.

47
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.800
Once more unto the breach, dearfriends, once more!

48
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.970
Or close the wall up with ourEnglish dead!

49
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.600
In peace, there's nothing sobecomes a man

50
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.530
as modest stillness andhumility.

51
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.600
But when the blast of war blowsin our ears,

52
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.030
then imitate the action of thetiger.

53
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.970
Stiffen the sinews, summon upthe blood,

54
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.170
disguise fair nature withhard-favored rage.

55
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.800
Then lend the eye a terribleaspect.

56
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.630
Let it pry through the portageof the head

57
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.330
like the brass cannon!

58
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.300
Let the brow o'erwhelm it asfearfully

59
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.430
as doth a galled rock o'erhangand jutty his confounded base,

60
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.830
swilled with the wild andwasteful ocean.

61
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.930
Now set the teeth and stretchthe nostril wide,

62
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.930
hold hard the breath,

63
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.100
and bend up every spirit to hisfull height!

64
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.500
On, on, you noblest English,

65
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.000
whose blood is fet from fathersof war proof.

66
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.500
Fathers that, like so manyAlexanders,

67
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.670
have in these parts from morntill even fought

68
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.100
and sheathed their swords forlack of argument.

69
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.670
Dishonor not your mothers!

70
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.770
Now attest that those whom youcalled fathers

71
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.470
did beget you.

72
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.230
Be copy now to men of grosserblood,

73
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.570
and teach them how to war.

74
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.100
And you, good yeomen,

75
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.600
whose limbs were made inEngland,

76
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.930
show us here the mettle of yourpasture.

77
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.630
Let us swear that you are worthyour breeding,

78
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.630
which I doubt not,

79
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.470
for there is none of you so meanand base

80
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.730
that hath not noble luster inyour eyes.

81
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
I see you stand like greyhoundsin the slips,

82
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.770
straining upon the start.

83
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.130
The game's afoot.

84
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.600
Follow your spirit,

85
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.230
and upon this charge cry,

86
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.930
"God for Harry,

87
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.370
"England,

88
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.500
and Saint George!"

89
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.100
On!

90
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.100
To the breach!

91
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.100
To the breach!

92
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.300
Pray thee, Corporal, stay!

93
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.300
To the breach!

94
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.270
The knocks are too hot!

95
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.500
And, for mine own part, I havenot a case of lives.

96
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.870
The humor of it is too hot.

97
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.800
That's the very plainsong of it.

98
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.170
Plainsong is most just, forhumors do abound.

99
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.530
"Knocks go and come.

100
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.400
"God's vassals drop and die,

101
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.500
"and sword and shield, in bloodyfield,

102
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.200
doth win immortal fame!"

103
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.070
Would I were in an alehouse inLondon.

104
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.800
I would give all my fame for apot of ale and safety.

105
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.200
And I.

106
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.830
"If wishes would prevail withme,

107
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.470
"my purpose should not fail withme,

108
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.730
but thither would I hie."

109
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.600
"As duly, but not as truly,

110
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.970
as bird doth sing on bough."

111
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.100
Up to the breach, you dogs!

112
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.970
Avaunt, you cullions!

113
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.470
Be merciful, great Duke, to menof mold.

114
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.770
Abate thy rage!

115
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.230
Abate thy manly rage!

116
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.130
Bate thy rage, great duke!

117
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.630
Good bawcock, bate thy rage!

118
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.170
Use lenity, sweet chuck!

119
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.470
These be good humors.

120
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.200
Your honor wins bad humors.

121
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200
Ah!

122
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.700
As young as I am,

123
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.130
I have observed these threeswashers,

124
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.230
and I am boy to them, all three.

125
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.570
but all they three,

126
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.970
though they would serve me,

127
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.470
could not be man to me,

128
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.030
for indeed, three such antics donot amount to a man.

129
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.330
For Bardolph,

130
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.470
he is white-livered andred-faced.

131
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.000
The means whereof, he faces itout but fights not.

132
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.100
For Pistol,

133
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.430
he hath a killing tongue and aquiet sword.

134
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.730
The means whereof,

135
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.100
he breaks words and keeps wholeweapons.

136
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.530
For Nym,

137
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.030
he have heard that men of fewwords

138
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.200
are the best men

139
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.470
and therefore scorns to say hisprayers

140
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.570
lest he should be thought acoward.

141
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.800
But his few bad words

142
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.730
are matched with as few gooddeeds.

143
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.800
He never broke any man's headbut his own,

144
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.770
and that was against a post whenhe was drunk.

145
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.800
They will steal anything andcall it purchase.

146
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.970
Bardolph stole a lute case,

147
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.470
bore it 12 leagues, and sold itfor 3 halfpence.

148
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.230
Nym and Bardolph are swornbrothers in filching,

149
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.130
and in Calais, they stole a fireshovel.

150
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.000
I knew by that piece of servicethe men would carry coals.

151
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.470
They would have me familiar withmen's pockets

152
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.300
as their gloves orhandkerchiefs,

153
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.530
which makes much against mymanhood

154
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.900
if I should take from another'spocket

155
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.500
to put into mine own,

156
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.530
for it is plain pocketing up ofwrongs.

157
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.970
I must leave them and seek somebetter service.

158
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.830
Their villainy goes much againstmy weak stomach,

159
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.900
and therefore, I must cast itup.

160
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.630
Captain Fluellen,

161
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.300
you must come presently to themines.

162
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.270
The Duke of Gloucester wouldspeak with you.

163
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.270
To the mines?

164
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.400
Tell you the duke

165
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.070
it is not so good to come to themines.

166
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.900
The mines is not according tothe disciplines of the war.

167
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.400
The concavities of it is notsufficient.

168
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.430
The adversary, you may discussunto the duke, look you now,

169
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.700
is digged himself 4 yard underthe countermines.

170
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.730
By Cheshu, I think he will blowup all

171
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.870
if there is not betterdirection.

172
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.630
The Duke of Gloucester,

173
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.070
to whom the order of the siegeis given,

174
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.070
is altogether directed by anIrishman...

175
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.270
a very valiant gentleman, i'faith.

176
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.270
It is Captain Macmorris, is itnot?

177
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.770
I think it be.

178
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.700
By Cheshu!

179
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.100
He is an ass as in the world!

180
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.900
I will verify as much in hisbeard.

181
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.000
He has no more directions

182
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.830
in the true disciplines of thewar,

183
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.770
the Roman disciplines,

184
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.500
than is a puppy dog.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.170
Captain Jamy is a marvelousvalorous gentleman,

188
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.570

189
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.430

191
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.100
By Cheshu,

192
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.400
he will maintain his argument

193
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.430
as well as any military man inthe world

194
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.900
in the disciplines

195
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.470
of the pristine wars of theRomans.

196
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.570
I say good day to you, CaptainFluellen.

197
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.030
God-den to your worship, goodCaptain James.

198

How now, Captain Macmorris?

199
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.170
Have you quit the mines?

200
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.830
Have the pioneers given o'er?

201
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.130
By Chrish, la'!

202
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.400
'Tish ill done!

203
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.400
The work is give over.

204
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.400
The trumpet sound the retreat.

205
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.730
By my hand, I swear, and myfather's soul,

206
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.300
the work is ill done.

207
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.200
'Tis give over.

208
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.930
I would have blowed up the town,

209
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.830
so Christ save me, la', in anhour.

210
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.170
Oh, 'tish ill done.

211
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.530
'Tish ill done.

212
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.530
By my hand, 'tish ill done.

213
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.070
Captain Macmorris...

214
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.470
I beseech you, will youvouchsafe me

215
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.070
a few disputations with you

216
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.330
as touching or concerning thedisciplines of the war,

217
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.730
the Roman wars,

218
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.470
in the way of argument andfriendly communication?

219
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.970
Partly to satisfy my opinion

220
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.970
and partly also for thesatisfaction,

221
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.900
look you, of my mind,

222
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.930
as touching the directions ofthe military discipline?

223
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.400
That is the point.

224
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.900
It shall be very good, goodfaith,

225
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.070
good captains bath.

226
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.770
and I shall quit you with goodlove,

227
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.970
as I may pick occasion.

228
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.100
And that shall I, marry.

229
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.830
It is no time to discourse, soChrist save me.

230
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.000
The day is hot--

231
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.400
and the weather and the wars

232
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.530
and the king and the dukes.

233
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.930
It is no time to discourse!

234
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.630
The town is beseeched,

235
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.630
and the trumpet call us to thebreach,

236
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.070
and we talk and, be Christ, donothing!

237
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.600
'Tis shame for us all, so Godsave me.

238
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.200
'Tis shame to stand still.

239
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.100
'Tis shame, by my hand.

240
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.700
And there is throats to be cutand works to be done.

241
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.300
And there is nothing done, soChrist save me, la'!

242
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.600
By the mess,

243
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.870
ere these eyes of mine takethemselves to slumber,

244
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.030
I'll do good service,

245
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.430
or I'll lig i' the ground forit.

246
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.970
Aye, or go to death.

247
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.530
But I'll pay it as valorously asI may,

248
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.530
that shall I surely do, that atthe brief and the long.

249
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.870
Marry, I'd full fain heard somequestion 'tween you tway.

250
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.330
Captain Macmorris,

251
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.600
look you, under your correction,

252
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.000
I do not think there is not manyof your nation.

253
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.170
Nation?

254
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.130
Of my nation?

255
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.930
What is my nation?

256
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.430
Ish a villain?

257
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.000
And a bastard?

258
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.630
And a knave?

259
00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.230
And a rascal?

260
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.500
What is my nation?

261
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.570
Who talks of my nation?

262
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.070
Look you, if you take the matterotherwise than is meant,

263
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.270
Captain Macmorris,

264
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.200
peradventure I shall think youdo not use me

265
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.500
with that love and affability

266
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.730
as in discretion you ought touse me, look you,

267
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.430
being as good a man as yourself

268
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.400
both in the disciplines of thewar

269
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.270
and in the derivation of mybirth

270
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.400
and in other particularities.

271
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.800
I do not know you so good a manas myself.

272
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.400
So Christ save me,

273
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.900
I will cut off your head!

274
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.130
Gentlemen both, you will mistakeeach other!

275
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.830
Aye, a foul fault.

276
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.530
The town sounds a parley.

277
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.270
Captain Macmorris,

278
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.130
when there is more betteropportunity

279
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.670
to be required, look you,

280
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.500
I will be so bold as to tell you

281
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.330
I know the disciplines of thewar.

282
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.770
And there is an end.

283
00:10:55.770 --> 00:11:00.130
How yet resolves the governor ofthe town?

284
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.200
This is the latest parle we willadmit.

285
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.570
Therefore, to our best mercygive yourselves,

286
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.270
or, like to men proud ofdestruction,

287
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.700
defy us to our worst,

288
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.500
for as I am a soldier,

289
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.600
a name that in my thoughtsbecomes me best,

290
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.470
if I begin the battery onceagain,

291
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.930
I will not leave thehalf-achieved Harfleur

292
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.930
till in her ashes she lieburied.

293
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.630
The gates of mercy shall be allshut up,

294
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.070
and the fleshed soldier, roughand hard of heart,

295
00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:30.400
in liberty of bloody hand

296
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.270
shall range with conscience wideas hell,

297
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.530
mowing like grass

298
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.930
your fresh fair virgins and yourflowering infants.

299
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.030
What say you?

300
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.200
Will you yield and this avoid

301
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.270
or, guilty in defense, be thusdestroyed?

302
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.670
Our expectation hath this day anend.

303
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:57.170
The dauphin, whom of succors weentreated,

304
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.470
returns us that his powers arenot yet ready

305
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.530
to raise so great a siege.

306
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.770
Therefore, great King,

307
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:08.430
we yield our town and lives tothy soft mercy.

308
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.800
Enter our gates.

309
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.770
Dispose of us and ours,

310
00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.600
for we no longer are defensible.

311
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Open your gates.

312
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.070
Come, Uncle Exeter,

313
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.670
go you, and enter Harfleur.

314
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.870
There remain,

315
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.200
and fortify it strongly 'gainstthe French.

316
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.630
And use mercy to them all.

317
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.670
For us, dear Uncle,

318
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.770
the winter coming on

319
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.030
and sickness growing upon oursoldiers,

320
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.500

372
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:51.170

374
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.300
De nick.

375
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300
Et le menton?

376
00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:56.930
De chin.

377
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.900
De sin.

378
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.900

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.670
Le menton, de sin.

380
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.630

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.870

d'Angleterre.

384
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.530
Je ne doute point d'apprendre,

385
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.570
par la grace de Dieu, et en peude temps.

386
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:14.330
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ceque je vous ai enseigne?

387
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.030
Non, je reciterai a vouspromptement.

De nails, madame.

392
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.270
De nails,

393
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:30.370

394
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.370
de ilbow.

395
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.800
Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.

396
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.000
Ainsi dis-je.

397
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.030
De elbow,

398
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.770

399
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.070

400
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.730
Comment appelez-vous le pied etla robe?

Le foot et le coun.

402
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.370
Le foot et le coun.

403
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:01.000
Mm-hmm.

404
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.230
Oh, Seigneur Dieu.

405
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.730
Ce sont mots de son mauvais,corruptible, gros, et impudique,

406
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:11.270
et non pour les dames d'honneurd'user.

407
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.100
Je ne voudrais prononcer cesmots devant

408
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.030
les seigneurs de France pourtout le monde.

409
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.030
Foh.

410
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.270
Le foot et le coun.

411
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.470
Neanmoins, je reciterai

412
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.300
une autre fois ma leconensemble.

413
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.430
De hand,

422
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.170
Excellent, madame.

423
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.830
C'est assez pour une fois.

424
00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.270
Allons-nous a diner.

425
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.500
'Tis certain he has passed theriver Somme!

426
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.630
And if he be not fought withal,my lord,

427
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.770
let us not live in France.

428
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.970
Let us quit all

429
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.200
and give our vineyards to abarbarous people.

430
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.700
Oh, Dieu vivant.

431
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:14.470
Shall a few sprays of us,

432
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.870
the emptying of our fathers'luxury,

433
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.500
our scions put in wild andsavage stock,

434
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.600
spurt up so suddenly into theclouds

435
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:22.900
and overlook their grafters?

436
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.200
Normans, but bastard Normans!

437
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.100
Norman bastards!

438
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.300
Mort de ma vie!

439
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.230
If they march along unfoughtwithal,

440
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.900
but I will sell my dukedom

441
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.300
to buy a slobbery and a dirtyfarm

442
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.900
in that nook-shotten isle ofAlbion!

443
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.500
By faith and honor,

444
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.530
our madams mock at us

445
00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.870
and plainly say our mettle isbred out,

446
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.600
and they will give their bodiesto the lust of English youth

447
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.400
to new-store France with bastardwarriors.

448
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.000
Where is Montjoy the herald?

449
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.770
Speed him hence!

450
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.170
Let him greet England with oursharp defiance.

451
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.170
Up, princes,

452
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.400
and with spirit of honor

453
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.070
edged more sharper than yourswords,

454
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.370
hie to the field.

455
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.330
Bar Harry England that sweepsthrough our land

456
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.200
with pennons painted in theblood of Harfleur.

457
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.030
Go down upon him-- you havepower enough--

458
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.770
and in a captive chariot intoRouen,

459
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.830
bring him our prisoner.

460
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.600
This becomes the great.

461
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.630
Ha!

462
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.600
Sorry am I his numbers are sofew,

463
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.930
his soldiers sick and famishedin their march,

464
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.900
for I am sure, when he shall seeour army,

465
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.530
he'll drop his heart into thesink of fear

466
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:27.030
and for achievement offer us hisransom.

467
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.500
Therefore, Lord Constable, hasteon Montjoy,

468
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.470
and let him say to England thatwe send to know

469
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.270
what willing ransom he willgive.

470
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.170
Prince Dauphin, you shall staywith us in Rouen.

471
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.270
Not so, I do beseech YourMajesty.

472
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.100
Be patient, for you shall remainwith us.

473
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.170
Now forth, Lord Constable andprinces all,

474
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.200
and quickly bring us word ofEngland's fall.

475
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.730
Aye!

476
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.400
How now, Captain Fluellen.

477
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.500
Come you from the bridge?

478
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.770
I assure you,

479
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.370
there is very excellent servicescommitted at the bridge.

480
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.930
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?

481
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.870
The Duke of Exeter is asmagnanimous as Agamemnon

482
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.430
and a man that I love and honorwith my soul and my heart

483
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:17.130
and my duty and my life and myliving

484
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.570
and my uttermost power.

485
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.430
He is not-- God be praised andblessed--

486
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.700
any hurt in the world

487
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.800
but keeps the bridge mostvaliantly,

488
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.130
with excellent discipline.

489
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.870
There is an aunchient lieutenantthere at the bridge.

490
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.330
I think in my very consciencenow

491
00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.270
he's as valiant a man as MarkAntony,

492
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.100
and he is a man of no estimationin the world,

493
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.570
but I did see him do as gallantservice.

494
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.570
What do you call him?

495
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.300
He is called Aunchient Pistol.

496
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.330
I know him not.

497
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:43.700
Captain!

498
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:44.800
Here is the man.

499
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.830
I thee beseech to do me favors.

500
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.770
The Duke of Exeter doth lovethee well.

501
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.800
Aye, I praise God.

502
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.600
I have merited some love at hishands.

503
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.870
Bardolph, a soldier,

504
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.170
firm and sound of heart and ofbuxom valor,

505
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.400
hath by cruel fate

506
00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.330
and giddy Fortune's furiousfickle wheel,

507
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.600
that goddess blind

508
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.330
that stands upon the rollingrestless stone--

509
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.000
By your patience, AunchientPistol.

510
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.530
Fortune is painted blind with amuffler afore her eyes

511
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.900
to signify to you that Fortuneis blind.

512
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.330
She is painted also with a wheel

513
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.530
to signify to you, which is themoral of it,

514
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.770
that she is turning andinconstant and mutability

515
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.270
and variation.

516
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.670
And her foot, look you, is fixedupon a spherical stone

517
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.200
which rolls and rolls and rolls.

518
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.730
In good truth, the poet makes

519
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.430
a most excellent description ofit.

520
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.300
Fortune is an excellent moral.

521
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.300
Fortune is Bardolph's foe andfrowns on him,

522
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.870
for he hath stolen a pax andhanged must be,

523
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.200
a damned death.

524
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.800
Let gallows gape for dog,

525
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.570
let man go free,

526
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.530
and let not hemp his windpipesuffocate,

527
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.600
for Exeter hath given the doomof death

528
00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.400
for pax of little price.

529
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.470
Therefore, go speak.

530
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.870
The duke will hear thy voice.

531
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.030
And let not Bardolph's vitalthread be cut

532
00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:56.100
with edge of penny cord and vilereproach.

533
00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.800
Speak, Captain, for his life,and I will thee requite.

534
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.130
Aunchient Pistol, I do partlyunderstand your meaning.

535
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:07.300
Why, then, rejoice therefore.

536
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.730
Certainly, Aunchient, it is nota thing to rejoice at,

537
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.370
for, look you, if he were mybrother,

538
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.470
I would desire the duke to usehis good pleasure

539
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:14.970
and to put him to execution,

540
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.900
for discipline ought to be used!

541
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.000
Die, and be damned.

542
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.400
And figo for thy friendship!

543
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.000
Why, this is an arrantcounterfeit rascal.

544
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.870
I remember him now--

545
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:33.400
a bawd, a cutpurse!

546
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.400
I tell you what, Captain Gower.

547
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.970
I do perceive he is not the man

548
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.230
he would gladly make show to theworld he is.

549
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.270
If I find a hole in his coat,

550
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.930
I will tell him my mind.

551
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.530
Hark you, the king is coming,

552
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.200
and I must speak with him fromthe bridge.

553
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.600
God bless Your Majesty.

554
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600
How now, Fluellen.

555
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.870
Camest thou from the bridge?

556
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.270
Aye, so please Your Majesty.

557
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.070
The Duke of Exeter hath verygallantly

558
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.900
maintained the bridge.

559
00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.900
The French is gone off, lookyou.

560
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.370
And there is gallant and mostbrave passages.

561
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.100
Marry, th' adversary

562
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.700
was have possession of thebridge.

563
00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.470
But he is enforced to retire,

564
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:18.370
and the Duke of Exeter is masterof the bridge.

565
00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.800
I can tell Your Majesty, theduke is a very brave man.

566
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.300
What men have you lost,Fluellen?

567
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.700
The perdition of the adversaryhath been very great--

568
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.370
well, reasonable great.

569
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.630
For my part, I think the dukehath lost never a man

570
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.830
but one that is like to beexecuted

571
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.130
for robbing a church,

572
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.130
one Bardolph,

573
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:39.400
if Your Majesty know the man.

574
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.730
His face is all bubukles

575
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.300
and whelks and knobs and flamesof fire,

576
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.800
and his lips blows at his nose.

577
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.330
It is like a coal of fire,

578
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:49.830
sometimes blue, sometimes red,

579
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:51.670
but his nose is executed,

580
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.830
and his fire is out.

581
00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.470
We would have all such offendersso cut off.

582
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.670
And we give express charge

583
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.430
that in our marches through thecountry,

584
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.530
there be nothing compelled fromthe villages,

585
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.370
nothing taken but paid for,

586
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.500
none of the French

587
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.730
upbraided or abused indisdainful language.

588
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.170
When lenity and cruelty play fora kingdom,

589
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.130
the gentler gamester is thesoonest winner.

590
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.430
You know me by my habit.

591
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.670
Well, then, I know thee.

592
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:24.870
What shall I know of thee?

593
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.900
My master's mind.

594
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.230
Unfold it.

595
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.630
Thus says my king.

596
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.870
"Say thou to Harry of England

597
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.500
"though we seemed dead, we didbut sleep.

598
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.130
"Advantage is a better soldierthan rashness.

599
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.330
"Tell him we could have rebukedhim at Harfleur,

600
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.830
"but that we thought not good

601
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:52.370
"to bruise an injury till itwere full ripe.

602
00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:55.800
"Now we speak upon our cue, andour voice is imperial.

603
00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.030
"England shall repent his folly,

604
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:03.300
"see his weakness, and admireour sufferance.

605
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.070
"Bid him therefore consider ofhis ransom,

606
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.770
"which must proportion thelosses we have borne,

607
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:13.070
"the subjects we have lost, thedisgrace we have digested,

608
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.770
"which in weight to re-answer,

609
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.100
"his pettiness would bow under.

610
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.800
"To this add defiance,

611
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.730
"and tell him, for conclusion,

612
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.430
"he hath betrayed his followers,

613
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.870
whose condemnation ispronounced."

614
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:33.030
So far my king and master,

615
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.970
so much my office.

616
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.630
What is thy name?

617
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:38.630
I know thy quality.

618
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.470
Montjoy.

619
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.330
Thou dost thy office fairly.

620
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.470
Turn thee back,

621
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.200
and tell thy king I do not seekhim now

622
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.170
but could be willing to march onto Calais

623
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.300
without impeachment,

624
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.730
for, to say the sooth,

625
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.500
though it is no wisdom toconfess so much

626
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.270
unto an enemy of craft andvantage,

627
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:03.630
my people are with sickness muchenfeebled,

628
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.270
my numbers lessened,

629
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.330
and those few I have

630
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.400
almost no better than so manyFrench,

631
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.630
who when they were in health, Itell thee, herald,

632
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.670
I thought upon one pair ofEnglish legs

633
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.070
did march three Frenchmen.

634
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.330
Yet, forgive me, God, that I dobrag thus.

635
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.370
This your air of France hathblown that vice in me.

636
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.370
I must repent.

637
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.570
Go therefore tell thy master,

638
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.800
here I am.

639
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.100
My ransom is this frail andworthless trunk,

640
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.470
my army but a weak and sicklyguard.

641
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:38.370
Yet, God before, tell him wewill come on,

642
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.570
though France himself and suchanother neighbor

643
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.670
stand in our way.

644
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.600
There's for thy labor, Montjoy.

645
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.630
Go, bid thy master well advisehimself.

646
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.470
If we may pass, we will.

647
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.500
If we be hindered, we shall yourtawny ground

648
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.900
with your red blood discolor.

649
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.100
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

650
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.500
The sum of all our answer is butthis.

651
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.930
We would not seek a battle as weare,

652
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.130
nor as we are, we say we willnot shun it.

653
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.130
So tell your master.

654
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600
I shall deliver so.

655
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Thanks to Your Highness.

656
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.970
I hope they will not come uponus now.

657
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.570
We are in God's hand, brother,not in theirs.

658
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.800
March to the bridge.

659
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.800
March to the bridge.

660
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.270
It now draws toward night.

661
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.670
Beyond the river, we'll encampourselves,

662
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:39.700
and on tomorrow bid them marchaway.

663
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.270
Tut; I have the best armor inthe world.

664
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.330
Would it were day.

665
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.830
You have an excellent armor,

666
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.900
but let my horse have his due.

667
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.400
It is the best horse of Europe.

668
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.730
Will it never be morning?

669
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:35.930
My Lord of Orleans

670
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.730
and my Lord High Constable,

671
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.830
you talk of horse and armor?

672
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.300
You are as well-provided of bothas any prince in the world.

673
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.070
What a long night is this.

674
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.400
I will not change my horse

675
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.030
with any that treads but on fourpasterns.

676
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.200
Ca,

677
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.200
ha.

678
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.800
He bounds from the earth as ifhis entrails were hairs.

679
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:12.930
Le cheval volant, the Pegasus,chez les narines de feu.

680
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.070
When I bestride him, I soar,

681
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.300
I am a hawk.

682
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.400
He trots the air.

683
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.930
The earth sings when he touchesit.

684
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.200
The basest horn of his hoof ismore musical

685
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.700
than the pipe of Hermes.

686
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.070
He's of the color of the nutmeg.

687
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.200
And of the heat of the ginger.

688
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.730
It is a beast for Perseus.

689
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.030
He is pure air and fire.

690
00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.670
And the dull elements of earthand water

691
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:44.200
never appear in him,

692
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:51.230
but only in patient stillnesswhen his rider mounts him.

693
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:53.630
He is indeed a horse,

694
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:56.370
and all other jades you may callbeasts.

695
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.600
Indeed, my lord,

696
00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.100
it is a most absolute andexcellent horse.

697
00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:05.030
It is the prince of palfreys.

698
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.130
His neigh is like the bidding ofa monarch,

699
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.970
and his countenance enforceshomage.

700
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.000
No more, Cousin.

701
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:19.270
Nay, the man hath no wit thatcannot,

702
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.630
from the rising of the lark tothe lodging of the lamb,

703
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.600
vary deserved praise on mypalfrey.

704
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.430
It is a theme as fluent as thesea.

705
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.170
Turn the sands into eloquenttongues,

706
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.430
and my horse is an argument forthem all.

707
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.130
It is a subject for a sovereignto reason on

708
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.770
and for a sovereign's sovereignto ride on

709
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:45.000
and for the world, familiar tous and unknown,

710
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.270
to lay apart their particularfunction

711
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.530
and wonder at him.

712
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.170
I once writ a sonnet in hispraise and began thus.

713
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.230
"Wonder of nature"--

714
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.430
I have heard a sonnet begin soto one's mistress.

715
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:08.300
Then did they imitate that whichI composed to my courser,

716
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.430
for my horse is my mistress.

717
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.170
My Lord Constable,

718
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:23.330
the armor I saw in your tenttonight,

719
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.230
are those stars or suns upon it?

720
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.400
Stars, my lord.

721
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.170
Some of them will fall tomorrow,I hope.

722
00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:34.470
Yet my sky shall not want.

723
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.930
That may be,

724
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.870
for you bear a manysuperfluously,

725
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.530
and 'twere more honor some wereaway.

726
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:42.730
Even as your horse bears yourpraises,

727
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.830
who would trot as well

728
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.870
were some of your bragsdismounted.

729
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.870
Would I were able to load himwith his desert.

730
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.870
Will it never be day?

731
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.000
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

732
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.870
and my way shall be paved withEnglish faces.

733
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:05.470
I will not say so,

734
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.170
for fear I should be faced outof my way.

735
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.400
Yet I would it were morning.

736
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.030
I would fain be about the earsof the English.

737
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.130
Who will go to hazard with mefor 20 prisoners?

738
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.300
You must first go yourself tohazard, ere you have them.

739
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.670
'Tis midnight.

740
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.500
I'll go arm myself.

741
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.330
The dauphin longs for morning.

742
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.670
He longs to eat the English.

743
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.430
I think he will eat all hekills.

744
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.000
By the white hand of my lady,he's a gallant prince.

745
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.470
Swear by her foot that she maytread out the oath.

746
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.530
He is simply

747
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.270
the most active gentleman ofFrance.

748
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.800
Doing is activity,

749
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.300
and he will still be doing.

750
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.400
He never did harm that I heardof.

751
00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.530
Nor will do none tomorrow.

752
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.100
He will keep that good namestill.

753
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.200
I know him to be valiant.

754
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.570
I was told that by one who knowshim better than you.

755
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.770
What's he?

756
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.270
Marry, he told me so himself,

757
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.100
and he said he cared not whoknew it.

758
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.230
My Lord High Constable...

759
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.930
the English lie within 1,500paces of your tents.

760
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.830
Who hath measured the ground?

761
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.030
The Lord Grandpre.

762
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.130
A most expert and valiantgentleman.

763
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:43.230
Would it were day!

764
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:51.730
Alas, poor Harry of England,

765
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.800
he longs not for the dawning aswe do.

766
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.070
What a wretched and peevishfellow

767
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.870
is this King of England

768
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.400
to mope with his fat-brainedfollowers

769
00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.630
so far out of his knowledge.

770
00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:05.600
If the English had anyapprehension,

771
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.600
they would run away.

772
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.730
That they lack, for if theirheads

773
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.000
had any intellectual armor,

774
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.100
they could never wear such heavyhead-pieces.

775
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.670
That island of England breedsvery valiant creatures.

776
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.130
Their mastiffs are ofunmatchable courage.

777
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:21.630
Then shall we find tomorrow

778
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.270
they have only stomachs to eatand none to fight.

779
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.200
Now is it time to arm.

780
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.770
Come, shall we about it?

781
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.970
It is now 2:00,

782
00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:39.000
but, let me see, by 10:00,

783
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.500
we shall have each a hundredEnglishmen.

784
00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.270
Now entertain conjecture of atime

785
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.200
when creeping murmur and theporing dark

786
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.030
fills the wide vessel of theuniverse.

787
00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.130
From camp to camp through thefoul womb of night,

788
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.870
the hum of either army stillysounds

789
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.130
that the fixed sentinels almostreceive

790
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.630
the secret whispers of eachother's watch.

791
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.270
Fire answers fire,

792
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.870
and through their paly flames,

793
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.300
each battle sees the other'sumbered face.

794
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.730
Steed threatens steed in highand boastful neighs,

795
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.400
piercing the night's dull ear.

796
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:26.070
And from the tents, thearmorers,

797
00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.330
accomplishing the knights,

798
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.270
with busy hammers closing rivetsup,

799
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:31.230
give dreadful note ofpreparation.

800
00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:35.630
The country cocks do crow,

801
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.500
the clocks do toll,

802
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.570
and the third hour of drowsymorning name.

803
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.330
Proud of their numbers andsecure in soul,

804
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.270
the confident and over-lustyFrench

805
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:52.700
do the low-rated English play atdice

806
00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.830
and chide the crippletardy-gaited Night,

807
00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.070
who, like a foul and ugly witch,doth limp so tediously away.

808
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.130
The poor condemned English, likesacrifices,

809
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.370
by their watchful fires sitpatiently

810
00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.130
and inly ruminate the morning'sdanger

811
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.970
and their gesture sad,

812
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.830
investing lank-lean cheeks andwarworn coats,

813
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.830
presenteth them unto the gazingmoon

814
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:23.770
so many horrid ghosts.

815
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.300
Oh, now, who will behold

816
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:29.870
the royal captain of this ruinedband

817
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.630
walking from watch to watch,from tent to tent,

818
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.870
let him cry, "Praise and gloryon his head,"

819
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.930
for forth he goes and visits allhis host,

820
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.030
bids them good morrow with amodest smile

821
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.070
and calls them brothers,friends, and countrymen.

822
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.470
Upon his royal face, there is nonote

823
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.670
how dread an army hath enroundedhim,

824
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.870
nor doth he dedicate one jot ofcolor

825
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:53.430
unto the weary and all-watchednight,

826
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.430
but freshly looks and overbearsattaint

827
00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.700
with cheerful semblance andsweet majesty

828
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.700
that every wretch, pining andpale before,

829
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.170
beholding him plucks comfortfrom his looks.

830
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.030
A largess universal, like thesun,

831
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.470
his liberal eye doth give toevery one,

832
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.030
thawing cold fear

833
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:16.270
that mean and gentle all behold,

834
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.170
as may unworthiness define,

835
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.500
a little touch of Harry in thenight.

836
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:27.130
And so our scene must to thebattle fly,

837
00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.800
where--oh, for pity--

838
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.400
we shall much disgrace

839
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.370
with four or five most vile andragged foils,

840
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.300
right ill-disposed in brawlridiculous,

841
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.400
the name of Agincourt.

842
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.630
Yet sit and see,

843
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.870
minding true things by whattheir mockeries be.

844
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.470
