leave working.

so much I am happy above a number,

I am not such a truant since my coming,

Pray, speak in English:

Noble lady,

66
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.730
I am sorry my integrity should breed,

67
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.470
And service to his majesty and you,

68
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.330
So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.

69
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.630
We come not by the way of accusation,

70
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.030
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,

71
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.770
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,

72
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.500
You have too much, good lady;

73
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.370
but to know how you stand minded

74
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.500
in the weighty difference

75
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.300
Between the king and you; and to deliver,

76
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.500
Like free and honest men,

77
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.270
our just opinions and comforts to your cause.

78
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.270
Most honour'd madam,

79
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.500
My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,

80
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.130
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,

81
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.570
Forgetting, like a good man your late censure

82
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.130
Both of his truth and him, which was too far,

83
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.600
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,

84
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.130
His service and his counsel.

85
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.300
My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;

86
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.070
Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!

87
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.730
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,

88
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.730
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,

89
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.070
More near my life, I fear,

90
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.000
with my weak wit,

91
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.670
And to such men of gravity and learning,

92
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.370
In truth, I know not.

93
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.000
I was set at work among my maids:

94
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.300
full little, God knows,

95
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.030
looking either for such men or such business.

96
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.370
For her sake that I have been,

97
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.300
for I feel the last fit of my greatness,

98
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.270
good your graces,

99
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.500
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:

100
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.230
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

101
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.970
Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:

102
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.770
Your hopes and friends are infinite.

103
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.900
In England

104
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.200
But little for my profit:

105
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
can you think, lords,

106
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.230
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?

107
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.130
Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,

108
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.700
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,

109
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.470
And live a subject?

110
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.900
Nay, forsooth, my friends,

111
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.800
They that must weigh out my afflictions,

112
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.500
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:

113
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.830
They are, as all my other comforts,

114
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.930
far hence In mine own country, lords.

115
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.900
I would your grace

116
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.730
Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

117
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.070
How, sir?

118
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.170
Put your main cause into the king's protection;

119
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.830
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much

120
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.170
Both for your honour better and your cause;

121
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.530
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,

122
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.170
You'll part away disgraced.

123
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.770
He tells you rightly.

124
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.100
Ye tell me what ye wish for both,

125
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.330
my ruin:

126
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.030
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!

127
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.130
Heaven is above all yet;

128
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.300
there sits a judge that no king can corrupt.

129
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.630
Your rage mistakes us.

130
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.400
The more shame for ye:

131
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400
holy men I thought ye,

132
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.430
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;

133
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.100
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:

134
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.670
Mend 'em, for shame, my lords.

135
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.270
Is this your comfort?

136
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.170
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,

137
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.370
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?

138
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.270
I will not wish ye half my miseries;

139
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.530
I have more charity:

140
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.830
but say, I warn'd ye;

141
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.200
Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed,

142
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.400
lest at once the burthen of my sorrows

143
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.170
fall upon ye.

144
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.600
Madam, this is a mere distraction;

145
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.670
You turn the good we offer into envy.

146
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.700
Ye turn me into nothing:

147
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.200
out upon ye and all such false professors!

148
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.000
would you have me

149
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.170
If you have any justice, any pity;

150
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.500
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits

151
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.030
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?

152
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.070
Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,

153
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.800
His love, too long ago!

154
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.470
I am old, my lords,

155
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.370
And all the fellowship I hold now with him

156
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.300
Is only my obedience.

157
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.130
What can happen to me above this wretchedness?

158
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.830
all your studies make me a curse like this.

159
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.100
Your fears are worse.

160
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.370
Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,

161
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.200
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?

162
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.300
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,

163
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.570
Never yet branded with suspicion?

164
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.600
Have I with all my full affections

165
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.300
Still met the king?

166
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.670
loved him next heaven? obey'd him?

167
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.200
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?

168
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.430
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?

169
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.230
And am I thus rewarded?

170
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.630
'tis not well, lords.

171
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.730
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,

172
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.330
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;

173
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.370
And to that woman, when she has done most,

174
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.830
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

175
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.100
Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

176
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.500
My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,

177
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.630
To give up willingly that noble title

178
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.470
Your master wed me to:

179
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.600
nothing but death shall e'er divorce my dignities.

180
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600
Pray, hear me.

181
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.470
Would I had never trod this English earth,

182
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.130
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!

183
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.830
Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.

184
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.070
What will become of me now, wretched lady!

185
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.430
I am the most unhappy woman living.

186
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.000
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!

187
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.870
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom,

188
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.570
where no pity, no friend, no hope;

189
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.730
no kindred weep for me;

190
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.570
Almost no grave allow'd me:

191
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.300
like the lily, that once was mistress of the field

192
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.200
and flourish'd,

193
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.870
I'll hang my head and perish.

194
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.630
If your grace could but be brought to know

195
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.730
our ends are honest,

196
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.670
You'ld feel more comfort:

197
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.970
why should we, good lady,

198
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.630
Upon what cause, wrong you?

199
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.770
alas, our places,

200
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.330
The way of our profession is against it:

201
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.100
We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.

202
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.930
For goodness' sake, consider what you do;

203
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.900
How you may hurt yourself,

204
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.370
ay, utterly grow from the king's acquaintance,

205
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.330
by this carriage.

206
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.600
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,

207
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.300
So much they love it;

208
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.730
but to stubborn spirits they swell, and grow

209
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.000
as terrible as storms.

210
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.030
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,

211
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.900
A soul as even as a calm:

212
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.530
pray, think us those we profess,

213
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.430
peace-makers, friends, and servants.

214
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.570
Madam, you'll find it so.

215
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.730
You wrong your virtues

216
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.900
With these weak women's fears:

217
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.530
a noble spirit, as yours was put into you,

218
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.030
ever casts such doubts, as false coin, from it.

219
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.100
The king loves you;

220
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.730
Beware you lose it not: for us,

221
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.900
if you please to trust us in your business,

222
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.800
we are ready to use our utmost studies

223
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.070
in your service.

224
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.670
Do what ye will, my lords:

225
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.570
and, pray, forgive me,

226
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.300
If I have used myself unmannerly;

227
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.730
You know I am a woman,

228
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:15.000
lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons.

229
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.530
Pray, do my service to his majesty:

230
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.500
He has my heart yet;

231
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.900
and shall have my prayers while I shall have my life.

232
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.170
Come, reverend fathers,

233
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.000
Bestow your counsels on me:

234
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.900
she now begs, that little thought,

235
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.470
when she set footing here,

236
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.800
She should have bought her dignities so dear.

237
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.670
If you will now unite in your complaints,

238
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.030
And force them with a constancy,

239
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.570
the cardinal cannot stand under them:

240
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.300
if you omit the offer of this time,

241
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.300
I cannot promise

242
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.900
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,

243
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.100
With these you bear already.

244
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.530
I am joyful to meet the least occasion

245
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.470
that may give me

246
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.630
Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,

247
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.730
To be revenged on him.

248
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.930
Which of the peers have uncontemn'd gone by him,

249
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.500
or at least strangely neglected?

250
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.170
when did he regard the stamp of nobleness

251
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.530
in any person out of himself?

252
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.730
My lords, you speak your pleasures:

253
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.470
What he deserves of you and me I know;

254
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.670
What we can do to him,

255
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.930
though now the time gives way to us, I much fear.

256
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.070
If you cannot bar his access to the king,

257
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.500
never attempt any thing on him;

258
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.370
for he hath a witchcraft

259
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.400
Over the king in's tongue.

260
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.200
O, fear him not;

261
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.070
His spell in that is out:

262
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.630
the king hath found matter against him

263
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.500
that for ever mars the honey of his language.

264
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.100
No, he's settled,

265
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.670
Not to come off, in his displeasure.

266
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.430
Sir, I should be glad to hear such news as this

267
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.500
Once every hour.

268
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.730
Believe it, this is true:

269
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.670
In the divorce his contrary proceedings

270
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.930
Are all unfolded

271
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.930
wherein he appears as I would wish mine enemy.

272
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.300
How came his practises to light?

273
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.770
Most strangely.

274
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.870
O, how, how?

275
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.030
The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,

276
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.170
And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,

277
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.470
How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness

278
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.670
To stay the judgment o' the divorce;

279
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.570
for if it did take place, 'I do,' quoth he,

280
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.200
'perceive my king is tangled in affection

281
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.330
to a creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'

282
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.270
Has the king this?

283
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.130
Believe it.

284
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.100
Will this work?

285
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.600
The king in this perceives him,

286
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.000
how he coasts and hedges his own way.

287
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.970
But in this point all his tricks founder,

288
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.170
and he brings his physic

289
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.200
After his patient's death:

290
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.900
the king already hath married the fair lady.

291
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.000
Would he had!

292
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.370
May you be happy in your wish, my lord

293
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.400
For, I profess, you have it.

294
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.930
Now, all my joy trace the conjunction!

295
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.970
My amen to't!

296
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.330
All men's!

297
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.130
There's order given for her coronation:

298
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.830
Marry, this is yet but young,

299
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.800
and may be left to some ears unrecounted.

300
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800
But, will the king

301
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.830
Digest this letter of the cardinal's?

302
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.000
The Lord forbid!

303
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.900
Marry, amen!

304
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.370
No, no; there be moe wasps

305
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.830
that buzz about his nose

306
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.670
Will make this sting the sooner.

307
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.270
Cardinal Campeius is stol'n away to Rome;

308
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.900
hath ta'en no leave;

309
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.770
Has left the cause o' the king unhandled;

310
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.900
and is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,

311
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.100
To second all his plot.

312
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.170
I do assure you the king cried Ha! at this.

313
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.230
Now, God incense him,

314
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.870
And let him cry Ha! louder!

315
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.230
But, my lord, when returns Cranmer?

316
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.870
He is return'd in his opinions;

317
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.900
which have satisfied the king for his divorce,

318
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.670
Together with all famous colleges

319
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.670
Almost in Christendom:

320
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.630
shortly, I believe,

321
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.070
His second marriage shall be publish'd,

322
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.000
and her coronation.

323
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.300
Katharine no more shall be call'd queen,

324
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.030
but princess dowager and widow to Prince Arthur.

325
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.270
This same Cranmer's

326
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.130
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain

327
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.630
In the king's business.

328
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.470
The packet, Cromwell. Gave't you the king?

329
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.570
To his own hand, in's bedchamber.

330
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.530
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?

331
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.430
Presently he did unseal them:

332
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.800
and the first he view'd,

333
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.770
He did it with a serious mind;

334
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.970
a heed was in his countenance.

335
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.270
You he bade attend him here this morning.

336
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.070
Is he ready to come abroad?

337
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.530
I think, by this he is.

338
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.830
Leave me awhile.

339
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.630
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,

340
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.130
The French king's sister: he shall marry her.

341
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.770
Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:

342
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.530
There's more in't than fair visage.

343
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.900
Bullen! No, we'll no Bullens.

344
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.170
Speedily I wish to hear from Rome.

345
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.500
The Marchioness of Pembroke!

346
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.400
He's discontented.

347
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.370
May be, he hears the king

348
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.830
does whet his anger to him.

349
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.300
Sharp enough, Lord, for thy justice!

350
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.630
The late queen's gentlewoman,

351
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.900
a knight's daughter,

352
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.670
To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!

353
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.030
This candle burns not clear:

354
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.970
'tis I must snuff it;

355
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.630
Then out it goes.

356
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.030
What though I know her virtuous and well deserving?

357
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.670
yet I know her for a spleeny Lutheran;

358
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.900
and not wholesome to our cause,

359
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.430
that she should lie i' the bosom of our

360
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.930
hard-ruled king.

361
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.100
Again, there is sprung up an heretic,

362
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.530
an arch one, Cranmer;

363
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.030
one hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,

364
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.770
And is his oracle.

365
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.730
He is vex'd at something.

366
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.530
I would 'twere something that would fret the string,

367
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.930
The master-cord on's heart!

368
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.230
The king, the king!

369
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.330
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated

370
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.730
To his own portion!

371
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.070
and what expense by the hour

372
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.700
seems to flow from him!

373
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.630
How, i' the name of thrift,

374
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.370
Does he rake this together!

375
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.630
Now, my lords, saw you the cardinal?

376
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.730
My lord, we have stood here observing him:

377
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.030
some strange commotion is in his brain:

378
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.400
he bites his lip, and starts;

379
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.430
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,

380
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.130
Then lays his finger on his temple,

381
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.000
straight springs out into fast gait;

382
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.500
then stops again,

383
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.230
Strikes his breast hard,

384
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.930
and anon he casts his eye against the moon:

385
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.700
in most strange postures we have seen him set himself.

386
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.500
It may well be;

387
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.800
There is a mutiny in's mind.

388
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.330
This morning papers of state he sent me to peruse,

389
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.630
As I required:

390
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.000
and wot you what I found there,

391
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
on my conscience, put unwittingly?

392
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.900
Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;

393
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.970
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,

394
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.500
Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household;

395
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.330
which I find at such proud rate,

396
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.730
that it out-speaks possession of a subject.

397
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.700
It's heaven's will:

398
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.370
Some spirit put this paper in the packet,

399
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.030
To bless your eye withal.

400
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.330
If we did think his contemplation

401
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.170
were above the earth,

402
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.130
And fix'd on spiritual object,

403
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.300
he should still dwell in his musings:

404
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.300
but I am afraid his thinkings are below the moon,

405
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.600
not worth his serious considering.

406
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.300
Heaven forgive me!

407
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.370
Ever God bless your highness!

408
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.100
Good my lord,

409
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.330
You are full of heavenly stuff,

410
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.900
and bear the inventory of your best graces

411
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.870
in your mind;

412
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.700
the which you were now running o'er:

413
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.600
you have scarce time

414
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.570
To steal from spiritual leisure

415
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.100
a brief span to keep your earthly audit:

416
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.030
sure, in that I deem you an ill husband,

417
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.470
and am glad to have you therein my companion.

418
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.670
Sir,For holy offices I have a time;

419
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.330
a time to think upon the part of business

420
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.730
which I bear i' the state;

421
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.930
and nature does require her times of preservation,

422
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.000
which perforce I, her frail son,

423
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.330
amongst my brethren mortal,

424
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.070
Must give my tendence to.

425
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.070
You have said well.

426
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.170
And ever may your highness yoke together,

427
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.500
As I will lend you cause,

428
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.800
my doing well with my well saying!

429
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.200
'Tis well said again;

430
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.330
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:

431
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.270
And yet words are no deeds.

432
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.200
My father loved you:

433
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.500
His said he did;

434
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.230
and with his deed did crown his word upon you.

435
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.530
Since I had my office,

436
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.830
I have kept you next my heart;

437
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.130
have not alone employ'd you

438
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.200
where high profits might come home,

439
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.300
But pared my present havings,

440
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.200
to bestow my bounties upon you.

441
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.130
Have I not made you, the prime man of the state?

442
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.430
I pray you, tell me,

443
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.800
If what I now pronounce you have found true:

444
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.430
And, if you may confess it, say withal,

445
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.330
If you are bound to us or no.

446
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.830
What say you?

447
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.930
My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,

448
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.030
Shower'd on me daily, have been more

449
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.970
than could my studied purposes requite;

450
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.600
which went beyond all man's endeavours:

451
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.400
my endeavours have ever come too short

452
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.630
of my desires,

453
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.630
Yet filed with my abilities:

454
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.200
mine own ends have been mine

455
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.700
so that evermore they pointed

456
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.830
To the good of your most sacred person

457
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.530
and the profit of the state.

458
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.100
For your great graces heap'd upon me,

459
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.130
poor undeserver, I can nothing

460
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.870
render but allegiant thanks,

461
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.470
My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,

462
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.670
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,

463
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.770
Till death, that winter, kill it.

464
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.230
Fairly answer'd;

465
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.300
A loyal and obedient subject

466
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.600
is therein illustrated:

467
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.930
the honour of it does pay the act of it;

468
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.400
as, i' the contrary,

469
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.500
The foulness is the punishment.

470
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.630
I presume that,

471
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.830
as my hand has open'd bounty to you,

472
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.000
My heart dropp'd love,

473
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.430
my power rain'd honour,

474
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.630
more on you than any;

475
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.870
so your hand and heart,

476
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.670
Your brain, and every function of your power,

477
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.200
Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,

478
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.170
As 'twere in love's particular,

479
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.930
be more to me, your friend, than any.

480
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.230
I do profess

481
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.670
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd

482
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.830
More than mine own;

483
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.130
that am, have, and will be

484
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:46.530
Though all the world should crack

485
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.500
their duty to you,

486
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.500
And throw it from their soul;

487
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.600
though perils did abound,

488
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.900
as thick as thought could make 'em,

489
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.470
and appear in forms more horrid,

490
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.630
yet my duty, as doth a rock against the chiding flood,

491
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.370
Should the approach of this wild river break,

492
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.930
And stand unshaken yours.

493
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.830
'Tis nobly spoken:

494
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.730
Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,

495
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.200
For you have seen him open't.

496
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.270
Read o'er this; and after, this:

497
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.330
and then to breakfast

498
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.070
with what appetite you have.

499
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.330
What should this mean?

500
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.830
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?

501
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.700
He parted frowning from me,

502
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.700
as if ruin leap'd from his eyes:

503
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.070
so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman

504
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.430
that has gall'd him;

505
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.670
Then makes him nothing.

506
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.970
I must read this paper;

507
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.900
I fear, the story of his anger.

508
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.800
'Tis so; This paper has undone me:

509
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.230
'tis the account of all that world of wealth

510
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.470
I have drawn together for mine own ends;

511
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.670
indeed, to gain the popedom,

512
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.900
And fee my friends in Rome.

513
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.200
O negligence!

514
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.030
Fit for a fool to fall by:

515
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.830
what cross devil made me put this main secret

516
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.270
in the packet I sent the king?

517
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.400
Is there no way to cure this?

518
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.030
No new device to beat this from his brains?

519
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.930
I know 'twill stir him strongly;

520
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.630
yet I know a way, if it take right, in spite of fortune

521
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.900
Will bring me off again.

522
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.230
What's this? 'To the Pope!'

523
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.030
The letter, as I live,

524
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.270
with all the business I writ to's holiness.

525
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.000
Nay then, farewell!

526
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.200
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;

527
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.000
And, from that full meridian of my glory,

528
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.570
I haste now to my setting:

529
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.070
I shall fall like a bright exhalation

530
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.400
in the evening,

531
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.800
And no man see me more.

532
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.200
Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal:

533
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.230
who commands you to render up the great seal

534
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.400
presently into our hands;

535
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.530
and to confine yourself to Asher House,

536
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.930
my Lord of Winchester's,

537
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.570
Till you hear further from his highness.

538
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.770
Stay:

539
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.200
Where's your commission, lords?

540
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.970
words cannot carry authority so weighty.

541
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.300
Who dare cross 'em,

542
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.470
Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?

543
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.130
Till I find more than will or words to do it,

544
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.700
I mean your malice, know, officious lords,

545
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.330
I dare and must deny it.

546
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.830
Now I feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded,

547
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.670
envy:

548
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.500
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,

549
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.300
As if it fed ye!

550
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.800
and how sleek and wanton

551
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.770
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!

552
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.230
Follow your envious courses, men of malice;

553
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.230
You have Christian warrant for 'em,

554
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.300
and, no doubt, in time

555
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.670
will find their fit rewards.

556
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.800
That seal, you ask with such a violence,

557
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.500
the king, mine and your master,

558
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.430
with his own hand gave me;

559
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.630
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,

560
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.570
During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,

561
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.470
Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?

562
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.000
The king, that gave it.

563
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.700
It must be himself, then.

564
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.970
Thou art a proud traitor, priest.

565
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.530
Proud lord, thou liest:

566
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.630
Within these forty hours

567
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.870
Surrey durst better

568
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.900
Have burnt that tongue than said so.

569
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.030
Thy ambition, thou scarlet sin,

570
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.300
robb'd this bewailing land of noble Buckingham,

571
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.100
my father-in-law:

572
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.270
The heads of all thy brother cardinals,

573
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.930
With thee and all thy best parts bound together,

574
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.570
Weigh'd not a hair of his.

575
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.200
Plague of your policy!

576
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.370
You sent me deputy for Ireland;

577
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.930
Far from his succor, from the king,

578
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:50.970
from all that might have mercy

579
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.400
on the fault thou gavest him;

580
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.130
Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,

581
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.800
Absolved him with an axe.

582
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.630
This, and all else this talking lord

583
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.930
can lay upon my credit,

584
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.630
I answer is most false.

585
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.870
The duke by law found his deserts:

586
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.870
how innocent I was

587
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.830
From any private malice in his end,

588
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.830
His noble jury and foul cause can witness.

589
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.430
If I loved many words, lord,

590
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.330
I should tell you

591
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.500
You have as little honesty as honour,

592
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.800
Your long coat, priest, protects you;

593
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.870
thou shouldst feel my sword

594
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.900
i' the life-blood of thee else.

595
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.770
My lords,

596
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.900
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?

597
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.930
And from this fellow?

598
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.100
if we live thus tamely,

599
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.800
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,

600
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.170
Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,

601
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.300
And dare us with his cap like larks.

602
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.670
All goodness is poison to thy stomach.

603
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.870
Yes, that goodness of gleaning

604
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:32.870
all the land's wealth into one

605
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.730
Into your own hands,

606
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.000
cardinal, by extortion;

607
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.300
The goodness of your intercepted packets

608
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.870
You writ to the pope against the king:

609
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.630
your goodness, since you provoke me,

610
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.030
shall be most notorious.

611
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.370
My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,

612
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.930
As you respect the common good,

613
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.870
the state of our despised nobility,

614
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.400
our issues, who, if he live,

615
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.930
will scarce be gentlemen,

616
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.000
Produce the grand sum of his sins,

617
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.570
the articles collected from his life.

618
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.970
I'll startle you worse than the scaring bell,

619
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.300
when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms,

620
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.800
lord cardinal.

621
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.730
How much, methinks, I could despise this man,

622
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.330
But that I am bound in charity against it!

623
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.300
Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:

624
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.200
But, thus much, they are foul ones.

625
00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.970
So much fairer and spotless

626
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.730
shall mine innocence arise,

627
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.430
When the king knows my truth.

628
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.530
This cannot save you:

629
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.400
I thank my memory,

630
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.000
I yet remember some of these articles;

631
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.270
and out they shall.

632
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.230
Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,

633
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.900
You'll show a little honesty.

634
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.670
Speak on, sir;

635
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.930
I dare your worst objections:

636
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.800
if I blush,

637
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.670
It is to see a nobleman want manners.

638
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.900
I had rather want those than my head.

639
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.000
Have at you!

640
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.470
First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,

641
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.000
You wrought to be a legate;

642
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.830
by which power you maim'd the jurisdiction

643
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.400
of all bishops.

644
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.000
Then, that in all you writ to Rome,

645
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
or else to foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'

646
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.170
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king

647
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.830
To be your servant.

648
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.470
Then that, without the knowledge

649
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.970
Either of king or council,

650
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.600
when you went ambassador to the emperor,

651
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.670
you made bold to carry into Flanders

652
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.970
the great seal.

653
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.430
Item, you sent a large commission

654
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.330
To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,

655
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.500
Without the king's will or the state's allowance,

656
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.870
A league between his highness and Ferrara.

657
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.030
That, out of mere ambition,

658
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.870
you have caused your holy hat

659
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.770
to be stamp'd on the king's coin.

660
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.600
Then that you have sent innumerable substance

661
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.930
By what means got, I leave to your own conscience

662
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.830
To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways

663
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.870
You have for dignities;

664
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.530
to the mere undoing of all the kingdom.

665
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700
Many more there are;

666
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.630
Which, since they are of you, and odious,

667
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.870
I will not taint my mouth with.

668
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.430
O my lord, Press not a falling man too far! '

669
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.930
tis virtue:

670
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.870
His faults lie open to the laws;

671
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.070
let them, not you, correct him.

672
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.500
My heart weeps to see him so little of his great self.

673
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.930
I forgive him.

674
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.730
Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,

675
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.800
Because all those things you have done of late,

676
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.030
By your power legatine, within this kingdom,

677
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.770
Fall into the compass of a praemunire,

678
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.370
That therefore such a writ be sued against you;

679
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.700
To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,

680
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.270
Chattels, and whatsoever,

681
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.700
and to be out of the king's protection.

682
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.770
This is my charge.

683
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.770
And so we'll leave you to your meditations

684
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.130
How to live better.

685
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.130
For your stubborn answer

686
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.730
About the giving back the great seal to us,

687
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.270
The king shall know it,

688
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.500
and, no doubt, shall thank you.

689
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.330
So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.

690
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.070
So farewell to the little good you bear me.

691
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:45.730
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!

692
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.300
This is the state of man:

693
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.070
to-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes;

694
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.000
to-morrow blossoms,

695
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.770
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;

696
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.970
The third day comes a frost,

697
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.570
a killing frost,

698
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.670
And, when he thinks, good easy man,

699
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.100
full surely his greatness is a-ripening,

700
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:22.470
nips his root, and then he falls, as I do.

701
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.370
I have ventured, like little wanton boys

702
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.770
that swim on bladders,

703
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.230
This many summers in a sea of glory,

704
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.930
But far beyond my depth:

705
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:42.570
my high-blown pride at length broke under me

706
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.400
and now has left me,

707
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.200
Weary and old with service,

708
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.930
to the mercy of a rude stream,

709
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.870
that must for ever hide me.

710
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.230
Vain pomp and glory of this world,

711
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.970
I hate ye:

712
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:09.230
I feel my heart new open'd.

713
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.800
O, how wretched is that poor man

714
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.070
that hangs on princes' favours!

715
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.130
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,

716
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.230
That sweet aspect of princes,

717
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.300
and their ruin,

718
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.470
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:

719
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.470
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,

720
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.530
Never to hope again.

721
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.670
Why, how now, Cromwell!

722
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.570
I have no power to speak, sir.

723
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.400
What, amazed at my misfortunes?

724
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.670
can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline?

725
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.930
Nay, an you weep, I am fall'n indeed.

726
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.330
How does your grace?

727
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.670
Why, well;

728
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.500
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.

729
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.500
I know myself now;

730
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.630
and I feel within me a peace

731
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.270
above all earthly dignities,

732
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:34.200
A still and quiet conscience.

733
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.070
The king has cured me,

734
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.200
I humbly thank his grace;

735
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.470
and from these shoulders,

736
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.370
These ruin'd pillars, out of pity,

737
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.700
taken a load would sink a navy,

738
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.070
too much honour:

739
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.700
O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell,

740
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.070
'tis a burthen too heavy

741
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.030
for a man that hopes for heaven!

742
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.100
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.

743
00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.570
I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,

744
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.300
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,

745
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.830
To endure more miseries and greater far

746
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.430
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.

747
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.370
What news abroad?

748
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.530
The heaviest and the worst

749
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.470
Is your displeasure with the king.

750
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.900
God bless him!

751
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.400
The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen

752
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.970
Lord chancellor in your place.

753
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.430
That's somewhat sudden:

754
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.430
But he's a learned man.

755
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.700
May he continue long in his highness' favour,

756
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.170
and do justice for truth's sake and his conscience;

757
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.230
that his bones,

758
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.370
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,

759
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:53.570
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em!

760
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.130
What more?

761
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.630
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,

762
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.330
Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.

763
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.930
That's news indeed.

764
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.070
Last, that the Lady Anne,

765
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.300
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,

766
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.600
This day was view'd in open as his queen,

767
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.030
Going to chapel;

768
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.330
and the voice is now

769
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:19.470
Only about her coronation.

770
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.900
There was the weight that pull'd me down.

771
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.700
O Cromwell, The king has gone beyond me:

772
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.330
all my glories in that one woman

773
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.970
I have lost for ever:

774
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.630
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,

775
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.500
Or gild again the noble troops that waited

776
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.200
Upon my smiles.

777
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.600
Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;

778
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.000
I am a poor fall'n man,

779
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.870
unworthy now to be thy lord and master:

780
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.430
seek the king;

781
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:56.300
That sun, I pray, may never set!

782
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.470
I have told him what and how true thou art:

783
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.600
he will advance thee;

784
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.530
Some little memory of me will stir him

785
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.430
I know his noble nature

786
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.200
not to let thy hopeful service perish too:

787
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.030
good Cromwell, Neglect him not;

788
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.300
make use now,

789
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.570
and provide for thine own future safety.

790
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.230
O my lord, must I, then, leave you?

791
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.770
must I needs forego so good, so noble

792
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.200
and so true a master?

793
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.600
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,

794
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.800
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.

795
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.330
The king shall have my service:

796
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.170
but my prayers for ever

797
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.330
and for ever shall be yours.

798
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.330
Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear

799
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.870
In all my miseries;

800
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.730
but thou hast forced me,

801
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.170
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.

802
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.130
Let's dry our eyes:

803
00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.500
and thus far hear me, Cromwell;

804
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.100
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,

805
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.200
And sleep in dull cold marble,

806
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.070
where no mention of me more must be heard of,

807
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:07.270
say, I taught thee,

808
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.170
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,

809
00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.770
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,

810
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.400
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;

811
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.870
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.

812
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.830
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.

813
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.270
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:

814
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.630
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,

815
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.270
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?

816
00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.800
Love thyself last:

817
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.200
cherish those hearts that hate thee;

818
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.200
Corruption wins not more than honesty.

819
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.300
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,

820
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.330
To silence envious tongues.

821
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.730
Be just, and fear not:

822
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:10.000
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,

823
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.870
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,

824
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:22.470
O Cromwell, thou fall'st a blessed martyr!

825
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:37.300
Serve the king; And, prithee, lead me in:

826
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.970
There take an inventory of all I have,

827
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.230
To the last penny; 'tis the king's:

828
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.100
my robe, and my integrity to heaven,

829
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.270
is all I dare now call mine own.

830
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:05.370
O Cromwell, Cromwell!

831
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.870
Had I but served my God with half the zeal

832
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.570
I served my king,

833
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.870
he would not in mine age

834
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.570
Have left me naked to mine enemies.

835
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.570
Good sir, have patience.

836
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.030
So I have. Farewell

837
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.030
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

838
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.500
