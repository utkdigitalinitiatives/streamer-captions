So deep suspicion, whereall faith was meant.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.130
Both of his truth and him,which was too far,

83
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.600
Offers, as I do, in a signof peace,

84
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.130

In such a point of weight,so near mine honour,

89
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.070
More near my life, I fear,

90
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.000
with my weak wit,

91
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.670
And to such men of gravityand learning,

92
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.370
In truth, I know not.

93
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.000

94
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.300
full little, God knows,

95
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.030
looking either for suchmen or such business.

96
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.370
For her sake that I havebeen,

97
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.300

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.270

Alas, I am a woman,friendless, hopeless!

101
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.970
Madam, you wrong the king'slove with these fears:

102
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.770
Your hopes and friends areinfinite.

103
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.900

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.200
But little for my profit:

105
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
can you think, lords,

106
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.230
That any Englishman daregive me counsel?

107
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.130
Or be a known friend, 'gainsthis highness' pleasure,

108
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.700
Though he be grown sodesperate to be honest,

109
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.470
And live a subject?

110
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.900
Nay, forsooth, my friends,

111
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.800
They that must weigh outmy afflictions,

112
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.500
They that my trust mustgrow to, live not here:

113
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.830
They are, as all my othercomforts,

114
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.930
far hence In mine owncountry, lords.

115
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:03.900
I would your grace

116
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.730
Would leave your griefs,and take my counsel.

117
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.070
How, sir?

118
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.170
Put your main cause intothe king's protection;

119
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.830
He's loving and mostgracious: 'twill be much

120
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.170
Both for your honourbetter and your cause;

121

Your rage mistakes us.

130
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.400
The more shame for ye:

131
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400
holy men I thought ye,

132
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.430
Upon my soul, two reverendcardinal virtues;

133
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.100
But cardinal sins andhollow hearts I fear ye:

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.270
Is this your comfort?

136
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.170
The cordial that ye bringa wretched lady,

137
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.370
A woman lost among ye,laugh'd at, scorn'd?

138
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.270
I will not wish ye half mymiseries;

139
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.530
I have more charity:

140
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.830
but say, I warn'd ye;

141
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.200
Take heed, for heaven'ssake, take heed,

142
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.400
lest at once the burthenof my sorrows

143
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.170
fall upon ye.

144
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.600
Madam, this is a meredistraction;

145
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.670
You turn the good we offerinto envy.

146
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.700
Ye turn me into nothing:

147
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.200
out upon ye and all suchfalse professors!

148
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.000
would you have me

149
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.170
If you have any justice,any pity;

150
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.500
If ye be any thing butchurchmen's habits

151
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.030
Put my sick cause into hishands that hates me?

152
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.070
Alas, has banish'd me hisbed already,

153
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.800
His love, too long ago!

154
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.470
I am old, my lords,

155
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.370
And all the fellowship Ihold now with him

156
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.300
Is only my obedience.

157
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.130
What can happen to meabove this wretchedness?

158
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.830
all your studies make me acurse like this.

159
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.100
Your fears are worse.

160
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.370
Have I lived thuslong--let me speak myself,

161
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.200
Since virtue finds nofriends--a wife, a true one?

162
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.300
A woman, I dare saywithout vain-glory,

163
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.570
Never yet branded withsuspicion?

164
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.600
Have I with all my fullaffections

165
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.300
Still met the king?

166
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.670
loved him next heaven?obey'd him?

167
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.200
Been, out of fondness,superstitious to him?

168
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.430
Almost forgot my prayersto content him?

169
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.230
And am I thus rewarded?

170
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.630
'tis not well, lords.

171
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.730
Bring me a constant womanto her husband,

172
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.330
One that ne'er dream'd ajoy beyond his pleasure;

173
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.370
And to that woman, whenshe has done most,

174
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.830
Yet will I add an honour,a great patience.

175
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:35.100
Madam, you wander from thegood we aim at.

176
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.500
My lord, I dare not makemyself so guilty,

177
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.630
To give up willingly thatnoble title

178
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.470
Your master wed me to:

179
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.600
nothing but death shalle'er divorce my dignities.

180
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.600
Pray, hear me.

181
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.470
Would I had never trodthis English earth,

182
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.130
Or felt the flatteriesthat grow upon it!

183
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.830
Ye have angels' faces, butheaven knows your hearts.

184
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.070
What will become of menow, wretched lady!

185
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.430
I am the most unhappywoman living.

186
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.000
Alas, poor wenches, whereare now your fortunes!

187
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.870
Shipwreck'd upon akingdom,

188
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.570
where no pity, no friend,no hope;

189
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.730
no kindred weep for me;

190
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.570
Almost no grave allow'dme:

191
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.300
like the lily, that oncewas mistress of the field

192
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.200
and flourish'd,

193
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.870
I'll hang my head andperish.

194
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.630
If your grace could but bebrought to know

195
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.730
our ends are honest,

196
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.670
You'ld feel more comfort:

197
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.970
why should we, good lady,

198
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.630
Upon what cause, wrongyou?

199
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.770
alas, our places,

200
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.330
The way of our professionis against it:

201
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.100
We are to cure suchsorrows, not to sow 'em.

202
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.930
For goodness' sake,consider what you do;

203
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.900
How you may hurt yourself,

204
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.370
ay, utterly grow from theking's acquaintance,

205
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.330
by this carriage.

206
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.600
The hearts of princes kissobedience,

207
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.300
So much they love it;

208
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.730
but to stubborn spiritsthey swell, and grow

209
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.000
as terrible as storms.

210
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.030
I know you have a gentle,noble temper,

211
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.900
A soul as even as a calm:

212
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.530
pray, think us those weprofess,

213
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.430
peace-makers, friends, andservants.

214
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.570
Madam, you'll find it so.

215
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.730
You wrong your virtues

216
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.900
With these weak women'sfears:

217
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.530
a noble spirit, as yourswas put into you,

218
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.030
ever casts such doubts, asfalse coin, from it.

219
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.100
The king loves you;

220
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.730
Beware you lose it not:for us,

221
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.900
if you please to trust usin your business,

222
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.800
we are ready to use ourutmost studies

223
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.070
in your service.

224
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.670
Do what ye will, my lords:

225
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.570
and, pray, forgive me,

226
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.300
If I have used myselfunmannerly;

227
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.730
You know I am a woman,

228
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:15.000
lacking wit to make a seemlyanswer to such persons.

229
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.530
Pray, do my service to hismajesty:

230
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.500
He has my heart yet;

231
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.900
and shall have my prayerswhile I shall have my life.

232
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.170
Come, reverend fathers,

233
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.000
Bestow your counsels onme:

234
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.900
she now begs, that littlethought,

235
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.470
when she set footing here,

236
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.800
She should have bought herdignities so dear.

237
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.670
If you will now unite inyour complaints,

238
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.030
And force them with aconstancy,

239
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.570
the cardinal cannot standunder them:

240
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:55.300
if you omit the offer ofthis time,

241
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.300
I cannot promise

242
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.900
But that you shall sustainmoe new disgraces,

243
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.100
With these you bearalready.

244
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.530
I am joyful to meet theleast occasion

245
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.470
that may give me

246
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.630
Remembrance of myfather-in-law, the duke,

247
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.730
To be revenged on him.

248
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.930
Which of the peers haveuncontemn'd gone by him,

249
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.500
or at least strangelyneglected?

250
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.170
when did he regard thestamp of nobleness

251
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.530
in any person out ofhimself?

252
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.730
My lords, you speak yourpleasures:

253
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.470
What he deserves of youand me I know;

254
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.670
What we can do to him,

255
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.930
though now the time givesway to us, I much fear.

256
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.070
If you cannot bar hisaccess to the king,

257
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.500
never attempt any thing onhim;

258
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.370
for he hath a witchcraft

259
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.400
Over the king in's tongue.

260
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.200
O, fear him not;

261
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.070
His spell in that is out:

262
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.630
the king hath found matteragainst him

263
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.500
that for ever mars thehoney of his language.

264
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.100
No, he's settled,

265
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.670
Not to come off, in hisdispleasure.

266
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.430
Sir, I should be glad tohear such news as this

267
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.500
Once every hour.

268
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.730
Believe it, this is true:

269
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.670
In the divorce hiscontrary proceedings

270
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.930
Are all unfolded

271
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.930
wherein he appears as Iwould wish mine enemy.

272
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.300
How came his practises tolight?

273
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.770
Most strangely.

274
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.870
O, how, how?

275
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.030
The cardinal's letters tothe pope miscarried,

276
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.170
And came to the eye o' theking: wherein was read,

277
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.470
How that the cardinal didentreat his holiness

278
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.670
To stay the judgment o'the divorce;

279
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.570
for if it did take place,'I do,' quoth he,

280
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.200
'perceive my king istangled in affection

281
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.330
to a creature of thequeen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'

282
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.270
Has the king this?

283
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.130
Believe it.

284
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.100
Will this work?

285
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.600
The king in this perceiveshim,

286
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.000
how he coasts and hedgeshis own way.

287
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.970
But in this point all histricks founder,

288
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.170
and he brings his physic

289
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.200
After his patient's death:

290
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.900
the king already hathmarried the fair lady.

291
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.000
Would he had!

292
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.370
May you be happy in yourwish, my lord

293
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.400
For, I profess, youhave it.

294
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.930
Now, all my joy trace theconjunction!

295
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.970
My amen to't!

296
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.330
All men's!

297
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.130
There's order given forher coronation:

298
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.830
Marry, this is yet butyoung,

299
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.800
and may be left to someears unrecounted.

300
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.800
But, will the king

301
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.830
Digest this letter of thecardinal's?

302
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.000
The Lord forbid!

303
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.900
Marry, amen!

304
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.370
No, no; there be moe wasps

305
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.830
that buzz about his nose

306
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.670
Will make this sting thesooner.

307
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.270
Cardinal Campeius isstol'n away to Rome;

308
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.900
hath ta'en no leave;

309
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.770
Has left the cause o' theking unhandled;

310
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.900
and is posted, as theagent of our cardinal,

311
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.100
To second all his plot.

312
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.170
I do assure you the kingcried Ha! at this.

313
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.230
Now, God incense him,

314
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.870
And let him cry Ha!louder!

315
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:17.230
But, my lord, when returnsCranmer?

316
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.870
He is return'd in hisopinions;

317
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.900
which have satisfied theking for his divorce,

318
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.670
Together with all famouscolleges

319
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.670
Almost in Christendom:

320
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.630
shortly, I believe,

321
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.070
His second marriage shallbe publish'd,

322
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.000
and her coronation.

323
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.300
Katharine no more shall becall'd queen,

324
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.030
but princess dowager andwidow to Prince Arthur.

325
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:37.270
This same Cranmer's

326
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.130
A worthy fellow, and hathta'en much pain

327
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:41.630
In the king's business.

328
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.470
The packet, Cromwell.Gave't you the king?

329
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.570
To his own hand, in'sbedchamber.

330
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.530
Look'd he o' the inside ofthe paper?

331
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.430
Presently he did unsealthem:

332
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.800
and the first he view'd,

333
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.770
He did it with a seriousmind;

334
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.970
a heed was in hiscountenance.

335
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.270
You he bade attend himhere this morning.

336
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.070
Is he ready to comeabroad?

337
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.530
I think, by this he is.

338
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.830
Leave me awhile.

339
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.630
It shall be to the Duchessof Alencon,

340
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.130
The French king's sister:he shall marry her.

341
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.770
Anne Bullen! No; I'll noAnne Bullens for him:

342
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.530
There's more in't thanfair visage.

343
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.900
Bullen! No, we'll noBullens.

344
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.170
Speedily I wish to hearfrom Rome.

345
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.500
The Marchioness ofPembroke!

346
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.400
He's discontented.

347
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.370
May be, he hears the king

348
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.830
does whet his anger tohim.

349
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.300
Sharp enough, Lord, forthy justice!

350
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.630
The late queen'sgentlewoman,

351
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.900
a knight's daughter,

352
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.670
To be her mistress'mistress! the queen's queen!

353
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.030
This candle burns notclear:

354
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.970
'tis I must snuff it;

355
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.630
Then out it goes.

356
00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.030
What though I know hervirtuous and well deserving?

357
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.670
yet I know her for aspleeny Lutheran;

358
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.900
and not wholesome to ourcause,

359
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.430
that she should lie i' thebosom of our

360
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.930
hard-ruled king.

361
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.100
Again, there is sprung upan heretic,

362
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.530
an arch one, Cranmer;

363
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.030
one hath crawl'd into thefavour of the king,

364
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.770
And is his oracle.

365
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.730
He is vex'd at something.

366
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.530
I would 'twere somethingthat would fret the string,

367
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.930
The master-cord on'sheart!

368
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.230
The king, the king!

369
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.330
What piles of wealth hathhe accumulated

370
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.730
To his own portion!

371
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.070
and what expense by thehour

372
00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.700
seems to flow from him!

373
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.630
How, i' the name ofthrift,

374
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.370
Does he rake thistogether!

375
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.630
Now, my lords, saw you thecardinal?

376
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.730
My lord, we have stoodhere observing him:

377
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.030
some strange commotion isin his brain:

378
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.400
he bites his lip, andstarts;

379
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.430
Stops on a sudden, looksupon the ground,

380
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.130
Then lays his finger onhis temple,

381
00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.000
straight springs out intofast gait;

382
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.500
then stops again,

383
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.230
Strikes his breast hard,

384
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.930
and anon he casts his eyeagainst the moon:

385
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.700
in most strange postures wehave seen him set himself.

386
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:06.500
It may well be;

387
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.800
There is a mutiny in'smind.

388
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.330
This morning papers ofstate he sent me to peruse,

389
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:12.630
As I required:

390
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.000
and wot you what I foundthere,

391
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
on my conscience, putunwittingly?

392
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.900
Forsooth, an inventory,thus importing;

393
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.970
The several parcels of hisplate, his treasure,

394
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.500
Rich stuffs, and ornamentsof household;

395
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.330
which I find at such proudrate,

396
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.730
that it out-speakspossession of a subject.

397
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.700
It's heaven's will:

398
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.370
Some spirit put this paperin the packet,

399
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.030
To bless your eye withal.

400
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.330
If we did think hiscontemplation

401
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.170
were above the earth,

402
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.130
And fix'd on spiritualobject,

403
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.300
he should still dwell inhis musings:

404
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.300
but I am afraid his thinkingsare below the moon,

405
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.600
not worth his seriousconsidering.

406
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.300
Heaven forgive me!

407
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.370
Ever God bless yourhighness!

408
00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:01.100
Good my lord,

409
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.330
You are full of heavenlystuff,

410
00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.900
and bear the inventory ofyour best graces

411
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.870
in your mind;

412
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.700
the which you were nowrunning o'er:

413
00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.600
you have scarce time

414
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.570
To steal from spiritualleisure

415
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.100
a brief span to keep yourearthly audit:

416
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.030
sure, in that I deem youan ill husband,

417
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:17.470
and am glad to have youtherein my companion.

418
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.670
Sir,For holy offices Ihave a time;

419
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.330
a time to think upon thepart of business

420
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.730
which I bear i' the state;

421
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.930
and nature does requireher times of preservation,

422
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.000
which perforce I, herfrail son,

423
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.330
amongst my brethrenmortal,

424
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.070
Must give my tendence to.

425
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.070
You have said well.

426
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.170
And ever may your highnessyoke together,

427
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.500
As I will lend you cause,

428
00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.800
my doing well with my wellsaying!

429
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.200
'Tis well said again;

430
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.330
And 'tis a kind of gooddeed to say well:

431
00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.270
And yet words are nodeeds.

432
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.200
My father loved you:

433
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.500
His said he did;

434
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.230
and with his deed didcrown his word upon you.

435
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.530
Since I had my office,

436
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.830
I have kept you next myheart;

437
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.130
have not alone employ'dyou

438
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.200
where high profits mightcome home,

439
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.300
But pared my presenthavings,

440
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.200
to bestow my bounties uponyou.

441
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.130
Have I not made you, theprime man of the state?

442
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.430
I pray you, tell me,

443
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.800
If what I now pronounceyou have found true:

444
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.430
And, if you may confessit, say withal,

445
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.330
If you are bound to us orno.

446
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.830
What say you?

447
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.930
My sovereign, I confessyour royal graces,

448
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.030
Shower'd on me daily, havebeen more

449
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.970
than could my studiedpurposes requite;

450
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.600
which went beyond allman's endeavours:

451
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.400
my endeavours have evercome too short

452
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.630
of my desires,

453
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.630
Yet filed with myabilities:

454
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.200
mine own ends have beenmine

455
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.700
so that evermore theypointed

456
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.830
To the good of your mostsacred person

457
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.530
and the profit of thestate.

458
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.100
For your great gracesheap'd upon me,

459
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.130
poor undeserver, I cannothing

460
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:51.870
render but allegiantthanks,

461
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.470
My prayers to heaven foryou, my loyalty,

462
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.670
Which ever has and evershall be growing,

463
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.770
Till death, that winter,kill it.

464
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.230
Fairly answer'd;

465
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.300
A loyal and obedientsubject

466
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.600
is therein illustrated:

467
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.930
the honour of it does paythe act of it;

468
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.400
as, i' the contrary,

469
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.500
The foulness is thepunishment.

470
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.630
I presume that,

471
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.830
as my hand has open'dbounty to you,

472
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.000
My heart dropp'd love,

473
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.430
my power rain'd honour,

474
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.630
more on you than any;

475
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:26.870
so your hand and heart,

476
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.670
Your brain, and everyfunction of your power,

477
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.200
Should, notwithstandingthat your bond of duty,

478
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.170
As 'twere in love'sparticular,

479
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.930
be more to me, yourfriend, than any.

480
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.230
I do profess

481
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.670
That for your highness'good I ever labour'd

482
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.830
More than mine own;

483
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.130
that am, have, and will be

484
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:46.530
Though all the worldshould crack

485
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.500
their duty to you,

486
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.500
And throw it from theirsoul;

487
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.600
though perils did abound,

488
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.900
as thick as thought couldmake 'em,

489
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.470
and appear in forms morehorrid,

490
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.630
yet my duty, as doth a rockagainst the chiding flood,

491
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.370
Should the approach ofthis wild river break,

492
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.930
And stand unshaken yours.

493
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.830
'Tis nobly spoken:

494
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.730
Take notice, lords, he hasa loyal breast,

495
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.200
For you have seen himopen't.

496
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.270
Read o'er this; and after,this:

497
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.330
and then to breakfast

498
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.070
with what appetite youhave.

499
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.330
What should this mean?

500
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.830
What sudden anger's this?how have I reap'd it?

501
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.700
He parted frowning fromme,

502
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.700
as if ruin leap'd from hiseyes:

503
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.070
so looks the chafed lionupon the daring huntsman

504
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.430
that has gall'd him;

505
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.670
Then makes him nothing.

506
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.970
I must read this paper;

507
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.900
I fear, the story of hisanger.

508
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:04.800
'Tis so; This paper hasundone me:

509
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.230
'tis the account of allthat world of wealth

510
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.470
I have drawn together formine own ends;

511
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.670
indeed, to gain thepopedom,

512
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.900
And fee my friends inRome.

513
00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.200
O negligence!

514
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.030
Fit for a fool to fall by:

515
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.830
what cross devil made meput this main secret

516
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.270
in the packet I sent theking?

517
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.400
Is there no way to curethis?

518
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.030
No new device to beat thisfrom his brains?

519
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.930
I know 'twill stir himstrongly;

520
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.630
yet I know a way, if it takeright, in spite of fortune

521
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.900
Will bring me off again.

522
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.230
What's this? 'To thePope!'

523
00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.030
The letter, as I live,

524
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.270
with all the business Iwrit to's holiness.

525
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:10.000
Nay then, farewell!

526
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.200
I have touch'd the highestpoint of all my greatness;

527
00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.000
And, from that fullmeridian of my glory,

528
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.570
I haste now to mysetting:

529
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.070
I shall fall like a brightexhalation

530
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.400
in the evening,

531
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.800
And no man see me more.

532
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.200
Hear the king's pleasure,cardinal:

533
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.230
who commands you to renderup the great seal

534
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.400
presently into our hands;

535
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.530
and to confine yourself toAsher House,

536
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.930
my Lord of Winchester's,

537
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.570
Till you hear further fromhis highness.

538
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:10.770
Stay:

539
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:15.200
Where's your commission,lords?

540
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.970
words cannot carryauthority so weighty.

541
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.300
Who dare cross 'em,

542
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.470
Bearing the king's willfrom his mouth expressly?

543
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.130
Till I find more than willor words to do it,

544
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.700
I mean your malice, know,officious lords,

545
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.330
I dare and must deny it.

546
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.830
Now I feel of what coarsemetal ye are moulded,

547
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.670
envy:

548
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.500
How eagerly ye follow mydisgraces,

549
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.300
As if it fed ye!

550
00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.800
and how sleek and wanton

551
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.770
Ye appear in every thingmay bring my ruin!

552
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:54.230
Follow your enviouscourses, men of malice;

553
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.230
You have Christian warrantfor 'em,

554
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.300
and, no doubt, in time

555
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.670
will find their fitrewards.

556
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.800
That seal, you ask withsuch a violence,

557
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.500
the king, mine and yourmaster,

558
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.430
with his own hand gave me;

559
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:10.630
Bade me enjoy it, with theplace and honours,

560
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.570
During my life; and, toconfirm his goodness,

561
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.470
Tied it by letters-patents:now, who'll take it?

562
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.000
The king, that gave it.

563
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.700
It must be himself, then.

564
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.970
Thou art a proud traitor,priest.

565
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.530
Proud lord, thou liest:

566
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.630
Within these forty hours

567
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.870
Surrey durst better

568
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.900
Have burnt that tonguethan said so.

569
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.030
Thy ambition, thou scarletsin,

570
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.300
robb'd this bewailing landof noble Buckingham,

571
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.100
my father-in-law:

572
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.270
The heads of all thybrother cardinals,

573
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.930
With thee and all thy bestparts bound together,

574
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.570
Weigh'd not a hair of his.

575
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.200
Plague of your policy!

576
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.370
You sent me deputy forIreland;

577
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:49.930
Far from his succor, fromthe king,

578
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:50.970
from all that might havemercy

579
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:52.400
on the fault thou gavesthim;

580
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.130
Whilst your great goodness,out of holy pity,

581
00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.800
Absolved him with an axe.

582
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.630
This, and all else thistalking lord

583
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.930
can lay upon my credit,

584
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.630
I answer is most false.

585
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.870
The duke by law found hisdeserts:

586
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.870
how innocent I was

587
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.830
From any private malice inhis end,

588
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.830
His noble jury and foulcause can witness.

589
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.430
If I loved many words,lord,

590
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:11.330
I should tell you

591
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.500
You have as little honestyas honour,

592
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.800
Your long coat, priest,protects you;

593
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.870
thou shouldst feel mysword

594
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.900
i' the life-blood of theeelse.

595
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.770
My lords,

596
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:19.900
Can ye endure to hear thisarrogance?

597
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:20.930
And from this fellow?

598
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.100
if we live thus tamely,

599
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.800
To be thus jaded by apiece of scarlet,

600
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.170
Farewell nobility; let hisgrace go forward,

601
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.300
And dare us with his caplike larks.

602
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.670
All goodness is poison tothy stomach.

603
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.870
Yes, that goodness ofgleaning

604
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:32.870
all the land's wealth intoone

605
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.730
Into your own hands,

606
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:35.000
cardinal, by extortion;

607
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.300
The goodness of yourintercepted packets

608
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.870
You writ to the popeagainst the king:

609
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.630
your goodness, since youprovoke me,

610
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.030
shall be most notorious.

611
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.370
My Lord of Norfolk, as youare truly noble,

612
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:46.930
As you respect the commongood,

613
00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.870
the state of our despisednobility,

614
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.400
our issues, who, if helive,

615
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.930
will scarce be gentlemen,

616
00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.000
Produce the grand sum ofhis sins,

617
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.570
the articles collectedfrom his life.

618
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.970
I'll startle you worsethan the scaring bell,

619
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.300
when the brown wench laykissing in your arms,

620
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.800
lord cardinal.

621
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.730
How much, methinks, Icould despise this man,

622
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.330
But that I am bound incharity against it!

623
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.300
Those articles, my lord,are in the king's hand:

624
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.200
But, thus much, they arefoul ones.

625
00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.970
So much fairer andspotless

626
00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.730
shall mine innocencearise,

627
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.430
When the king knows mytruth.

628
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.530
This cannot save you:

629
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:23.400
I thank my memory,

630
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.000
I yet remember some ofthese articles;

631
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.270
and out they shall.

632
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.230
Now, if you can blush andcry 'guilty,' cardinal,

633
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.900
You'll show a littlehonesty.

634
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.670
Speak on, sir;

635
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:31.930
I dare your worstobjections:

636
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.800
if I blush,

637
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.670
It is to see a noblemanwant manners.

638
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.900
I had rather want thosethan my head.

639
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.000
Have at you!

640
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.470
First, that, without theking's assent or knowledge,

641
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.000
You wrought to be alegate;

642
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.830
by which power you maim'dthe jurisdiction

643
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.400
of all bishops.

644
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.000
Then, that in all you writto Rome,

645
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
or else to foreignprinces, 'Ego et Rex meus'

646
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.170
Was still inscribed; inwhich you brought the king

647
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.830
To be your servant.

648
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.470
Then that, without theknowledge

649
00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.970
Either of king or council,

650
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.600
when you went ambassadorto the emperor,

651
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.670
you made bold to carryinto Flanders

652
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:01.970
the great seal.

653
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.430
Item, you sent a largecommission

654
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.330
To Gregory de Cassado, toconclude,

655
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.500
Without the king's will orthe state's allowance,

656
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.870
A league between hishighness and Ferrara.

657
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.030
That, out of mereambition,

658
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.870
you have caused your holyhat

659
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.770
to be stamp'd on theking's coin.

660
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:16.600
Then that you have sentinnumerable substance

661
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.930
By what means got, I leaveto your own conscience

662
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.830
To furnish Rome, and toprepare the ways

663
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:21.870
You have for dignities;

664
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.530
to the mere undoing of allthe kingdom.

665
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.700
Many more there are;

666
00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.630
Which, since they are ofyou, and odious,

667
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:29.870
I will not taint my mouthwith.

668
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.430
O my lord, Press not afalling man too far! '

669
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.930
tis virtue:

670
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.870
His faults lie open to thelaws;

671
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.070
let them, not you, correcthim.

672
00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.500
My heart weeps to see him solittle of his great self.

673
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.930
I forgive him.

674
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.730
Lord cardinal, the king'sfurther pleasure is,

675
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.800
Because all those thingsyou have done of late,

676
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.030
By your power legatine,within this kingdom,

677
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.770
Fall into the compass of apraemunire,

678
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.370
That therefore such a writbe sued against you;

679
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.700
To forfeit all your goods,lands, tenements,

680
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.270
Chattels, and whatsoever,

681
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:05.700
and to be out of theking's protection.

682
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.770
This is my charge.

683
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:09.770
And so we'll leave you toyour meditations

684
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.130
How to live better.

685
00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.130
For your stubborn answer

686
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.730
About the giving back thegreat seal to us,

687
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.270
The king shall know it,

688
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.500
and, no doubt, shall thankyou.

689
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.330
So fare you well, mylittle good lord cardinal.

690
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:33.070
So farewell to the littlegood you bear me.

691
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:45.730
Farewell! a long farewell,to all my greatness!

692
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.300
This is the state of man:

693
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.070
to-day he puts forth thetender leaves of hopes;

694
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.000
to-morrow blossoms,

695
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.770
And bears his blushinghonours thick upon him;

696
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.970
The third day comes afrost,

697
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.570
a killing frost,

698
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.670
And, when he thinks, goodeasy man,

699
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.100
full surely his greatnessis a-ripening,

700
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:22.470
nips his root, and then hefalls, as I do.

701
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.370
I have ventured, likelittle wanton boys

702
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.770
that swim on bladders,

703
00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.230
This many summers in a seaof glory,

704
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.930
But far beyond my depth:

705
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:42.570
my high-blown pride atlength broke under me

706
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:44.400
and now has left me,

707
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.200
Weary and old withservice,

708
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.930
to the mercy of a rudestream,

709
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.870
that must for ever hideme.

710
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.230
Vain pomp and glory ofthis world,

711
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.970
I hate ye:

712
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:09.230
I feel my heart newopen'd.

713
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.800
O, how wretched is thatpoor man

714
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:14.070
that hangs on princes'favours!

715
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:18.130
There is, betwixt thatsmile we would aspire to,

716
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.230
That sweet aspect ofprinces,

717
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:24.300
and their ruin,

718
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.470
More pangs and fears thanwars or women have:

719
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.470
And when he falls, hefalls like Lucifer,

720
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.530
Never to hope again.

721
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.670
Why, how now, Cromwell!

722
00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.570
I have no power to speak,sir.

723
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:06.400
What, amazed at mymisfortunes?

724
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.670
can thy spirit wonder agreat man should decline?

725
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.930
Nay, an you weep, I amfall'n indeed.

726
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.330
How does your grace?

727
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.670
Why, well;

728
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.500
Never so truly happy, mygood Cromwell.

729
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.500
I know myself now;

730
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.630
and I feel within me apeace

731
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.270
above all earthlydignities,

732
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:34.200
A still and quietconscience.

733
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.070
The king has cured me,

734
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.200
I humbly thank his grace;

735
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.470
and from these shoulders,

736
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.370
These ruin'd pillars, outof pity,

737
00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.700
taken a load would sink anavy,

738
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.070
too much honour:

739
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.700
O, 'tis a burthen,Cromwell,

740
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.070
'tis a burthen too heavy

741
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.030
for a man that hopes forheaven!

742
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.100
I am glad your grace hasmade that right use of it.

743
00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.570
I hope I have: I am ablenow, methinks,

744
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.300
Out of a fortitude of soulI feel,

745
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.830
To endure more miseriesand greater far

746
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.430
Than my weak-heartedenemies dare offer.

747
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.370
What news abroad?

748
00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.530
The heaviest and the worst

749
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.470
Is your displeasure withthe king.

750
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:22.900
God bless him!

751
00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.400
The next is, that SirThomas More is chosen

752
00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.970
Lord chancellor in yourplace.

753
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.430
That's somewhat sudden:

754
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.430
But he's a learned man.

755
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.700
May he continue long inhis highness' favour,

756
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.170
and do justice for truth'ssake and his conscience;

757
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:46.230
that his bones,

758
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.370
When he has run his courseand sleeps in blessings,

759
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:53.570
May have a tomb oforphans' tears wept on em!

760
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.130
What more?

761
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.630
That Cranmer is return'dwith welcome,

762
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.330
Install'd lord archbishopof Canterbury.

763
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.930
That's news indeed.

764
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.070
Last, that the Lady Anne,

765
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.300
Whom the king hath insecrecy long married,

766
00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.600
This day was view'd inopen as his queen,

767
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.030
Going to chapel;

768
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.330
and the voice is now

769
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:19.470
Only about her coronation.

770
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.900
There was the weight thatpull'd me down.

771
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.700
O Cromwell, The king hasgone beyond me:

772
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.330
all my glories in that onewoman

773
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.970
I have lost for ever:

774
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.630
No sun shall ever usherforth mine honours,

775
00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.500
Or gild again the nobletroops that waited

776
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.200
Upon my smiles.

777
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.600
Go, get thee from me,Cromwell;

778
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.000
I am a poor fall'n man,

779
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.870
unworthy now to be thylord and master:

780
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.430
seek the king;

781
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:56.300
That sun, I pray, maynever set!

782
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.470
I have told him what andhow true thou art:

783
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.600
he will advance thee;

784
00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.530
Some little memory of mewill stir him

785
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.430
I know his noble nature

786
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.200
not to let thy hopefulservice perish too:

787
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.030
good Cromwell, Neglect himnot;

788
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.300
make use now,

789
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.570
and provide for thine ownfuture safety.

790
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.230
O my lord, must I, then,leave you?

791
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.770
must I needs forego sogood, so noble

792
00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.200
and so true a master?

793
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.600
Bear witness, all thathave not hearts of iron,

794
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.800
With what a sorrowCromwell leaves his lord.

795
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.330
The king shall have myservice:

796
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.170
but my prayers for ever

797
00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.330
and for ever shall beyours.

798
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.330
Cromwell, I did not thinkto shed a tear

799
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.870
In all my miseries;

800
00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.730
but thou hast forced me,

801
00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:46.170
Out of thy honest truth,to play the woman.

802
00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.130
Let's dry our eyes:

803
00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.500
and thus far hear me,Cromwell;

804
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.100
And, when I am forgotten,as I shall be,

805
00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.200
And sleep in dull coldmarble,

806
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.070
where no mention of memore must be heard of,

807
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:07.270
say, I taught thee,

808
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.170
Say, Wolsey, that oncetrod the ways of glory,

809
00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.770
And sounded all the depthsand shoals of honour,

810
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.400
Found thee a way, out ofhis wreck, to rise in;

811
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:25.870
A sure and safe one, thoughthy master miss'd it.

812
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.830
Mark but my fall, and thatthat ruin'd me.

813
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.270
Cromwell, I charge thee,fling away ambition:

814
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.630
By that sin fell theangels; how can man, then,

815
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.270
The image of his Maker,hope to win by it?

816
00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:46.800
Love thyself last:

817
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.200
cherish those hearts thathate thee;

818
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.200
Corruption wins not morethan honesty.

819
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.300
Still in thy right handcarry gentle peace,

820
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:01.330
To silence envioustongues.

821
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.730
Be just, and fear not:

822
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:10.000
Let all the ends thouaim'st at be thy country's,

823
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.870
Thy God's, and truth's;then if thou fall'st,

824
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:22.470
O Cromwell, thou fall'st ablessed martyr!

825
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:37.300
Serve the king; And,prithee, lead me in:

826
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:39.970
There take an inventory ofall I have,

827
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.230
To the last penny; 'tisthe king's:

828
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.100
my robe, and my integrityto heaven,

829
00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.270
is all I dare now callmine own.

830
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:05.370
O Cromwell, Cromwell!

831
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:08.870
Had I but served my Godwith half the zeal

832
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.570
I served my king,

833
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:12.870
he would not in mine age

834
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.570
Have left me naked to mineenemies.

835
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.570
Good sir, have patience.

836
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:24.030
So I have. Farewell

837
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:29.030
The hopes of court! myhopes in heaven do dwell.

838
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.500
