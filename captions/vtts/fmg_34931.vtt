WEBVTT

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A HAPPY TIME
 FOR MOST FAMILIES

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
- WITH HEALTHY MOMS
  AND HEALTHY BABIES.
- Woman: LOOK AT THAT NOSE!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Narrator:
 BUT IN THE WOMB, THINGS
 CAN SUDDENLY GO WRONG.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
- ( monitor beeping )
- TERRIBLY WRONG.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
THIS WAS GOING TO BE
ONE OF THOSE BABIES
THAT WAS DYING.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
ENTER THE AMAZING WORLD
 OF HIGH-RISK MEDICINE...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
THAT'S A VERY
IMMATURE LUNG.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Narrator:
 ...AND LEARN ABOUT
 A HIGH-TECH SOLUTION.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
- Narrator:
  IN A LOW-TECH PACKAGE.
- THIS BEAR IS BREATHING...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
ARE THEY DESTINED TO BE
EMOTIONALLY DELAYED?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I CAN EITHER LOOK
OR TALK--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Narrator:
 "BRAZELTON ON PARENTING."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
THE NORMAL GESTATION
FOR A BABY

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
IS 40 WEEKS IN THE WOMB,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
BUT BABIES CAN BE BORN
A LOT EARLIER.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
MODERN SCIENCE
IS NOW ABLE

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
TO KEEP BABIES ALIVE,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
BUT THEIR BODIES
AND BRAINS

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
AREN'T REALLY READY
TO LIVE OUTSIDE THE WOMB,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
AND THE STRUGGLE
CAN LAST FOR WEEKS,
AND EVEN MONTHS.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
PARENTS OFTEN HAVE
TO PREPARE THEMSELVES

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
FOR THE FACT THAT
THEIR CHILDREN MAY DIE

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
OR SUFFER SERIOUS
LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
TODAY,
WE'RE GONNA START

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
WITH A LOOK AT ONE
OF THE MOST ADVANCED

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
NEONATAL INTENSIVE
CARE UNITS

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
AND THE STORY
OF A LITTLE GIRL

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
BORN FAR TOO SOON.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
- ( sirens wailing )
- Brazelton: THE STORY BEGINS

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
AT THE EMERGENCY
 HELICOPTER PAD

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
ATOP PHILADELPHIA'S
 JEFFERSON HOSPITAL--

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
A CODE-ONE MEDEVAC

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
FOR A VERY SICK WOMAN.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
( radio chatter )

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
ANGELA PERRY IS
 SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
SUDDENLY,
 ALL HER SYSTEMS

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
HAVE STARTED TO FAIL.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
- ( monitor beeping )
- THE DOCTOR'S DECISION

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
BETWEEN A MOTHER
 AND HER UNBORN CHILD.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Man:
 THERE WAS A CHANCE,
 YES, IT COULD LIVE,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
YES, AND IT COULD DIE.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
SHE WAS ACTUALLY
GETTING WORSE.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
SO AT THAT POINT
YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE PERSON

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
AND WORRY ABOUT
THE BABY LATER.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Rosemary McWilliams:
 ANGIE UNDERSTANDS

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
THE PHENOMENON
 OF A MOTHER

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
RISKING HER LIFE
 FOR A CHILD.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
SHE'S LIKE,
"NOTHING CAN INTERFERE

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
WITH THIS BABY"
KIND OF THING,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
AND I'M LIKE,
"WELL, JUST REMEMBER
YOU'RE MY BABY."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Brazelton:
 AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
AND A BABY BORN
 AT ONLY 24-WEEKS GESTATION,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
FOUR MONTHS EARLY!

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
- Doctor: BABY'S OUT.
- Dr. Jay Greenspan:
  WE KNOW THAT ONLY ABOUT

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
FIVE OUT OF 10
 OF THEM WILL SURVIVE.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
AND OF THOSE SURVIVORS,
 SOME WILL BE

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
VERY VERY LONG-TERM
 CRITICALLY-ILL INFANTS.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
SOME WILL BE LONG-TERM--

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
WILL BE DEVASTATED
LONG TERM.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
( sustained beep )

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Brazelton:
 JEFFERSON NEONATOLOGISTS

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
PERFORM A DELICATE
 RESUSCITATION.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
ALREADY,
 IT'S TOUCH-AND-GO.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
- ( phone ringing )
- ( monitor beeping )

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
A BABY BORN THIS EARLY

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
HAS SKIN AS THIN
 AS TISSUE,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
VEINS THE DIAMETER
 OF SEWING THREAD.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THEY'RE BARELY
 RECOGNIZABLE AS A BABY.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Woman:
 YOU KNOW THEY'RE CRYING,
 BUT YOU CAN'T HEAR THAT CRY.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
YOU SEE THEM WINCING,
THE MOUTH GOING,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
BUT NOTHING COMES OUT.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM--

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
LUNGS ARE THE LAST ORGAN
TO DEVELOP IN THE WOMB.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
THESE BABIES
JUST CAN'T BREATHE.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THAT'S A VERY
IMMATURE LUNG.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
SHE IS LIVING
ON THE VENTILATOR RIGHT NOW.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
AND WE'RE JUST
BARELY MAKING IT,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
'CAUSE THE HEART IS TELLING US
THAT IT WANTS MORE.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
IF WE GIVE MORE PRESSURE,
WE'RE GONNA END UP PUSHING
ON THE HEART,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
AND IT'S GONNA BE
A VICIOUS CYCLE.
THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO
BUT THE VENTILATOR, RIGHT?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
HUH-UH, NOTHING
BUT THE VENTILATOR.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Brazelton:
 TWO HOURS SINCE BIRTH.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
THE BABY HAS
 A NEW HOME--

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
JEFFERSON'S NEONATAL
 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
SHE ALSO HAS A NAME--

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
ROBYNE GRACE PERRY.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
( nurses conversing )

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Brazelton:
 CARE IS CRITICAL
 TO THESE BABIES' SURVIVAL.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
AND NOT JUST
ALL THE BREAKTHROUGH DRUGS

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
AND HIGH-TECH HARDWARE.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Baumgart:
 THE LEAST WE TOUCH
 THIS BABY,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
THE MORE DELICATE,
THE MORE GENTLE
HER LIFE IS.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
THAT'S WHY A MINIMAL
HANDLING STRATEGY IS

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
PROBABLY
 THE BEST STRATEGY.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
SHE DOESN'T NEED
 THE EXTRA STRESS OF THAT.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Toni Mancini:
 AS A NURSE,
 IT'S UP TO US

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
NOT TO MISS
THE SUBTLE LITTLE THINGS

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
THAT CAN TURN OUT TO BE
LIFE-THREATENING.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
THE WAY THE ENVIRONMENT
 AFFECTS THESE BABIES

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
AND THEIR OUTCOMES,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
IN TRYING TO RECREATE

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
THE QUIETNESS
 OF THE WOMB--

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
CONTROLLING THE LIGHT,
 CONTROLLING THE NOISE LEVEL.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
YOU COULD BE SITTING
 AT A BABY'S BEDSIDE,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
AND THIS BABY
 WILL BE FINE,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
AND A FEW PEOPLE
 MAY COME IN THE ROOM

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
AND BE STANDING
A LITTLE BIT TOO CLOSE,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
- AND SOMETIMES
  YOU JUST SEE...
- ( beeping )

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
THAT THE SIGNS
 ON THE BABY'S MONITOR
 JUST NOSEDIVE.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Greenspan:
 WE'RE NOT AS GOOD
 AS A MOM.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
WE CAN'T DUPLICATE

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
WHAT NATURE
 HAS DESIGNED,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
BUT WE ARE
MUCH MUCH MUCH BETTER

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
THAN WE WERE
EVEN FIVE YEARS AGO.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
- 21, HEAD.
- Brazelton: ROBIN IS
  EXTREMELY SMALL,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
EVEN FOR A BABY
 SO PREMATURE.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
HER WEIGHT--
A LITTLE MORE THAN A POUND.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
ROBIN SURVIVES
 THE FIRST CRITICAL HOURS,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
BUT HER PROGNOSIS
 IS BLEAK.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
( monitor beeping
 loudly )

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
EVEN IF SHE
DOES SURVIVE,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
WILL THERE BE
 LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
WE'RE GONNA CHECK
X-RAYS TODAY,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
AND MAKE SURE
THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.
EACH ARTIFICIAL BREATH

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
IS GONNA BE DAMAGING,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
AND OVER THE COURSE OF TIME
THAT DAMAGE

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
MAY BLOSSOM
INTO CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
GRANDMOTHER'S AFRAID
 OF CEREBRAL PALSY

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
AND MENTAL RETARDATION.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I THINK MOTHER
 IS BETTER.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Brazelton:
 ANGELA IS FINALLY
 OUT OF TROUBLE...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
BASICALLY, SHE DOES NOT WANT
THIS CHILD TO SUFFER.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Brazelton:
 ...BUT NOT HER DAUGHTER.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
IF I HAD TO GUESS
THE FUTURE,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
WE COULD PULL OUT THE STOPS
AND DO LOTS OF THINGS,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
BUT I'M NOT SURE
WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS ONE.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
WE CAN NOT
 ESCALATE SUPPORT,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
OR WE CAN ACTUALLY
 WITHDRAW SUPPORT,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
KEEP THE BABY COMFORTABLE.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I DON'T THINK THESE LUNGS
 ARE A GOOD SET OF LUNGS.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
IN TERMS OF ANY
 RESEARCH-TYPE MEDICATIONS,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I DON'T THINK
DIFFERENT DEVICES

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
WOULD SHOW ANY BENEFIT,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
SO I'M GONNA STICK
WITH THE ROUTINE LEVEL

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION
AND SUPPORT RIGHT NOW,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
BUT I'D LIKE TO OFFER
 YOU THE CHANCE

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
TO SAY HELLO
 TO YOUR DAUGHTER

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
IF WE CAN BUY
 THE TIME FOR THAT.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
TECHNOLOGY HAS GIVEN HER
AN OPPORTUNITY

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
THAT COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE REST OF HER LIFE.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
BUT THE GIFT OF LIFE,
 COMPARED TO, YOU KNOW,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
THE FULL QUALITY
 OF LIFE--

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
IT'S NOT A DECISION
PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
( steady heartbeat )

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
PARENTING,"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT pampers.com.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
WE ALL WANT TO GET
PREMATURES OFF THE GROUND

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
SO THEY CAN GET ORGANIZED
AND BE READY TO GO HOME

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
AND FACE
A COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I'M HERE
 WITH DR. EVELYN THOMAN

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
WHO'S BEEN DEVELOPING
 AN AMAZING HIGH-TECH DEVICE

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
IN A VERY LOW-TECH PACKAGE,
AND I WONDER

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
HOW IN THE WORLD
DID YOU EVER COME

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
TO ANYTHING AS CRAZY
AS A BEAR

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
FOR A PREMATURE BABY.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
WELL, ALL BABIES
LOVE BEARS, BERRY.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
( both laugh )

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
AND WHEN PREMATURE BABIES
ARE IN THE HOSPITAL

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
DURING THE PRETERM PERIOD,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
EVERYTHING THAT'S
DONE TO THEM IS

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
DONE TO THEM,
AND FOR THEM.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
WHAT WE REALLY
WANTED TO DO WAS

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
TO DEVISE SOMETHING

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
THAT WOULD LET THE BABIES
DO SOMETHING FOR THEMSELVES.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
YOU MEAN, THEY PICK IT UP
LIKE A LOVEY

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
AND HOLD ON TO IT?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
NO, THEY CAN'T
PICK IT UP,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY
GET CLOSER TO IT,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
AND THEY CAN MOVE
AWAY FROM IT.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
A PREMATURE BABY?
A TINY LITTLE PREEMIE

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
- NOT AS BIG AS THIS?
- I WILL SHOW YOU,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
FIRST OF ALL,
WHAT IT IS

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
THAT MAKES THEM
INTERESTED IN IT.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
- OH, LOOK AT THAT
 START TO BREATHE!
- THE BEAR--

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
- IT BREATHES.
- ( laughs )

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
FURTHERMORE, IT BREATHES
AT THE SAME RATE

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
OF THE BABY
IT IS PUT WITH.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
- IT'S BREATHING
 AT YOUR RATE RIGHT NOW.
- REALLY?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
THE BABIES
THAT HAVE A BEAR

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
BREATHE MORE REGULARLY,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT
A REGULAR MODEL TO FOLLOW.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
MY GOLLY, THESE BABIES
THAT HAVE RAPID BREATHING

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
- THEN STOP,
 THEN RAPID BREATHING...
- YES.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
- BEGIN TO REGULATE
  WITH THE BEAR?
- YES,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
AND WE HAVE SHOWN THAT
IN OUR RESEARCH.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
THAT THIS IS DESIGNED TO DO
IS TO BE VERY QUIET,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
TO IMPOSE ANYTHING
ON THE BABY,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
ANY STIMULATION
ON THE BABY.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
YOU KNOW,
THEY HAVE USED

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
- MUSIC AND VOICES...
- RIGHT.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
AND THE BABIES
CAN'T TURN THEM OFF.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
THEY'RE TOO FRAGILE.
THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEMS

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
CAN'T TAKE A LOT
OF THAT STIMULATION.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
THAT'S RIGHT,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
AND WITH THE BEAR
THE IDEA WAS,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
THE BABY WOULD KNOW
HOW MUCH STIMULATION

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
- IT COULD TAKE.
- WOW.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
AND THAT'S WHY
THE BEAR

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
IS FLAT ON THE TWO SIDES.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
IT'S SO THAT WE CAN
PUT HIM IN THE ISOLETTE

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
AWAY FROM THE BABY,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
SO IT ISN'T IMPOSED
ON THE BABY.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
BUT HOW COULD THEY SENSE,
IF IT'S AWAY FROM THEM,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
THAT THIS MEANS ANYTHING?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
WELL, THEY CONTACT IT
FIRST BY CHANCE,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
AND THEN THEY LEARN--
THE BEAR IS THERE.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
AND LET ME SHOW YOU,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
EACH BABY HAS
 ITS OWN WAY

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
OF WANTING TO TOUCH
 THAT BEAR.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
SOME BABIES WILL PUSH
 THEIR HEAD UP AGAINST IT,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
SOME BABIES WILL
 PUT THEIR FEET, THEIR LEGS

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
UP AGAINST IT,
 AS THAT BABY DOES.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
AND THIS IS A LEARNING
EXPERIENCE FOR THE BABIES...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
- WOW.
- ...BECAUSE THEY LEARN
 THE BEAR IS THERE.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
NOW IF THE BEAR
ISN'T BREATHING,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
- THEY DON'T DO THAT.
- REALLY?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
- NO, THEY DON'T.
- HOW CAN THEY TELL?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
WELL, YOU TOLD.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
- WELL, I DID,
- YOU CAN TELL.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
BUT I'M ALL GROWN UP.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
NO, THEY CAN TELL
THE DIFFERENCE.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AT LEAST THEY CAN
TELL THE DIFFERENCE

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
SUCH THAT
THE NON-BREATHING BEAR
DOES NOT ATTRACT THE BABY.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
AND THIS IS
FOLLOWING THE TIME

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
WHEN WE DIDN'T THINK
BABIES COULD EVEN
SEE OR HEAR.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
THAT BEING IN CONTROL
OF SOMETHING

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
REALLY FOSTERS
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
AT A VERY VERY FRAGILE,
EARLY AGE.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
SO IT'S A KIND
OF CONTINGENCY,
ISN'T IT?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
IT GETS INTO THE BABY'S
OWN EFFORTS

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
- AND REINFORCES THEM.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
ISN'T THAT FASCINATING?
IT'S SO SIMPLE!

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
IT DOES SEEM SIMPLE,
BUT IT'S VERY PROFOUND,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
BECAUSE THIS MEANS
THAT THE BRAIN

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
IS DOING ALL THE THINGS
YOU SAID.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
IT'S BECOMING
BETTER ORGANIZED.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
- IT'S ENDURING
 FOR THE BABIES.
- WONDERFUL.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Brazelton:
 SHE'S TWO DAYS OLD.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
MIRACULOUSLY,
 ROBYNE IS HANGING ON,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
STABILIZED,
 BUT HARDLY THRIVING.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
YOU LOOK SO CUTE
 IN YOUR PINK RIBBON.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Greenspan:
 WE ALL EXPECT
 TO HAVE A HEALTHY,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
BOUNCING BABY GIRL
 OR BOY.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
IT'S A TRAGEDY
 FOR A FAMILY

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
WHENEVER A BABY COMES
 INTO AN INTENSIVE CARE.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
WE TRY TO PREPARE THEM
 FOR WHAT CAN HAPPEN

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
 AND WHAT PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
BUT THEY,
 LIKE ANY PARENT,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
REMAIN OPTIMISTIC,
 HOPEFUL.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
AND WE REALIZE
THAT THEY'RE,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
IN A SENSE,
OUR PATIENTS TOO--
THE PARENTS.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
WE TRY TO-- WE'LL TRY
TO HELP THEM THROUGH IT,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TO THEIR DAUGHTER.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
- THERE'S HYPERINFLATION
 ALREADY.
- OKAY.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
- THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM
 IN TERMS OF ANOTHER--
- OKAY.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Brazelton:
 LIFE IN THE NEONATAL
 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
IS A SERIES OF DECISIONS.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
WITH ROBYNE

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
THE DECISIONS KEEP
 GETTING TOUGHER.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
( ventilator hissing )

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
GREAT ON THE RIGHT.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THE LEFT IS STILL DOWN.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
( indistinct conversation )

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Greenspan:
 I FELT BADLY FOR THE PARENT
 GOING THROUGH THIS.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I FELT HORRIBLY
 FOR THE BABY.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
IF THINGS WERE TO GO
SUDDENLY DISASTROUSLY WRONG,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
WE MAY HAVE
TO MAKE A DECISION

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
ABOUT RESUSCITATING,
AND THAT MEANS

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS--
CHEST COMPRESSIONS,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
HIGH-PRESSURE VENTILATION
AND EMERGENCY MEDS.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL
WHEN THEY'RE THIS SMALL.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
THEY CAN BLEED IN THE HEAD,
THEY CAN BLEED IN THE LUNGS.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Greenspan:
 ROBYNE WAS BORN
 AT 24 WEEKS,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
WHICH IS REALLY
 THE BORDERLINE OF VIABILITY.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000
IN THAT CASE

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
WE OFTEN BRING IN
 THE FAMILY

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
TO MAKE THESE
 DIFFICULT DECISIONS

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
AS TO HOW AGGRESSIVE
WE SHOULD BE

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
WITH BABIES LIKE ROBYNE.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE YOU WANT US
TO HOLD THE LINE RIGHT NOW.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
- RIGHT.
- YOU GOT IT.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
WE'LL HOLD THE LINE AND
 SUPPORT HER AS BEST WE CAN.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
IF IT FALLS APART,
I'LL COME TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
( monitor beeping )

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Brazelton:
 SIX HOURS LATER,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
AND ROBYNE'S
 CONDITION FALLS

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
ABOUT AS FAR APART
 AS YOU CAN GET.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
ROBYNE'S LUNGS,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
STRESSED BY THE CONSTANT
 PRESSURE OF THE VENTILATOR,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
ARE FINALLY GIVING OUT...

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
HER VITAL SIGNS--
 FAILING.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
BLOOD PRESSURE--

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
DANGEROUSLY LOW.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
RESPIRATION--
 A WHISPER.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
A BLEEDING BRAIN
 COULD PARALYZE HER

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
OR LEAVE HER BLIND.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
DOCTORS FINALLY MANAGE
 TO RESUSCITATE

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
BUT THE NEXT CRISIS
 COULD BE ROBYNE'S LAST.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Baumgart:
 THERE WAS A REAL
 GOOD CHANCE

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
SHE WASN'T GONNA
 MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
FOR ALL WE WERE DOING,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
SHE WAS DYING.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
THAT'S WHEN WE HAD
 THE PRIEST COME IN

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
TO TALK
 TO THE PARENTS.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Relatives
 ...FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN
 HALLOWED BE THY NAME--

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Brazelton:
 THE ONLY THING
 LEFT TO DO--

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
LAST RITES...

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Relatives:
 ...GIVE US THIS DAY
 OUR DAILY BREAD--

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Brazelton:
 ...AND PRAYER.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT,
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE--

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT--

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Man:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
MY QUESTION IS--
AFTER 30 YEARS

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
- OF OWNING
 A FAMILY DAYCARE HOME...
- UH-HUH.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
...AND ABOUT 130 CHILDREN,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I'VE NOTICED--

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
AND I'M WONDERING
HOW I CAN HELP.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
PREMATURE BABIES--

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
ARE THEY
DESTINED TO BE

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
EMOTIONALLY DELAYED?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
ARE THEY
DESTINED TO BE

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
SOCIALLY DELAYED
LATER ON IN LIFE

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
OR WILL THEY CATCH UP?
WHEN AND HOW DO I HELP?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
I USE AN EXPRESSION CALLED,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
"YOUR CHILD
 WILL BE JUST FINE
 IN HER OWN SWEET TIME,"

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
BUT WILL THEY CATCH UP?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I THINK "CATCH UP"
IS A MISTAKEN IDEA.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
'CAUSE IT MEANS YOU'RE
ALWAYS COMPARING THEM

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
TO SOME NORM THAT YOU
 HAVE IN YOUR MIND,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
AND YOU WASTE
ALL YOUR ENERGY

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
ON THAT COMPARISON
RATHER THAN

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
ON WHAT KIND OF CHILD
YOU'RE REALLY DEALING WITH.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
AND A LOT
 OF PREMATURES

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
ARE VERY SENSITIVE,
VERY HYPERSENSITIVE.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
YOU REALLY NEED
 TO CONCENTRATE

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
ON WHAT THAT BABY'S LIKE.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I FIND IN MY OWN
WORK WITH PREEMIES,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I CAN EITHER LOOK
OR TALK OR TOUCH,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
BUT I CAN'T DO
BUT ONE AT A TIME.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I HAVE TO WAIT
 TILL THEY FINALLY SOFTEN,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
AND THEN I CAN SAY,
"HOW ARE YOU DOING?"

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
AND THEY STIFFEN AND ARCH,
AND FINALLY RELAX,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
AND IT TAKES
 A LONG TIME.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
IT TOOK MY OLDEST
GRANDCHILD FOUR YEARS

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
BEFORE I COULD
WALK IN THE HOUSE,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
LOOK HIM IN THE FACE,
AND KEEP HIM THERE.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
HOW CAN YOU
PROMISE PARENTS

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
THAT THEY'RE GONNA
CATCH UP,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
WHEN IT TAKES THEM
THAT LONG

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
TO PUT A BRAIN TOGETHER
THAT'S BEEN STRESSED?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
WHAT I FIND
WORRIES MOTHERS IS,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
SOME MOTHERS CAN'T HUG
OR KISS THEIR BABIES...

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
- YEAH.
- ...EVEN WHEN THEY'RE
 TWO AND THREE YEARS OLD.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
YOU CAN MODEL.
YOU CAN SAY,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
"THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
OF LETTING THEM KNOW

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
- YOU CARE ABOUT THEM."
- OH.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
JUST PUTTING YOUR HAND BACK
WHEN THEY'VE GOT 
THEIR HAND THERE,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
OR JUST TALKING
GENTLY TO THEM

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEM.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
MODEL FOR THEM

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
THAT A BABY CAN
TAKE IN SO MUCH,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
BUT IN THE PROCESS SAY,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
"THIS IS THE WAY
SHE GETS THE MOST

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
OUT OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
IF YOU CAN DO IT

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
VERY GRADUALLY
AND AT THEIR SPEED,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
THEN THEY CAN
PUT IT TOGETHER."

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
- IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
- THANK YOU.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000

OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM IBM.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
CRYSTAL, PARENTS
OF PREMATURE BABIES
NEED TIME TO GRIEVE

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
ABOUT HAVING PRODUCED
A FRAGILE BABY,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AND YET THEY NEED
THE INFORMATION

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
TO DO A GOOD JOB
BY THOSE BABIES.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
- CAN THE INTERNET
 HELP WITH THAT?
- ABSOLUTELY, BERRY.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
THE INTERNET CAN PROVIDE
PARENTS OF PREMATURE BABIES

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
NOT JUST INFORMATION
REGARDING WHAT THEY'RE
GOING THROUGH,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
BUT ACTUAL SUPPORT
AND THE OPPORTUNITY

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
TO SHARE
WITH OTHER PARENTS

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL
TURMOIL THAT THEY MAY BE
GOING THROUGH.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
"PARENTS OF PREMATURE BABIES"
 IS ONE WEBSITE

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
THAT PROVIDES
 GOOD INFORMATION.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
YOU CAN LINK
 FROM THAT SITE

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
TO "WELCOME TO preemies.org."

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
HERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ENGAGE
 IN A CHAT ROOM DISCUSSION

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
WITH ANOTHER PARENT GOING
 THROUGH SIMILAR CHALLENGES

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THAT YOU MAY BE
 GOING THROUGH

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
TO PROVIDE EACH OTHER
SUPPORT,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
TO SHARE YOUR PAINS
AND YOUR FEARS

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
BUT ALSO YOUR JOYS
AND YOUR SUCCESS.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
YOU'RE NOT IN THIS ALONE,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
AND THE INTERNET
 CAN HELP YOU REACH OUT
 TO THOSE PEOPLE

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
THAT ARE EXPERIENCING
 WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
AND FIND SOME JOY
AND SOME HOPE.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
THAT'S WONDERFUL,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB
MEDICALLY

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
OF SAVING NOT ONLY PREMATURES,
BUT THEIR BRAINS.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
BUT WE FOUND THAT
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
TO THEIR FUTURE
IS HOW THE PARENTS

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
ADJUST TO THESE
FRAGILE BABIES.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
IF THEY CAN GET SUPPORT
FORM EACH OTHER,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
CAN'T THEY LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
BERRY, OUR INTERNET
QUESTION TODAY

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
COMES FROM DAWN
FROM CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
HER QUESTION IS--
 "OUR FIRST BABY, PEYTON,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
WAS PREMATURE.
 I HAD A NORMAL PREGNANCY

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
UNTIL MY WATER
 BROKE ALMOST TWO MONTHS
 BEFORE MY DUE DATE.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
MY DOCTORS CANNOT TELL US
 WHY PEYTON WAS EARLY.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
WE ARE NOW THINKING
 OF HAVING OUR SECOND CHILD

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
BUT MY HUSBAND JEFF
 AND I ARE NERVOUS--

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
COULD THIS HAPPEN AGAIN?"

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
YEAH, SURE COULD,
BUT IF YOU'RE IN GOOD
OBSTETRICAL HANDS,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
THE CHANCES ARE
CERTAINLY REDUCED.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
WORRY ABOUT IT

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS
NEXT PREGNANCY

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
UNTIL YOU PASS THE TIME
WHEN THAT FIRST CHILD CAME.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
SO I'D BE SURE YOU HAVE
THE BEST SUPPORT
YOU CAN GET.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000

Greenspan:
 THE QUESTION WE ALWAYS HAVE

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
WHEN YOU'RE BORN
 AT 24 WEEKS,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
SHOULD WE BE--

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
YOU DON'T WANT
 TO PROLONG A SITUATION

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
WHERE THE INFANT WAS
 ULTIMATELY GOING TO DIE.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
IN ROBYNE'S CASE,
SHE REALLY CAME OUT FIGHTING.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
SHE CLEARLY SHOWED US
A WILL TO LIVE.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
- HI.
- WHO IS THAT?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
- SAY HI!
- HI, ROBYNE.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Brazelton:
 ROBYNE PERRY--
 TWO YEARS OLD.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Dr. Greenspan:
 I THINK ROBYNE REPRESENTS

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
A VERY GOOD SUCCESS STORY.
 SHE IS SMALLER,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
SHE'S A LITTLE WEAKER
 ON ONE SIDE THAN THE OTHER,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
AND A LITTLE BIT
 MORE FRAGILE.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Brazelton:
 ROBYNE'S ALSO A TOTALLY
 DELIGHTFUL LITTLE GIRL.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Dr. Greenspan:
 THE FACT IS THAT SEEING HER

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
AND OTHERS LIKE HER
 GIVES US HOPE

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
THAT ALL THE HARD WORK
 THAT PARENTS DO AND WE DO
 IS WORTHWHILE.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
- A LITTLE KISS.
- AWW.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
WHEN I LOOK
AT ROBYNE NOW,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I SEE THE MOST AMAZING,
STRONG-WILLED...

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
- HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.
- ...LOVING GIFT OF GOD.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
I DON'T SEE HER

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
AS HAVING ANY PROBLEMS
OR ANY SETBACKS.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I SEE HER AS THE MOST

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
AMAZING HUMAN BEING
 IN MY EYES.
 ( laughs )

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
SHE'S A GIFT OF GOD.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
AS ROBYNE HAS SHOWN US,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
A BABY BORN
EXTREMELY EARLY

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
CAN SURVIVE
AND EVEN THRIVE.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
NOT EVERY STORY HAS
SUCH A HAPPY ENDING,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
BUT AS WE'VE SEEN,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS
EVERY DAY

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
IN HELPING THESE PREEMIES
GET ORGANIZED AND HEALTHY

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
AND IN HELPING
THEIR PARENTS DEAL

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
WITH THEIR OWN
ISSUES OF GRIEF

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
SO THEY'LL BE ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR BABIES

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
EVEN BEFORE THEY GO HOME.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT
FOR THE BABY'S FUTURE,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
BECAUSE A BABY REALLY
CAN'T MAKE IT

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
UNLESS THE WHOLE FAMILY
MAKES IT.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
