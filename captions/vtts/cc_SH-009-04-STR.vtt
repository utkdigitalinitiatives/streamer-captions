00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.530


3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.930
Good morrow, Brother Bedford.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.100
God Almighty,

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.270
there is some soul of goodnessin things evil,

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.800
would men observingly distill itout,

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.100
for our bad neighbor makes usearly stirrers,

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.200
which is both healthful and goodhusbandry.

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.030
Besides, they are our outwardconsciences

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.470
and preachers to us all,

11
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.030
admonishing that we should dressus fairly for our end.

12
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.800
Thus may we gather honey fromthe weed

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.070
and make a moral of the devilhimself.

14
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.070
Good morrow, old Sir ThomasErpingham.

15
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.500
A good soft pillow for that goodwhite head

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.430
were better than a churlish turfof France.

17
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.630
Not so, my liege.

18
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.270
This lodging likes me better,

19
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.670
since I may say, "Now lie I likea king."

20
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.300
'Tis good for men

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.770
to love their present pains uponexample,

22
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.770
so the spirit is eased.

23
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.500
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

24
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.900
Brothers both, commend me to theprinces in our camp.

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.270
Do my good morrow to them,

26
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.130
and anon desire them all to mypavilion.

27
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.130
We shall, my liege.

28
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.470
Shall I attend Your Grace?

29
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.600
No, my good knight.

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.630
Go with my brothers to my lordsof England.

31
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.170
I and my bosom must debate awhile,

32
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.470
and then I would no othercompany.

33
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
The Lord in heaven bless thee,noble Harry.

34
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.670
God-a-mercy, old heart.

35
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.670
Thou speakest cheerfully.

36
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.370
Qui va la?

37
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.700
A friend.

38
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.670
Discuss unto me, art thouofficer?

39
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.830
Or art thou base, common, andpopular?

40
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.200
I am a gentleman of a company.

41
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.830
Trailest thou the puissant pike?

42
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.400
Even so.

43
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400
What are you?

44
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.000
As good a gentleman as theemperor.

45
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.330
Then you are a better than theking.

46
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.800
Ah, the king's a bawcock with aheart of gold,

47
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.170
a lad of life, an imp of fame,

48
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.230
of parents good, of fist mostvaliant.

49
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.600
I kiss his dirty shoe, and fromheartstring,

50
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.200
I love the lovely bully.

51
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.270
What is thy name?

52
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.370
Harry le Roy.

53
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.370
Le Roy!

54
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.900
A Cornish name.

55
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.430
Art thou of Cornish crew?

56
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.370
No, I am a Welshman.

57
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.830
Knowest thou Fluellen?

58
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.100
Yes.

59
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.100
Tell him I'll knock his leekabout his pate

60
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.400
upon Saint Davy's day.

61
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.530
Do not you wear your dagger inyour cap that day,

62
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.100
lest he knock that about yours.

63
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.630
Are you his friend?

64
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.970
And his kinsman too.

65
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.800
A figo for thee, then!

66
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.270
Ouch!

67
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.530
I thank you.

68
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.330
God be with you.

69
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.800
My name is Pistol called.

70
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.000
It sorts well with yourfierceness.

71
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
Captain Fluellen.

72
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.730
Shh!

73
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.770
In the name of Jesu Christ,speak fewer.

74
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.400
It is the greatest admiration inthe universal world

75
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.700
when the true and aunchient

76
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.600
prerogatives and the laws of thewars

77
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.600
is not kept.

78
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.900
If you would take

79
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.270
the pains but to examine thewars of Pompey the Great,

80
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.470
I warrant you shall find

81
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.900
there is no tiddle-taddle norpibble-pabble

82
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900
in Pompey's camp.

83
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.030
I warrant you,

84
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.870
you shall find the ceremonies ofthe wars

85
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.870
and the cares of it and theforms of it

86
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.600
and the sobriety of it and themodesty of it

87
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.800
to be otherwise.

88
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.700
Why, the enemy is very loud.

89
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.900
You hear him all night.

90
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.070
If the enemy is an ass and afool

91
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.630
and a prating coxcomb,

92
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.770
is it meet, think you,

93
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.330
that we should also be, lookyou,

94
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.000
an ass and a fool and a pratingcoxcomb?

95
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.070
Shh!

96
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.070
Shh!

97
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.900
In your own conscience, now?

98
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.100
I will speak lower.

99
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.100
I pray you and beseech you thatyou will.

100
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.130
Though it appear a little out offashion,

101
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.800
there is much care and valor inthis Welshman.

102
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.030
Brother John Bates,

103
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.000
is not that the morning whichbreaks yonder?

104
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.270
I think it be.

105
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.100
But we have no great cause todesire the approach of it.

106
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.470
Ah, we see yonder the beginningof the day.

107
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.330
I do not think we'll ever seethe end of it.

108
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.870
Who goes there?

109
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.300
A friend.

110
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.130
Under what captain serve you?

111
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.070
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

112
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.830
A good old commander, a mostkind gentleman.

113
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.570
I pray you,

114
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.630
what thinks he of our estate?

115
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.730
Even as men wrecked upon a sand,

116
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.130
that look to be washed off thenext tide.

117
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.900
He hath not told his thought tothe king.

118
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.570
No, nor it is not meet heshould,

119
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.770
for though I speak it to you,

120
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.500
I think the king is but a man asI am.

121
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.270
The violet smells to him as itdoth to me.

122
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.730
The element shows to him as itdoth to me.

123
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.830
All his senses have but humanconditions.

124
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.100
His ceremonies laid by,

125
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.330
in his nakedness, he appears buta man.

126
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.830
And though his affections arehigher mounted than ours,

127
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.830
yet, when they stoop,

128
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.700
they stoop with the like wing.

129
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.430
Therefore, when he sees reasonof fears as we do,

130
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.900
his fears, out of doubt,

131
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.930
be of the same relish as oursare.

132
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.770
Yet, in reason, no man shouldpossess him

133
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.470
with any appearance of fear,

134
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.570
lest he, by showing it, shoulddishearten his army.

135
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.330
He may show what outward couragehe may,

136
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.830
but I believe, as cold a nightas 'tis,

137
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.330
he could wish himself in theThames up to the neck.

138
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.770
And I would he were and I by himat all adventures,

139
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.300
so we were quit here.

140
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.530
By my troth, I will speak myconscience of the king.

141
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.400
I think he would not wishhimself anywhere

142
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400
but where he is.

143
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.830
Then I would he were here alone.

144
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.030
So he's sure to be ransomed andmany poor men's lives saved.

145
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.700
I dare say you love him not soill

146
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.870
to wish him here alone,

147
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.500
howsoever you speak this to feelother men's minds.

148
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.600
Methinks I could not dieanywhere so contented

149
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.170
as in the king's company,

150
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.170
his cause being just, hisquarrel honorable.

151
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.070
That's more than we know.

152
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.000
Aye, or more than we should seekafter,

153
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.630
for we know enough if we know weare the king's subjects.

154
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.000
If his cause be wrong,

155
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.730
our obedience to the king wipesthe crime of it out of us.

156
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.870
But if the cause be not good,

157
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.630
the king himself hath a heavyreckoning to make,

158
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.600
when all those legs and arms andheads,

159
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.230
chopped off in a battle,

160
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.330
shall join together at thelatter day and cry all,

161
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.670
"We died at--at such a place"--

162
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.830
some swearing,

163
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.830
some crying for a surgeon,

164
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.670
some upon their wives left poorbehind them,

165
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.130
some upon the debts they owe,

166
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.230
some upon their children

167
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.270
rawly left.

168
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.530
I am afeard there are few diewell

169
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.070
that die in a battle,

170
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.800
for how can they charitablydispose of anything

171
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.600
when blood is their argument?

172
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.170
Now if these men do not diewell,

173
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.400
it will be a black matter

174
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.070
for the king that led them toit,

175
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.200
who to disobey were against allproportion

176
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.200
of subjection.

177
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.100
So if a son that is by hisfather

178
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.900
sent about merchandise

179
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.730
do sinfully miscarry upon thesea,

180
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.200
the imputation of hiswickedness, by your rule,

181
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.170
should be imposed upon hisfather that sent him.

182
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.530
Or if a servant under hismaster's command

183
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.600
transporting a sum of money

184
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.500
be assailed by robbers and diein many irreconciled iniquities,

185
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.500
you may call the business of themaster

186
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.470
the author of the servant'sdamnation.

187
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.130
But this is not so.

188
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.430
The king is not bound to answer

189
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.570
the particular endings of hissoldiers,

190
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.870
the father of his son, nor themaster of his servant,

191
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.030
for they purpose not their death

192
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.000
when they purpose theirservices.

193
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.870
Besides, there is no king, behis cause never so spotless,

194
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.630
if it come to the arbitrament ofswords,

195
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.770
can try it out with allunspotted soldiers.

196
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.330
Some peradventure have on them

197
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.570
the guilt of premeditated andcontrived murder;

198
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.070
some of beguiling virgins

199
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.300
with the broken seals ofperjury;

200
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.300
some making the wars theirbulwark

201
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.070
that have before gored thegentle bosom of peace

202
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.670
with pillage and robbery.

203
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.100
Now, if these men have defeatedthe law

204
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.130
and outrun native punishment,

205
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.670
though they can outstrip men,

206
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.430
they have no wings to fly fromGod.

207
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.300
War is his beadle, war is hisvengeance

208
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.970
so that here men are punished

209
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.730
for before-breach of the king'slaws

210
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.400
in now the king's quarrel.

211
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.330
Where they feared the death,they have borne life away,

212
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.070
Where they would be safe, theyperish.

213
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.200
Then if they die unprovided,

214
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.400
no more is the king guilty oftheir damnation

215
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.470
than he was before guilty ofthose impieties

216
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.130
for the which they are nowvisited.

217
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.070
Every subject's duty is theking's,

218
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.170
but every subject's soul is hisown.

219
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.300
Therefore should every soldierin the wars

220
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.600
do as every sick man in his bed,

221
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.030
wash every mote out of hisconscience;

222
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.870
and dying so, death is to himadvantage;

223
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.870
or not dying, the time wasblessedly lost

224
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.070
wherein such preparation wasgained.

225
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.630
And in him that escapes,

226
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.970
it were not sin to think that,making God so free an offer,

227
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.200
He let him outlive that day tosee His greatness

228
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.800
and to teach others how theyshould prepare.

229
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.900
'Tis certain, every man thatdies ill,

230
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.100
the ill upon his own head,

231
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.600
the king is not to answer forit.

232
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.400
I do not desire he should answerfor me,

233
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.370
and yet I determine to fightlustily for him.

234
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.400
I myself heard the king say hewould not be ransomed.

235
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.700
Aye, he said so, to make usfight cheerfully,

236
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.330
but when our throats are cut,

237
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.430
he may be ransomed and we ne'erthe wiser.

238
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.430
If I live to see it,

239
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.900
I'll never trust his word after.

240
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.000
Oh, you pay him, then.

241
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.200
Oh, that's a perilous shot outof an elder-gun

242
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.500
that a poor and a privatedispleasure

243
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.000
can do against a monarch.

244
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.400
You may as well go about to turnthe sun to ice

245
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.700
with fanning in its face with apeacock's feather.

246
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.670
You'll never trust his wordafter.

247
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.370
Come, it is a foolish saying.

248
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.770
Your reproof is something tooround.

249
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.100
I should be angry with you, ifthe time were convenient.

250
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.530
Well, let it be a quarrelbetween us if you live.

251
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.100
I embrace it.

252
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.630
How shall I know thee again?

253
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.100
Give me any gage of thine, and Iwill wear it in my bonnet.

254
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.970
If ever thou darest acknowledgeit,

255
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.070
I will make it my quarrel.

256
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:19.300
There is my glove.

257
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.770
Give me another of thine.

258
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.300
There.

259
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.970
This will I also wear in my cap,

260
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.170
and if ever you come to me andsay, after tomorrow,

261
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.470
"This is my glove,"

262
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.630
by this hand, I'll take thee abox on the ear.

263
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.270
If ever I live to see it, I willchallenge it.

264
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.570
Thou darest as well be hanged.

265
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.770
Well, I will do it,

266
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.600
though I take thee in the king'scompany!

267
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.600
Keep thy word!

268
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.130
Fare thee well.

269
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.630
Be friends, you English fools,be friends.

270
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.470
We have French quarrels enough,if you could tell how to reckon.

271
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.570
Indeed, the French may lay 20French crowns to 1

272
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:50.670
they will beat us,

273
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.230
for they bear them on theirshoulders.

274
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.430
But it is no English treason tocut French crowns.

275
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.670
And tomorrow the king himselfwill be a clipper!

276
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.900
Upon the king.

277
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.900
Let us our lives,

278
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.400
our souls,

279
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.800
our debts,

280
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.930
our careful wives,

281
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.870
our children,

282
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.470
and our sins

283
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.470
lay on the king.

284
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.030
We must bear all.

285
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.770
Oh, hard condition,

286
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.470
twin-born with greatness,

287
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.370
subject to the breath of everyfool

288
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:58.400
whose sense no more can feel buthis own wringing.

289
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:02.130
What infinite heart's ease mustkings neglect

290
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.570
that private men enjoy?

291
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.200
And what have kings thatprivates have not too

292
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.230
save ceremony,

293
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.270
save general ceremony?

294
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.330
And what art thou,

295
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.070
thou idle ceremony?

296
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.600
What kind of god art thou

297
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.270
that sufferest more of mortalgriefs

298
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.700
than do thy worshippers?

299
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.470
What are thy rents?

300
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.600
What are thy comings in?

301
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.570
Oh, ceremony, show me but thyworth.

302
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.430
What is thy soul of adoration?

303
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.530
Art thou aught else

304
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.100
but place, degree, and form

305
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.600
creating awe and fear in othermen?

306
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.870
Wherein thou art less happy,being feared,

307
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.870
than they in fearing?

308
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.730
What drinkest thou oft, insteadof homage sweet,

309
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.230
but poisoned flattery?

310
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.970
Oh, be sick, great greatness.

311
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.900
Bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

312
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.730
Thinkest thou the fiery feverwill go out

313
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.730
with titles blown fromadulation?

314
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:05.970
Will it...

315
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.470
give place to flexure and lowbending?

316
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.230
Canst thou, when thou commandestthe beggar's knee,

317
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.570
command the health of it?

318
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.800
No, thou proud dream

319
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.530
that playest so subtly with aking's repose.

320
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.370
I am a king that find thee.

321
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:33.970
And I know 'tis not the balm,thesceptre, and the ball;

322
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:41.070
the sword, the mace, the crownimperial;

323
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.730
the intertissued robe of goldand pearl;

324
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.470
the farced title running 'forethe king;

325
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.630
the throne he sits on;

326
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.170
nor the tide of pomp

327
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.630
that beats upon the high shoreof this world--

328
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.700
no, not all these,

329
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.930
thrice-gorgeous ceremony.

330
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.100
Not all these, laid in bedmajestical,

331
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.600
can sleep so soundly as thewretched slave,

332
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.370
who with a body filled andvacant mind

333
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.230
gets him to rest, crammed withdistressful bread,

334
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.100
never sees horrid night,

335
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.170
the child of hell,

336
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.000
but, like a lackey, from therise to set

337
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.730
sweats in the eye of Phoebus andall night sleeps in Elysium.

338
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.000
Next day after dawn

339
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.630
doth rise and help Hyperion tohis horse

340
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.770
and follows so the ever-runningyear,

341
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.470
with profitable labor, to hisgrave.

342
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.730
And but for ceremony,

343
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.700
such a wretch,

344
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.470
winding up days with toil andnights with sleep,

345
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.070
had the forehand and vantage ofa king.

346
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.600
The slave, a member of thecountry's peace,

347
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.770
enjoys it,

348
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.800
but in gross brain little wotswhat watch the king keeps

349
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.830
to maintain the peace,

350
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.330
whose hours the peasant bestadvantages.

351
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.230
My lord.

352
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.500
My lord, your nobles, jealous ofyour absence,

353
00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.770
seek through your camp to findyou.

354
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:40.370
Good old knight,

355
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.900
collect them all together at mytent.

356
00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.600
I'll be before thee.

357
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.500
I shall do it, my lord.

358
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:54.830
Oh, God of battles,

359
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.930
steel my soldiers' hearts.

360
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.200
Possess them not with fear.

361
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.930
Take from them now the sense ofreckoning,

362
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.330
if the opposed numbers plucktheir hearts from them.

363
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.000
Not today, oh, Lord,

364
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.130
oh, not today.

365
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.200
Think not upon the fault

366
00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.270
my father made in compassing thecrown.

367
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.100
I Richard's body have interredanew

368
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.000
and on it have bestowed morecontrite tears

369
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.670
than from it issued forced dropsof blood.

370
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.730
500 poor I have in yearly pay,

371
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.370
who twice a day their witheredhands

372
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.670
hold up toward heaven to pardonblood.

373
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.870
And I have built two chantries,

374
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.730
where the sad and solemn priestssing still for Richard's soul.

375
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:54.700
More would I do,

376
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.870
but all that I can do is nothingworth,

377
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.430
since that my penitence comesafter all,

378
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.930
imploring pardon.

379
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.930
My liege.

380
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.630
My brother Gloucester's voice.

381
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.700
Aye.

382
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.600
I know thy errand.

383
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.600
I will go with thee.

384
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.430
The day,

385
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.700
my friends,

386
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.700
and all things stay for me.

387
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.270
The sun doth gild our armor.

388
00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.270
Up, my lords.

389
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.700
Montez a cheval!

390
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.270
My horse, varlet!

391
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.670
Laquais! Ha!

392
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.900
Oh, brave spirit.

393
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.900
Via.

394
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.300
Les eaux et la terre.

395
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.430
Rien puis.

396
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.830
L'air et le feu.

397
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.830
Ciel, Cousin Orleans.

398
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:52.270
Now, my Lord Constable.

399
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.500
Hark, how our steeds for presentservice neigh.

400
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:58.370
Mount them and make incision intheir hides

401
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.970
that their hot blood may spin inEnglish eyes

402
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.530
and dout them with superfluouscourage, ha.

403
00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.070
What, will you have them weepour horses' blood?

404
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:09.030
How shall we, then, behold theirnatural tears?

405
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.070
The English are embattled, youFrench peers.

406
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.430
To horse, you gallant princes,straight to horse.

407
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.170
Do but behold yon poor andstarved band,

408
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.000
and your fair show shall suckaway their souls,

409
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.800
leaving them but the shales andhusks of men.

410
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.700
There is not work enough for allour hands,

411
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.930
scarce blood enough in all theirsickly veins

412
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.500
to give each naked curtal ax astain,

413
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.930
that our French gallants shalltoday draw out

414
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.500
and sheathe for lack of sport.

415
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.000
If we but blow on them,

416
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.470
the vapor of our valor willo'erturn them.

417
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.070
Why do you stay so long, mylords of France?

418
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.770
Yon island carrions, desperateof their bones,

419
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.030
ill-favoredly become the morningfield.

420
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.670
Their ragged curtains poorly arelet loose,

421
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.900
and our air shakes them passingscornfully.

422
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.170
The horsemen sit like fixedcandlesticks

423
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.130
with torch-staves in their hand.

424
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.130
And their poor jades lob downtheir heads,

425
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.800
dropping the hides and hips,

426
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.400
the gum down-roping from theirpale-dead eyes,

427
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.530
and in their pale dull mouths,

428
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:11.930
the gimmal bit lies foul withchewed grass,

429
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.730
dull and motionless.

430
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.570
And their executors, the knavishcrows,

431
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.670
fly o'er them, all impatient fortheir hour.

432
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.600
They have said their prayers,and they stay for death.

433
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.030
Shall we go send them dinnersand fresh suits

434
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.270
and give their fasting horsesprovender,

435
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.700
and after fight with them?

436
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.270
I stay but for my guidon.

437
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.500
Let's away.

438
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.900
The sun is high,

439
00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.800
and we outwear the day.

440
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.470
Where is the king?

441
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.070
The king himself

442
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.200
is rode to view their battle.

443
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.400
Of fighting men, they have fullthree-score thousand.

444
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.070
There's five to one.

445
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.570
Besides, they all are fresh.

446
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.030
God's arm strike with us; 'tis afearful odds.

447
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.100
God by you, princes all.

448
00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.430
I'll to my charge.

449
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.300
If we no more meet till we meetin heaven,

450
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.530
then, joyfully, my noble Lord ofBedford,

451
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.000
my dear Lord Gloucester,

452
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.600
my good Lord Exeter,

453
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.730
and my kind kinsman,

454
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.770
warriors all, adieu.

455
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.530
Farewell, good Salisbury,

456
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.670
and good luck go with thee.

457
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.200
Farewell, kind lord.

458
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.070
Fight valiantly today.

459
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:21.770
Yet I do thee wrong to mind theeof it,

460
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.800
for thou art framed of the firmtruth of valor.

461
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.170
He is as full of valor as ofkindness,

462
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.170
princely in both.

463
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.330
Oh, that we now had here

464
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.700
but one 10,000 of those men inEngland

465
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.400
that do no work today.

466
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.370
What's he that wishes so?

467
00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:39.870
My cousin Westmoreland.

468
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.530
No, my fair cousin.

469
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.000
We are marked to die,

470
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.300
we are enow to do our countryloss;

471
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.470
and if to live, the fewer men,the greater share of honor.

472
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.500
God's will.

473
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.070
I pray thee, wish not one manmore.

474
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.400
By Jove, I am not covetous forgold

475
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.370
nor care I who doth feed upon mycost.

476
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.370
It yearns me not if men mygarments wear.

477
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.170
Such outward things dwell not inmy desires.

478
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:08.700
But if it be a sin to covethonor,

479
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.970
I am the most offending soulalive.

480
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.730
No, faith, my coz, wish not aman from England.

481
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.730
God's peace.

482
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.700
I would not lose so great anhonor

483
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.070
as one man more, methinks, wouldshare from me

484
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.070
for the best hope I have.

485
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.200
Oh, do not wish one more.

486
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.530
Rather proclaim it,Westmoreland, through my host,

487
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:29.400
that he which hath no stomach tothis fight, let him depart.

488
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.770
His passport shall be made

489
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.100
and crowns for convoy put intohis purse.

490
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.900
We would not die in that man'scompany

491
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.130
that fears his fellowship to diewith us.

492
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.500
This day is called

493
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.200
the feast of Crispian.

494
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.130
He that outlives this day

495
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.330
and comes safe home

496
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.530
will stand at tiptoe when thisday is named

497
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.030
and rouse him at the name ofCrispian.

498
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.730
He that shall live this day

499
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.970
and see old age

500
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.200
will yearly on the vigil feasthis neighbors

501
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.630
and say, "Tomorrow is SaintCrispian."

502
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.230
Then shall he strip his sleeveand show his scars

503
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.330
and say, "These wounds I had onCrispian's day."

504
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.030
Old men forget,

505
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.100
yet all shall be forgot,

506
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.770
but he'll remember withadvantages

507
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.330
what feats he did that day.

508
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.430
Then shall our names,

509
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.730
familiar in his mouth ashousehold words--

510
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.530
Harry the king,

511
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.300
Bedford and Exeter,

512
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.900
Warwick and Talbot,

513
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.270
Salisbury and Gloucester--

514
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.130
be in their flowing cups freshlyremembered.

515
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:48.370
This story shall the good manteach his son.

516
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.200
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'ergo by,

517
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.500
from this day to the ending ofthe world,

518
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.230
but we in it shall beremembered,

519
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.500
we few,

520
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.470
we happy few,

521
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.800
we band of brothers;

522
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.470
for he today that sheds hisblood with me

523
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.670
shall be my brother.

524
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:13.870
Be he ne'er so vile,

525
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.270
this day shall gentle hiscondition.

526
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.900
And gentlemen in England nowabed

527
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.170
shall think themselves accursedthey were not here

528
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.600
and hold their manhoods cheap

529
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.230
whiles any speaks that foughtwith us

530
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.230
upon Saint Crispin's day.

531
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.100
My sovereign lord,

532
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.270
bestow yourself with speed.

533
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:35.630
The French are bravely in theirbattles set

534
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:36.970
and will with all expediencecharge on us.

535
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.170
All things are ready if ourminds be so.

536
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.730
Perish the man whose mind isbackward now.

537
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.570
Thou dost not wish more helpfrom England, coz.

538
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.500
God's will, my liege, would youand I alone,

539
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.870
without more help, could fightthis royal battle.

540
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.770
Why, now thou hast unwished5,000 men,

541
00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.670
which likes me better than towish us one.

542
00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.230
You know your places.

543
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.570
God be with you all.

544
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.470
Once more, I come to know ofthee,

545
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:09.570
King Harry,

546
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.700
if for thy ransom thou wilt nowcompound,

547
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.430
before thy most assuredoverthrow,

548
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.670
for certainly thou art so nearthe gulf,

549
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.730
thou needs must be englutted.

550
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.430
Besides, in mercy, the constabledesires thee

551
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.230
thou wilt mind thy followers ofrepentance

552
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.500
that their souls may make apeaceful and a sweet retire

553
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.500
from off these fields, where,wretches,

554
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.430
their poor bodies must lie andfester.

555
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.070
Who hath sent thee now?

556
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.200
The constable of France.

557
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.130
I pray thee, bear my formeranswer back.

558
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.730
Bid them achieve me and thensell my bones.

559
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.770
Good God, why should they mockpoor fellows thus?

560
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.600
The man that once did sell thelion's skin

561
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.700
while the beast lived

562
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.730
was killed with hunting him.

563
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.770
A many of our bodies

564
00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.170
shall no doubt find nativegraves,

565
00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.500
upon the which, I trust,

566
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:03.400
shall witness live in brass ofthis day's work.

567
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.400
Those that leave their valiantbones in France,

568
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.770
dying like men, though buried inyour dunghills,

569
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.000
they shall be famed,

570
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.570
for there, the sun shall greetthem

571
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.500
and draw their honors reeking upto heaven,

572
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.900
leaving their earthly parts tochoke your clime,

573
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:21.870
the smell whereof shall breed aplague in France.

574
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.900
Let me speak proudly.

575
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.030
Tell the constable

576
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.770
we are but warriors for theworking day.

577
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.930
Our gayness and our gilt are allbesmirched

578
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.000
with rainy marching in thepainful field.

579
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.370
There's not a piece of featherin our host--

580
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.600
good argument, I hope, we willnot fly--

581
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.330
and time hath worn us intoslovenry.

582
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:43.330
But, by the mass, our hearts arein the trim.

583
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.870
And my poor soldiers tell me,

584
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.800
yet ere night, they'll be infresher robes,

585
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.370
or they will pluck the gay newcoats

586
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.770
o'er the French soldiers' heads

587
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.030
and turn them out of service.

588
00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.530
If they do this-- as, if Godplease, they shall--

589
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.630
my ransom then shall soon belevied.

590
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:59.230
Herald, save thou thy labor.

591
00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.500
Come thou no more for ransom,gentle herald,

592
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.070
for they shall have none, Iswear, but these my joints,

593
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.930
which if they have as I willleave 'em them,

594
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.200
shall yield them little, tellthe constable.

595
00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.830
I shall, King Harry.

596
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.470
And so fare thee well.

597
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.730
Thou never shalt hear heraldanymore.

598
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.930
I fear thou wilt once more comeagain for a ransom.

599
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.600
My lord, most humbly on my knee,

600
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.370
I beg the leading of the vaward.

601
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.930
Take it,

602
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.930
brave York.

603
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.630
Now, soldiers,

604
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.070
march away!

605
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.370
And how thou pleasest, God,dispose the day.

606
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.030
Yield, cur!

607
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.230
Je pense que vous etes legentilhomme de bonne qualite.

608
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:13.230
Art thou a gentleman?

609
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.870
What is thy name? Discuss.

610
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.730
Oh, Seigneur Dieu.

611
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.530
Oh, Signieur Dew should be agentleman.

612
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:24.830
Perpend my words, Oh, SignieurDew, and mark.

613
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.730
Oh, Signieur Dew, thou diest onpoint of fox,

614
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.970
except, oh, Signieur,

615
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:35.330
you do give to me egregiousransom.

616
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.070
Oh, prenez misericorde.

617
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.230
Ayez pitie de moi.

618
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.630
Est-il impossible d'echapper laforce de ton bras.

619
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.830
Brass, cur?

620
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.300
You damned and luxuriousmountain goat,

621
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.170
offerest thou me brass?

622
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.300
Oh, pardonnez-moi.

623
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.230
What sayest thou so to me?

624
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.400
A ton of moys?

625
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.800
Come hither, boy!

626
00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.300
Ask me this slave in French whatis his name.

627
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.530
Ecoutez?

628
00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.170
Comment etes-vous appele?

629
00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.230
Monsieur le Fer.

630
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.530
He says his name is Master Fer.

631
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:10.700
Master Fer?

632
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.500
I'll fer him, firk him, andferret him.

633
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.430
Discuss the same in French untohim.

634
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.100
I do not know the French for ferand ferret and firk.

635
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.800
Well, bid him prepare, for Iwill cut his throat.

636
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.500
Que dit-il, Monsieur?

637
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:26.270
Il me commande a vous dire quevous faites vous pret.

638
00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:30.770
Car ce soldat ici est disposetout a cette heure

639
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.970
de couper votre gorge.

640
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:36.470
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,

641
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.100
peasant, unless you give mecrowns,

642
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.400
brave crowns,

643
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.030
or mangled shalt thou be bythis, my sword.

644
00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.170
Oh, je vous supplie, pourl'amour de Dieu,

645
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:47.600
me pardonner!

646
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.070
Je suis gentilhomme de bonnemaison.

647
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.600
Gardez ma vie, et je vousdonnerai deux cents ecus.

648
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.370
What are his words?

649
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.100
He prays for you to save hislife.

650
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.700
He is a gentleman of good house.

651
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.800
And for his ransom, he will giveyou 200 crowns.

652
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.070
Oui, monsieur.

653
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.530
Tell him my fury will abate,

654
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.970
but I the crowns will take.

655
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.800
Petit monsieur, que dit-il?

656
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.330
Encore qu'il est contre sonjurement

657
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.630
de pardonner aucun prisonnier.

658
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.430
Neanmoins, pour les ecus quevous l'avez promis,

659
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:24.700
il est content de vous donner laliberte, le franchisement.

660
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.500
Sur mes genoux je vous donnemille remercimens.

661
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.930
Et je m'estime heureux que jesuis tombe entre

662
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.500
les mains d'un chevalier,

663
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.700
je pense, le plus brave,vaillant,

664
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.930
et tres distingue seigneurd'Angleterre!

665
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.930
Merci, monsieur.

666
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.400
Expound unto me, boy.

667
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.500
He gives you, upon his knees, athousand thanks.

668
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.930
And he esteems himself happythat he hath fallen

669
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.330
into the hands of one, as hethinks,

670
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.200
the most brave, valorous,

671
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.530
and thrice-worthy signieur ofEngland.

672
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.630
As I suck blood, I will somemercy show.

673
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.030
Follow me!

674
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.030
Follow me!

675
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.330
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.

676
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.400
Follow me!

677
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.400
I did never know so full a voiceissue from so empty a heart.

678
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.930
But the saying is true,

679
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.830
"The empty vessel makes thegreatest sound."

680
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.830
Bardolph and Nym had ten timesmore valor

681
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.330
than this roaring devil i' theold play,

682
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.000
and they are both hanged.

683
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.130
And so would this be

684
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.070
if he durst steal anythingadventurously.

685
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.330
I must stay with the lackey withthe luggage of our camp.

686
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.070
The French might have a goodprey of us,

687
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.230
if he knew of it,

688
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:43.270
for there is none to guard itbut boys.

689
00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.000
Shame and eternal shame, nothingbut shame!

690
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.500
Oh, let us die in honor.

691
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.170
Once more back again!

692
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.270
And he who will not followBourbon now, let him go hence,

693
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.730
and with his cap in hand, like abase pander,

694
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.070
hold the chamber door whilst bya slave,

695
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.670
no gentler than my dog,

696
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:02.770
his fairest daughter iscontaminated.

697
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:05.700
Disorder, that hath spoiled us,friend us now.

698
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.400
Let us on heaps go offer up ourlives.

699
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.730
We are enow yet living in thefield

700
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.330
to smother up the English in ourthrongs

701
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.530
if any order might be thoughtupon.

702
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:16.900
Oh, the devil take order now.

703
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.470
I'll to the throng!

704
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.900
Let life be short, else shamewill be too long.

705
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.300
Well have we done,thrice-valiant countrymen.

706
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.770
But all's not done.

707
00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.470
Yet keep the French the field.

708
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.770
The Duke of York commends him toYour Majesty.

709
00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.930
Lives he, good Uncle?

710
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.700
Thrice within this hour, I sawhim down,

711
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.370
thrice up again and fighting.

712
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.070
From helmet to the spur, allblood he was.

713
00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:00.870
In which array, brave soldier,doth he lie, larding the plain.

714
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:02.030
And by his bloody side,

715
00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.470
yokefellow to his honor-owingwounds,

716
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.770
the noble Earl of Suffolk alsolies.

717
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.600
Suffolk first died.

718
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:13.270
York, all haggled over, comes tohim,

719
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.270
where in gore he lay insteeped,

720
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.270
takes him by the beard,

721
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:17.300
and kisses the gashes

722
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.170
that bloodily did yawn upon hisface.

723
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:22.270
He cries aloud, "Tarry, mycousin Suffolk.

724
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.230
"My soul shall thine keepcompany to heaven.

725
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.170
"Tarry, sweet soul, for mine,then fly abreast,

726
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.600
"as in this glorious andwell-foughten field

727
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.100
we--we kept together in ourchivalry."

728
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:39.300
Upon these words, I came andcheered him up.

729
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.430
He smiled me in the face, raughtme his hand,

730
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:44.100
and, with a feeble grip, says,"Dear my lord,

731
00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.000
commend my service to mysovereign."

732
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.770
So did he turn,

733
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.900
and over Suffolk's neck,

734
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.400
he threw his wounded arm andkissed his lips.

735
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.700
And so espoused to death, withblood,

736
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.770
he sealed a testament ofnoble-ending love.

737
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.830
The pretty and sweet manner ofit

738
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:08.170
forced those waters from mewhich I would have stopped.

739
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.630
I had not so much of man in me,

740
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.800
and all my mother came into mineeyes

741
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.030
and gave me up to tears.

742
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.970
I blame you not,

743
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:21.100
for, hearing this,

744
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.400
I must perforce compound withmistful eyes,

745
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.430
or they will issue too.

746
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.630
But hark, what new alarum isthis same?

747
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.830
The French have reinforced theirscattered men.

748
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.600
Then every soldier kill hisprisoners.

749
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600
Give the word through.

750
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.730
Kill the poys and the luggage!

751
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.700
'Tis expressly against the lawof arms!

752
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.200
'Tis as arrant a piece ofknavery,

753
00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.030
mark you now, as can be offered.

754
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.830
In your conscience, is it not?

755
00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.270
'Tis certain there's not a boyleft alive.

756
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:57.600
And the cowardly rascals thatran from the battle

757
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.630
have done this slaughter.

758
00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:02.270
Besides, they have burned andcarried away

759
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.370
all that was in the king's tent.

760
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.130
Wherefore the king, mostworthily,

761
00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.330
hath caused every soldier to cuthis prisoner's throat.

762
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.530
Oh, 'tis a gallant king.

763
00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:16.600
Aye, he was born at Monmouth,Captain Gower.

764
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.130
What call you the name of thetown

765
00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.470
where Alexander the Pig is born?

766
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.030
Alexander the Great.

767
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.670
Why, I pray you, is pig notgreat?

768
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:28.630
The pig or the great or the hugeor the mighty

769
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.800
or the magnificence?

770
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.030
It's all one reckoning,

771
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.870
save the phrase, a littlevariation.

772
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.000
I think Alexander the Great wasborn at Macedon.

773
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.130
His father was called Philip ofMacedon,

774
00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.530
as I take it.

775
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.570
I think it is in Macedon whereAlexander is born.

776
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:44.670
I tell you, Captain,

777
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.470
if you look in the maps of the'orld,

778
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:48.700
I warrant you shall find

779
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.870
in the situations betweenMacedon and Monmouth

780
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:56.070
that the situations, look you,is both alike.

781
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.270
There is a river in Macedon.

782
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.730
There is also moreover a riverat Monmouth,

783
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.770
the Wye at Monmouth.

784
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.800
But it is out of my brains

785
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.370
what is the name of the otherriver.

786
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:08.570
But it is all one,

787
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:11.230
such as my fingers is to myfingers,

788
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.500
and there is salmons--

789
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.730
mm--

790
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.730
in both.

791
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:18.570
Oh, shh.

792
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.430
If you mark Alexander's lifewell,

793
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.700
Harry of Monmouth's life

794
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.700
is come after it indifferentwell,

795
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.400
for there is figures in allthings.

796
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.730
Alexander, God knows and youknow,

797
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.070
in his rages and his wraths

798
00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.300
and his cholers and his moodsand his displeasures

799
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.670
and his indignations and alsobeing

800
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:39.000
a little intoxicates in hisbrains,

801
00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.770
did, in his ales and his angers,kill his best friend, Cleitus.

802
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.730
Our king is not like him inthat.

803
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.670
He never killed any of hisfriends.

804
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.500
It is not well done, mark younow,

805
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.900
to take the tales out of mymouth

806
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.470
ere it is made and finished.

807
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:56.270
I speak but in the figures andcomparisons of it.

808
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:59.200
As Alexander did kill his friendCleitus,

809
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.530
in his ales and in his cups,

810
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.500
so also Harry Monmouth,

811
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.770
being in his right wits and hisgood judgments,

812
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:08.000
turned away the fat knight withthe great belly doublet.

813
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.800
He was full of jests and gipesand mocks and knaveries.

814
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.100
Oh, I forgot his name now.

815
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.230
Sir John Falstaff.

816
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.270
That is he.

817
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:17.370
I'll tell you, Captain,

818
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:19.730
there is good men born atMonmouth.

819
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.770
Here comes His Majesty.

820
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.270
I was not angry since I came toFrance

821
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.270
until this instant.

822
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.330
Take a trumpet, herald.

823
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.170
Ride thou unto the horsemen onyond hill.

824
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.300
If they will fight with us,

825
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.500
bid them come down or void thefield.

826
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.000
They do offend our sight.

827
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.300
If they'll do neither,

828
00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.270
we'll come to them and make themskirr away,

829
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.830
as swift as stones enforced fromthe old Assyrian slings.

830
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.970
Besides, we'll cut the throatsof those we have,

831
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.630
and not a man of them that weshall take

832
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:15.570
shall taste our mercy!

833
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:16.870
Go and tell them so.

834
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.130
Here comes the herald of theFrench, my liege.

835
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.970
How now.

836
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.270
What means this, herald?

837
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.030
Comest thou again for ransom?

838
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:34.530
No, great king.

839
00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.730
I come to thee for charitablelicense,

840
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.330
that we may wander o'er thisbloody field

841
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.270
to book our dead and then tobury them,

842
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:47.800
to sort our nobles from ourcommon men,

843
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.100
for many of our princes-- woethe while--

844
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.100
lie drowned and soaked inmercenary blood.

845
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.470
So do our vulgar drench theirpeasant limbs

846
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.730
in blood of princes,

847
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:03.100
and their wounded steeds fretfetlock deep in gore

848
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.370
and with wild rage

849
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.830
yerk out their armed heels attheir dead masters,

850
00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.130
killing them twice.

851
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.730
Oh, give us leave, great king,to view the field in safety

852
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.530
and dispose of their deadbodies.

853
00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.300
I tell thee truly, herald,

854
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.230
I know not if the day be ours orno,

855
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.000
for yet a many of your horsemenpeer and gallop o'er the field.

856
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.670
The day is yours.

857
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:36.130
Praised be God,

858
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.130
and not our strength, for it.

859
00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.670
What is this castle called thatstands hard by?

860
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:03.730
They call it Agincourt.

861
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:14.070
Then call we this the field ofAgincourt,

862
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.870
fought on the day of CrispinCrispianus.

863
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:30.530
Your grandfather of famousmemory--

864
00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:32.630
an't please Your Majesty--

865
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.400
and your great-uncle Edward, theBlack Prince of Wales,

866
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.300
as I have read in thechronicles,

867
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.300
fought a most famous battle herein France.

868
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.470
They did, Fluellen.

869
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.200
Your Majesty says very true.

870
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.630
If Your Majesties is rememberedof it,

871
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.330
the Welshmen did good service

872
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.230
in the garden where leeks didgrow,

873
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.970
wearing leeks in their Monmouthcaps,

874
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:54.700
which, Your Majesty know, tothis hour

875
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.630
to be an honorable badge of theservice.

876
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.430
And I do believe Your Majestytakes no scorn

877
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.630
to wear the leek upon SaintTavy's day.

878
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:03.530
I wear it for a memorable honor,

879
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.530
for I am Welsh, you know, goodcountryman.

880
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.270
All the water in Wye cannot wash

881
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.330
the Welsh blood out of YourMajesty's body,

882
00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:15.170
I can tell you that!

883
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.730
God bless it and preserve it

884
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:22.200
as long as it pleases His Graceand His Majesty too!

885
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.470
Thanks, good my countryman.

886
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:29.200
By Jeshu, I am Your Majesty'scountryman!

887
00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.770
I care not who know it!

888
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.400
I will confess it to all the'orld!

889
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.600
I need not be ashamed of YourMajesty, praised be God,

890
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.430
as long as Your Majesty is anhonest man.

891
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.930
God keep me so.

892
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.370
Our herald go with him,

893
00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:56.300
and bring me just notice of thenumbers dead

894
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.300
on both our parts.

895
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.500
Call yonder fellow hither.

896
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.370
Soldier, you must come to theking.

897
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.000
Soldier, why wearest thou thatglove in thy cap?

898
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.400
Oh.

899
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.770
An't please Your Majesty,

900
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.970
it is the gage of one I shouldfight withal,

901
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:33.970
if he be alive.

902
00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:34.970
An Englishman?

903
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.270
An't please Your Majesty,

904
00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.200
a rascal that swaggered with melast night,

905
00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.970
who, if ever dare challenge thisglove,

906
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:41.700
I have sworn to take him a boxo' the ear.

907
00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.300
Or if I should see my glove inhis cap--

908
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.870
which he swore, as he were asoldier,

909
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.270
he would wear if alive--

910
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.100
I will strike it out soundly.

911
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:50.100
What think you, CaptainFluellen?

912
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.400
Is it fit this soldier keep hisoath?

913
00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.400
He is a villain and a craven,

914
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.800
an't please Your Majesty, in myconscience.

915
00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.800
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, whenthou meetest the fellow.

916
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.430
So I will, my liege, as I live.

917
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:06.630
Who servest thou under?

918
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.000
Under Captain Gower, my liege.

919
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.370
Call him hither to me, soldier.

920
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.070
Oh, I will, my liege.

922
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:21.500
Wear thou this favor for me andstick it in thy cap.

923
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.500
When Alencon and myself weredown together,

924
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.900
I plucked this glove from hishelm.

925
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.270
If any man challenge this,

926
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.070
he is a friend to Alencon and anenemy to our person.

927
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.000
If thou encounter any such,apprehend him,

928
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.670
an thou dost me love.

929
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:34.770

931
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.530
in the hearts of his subjects.

932
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.270
I fain see the man that hath buttwo legs

933
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.470
that shall find himselfaggrieved at this glove.

934
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:43.470
That is all.

935
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.000
But I'd fain see it once,

936
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.330
an please God of His grace thatI might see.

937
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:48.530
Knowest thou Gower?

938
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.470
Oh, he is my very dear friend,an please you.

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:49.270
but in plain shock and even playof battle,

1084
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.670
was ever known so great andlittle loss

1085
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.400
on one part and on the other?

1086
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.970
Take it, God, for it is none butThine.

1087
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:05.500
'Tis wonderful.

1088
00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.770
Come, go we in procession to thevillage.

1089
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.700
And be it death proclaimedthrough our host

1090
00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.630
to boast of this or take thatpraise from God

1091
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.730
which is His only.

1092
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.170
Is it not lawful, an please YourMajesty,

1093
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:16.170
to tell how many is killed?

1094
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.170
Yes, Captain.

1095
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:18.570
But with this acknowledgment,

1096
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.970
that God fought for us.

1097
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:21.930
Yes, my conscience, He did usgreat good.

1098
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.570
Do we all holy rites.

1099
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:31.300
Let there be sung, "Non nobis teDeum,"

1100
00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.430
the dead with charity enclosedin clay,

1101
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.000
and then to Calais

1102
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.600
and to England then,

1103
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.970
and where ne'er from Francearrived more happy men.

1104
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.730
Vouchsafe to those that have notread the story,

1105
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.630
that I may prompt them.

1106
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:52.630
And of such as have,

1107
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.170
I humbly pray them to admit theexcuse of time,

1108
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:56.800
of numbers and due course ofthings,

1109
00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.370
which cannot in their huge andproper life

1110
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.170
be here presented.

1111
00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:04.100
Now we bear the king towardCalais.

1112
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.430
Grant him there.

1113
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.030
There seen, heave him away uponyour winged thoughts

1114
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.630
athwart the sea.

1115
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:13.670
Behold, the English beach palesin the flood with men,

1116
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:14.970
with wives and boys,

1117
00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:18.670
whose shouts and claps out-voicethe deep-mouthed sea,

1118
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:20.630
which like a mighty whiffler'fore the king

1119
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:22.330
seems to prepare his way.

1120
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:27.700
So let him land, and solemnlysee him set on to London.

1121
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:30.530
So swift a pace hath thoughtthat even now

1122
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:33.370
you may imagine him uponBlackheath,

1123
00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.470
where that his lords desire him

1124
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.070
to have borne his bruised helmet

1125
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:39.970
and his bended sword before himthrough the city.

1126
00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:42.000
He forbids it,

1127
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.070
being free from vainness andself-glorious pride,

1128
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:47.300
giving full trophy, signal, andostent

1129
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.370
quite from himself to God.

1130
00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:52.100
But now behold,

1131
00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.630
in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought,

1132
00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.900
how London doth pour out hercitizens.

1133
00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.700
The mayor and all his brethrenin best sort,

1134
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.770
like to the senators of theantique Rome

1135
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:06.100
with the plebeians swarming attheir heels,

1136
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.830
go forth and fetch theirconquering Caesar in.

1137
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:11.970
As, by a lower but lovinglikelihood,

1138
00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:14.400
were now the general of ourgracious empress,

1139
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.000
as in good time he may, fromIreland coming,

1140
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.770
bringing rebellion broached onhis sword,

1141
00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.230
how many would the peaceful cityquit,

1142
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.400
to welcome him.

1143
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:30.230
Much more and much more causedid they this Harry.

1144
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.330
Now in London place him.

1145
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:34.970
As yet the lamentations of theFrench

1146
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:37.800
invites the king of England'sstay at home--

1147
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.770
the emperor's coming in behalfof France

1148
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.200
to order peace between them--

1149
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:44.870
and omit all the occurrences,whatever chanced,

1150
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.770
till Harry's back return againto France.

1151
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.970
There must we bring him,

1152
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:52.200
and myself have played theinterim

1153
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.770
by remembering you 'tis past.

1154
00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.030
Then brook abridgment,

1155
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:58.500
and your eyes advance after yourthoughts,

1156
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.200
straight back again to France.

1157
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.930
Nay, that's right.

1158
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.900
But why wear you your leektoday?

1159
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.730
Saint Davy's day is past.

1160
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:10.570
There is occasions and causeswhy and wherefore in all things.

1161
00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:13.500
I will tell you as my friend,Captain Gower.

1162
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.470
The rascally, scald, beggarly,lousy, pragging knave, Pistol,

1163
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:21.570
which you and yourself and allthe world know

1164
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:23.230
to be a man of no merits,

1165
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:27.570
he is come to me yesterday andbrings me bread and salt

1166
00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.870
and bids me eat my leek.

1167
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:30.970
It was in a place

1168
00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:33.070
where I could bear no contentionwith him.

1169
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:36.700
But I'll be so bold as to wearmy leek in my cap

1170
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.630
till I see him again,

1171
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:41.730
and then I will tell him alittle piece of my desires.

1172
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:44.930
Here he comes, swelling like aturkey-cock.

1173
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:47.970
'Tis no matter for his swellingsnor his turkey-cocks.

1174
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.230
God bless you, Aunchient Pistol!

1175
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:54.100
You scurvy, lousy knave, Godbless you.

1176
00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:55.100
Ha!

1177
00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.100
Art thou bedlam?

1178
00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.330
Would'st thou have me fold upParca's fatal web?

1179
00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:01.430
Hence.

1180
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:03.670
I am qualmish at the smell ofleek.

1181
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:06.700

Ow!

1190
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:28.900
Ah!

1191
00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.770
There is one goat for you.

1192
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:31.970
Oh!

Will you be so good, scaldknave, as eat it?

1194

Base Troyan, thou shalt die.

1195
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.930
You say very true, scald knave,when God's will is.

1196
00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.230
I will desire you to live in themeantime

1197
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:43.800
and eat your victuals.

1198
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.930
Come, there is sauce for it.

1199
00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:47.600

Yes, certainly, out of doubt

1204
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:57.230
and out of question too

1205
00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.030
and ambiguities.

1206
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:03.330

I have another leek in mypocket.

1211
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.230
There's not enough leek to swearby.

1212
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:18.600
Quiet thy cudgel!

1213
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.830

Oh, no, throw none away.

The skin is good for your brokencoxcomb.

1217
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.400
God be wi' you and keep you

1218
00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.600
and heal your pate.

1219
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:59.000
Doth Fortune play the huswifewith me now?

1220
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.200
News have I that my Nell is deadi' the spital

1221
00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.900
of malady of France.

1222
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:11.900
And there, my rendezvous isquite cut off.

1223
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.730
Old I do wax.

1224
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:22.570
And from my weary limbs, honoris cudgelled.

1225
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:29.530
Well, bawd I'll turn

1226
00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:34.100
and something lean to cutpurseof quick hand.

1227
00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.670
To England will I steal,

1228
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:41.000
and there, I'll steal.

1229
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.770
And patches will I get untothese scars,

1230
00:57:45.770 --> 00:57:49.900
and say I got them in the Galliawars.

1231
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:56.830
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1232
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:59.830
