And fought the holy warsin Palestine,

By this brave duke cameearly to his grave:

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.570

To spread his colours,boy, in thy behalf,

And to rebuke theusurpation

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.600
Of thy unnatural uncle,English John:

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.470
Embrace him, love him,give him welcome hither.

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.870
God shall forgive youCoeur-de-lion's death

14

I give you welcome with apowerless hand,

Welcome before the gatesof Angiers, duke.

A noble boy! Who would notdo thee right?

20

Upon thy cheek lay I thiszealous kiss,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.600
As seal to this indentureof my love,

Till Angiers and the rightthou hast in France,

24
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.770
Together with that pale,that white-faced shore,

25
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.330
Whose foot spurns back theocean's roaring tides

26
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
And coops from other landsher islanders,

27
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.430
Even till that England,hedged in with the main,

28
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.330
That water-walled bulwark,still secure

29
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.270
And confident from foreignpurposes,

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.400
Even till that utmostcorner of the west

31
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.200
Salute thee for her king:till then, fair boy,

32
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.330
Will I not think of home,but follow arms.

33
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.730
O, take his mother'sthanks, a widow's thanks,

34
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.000
Till your strong hand shallhelp to give him strength

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.770
To make a more requital toyour love!

36
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.430
The peace of heaven is theirsthat lift their swords

37
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.700
In such a just andcharitable war.

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.070
(crowd chants) Arthur! Arthur!

39
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.300
Well then, to work: ourcannon shall be bent

40
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.500
Against the brows of thisresisting town.

41
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.000
Call for our chiefest menof discipline,

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.130
To cull the plots of bestadvantages:

43
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.670
We'll lay before this townour royal bones,

44
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.470
Wade to the market-placein Frenchmen's blood,

45
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.800
But we will make itsubject to this boy.

46
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.830
Stay for an answer to yourembassy,

47
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.330
Lest unadvised you stainyour swords with blood:

48
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.200
My Lord Chatillon may fromEngland bring,

49
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.930
That right in peace whichhere we urge in war,

50
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.630
And then we shall repenteach drop of blood

51
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.670
Which hot rash haste soindirectly shed.

52
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.500
A wonder, lady! lo, uponthy wish,

53
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.070
Our messenger Chatillon isarrived!

54
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.670
What England says, saybriefly, gentle lord;

55
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670
We coldly pause for thee;Chatillon, speak.

56
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.330
Then turn your forces fromthis paltry siege

57
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.230
And stir them up against amightier task.

58
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.630
England, impatient of yourjust demands,

59
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.200
Hath put himself in arms:the adverse winds,

60
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.330
Whose leisure I havestay'd, have given him time

61
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.870
To land his legions all assoon as I;

62
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.970
His marches are expedientto this town,

63
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.730
His forces strong, hissoldiers confident.

64
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.000
With him along is come themother-queen,

65
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.030
An Ate, stirring him toblood and strife;

66
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.030
With her her niece, theLady Blanch of Spain;

67
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.300
With them a bastard of theking's deceased,

68
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.500
And all the unsettledhumours of the land,

69
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.330
Rash, inconsiderate, fieryvoluntaries,

70
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.170
With ladies' faces andfierce dragons' spleens,

71
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.330
Have sold their fortunesat their native homes,

72
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.570
Bearing their birthrightsproudly on their backs,

73
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.330
To make hazard of newfortunes here:

74
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.000
In brief, a braver choiceof dauntless spirits

75
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.230
Than now the Englishbottoms have waft o'er

76
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.870
Did nearer float upon theswelling tide,

77
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.800
To do offence and scath inChristendom.

78
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.670
♪Drum beats

79
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.130
The interruption of theirchurlish drums

80
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.970
Cuts off more circumstance:they are at hand,

81
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.300
To parley or to fight;therefore prepare.

82
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.230
How much unlook'd for isthis expedition!

83
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.930
By how much unexpected, byso much

84
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.600
We must awake endavour fordefence;

85
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.570
For courage mounteth withoccasion:

86
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.930
Let them be welcome then:we are prepared.

87
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.970
Peace be to France, ifFrance in peace permit

88
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.770
Our just and linealentrance to our own;

89
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.930
If not, bleed France, andpeace ascend to heaven,

90
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.070
Whiles we, God'swrathful agent,

91
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.530
do correct their proud contemptthat beats His peace to heaven.

92
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.370
Peace be to England, ifthat war return

93
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.470
From France to England,there to live in peace.

94
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.670
England we love; and forthat England's sake

95
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.570
With burden of our armourhere we sweat.

96
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.330
This toil of ours shouldbe a work of thine;

97
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.270
But thou from lovingEngland art so far,

98
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.470
That thou hast under-wroughthis lawful king

99
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.600
Cut off the sequence ofposterity,

100
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.170
Out-faced infant state anddone a rape

101
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.400
Upon the maiden virtue ofthe crown.

102
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.230
Look here upon thy brotherGeffrey's face;

103
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800
These eyes, these brows,were moulded out of his:

104
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.970
This little abstract dothcontain that large

105
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.230
Which died in Geffrey, andthe hand of time

106
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.300
Shall draw this brief intoas huge a volume.

107
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.770
That Geffrey was thy elderbrother born,

108
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.730
And this his son; Englandwas Geffrey's right

109
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.600
And this is Geffrey's: inthe name of God

110
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.170
How comes it then thatthou art call'd a king,

111
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.070
When living blood doth inthese temples beat,

112
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.670
Which owe the crown thatthou o'ermasterest?

113
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.970
From whom hast thou thisgreat commission, France,

114
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.600
To draw my answer from thyarticles?

115
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.100
From that supernal judge,which stirs good thoughts

116
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.900
In any breast of strongauthority,

117
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.970
To look into the blots andstains of right:

118
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.270
That judge hath made meguardian to this boy:

119
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.400
By whose warrant Iimpeach thy wrong

120
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.900
And by whose help I meanto chastise it.

121
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.900
Alack, thou dost usurpauthority.

122
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.800
Excuse; it is to beatusurping down.

123
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.800
Who is it thou dost callusurper, France?

124
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.630
Let me make answer; thyusurping son.

125
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.770
Out, insolent! thy bastardshall be king,

126
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.670
That thou mayst be a queen,and cheque the world!

127
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.930
My bed was ever to thy son

128
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.030
as true as thine wasto thy husband;

129
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.130
and this boy liker in featureto his father Geffrey

130
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.370
Than thou and John inmanners; being as like

131
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.400
As rain to water, or devilto his dam.

132
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.930
My boy a bastard! By my soul,

133
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.200
I think his father neverwas so true begot:

134
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.430
It cannot be, an if thouwert his mother.

135
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.000
There's a good mother, boy,that blots thy father.

136
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.800
There's a good grandam,boy, that would blot thee.

137
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.470
Peace!

138
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.200
Hear the crier.

139
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.370
What the devil art thou?

140
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.300
One that will play thedevil, sir, with you,

141
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.730
An a' may catch your hideand you alone:

142
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.170
You are the hare of whomthe proverb goes,

143
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.000
Whose valour plucks deadlions by the beard;

144
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.070
I'll smoke your skin-coat,an I catch you right;

145
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.630
Look to't Sirrah;i' faith, I will, i' faith.

146
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.970
O, well did he become thatlion's robe

147
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.500
That did disrobe the lionof that robe!

148
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.870
It lies as sightly on theback of him

149
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.700
As great Alcides' showsupon an ass:

150
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.800
But, ass, I'll take thatburthen from your back,

151
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.930
Or lay on that shall makeyour shoulders crack.

152
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.030
What craker is this samethat deafs our ears

153
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.370
With this abundance ofsuperfluous breath?

154
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.700
Lewis, determine what weshall do straight.

155
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.730
Women and fools, break offyour conference.

156
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.630
King John, this is thevery sum of all;

157
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.330
England and Ireland,Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

158
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.270
In right of Arthur do Iclaim of thee:

159
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.170
Wilt thou resign them andlay down thy arms?

160
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.330
My life as soon: I do defythee, France.

161
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.930
Arthur of Bretagne, yieldthee to my hand;

162
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.870
And out of my dear loveI'll give thee more

163
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.930
Than e'er the coward handof France can win:

164
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.330
Submit thee, boy.

165
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.230
Come to thy grandam,child.

166
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.730
Do, child, go to itgrandam, child:

167
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.400
Give grandam kingdom, andit grandam will

168
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.730
Give it a plum, a cherry,and a fig:

169
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.430
There's a good grandam.

170
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.730
Good my mother, peace!

171
00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.570
I would that I were lowlaid in my grave:

172
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.930
I am not worth this coilthat's made for me.

173
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.330
His mother shames him so,poor boy, he weeps.

174
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.300
Now shame upon you,whether she does or no!

175
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.930
His grandam's wrongs, andnot his mother's shames,

176
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.730

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.070
Shall leave his nativechannel and o'erswell

352
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.200
With course disturb'd eventhy confining shores,

353
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.070
Unless thou let his silverwater keep

354
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.730
A peaceful progress to theocean.

355
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.900
England, thou hast notsaved one drop of blood,

356
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.400
In this hot trial, morethan we of France;

357
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.670
Rather, lost more. And bythis hand I swear,

358
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.470
That sways the earth thisclimate overlooks,

359
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.430
Before we will lay downour just-borne arms,

360
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.030
We'll put thee down, 'gainstwhom these arms we bear,

361
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.700
Or add a royal number tothe dead,

362
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.370
Gracing the scroll thattells of this war's loss

363
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.030
With slaughter coupled tothe name of kings.

364
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:58.200
Ha, majesty! how high thyglory towers,

365
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.070
When the rich blood ofkings is set on fire!

366
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.600
O, now doth Death line hisdead chaps with steel;

367
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600
The swords of soldiers arehis teeth, his fangs;

368
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.770
And now he feasts, mousingthe flesh of men,

369
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.570
In undetermineddifferences of kings.

370
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.270
Why stand these royalfronts amazed thus?

371
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.830
Cry, 'havoc!' kings; backto the stained field,

372
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.570
You equal potents, fierykindled spirits!

373
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.270
Then let confusion of one partconfirm the other's peace:

374
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:28.000
Till then, blows,blood and death!

375
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.630
Whose party do thetownsmen yet admit?

376
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.570
Speak, citizens, forEngland; who's your king?

377
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.830
The king of England; whenwe know the king.

378
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.530
Know him in us, that herehold up his right.

379
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.970
In us, that are our owngreat deputy

380
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.570
And bear possession of ourperson here,

381
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.470
Lord of our presence,Angiers, and of you.

382
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.370
A greater power then wedenies all this;

383
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.930
And till it be undoubted,we do lock

384
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.330
Our former scruple in ourstrong-barr'd gates;

385
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.200
King'd of our fears, untilour fears, resolved,

386
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.130
Be by some certain kingpurged and deposed.

387
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:20.170
By heaven, these scroyles ofAngiers flout you, kings,

388
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.130
And stand securely ontheir battlements,

389
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.700
As in a theatre, whencethey gape and point

390
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.430
At your industrious scenesand acts of death.

391
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.370
Your royal presences beruled by me:

392
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.630
Do like the mutines ofJerusalem,

393
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.370
Be friends awhile and bothconjointly bend

394
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.970
Your sharpest deeds ofmalice against this town:

395
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.870
By east and west letFrance and England mount

396
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.600
Their battering cannoncharged to the mouths,

397
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.000
Till their soul-fearingclamours have brawl'd down

398
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.100
The flinty ribs of thiscontemptuous city:

399
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.930
I'ld play incessantly uponthese jades,

400
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.700
Even till unfenceddesolation

401
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.630
Leave them as naked as thevulgar air.

402
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.170
That done, dissever yourunited strengths,

403
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.230
And part your mingledcolours once again;

404
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.000
Turn face to face andbloody point to point;

405
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.530
Then, in a moment, Fortuneshall cull forth

406
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.770
Out of one side her happyminion,

407
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.600
To whom in favour sheshall give the day,

408
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.100
And kiss him with aglorious victory.

409
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.500
How like you this wildcounsel, mighty states?

410
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.330
Smacks it not something ofthe policy?

411
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.630
Now, by the sky that hangsabove our heads,

412
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.470
I like it well. Say France,shall we knit our powers

413
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.330
And lay this Angiers evento the ground;

414
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:34.570
Then after fight who shallbe king of it?

415
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:39.870
An if thou hast the mettleof a king,

416
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.800
Being wronged as we are bythis peevish town, why then,

417
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.300
Turn thou the mouth of thyartillery,

418
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.000
As we will ours, againstthese saucy walls;

419
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.600
And when that we havedash'd them to the ground,

420
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.370
Why then defy each otherand pell-mell

421
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:55.100
Make work upon ourselves,for heaven or hell.

422
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:05.530
Let it be so. Say, wherewill you assault?

423
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.500
We from the west will senddestruction

424
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.870
Into this city's bosom.

425
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.570
I from the north.

426
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.900
Our thunder from the south

427
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.970
Shall rain their drift ofbullets on this town.

428
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.300
O prudent discipline! Fromnorth to south:

429
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.800
Austria and France shootin each other's mouth:

430
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.070
I'll stir them to it.Come, away, away!

431
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.970
Hear us, great kings:vouchsafe awhile to stay,

432
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.600
And I shall show you peaceand fair-faced league;

433
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.470
Win you this city withoutstroke or wound;

434
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.800
Rescue those breathinglives to die in beds,

435
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.970
That here come sacrificesfor the field:

436
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.070
Persever not, but hear me,mighty kings.

437
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.530
Speak on with favour; weare bent to hear.

438
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.570
That daughter there ofSpain, the Lady Blanch,

439
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.170
Is niece to England: lookupon the years

440
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.600
Of Lewis the Dauphin andthat lovely maid:

441
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.930
If lusty love should go inquest of beauty,

442
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.400
Where should he find itfairer than in Blanch?

443
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.770
If zealous love should goin search of virtue,

444
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.600
Where should he find itpurer than in Blanch?

445
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.670
If love ambitious sought amatch of birth,

446
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.930
Whose veins bound richerblood than Lady Blanch?

447
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.330
Such as she is, in beauty,virtue, birth,

448
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.570
Is the young Dauphin everyway complete:

449
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:26.570
If not complete of, say heis not she;

450
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.430
And she again wantsnothing, to name want,

451
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.670
If want it be not that sheis not he:

452
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.370
He is the half part of ablessed man,

453
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.030
Left to be finished bysuch as she;

454
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.530
And she a fair dividedexcellence,

455
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.570
Whose fulness ofperfection lies in him.

456
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.970
O, two such silvercurrents, when they join,

457
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.500
Do glorify the banks thatbound them in;

458
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.730
And two such shores to twosuch streams made one,

459
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.000
Two such controlling boundsshall you be, kings,

460
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.100
To these two princes, ifyou marry them.

461
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.100
This union shall do morethan battery can

462
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.930
To our fast-closed gates;for at this match,

463
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.100
With swifter spleen thanpowder can enforce,

464
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.570
The mouth of passage shallwe fling wide ope,

465
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:17.300
And give you entrance: butwithout this match,

466
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.900
The sea enraged is nothalf so deaf,

467
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.830
Lions more confident,mountains and rocks

468
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.230
More free from motion, no,not Death himself

469
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.400
In moral fury half soperemptory,

470
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.970
As we to keep this city.

471
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.470
Here's a stay

472
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.470
That shakes the rottencarcass of old Death

473
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:52.100
Out of his rags! Here's alarge mouth, indeed,

474
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.300
That spits forth death andmountains, rocks and seas,

475
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.800
Talks as familiarly ofroaring lions

476
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.530
As maids of thirteen do ofpuppy-dogs!

477
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.700
What cannoneer begot thislusty blood?

478
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.670
He speaks plain cannonfire, and smoke and bounce;

479
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.570
He gives the bastinadowith his tongue:

480
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.430
Our ears are cudgell'd;not a word of his

481
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.900
But buffets better than afist of France:

482
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.200
Zounds! I was never sobethump'd with words

483
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.230
Since I first call'd mybrother's father dad.

484
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.500
Son, list to thisconjunction, make this match;

485
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.400
Give with our niece adowry large enough:

486
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.900
For by this knot thoushalt so surely tie

487
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.930
Thy now unsured assuranceto the crown,

488
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.900
That yon green boy shallhave no sun to ripe

489
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:47.500
The bloom that promiseth amighty fruit.

490
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.170
I see a yielding in thelooks of France;

491
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.000
Mark, how they whisper:urge them while their souls

492
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.570
Are capable of thisambition,

493
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.430
Lest zeal, now melted bythe windy breath

494
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.970
Of soft petitions, pityand remorse,

495
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.730
Cool and congeal again towhat it was.

496
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.330
Why answer not the doublemajesties

497
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.570
This friendly treaty ofour threaten'd town?

498
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.400
Speak England first, thathath been forward first

499
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.200
To speak unto this city:what say you?

500
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.130
If that the Dauphin there,thy princely son,

501
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.430
Can in this book of beautyread 'I love,'

502
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.630
Then Anjou and fairTouraine, Maine, Poictiers,

503
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.530
And all that we upon thisside the sea,

504
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.630
Except this city now by usbesieged,

505
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.030
Find liable to our crownand dignity,

506
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.570
Shall gild her bridal bedand make her rich

507
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.070
In titles, honours andpromotions,

508
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.970
As she in beauty,education, blood,

509
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.930
Holds hand with anyprincess of the world.

510
00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:59.230
What say'st thou, boy?look in the lady's face.

511
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:03.300
I do, my lord; and in hereye I find a wonder,

512
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.770
or a wondrous miracle,

513
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.400
The shadow of myselfform'd in her eye:

514
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.170
Which being but the shadowof your son,

515
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:14.730
Becomes a sun and makesyour son a shadow:

516
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.900
I do protest I never lovedmyself

517
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.930
Till now infixed I beheldmyself

518
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.900
Drawn in the flatteringtable of her eye.

519
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.870
Drawn in the flatteringtable of her eye!

520
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.070
Hang'd in the frowningwrinkle of her brow!

521
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.700
And quarter'd in herheart! he doth espy

522
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.200
Himself love's traitor:this is pity now,

523
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.170
That hang'd and drawn andquartered, there should be

524
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.970
In such a love so vile alout as he.

525
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.570
My uncle's will in thisrespect is mine:

526
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.200
If he see aught in youthat makes him like,

527
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.000
That any thing he sees,which moves his liking,

528
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.330
I can with ease translateit to my will;

529
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.970
Or if you will, to speakmore properly,

530
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.130
I will enforce it easilyto my love.

531
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.130
Further I will not flatteryou, my lord,

532
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.100
That all I see in you isworthy love,

533
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.270
Than this; that nothing doI see in you,

534
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.230
Though churlishthoughts themselves

535
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.270
should be your judge,

536
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.900
That I can find shouldmerit any hate.

537
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:31.470
What say these young ones?What say you my niece?

538
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.130
That she is bound inhonour still to do

539
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.000
What you in wisdom stillvouchsafe to say.

540
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Speak then, prince Dauphin;can'st thou love this lady?

541
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.230
Nay, ask me if I canrefrain from love;

542
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.030
For I do love her mostunfeignedly.

543
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.130
Then do I give Volquessen,Touraine, Maine,

544
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.000
Poictiers and Anjou, thesefive provinces,

545
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
With her to thee; and thisaddition more,

546
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.430
Full thirty thousand marksof English coin.

547
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.130
Philip of France, if thoube pleased withal,

548
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.200
Command thy son anddaughter to join hands.

549
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.530
It likes us well; youngprinces, close your hands.

550
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.000
And your lips too; for Iam well assured

551
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.570
That I did so when I wasfirst assured.

552
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.370
Now, citizens of Angiers,ope your gates,

553
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.970
Let in that amity whichyou have made;

554
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.670
For at Saint Mary's chapelpresently

555
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.100
The rites of marriageshall be solemnized.

556
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.330
Is not the Lady Constancein this troop?

557
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.800
I know she is not, forthis match made up

558
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.970
Her presence would haveinterrupted much:

559
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.870
Where is she and her son?tell me, who knows.

560
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.130
She is sad and passionateat your highness' tent.

561
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.670
And, by my faith, thisleague that we have made

562
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.370
Will give her sadness verylittle cure.

563
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.400
Brother of England, howmay we content

564
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.400
This widow lady? In herright we came;

565
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.070
Which we, God knows, haveturn'd another way,

566
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.230
To our own vantage.

567
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.230
We will heal up all;

568
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.500
For we'll create youngArthur Duke of Bretagne

569
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.430
And Earl of Richmond; andthis rich fair town

570
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.500
We make him lord of. Callthe Lady Constance;

571
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.070
Some speedy messenger bidher repair

572
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.170
To our solemnity: I trustwe shall,

573
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.270
If not fill up the measureof her will,

574
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.400
Yet in some measuresatisfy her so

575
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.270
That we shall stop herexclamation.

576
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.870
Go we, as well as hastewill suffer us,

577
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:36.370
To this unlook'd for,unprepared pomp.

578
00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:04.800
Mad world! mad kings! madcomposition!

579
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.500
John, to stop Arthur'stitle in the whole,

580
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.700
Hath willingly departedwith a part,

581
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.330
And France, whose armourconscience buckled on,

582
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.570
Whom zeal and charitybrought to the field

583
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.830
As God's own soldier,rounded in the ear

584
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.570
With that same purpose-changer,that sly devil,

585
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.600
That broker, that stillbreaks the pate of faith,

586
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.000
That daily break-vow, hethat wins of all,

587
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.030
Of kings, of beggars, oldmen, young men, maids,

588
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.630
Who, having no externalthing to lose

589
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.330
But the word 'maid,' cheatsthe poor maid of that,

590
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:46.530
That smooth-faced gentleman,tickling Commodity,

591
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:52.200
Commodity, the bias of theworld,

592
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.430
The world, who of itselfis balanced well,

593
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.500
Made to run even upon evenground,

594
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.400
Till this advantage, thisvile-drawing bias,

595
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.930
This sway of motion, thisCommodity,

596
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.670
Makes it take head fromall indifferency,

597
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.370
From all direction,purpose, course, intent:

598
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.630
And this same bias, thisCommodity,

599
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.630
This bawd, this broker,this all-changing word,

600
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.600
Clapp'd on the outward eyeof fickle France,

601
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.170
Hath drawn him from hisown determined aid,

602
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.330
From a resolved andhonourable war,

603
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.800
To a most base andvile-concluded peace.

604
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.600
(laughing)

605
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.800
And why rail I on thisCommodity?

606
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.430
But for because he hathnot woo'd me yet:

607
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.100
Not that I have the powerto clutch my hand,

608
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.400
When his fair angels wouldsalute my palm;

609
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.700
But for that my hand, asunattempted yet,

610
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.570
Like a poor beggar,raileth on the rich.

611
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.800
Well, whiles I am abeggar, I will rail

612
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.230
And say there is no sinbut to be rich;

613
00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.530
And being rich, my virtuethen will be

614
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.070
To say there is no vicebut beggary.

615
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:09.500
Since kings break faithupon commodity,

616
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:16.030
Gain, be my lord, for Iwill worship thee.

617
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.730
