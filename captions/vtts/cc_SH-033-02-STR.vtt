00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870


2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.370
Before Tangiers, well met brave Austria

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.100
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.430
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.070
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.100
By this brave duke came early to his grave:

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.570
And for amends to his posterity,

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.600
At our importance hither is he come,

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.530
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,

10
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.470
And to rebuke the usurpation

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.600
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.470
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.870
God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death

14
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.900
The rather that you give his offspring life,

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.970
Shadowing their right under your wings of war:

16
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.370
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,

17
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.230
But with a heart full of unstained love:

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.600
A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?

20
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.730
Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.600
As seal to this indenture of my love,

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500
That to my home I will no more return,

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.930
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,

24
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.770
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,

25
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.330
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides

26
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
And coops from other lands her islanders,

27
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.430
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,

28
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.330
That water-walled bulwark, still secure

29
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.270
And confident from foreign purposes,

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.400
Even till that utmost corner of the west

31
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.200
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,

32
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.330
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.

33
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.730
O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,

34
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.000
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.770
To make a more requital to your love!

36
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.430
The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords

37
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.700
In such a just and charitable war.

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.070
(crowd chants) Arthur! Arthur!

39
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.300
Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent

40
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.500
Against the brows of this resisting town.

41
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.000
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,

42
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.130
To cull the plots of best advantages:

43
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.670
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,

44
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.470
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,

45
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.800
But we will make it subject to this boy.

46
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.830
Stay for an answer to your embassy,

47
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.330
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:

48
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.200
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,

49
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.930
That right in peace which here we urge in war,

50
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.630
And then we shall repent each drop of blood

51
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.670
Which hot rash haste so indirectly shed.

52
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.500
A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,

53
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.070
Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!

54
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.670
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;

55
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.

56
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.330
Then turn your forces from this paltry siege

57
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.230
And stir them up against a mightier task.

58
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.630
England, impatient of your just demands,

59
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.200
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,

60
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.330
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time

61
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.870
To land his legions all as soon as I;

62
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.970
His marches are expedient to this town,

63
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.730
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.

64
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.000
With him along is come the mother-queen,

65
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.030
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;

66
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.030
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;

67
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.300
With them a bastard of the king's deceased,

68
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.500
And all the unsettled humours of the land,

69
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.330
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,

70
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.170
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,

71
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.330
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,

72
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.570
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,

73
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.330
To make hazard of new fortunes here:

74
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.000
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits

75
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.230
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er

76
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.870
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,

77
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.800
To do offence and scath in Christendom.

78
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.670
♪Drum beats

79
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.130
The interruption of their churlish drums

80
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.970
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,

81
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.300
To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.

82
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.230
How much unlook'd for is this expedition!

83
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.930
By how much unexpected, by so much

84
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.600
We must awake endavour for defence;

85
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.570
For courage mounteth with occasion:

86
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.930
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.

87
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.970
Peace be to France, if France in peace permit

88
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.770
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;

89
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.930
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,

90
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.070
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent,

91
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.530
do correct their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.

92
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.370
Peace be to England, if that war return

93
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.470
From France to England, there to live in peace.

94
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.670
England we love; and for that England's sake

95
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.570
With burden of our armour here we sweat.

96
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.330
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;

97
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.270
But thou from loving England art so far,

98
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.470
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king

99
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.600
Cut off the sequence of posterity,

100
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.170
Out-faced infant state and done a rape

101
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.400
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.

102
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.230
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;

103
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.800
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:

104
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.970
This little abstract doth contain that large

105
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.230
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time

106
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.300
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.

107
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.770
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,

108
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.730
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right

109
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.600
And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God

110
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.170
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,

111
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.070
When living blood doth in these temples beat,

112
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.670
Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?

113
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.970
From whom hast thou this great commission, France,

114
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.600
To draw my answer from thy articles?

115
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.100
From that supernal judge, which stirs good thoughts

116
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.900
In any breast of strong authority,

117
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.970
To look into the blots and stains of right:

118
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.270
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:

119
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.400
By whose warrant I impeach thy wrong

120
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.900
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.

121
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.900
Alack, thou dost usurp authority.

122
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.800
Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.

123
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.800
Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?

124
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.630
Let me make answer; thy usurping son.

125
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.770
Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,

126
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.670
That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!

127
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.930
My bed was ever to thy son

128
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.030
as true as thine was to thy husband;

129
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.130
and this boy liker in feature to his father Geffrey

130
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.370
Than thou and John in manners; being as like

131
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.400
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.

132
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.930
My boy a bastard! By my soul,

133
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.200
I think his father never was so true begot:

134
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.430
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.

135
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.000
There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.

136
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.800
There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.

137
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.470
Peace!

138
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.200
Hear the crier.

139
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.370
What the devil art thou?

140
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.300
One that will play the devil, sir, with you,

141
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.730
An a' may catch your hide and you alone:

142
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.170
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,

143
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.000
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;

144
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.070
I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;

145
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.630
Look to't Sirrah; i' faith, I will, i' faith.

146
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.970
O, well did he become that lion's robe

147
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.500
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!

148
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.870
It lies as sightly on the back of him

149
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.700
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:

150
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.800
But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,

151
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.930
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.

152
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:01.030
What craker is this same that deafs our ears

153
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.370
With this abundance of superfluous breath?

154
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.700
Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.

155
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.730
Women and fools, break off your conference.

156
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.630
King John, this is the very sum of all;

157
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.330
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

158
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.270
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:

159
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.170
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?

160
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.330
My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.

161
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.930
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;

162
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.870
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more

163
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.930
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:

164
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.330
Submit thee, boy.

165
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.230
Come to thy grandam, child.

166
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.730
Do, child, go to it grandam, child:

167
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.400
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will

168
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.730
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:

169
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.430
There's a good grandam.

170
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.730
Good my mother, peace!

171
00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.570
I would that I were low laid in my grave:

172
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.930
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.

173
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.330
His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.

174
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.300
Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!

175
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.930
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,

176
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.730
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,

177
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.030
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;

178
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.070
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed

179
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.770
To do him justice and revenge on you.

180
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.630
Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!

181
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:34.470
Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!

182
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.870
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp the dominations,

183
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.770
royalties and rights of this oppressed boy:

184
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.000
this is thy eld'st son's son,

185
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.830
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:

186
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.100
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;

187
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.370
The canon of the law is laid on him,

188
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.370
Being but the second generation

189
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.970
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.

190
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.370
Bedlam, have done.

191
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.470
I have but this to say,

192
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.000
That he is not only plagued for her sin,

193
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.400
But God hath made her sin and her the plague

194
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.730
On this removed issue, plague for her

195
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.330
And with her plague; her sin his injury,

196
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
Her injury the beadle to her sin,

197
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.730
All punish'd in the person of this child,

198
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.100
And all for her; a plague upon her!

199
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.430
Thou unadvised scold, I can produce a will

200
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.700
that bars the title of thy son.

201
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:40.130
Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:

202
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.700
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!

203
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.170
Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:

204
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.400
It ill beseems this presence

205
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.230
to cry aim to these ill-tuned repetitions.

206
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.930
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls

207
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.770
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak

208
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.870
Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.

♪Trumpet sounds.

210
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.270
Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?

211
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.830
'Tis France, for England.

212
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.930
England, for itself.

213
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.400
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--

214
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.200
You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,

215
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.030
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--

216
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:27.730
For our advantage; therefore hear us first.

217
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.200
These flags of France, that are advanced here

218
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.400
Before the eye and prospect of your town,

219
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.470
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:

220
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.600
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,

221
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.400
And ready mounted are they to spit forth

222
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.870
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:

223
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.900
All preparation for a bloody siege

224
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.730
All merciless proceeding by these French

225
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.900
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;

226
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:56.330
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,

227
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.730
That as a waist doth girdle you about,

228
00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.230
By the compulsion of their ordinance

229
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.270
By this time from their fixed beds of lime

230
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.300
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made

231
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.970
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.

232
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.970
But on the sight of us your lawful king,

233
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.600
Who painfully with much expedient march

234
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.000
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,

235
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.670
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,

236
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:28.130
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;

237
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.500
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,

238
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.300
To make a shaking fever in your walls,

239
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.230
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,

240
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.800
To make a faithless error in your ears:

241
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.900
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,

242
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:47.470
And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,

243
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.370
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,

244
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.800
Crave harbourage within your city walls.

245
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.400
When I have said, make answer to us both.

246
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.500
Lo, in this right hand, whose protection

247
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.330
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right

248
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.400
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,

249
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.130
Son to the elder brother of this man,

250
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.330
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:

251
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.970
For this down-trodden equity, we tread

252
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.100
In warlike march these greens before your town,

253
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.970
Being no further enemy to you

254
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.970
than the constraint of hospitable zeal

255
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.100
In the relief of this oppressed child

256
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.200
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then to pay that duty

257
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.300
which you truly owe

258
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:42.230
To him that owes it, namely this young prince:

259
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.100
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,

260
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.200
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;

261
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.900
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent

262
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.400
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;

263
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,

264
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.700
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,

265
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.330
We will bear home that lusty blood again

266
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.700
Which here we came to spout against your town,

267
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.000
And leave your children, wives and you in peace.

268
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:18.430
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,

269
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.830
'Tis not the roundure of

270
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:25.230
your old-faced walls can hide you from our messengers of war,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.930
Though all these English and their discipline

272
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.100
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.

273
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.700
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,

274
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.770
In that behalf which we have challenged it?

275
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.670
Or shall we give the signal to our rage

276
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:46.500
And stalk in blood to our possession?

277
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.800
In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:

278
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.430
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.

279
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.770
Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.

280
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.600
That can we not; but he that proves the king,

281
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.500
To him will we prove loyal: till that time

282
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.870
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.

283
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.070
Doth not the crown of England prove the king?

284
00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.630
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,

285
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.530
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--

286
00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:14.400
Bastards, and else.

287
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.900
To verify our title with their lives.

288
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.630
As many and as well-born bloods as these,--

289
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.370
Some bastards too.

290
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.030
Stand in his face to contradict his claim.

291
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.300
Till you compound whose right is worthiest,

292
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.830
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.

293
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.170
Then God forgive the sin of all those souls

294

That to their everlasting residence,

Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,

At your den, sirrah, with your lioness

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.200
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,

353
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:17.070
Unless thou let his silver water keep

354
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.730
A peaceful progress to the ocean.

355
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.900
England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,

356
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.400
In this hot trial, more than we of France;

357
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.670
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,

358
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.470
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,

359
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.430
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,

360
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.030
We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,

361
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.700
Or add a royal number to the dead,

362
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.370
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss

363
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.030
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.

364
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:58.200
Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,

365
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.070
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!

366
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.600
O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;

367
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;

368
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.770
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,

369
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.570
In undetermined differences of kings.

370
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.270
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?

371
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.830
Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,

372
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.570
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!

373
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.270
Then let confusion of one part confirm the other's peace:

374
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:28.000
Till then, blows, blood and death!

375
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.630
Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?

376
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.570
Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?

377
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:40.830
The king of England; when we know the king.

378
00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.530
Know him in us, that here hold up his right.

379
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.970
In us, that are our own great deputy

380
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.570
And bear possession of our person here,

381
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.470
Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.

382
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.370
A greater power then we denies all this;

383
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.930
And till it be undoubted, we do lock

384
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.330
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;

385
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.200
King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,

386
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:14.130
Be by some certain king purged and deposed.

387
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:20.170
By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,

388
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.130
And stand securely on their battlements,

389
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.700
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point

390
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.430
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.

391
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.370
Your royal presences be ruled by me:

392
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:35.630
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,

393
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.370
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend

394
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.970
Your sharpest deeds of malice against this town:

395
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.870
By east and west let France and England mount

396
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.600
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,

397
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.000
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down

398
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.100
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:

399
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.930
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,

400
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.700
Even till unfenced desolation

401
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.630
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.

402
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.170
That done, dissever your united strengths,

403
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.230
And part your mingled colours once again;

404
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.000
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;

405
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.530
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth

406
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.770
Out of one side her happy minion,

407
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:11.600
To whom in favour she shall give the day,

408
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.100
And kiss him with a glorious victory.

409
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.500
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?

410
00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.330
Smacks it not something of the policy?

411
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:21.630
Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,

412
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.470
I like it well. Say France, shall we knit our powers

413
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.330
And lay this Angiers even to the ground;

414
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:34.570
Then after fight who shall be king of it?

415
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:39.870
An if thou hast the mettle of a king,

416
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.800
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town, why then,

417
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.300
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,

418
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.000
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;

419
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.600
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,

420
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.370
Why then defy each other and pell-mell

421
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:55.100
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.

422
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:05.530
Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?

423
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.500
We from the west will send destruction

424
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.870
Into this city's bosom.

425
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.570
I from the north.

426
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.900
Our thunder from the south

427
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.970
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.

428
00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.300
O prudent discipline! From north to south:

429
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.800
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:

430
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.070
I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!

431
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.970
Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,

432
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.600
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;

433
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.470
Win you this city without stroke or wound;

434
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:37.800
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,

435
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.970
That here come sacrifices for the field:

436
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.070
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.

437
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:48.530
Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.

438
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.570
That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,

439
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.170
Is niece to England: look upon the years

440
00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.600
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:

441
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.930
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,

442
00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.400
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?

443
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.770
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,

444
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.600
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?

445
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.670
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,

446
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.930
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?

447
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.330
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,

448
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.570
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:

449
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:26.570
If not complete of, say he is not she;

450
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.430
And she again wants nothing, to name want,

451
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.670
If want it be not that she is not he:

452
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:35.370
He is the half part of a blessed man,

453
00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.030
Left to be finished by such as she;

454
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.530
And she a fair divided excellence,

455
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.570
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.

456
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.970
O, two such silver currents, when they join,

457
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.500
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;

458
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.730
And two such shores to two such streams made one,

459
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.000
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,

460
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.100
To these two princes, if you marry them.

461
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:02.100
This union shall do more than battery can

462
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.930
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,

463
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:09.100
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,

464
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.570
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,

465
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:17.300
And give you entrance: but without this match,

466
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.900
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,

467
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.830
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks

468
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.230
More free from motion, no, not Death himself

469
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.400
In moral fury half so peremptory,

470
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.970
As we to keep this city.

471
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.470
Here's a stay

472
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.470
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death

473
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:52.100
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,

474
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.300
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,

475
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.800
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions

476
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.530
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!

477
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.700
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?

478
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.670
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;

479
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.570
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:

480
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.430
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his

481
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.900
But buffets better than a fist of France:

482
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.200
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words

483
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.230
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.

484
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.500
Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;

485
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.400
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:

486
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.900
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie

487
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.930
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,

488
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.900
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe

489
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:47.500
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.

490
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.170
I see a yielding in the looks of France;

491
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.000
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls

492
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.570
Are capable of this ambition,

493
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.430
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath

494
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.970
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,

495
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.730
Cool and congeal again to what it was.

496
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.330
Why answer not the double majesties

497
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.570
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?

498
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.400
Speak England first, that hath been forward first

499
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:22.200
To speak unto this city: what say you?

500
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.130
If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,

501
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.430
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'

502
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.630
Then Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,

503
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.530
And all that we upon this side the sea,

504
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.630
Except this city now by us besieged,

505
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.030
Find liable to our crown and dignity,

506
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.570
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich

507
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.070
In titles, honours and promotions,

508
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.970
As she in beauty, education, blood,

509
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.930
Holds hand with any princess of the world.

510
00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:59.230
What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.

511
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:03.300
I do, my lord; and in her eye I find a wonder,

512
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.770
or a wondrous miracle,

513
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.400
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:

514
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.170
Which being but the shadow of your son,

515
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:14.730
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:

516
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.900
I do protest I never loved myself

517
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.930
Till now infixed I beheld myself

518
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.900
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.

519
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.870
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!

520
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:34.070
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!

521
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.700
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy

522
00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.200
Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,

523
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.170
That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be

524
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:49.970
In such a love so vile a lout as he.

525
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.570
My uncle's will in this respect is mine:

526
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.200
If he see aught in you that makes him like,

527
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.000
That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,

528
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.330
I can with ease translate it to my will;

529
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.970
Or if you will, to speak more properly,

530
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:09.130
I will enforce it easily to my love.

531
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.130
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,

532
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.100
That all I see in you is worthy love,

533
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.270
Than this; that nothing do I see in you,

534
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.230
Though churlish thoughts themselves

535
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.270
should be your judge,

536
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.900
That I can find should merit any hate.

537
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:31.470
What say these young ones? What say you my niece?

538
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.130
That she is bound in honour still to do

539
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:37.000
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.

540
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Speak then, prince Dauphin; can'st thou love this lady?

541
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.230
Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;

542
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.030
For I do love her most unfeignedly.

543
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.130
Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,

544
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.000
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,

545
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
With her to thee; and this addition more,

546
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.430
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.

547
00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.130
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,

548
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:06.200
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.

549
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:10.530
It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.

550
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.000
And your lips too; for I am well assured

551
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.570
That I did so when I was first assured.

552
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.370
Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,

553
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.970
Let in that amity which you have made;

554
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.670
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently

555
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.100
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.

556
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.330
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?

557
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.800
I know she is not, for this match made up

558
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.970
Her presence would have interrupted much:

559
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.870
Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.

560
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:48.130
She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.

561
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.670
And, by my faith, this league that we have made

562
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.370
Will give her sadness very little cure.

563
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:58.400
Brother of England, how may we content

564
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.400
This widow lady? In her right we came;

565
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.070
Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,

566
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.230
To our own vantage.

567
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:08.230
We will heal up all;

568
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.500
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne

569
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:15.430
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town

570
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.500
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;

571
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.070
Some speedy messenger bid her repair

572
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.170
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,

573
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.270
If not fill up the measure of her will,

574
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.400
Yet in some measure satisfy her so

575
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.270
That we shall stop her exclamation.

576
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.870
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,

577
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:36.370
To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.

578
00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:04.800
Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!

579
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.500
John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,

580
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.700
Hath willingly departed with a part,

581
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.330
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,

582
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.570
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field

583
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.830
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear

584
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:23.570
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,

585
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.600
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,

586
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.000
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,

587
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.030
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,

588
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.630
Who, having no external thing to lose

589
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.330
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,

590
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:46.530
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,

591
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:52.200
Commodity, the bias of the world,

592
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.430
The world, who of itself is balanced well,

593
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.500
Made to run even upon even ground,

594
00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.400
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,

595
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.930
This sway of motion, this Commodity,

596
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.670
Makes it take head from all indifferency,

597
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:09.370
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:

598
00:33:09.370 --> 00:33:11.630
And this same bias, this Commodity,

599
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.630
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,

600
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:16.600
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,

601
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.170
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,

602
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.330
From a resolved and honourable war,

603
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.800
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.

604
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.600
(laughing)

605
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.800
And why rail I on this Commodity?

606
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.430
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:

607
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.100
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,

608
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.400
When his fair angels would salute my palm;

609
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:43.700
But for that my hand, as unattempted yet,

610
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.570
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.

611
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.800
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail

612
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.230
And say there is no sin but to be rich;

613
00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.530
And being rich, my virtue then will be

614
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.070
To say there is no vice but beggary.

615
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:09.500
Since kings break faith upon commodity,

616
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:16.030
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

617
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.730
