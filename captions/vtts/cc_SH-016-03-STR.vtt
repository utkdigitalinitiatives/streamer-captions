00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730


2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.030
I have sent you a daughter-in-law:

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:10.270
she hath recovered the king, and undone me.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.500
I have wedded her, not bedded her;

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.330
and sworn to make the 'not' eternal.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.830
You shall hear I am run away:

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.030
know it before the report come.

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.030
If there be breadth enough in the world,

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.200
I will hold a long distance.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.200
My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram.

11
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.030
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.970
To fly the favours of so good a king;

13
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.770
To pluck his indignation on thy head

14
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.330
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.530
For the contempt of empire.

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830
O madam, yonder is heavy news within

17
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.770
between two soldiers and my young lady!

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.900
What is the matter?

19
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.530
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort;

20
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.530
your son will not be killed

21
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.230
so soon as I thought he would.

22
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.530
Why should he be killed?

23
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.100
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:

24
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.070
the danger is in standing to't;

25
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.630
that's the loss of men,

26
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.630
though it be the getting of children.

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.170
Here they come will tell you more:

28
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.800
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300
Do not say so.

30
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.100
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,

31
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.030
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,

32
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.230
That the first face of neither, on the start,

33
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.630
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

34
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.270
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:

35
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.400
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.730
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,

37
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.970
Thither we bend again.

38
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.570
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

39
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.070
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger

40
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.900
which never shall come off,

41
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.630
and show me a child begotten

42
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.970
of thy body that I am father to,

43
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.870
then call me husband:

44
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.530
but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'

45
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.570
This is a dreadful sentence.

46
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.770
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

47
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.830
Ay, madam;

48
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.400
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.

49
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.530
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;

50
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.770
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,

51
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.900
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;

52
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.230
But I do wash his name out of my blood,

53
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.630
And thou art all my child.

54
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.700
Towards Florence is he?

55
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.930
Ay, madam.

56
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.930
And to be a soldier?

57
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.170
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,

58
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.700
The duke will lay upon him all the honour

59
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.230
That good convenience claims.

60
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.300
Return you thither?

61
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.970
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

62
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.970
Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.

63
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.300
'Tis bitter.

64
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.470
Find you that there?

65
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.430
Ay, madam.

66
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.270
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply,

67
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.070
which his heart was not consenting to.

68
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.070
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!

69
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.500
There's nothing here that is too good for him

70
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.700
But only she; and she deserves a lord

71
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.800
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon

72
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.630
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

73
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.000
A servant only, and a gentleman

74
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Which I have sometime known.

75
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.730
Parolles, was it not?

76
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.230
Ay, my good lady, he.

77
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.830
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.

78
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.070
My son corrupts a well-derived nature

79
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.000
With his inducement.

80
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.970
Indeed, good lady,

81
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.630
The fellow has a deal of that too much,

82
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.170
Which holds him much to have.

83
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.300
You're welcome, gentlemen.

84
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.700
I will entreat you, when you see my son,

85
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.970
To tell him that his sword can never win

86
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.770
The honour that he loses:

87
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.030
more I'll entreat you written to bear along.

88
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.470
We serve you, madam

89
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.230
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'

90
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.900
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!

91
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.730
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;

92
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.930
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I

93
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.100
That chase thee from thy country and expose

94
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.200
Those tender limbs of thine to the event

95
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.330
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I

96
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.530
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou

97
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.770
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark

98
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.430
Of smoky muskets?

99
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.200
O you leaden messengers,

100
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.870
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,

101
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.200
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,

102
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.700
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.

103
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.300
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;

104
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.070
Whoever charges on his forward breast,

105
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.400
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;

106
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.270
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause

107
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.730
His death was so effected: better 'twere

108
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.530
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd

109
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.500
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere

110
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.830
That all the miseries which nature owes

111
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.830
Were mine at once.

112
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.470
No, come thou home, Rousillon,

113
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.670
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,

114
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.930
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;

115
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.830
My being here it is that holds thee hence:

116
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:57.670
Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although

117
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.270
The air of paradise did fan the house

118
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.270
And angels officed all: I will be gone,

119
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.970
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,

120
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.630
To consolate thine ear.

121
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.030
Come, night; end, day!

122
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:25.130
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

123
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.700
Alas! and would you take the letter from her?

124
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.670
Might you not know she would do as she has done,

125
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.170
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

126
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.900
I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:

127
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.500
Ambitious love hath so in me offended,

128
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.670
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,

129
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.370
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.

130
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.100
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war

131
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.870
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:

132
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.500
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far

133
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.970
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:

134
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.930
He is too good and fair for death and me:

135
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.400
Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

136
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.870
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!

137
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.030
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,

138
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.370
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,

139
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.230
I could have well diverted her intents,

140
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.770
Which thus she hath prevented.

141
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.230
Pardon me, madam:

142
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.030
If I had given you this at over-night,

143
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.230
She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,

144
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.730
Pursuit would be but vain.

145
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.300
What angel shall

146
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.470
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,

147
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.730
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear

148
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.500
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath

149
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.430
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,

150
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.970
To this unworthy husband of his wife;

151
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.530
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth

152
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.870
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.

153
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.600
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.

154
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.830
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:

155
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.470
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,

156
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.800
He will return; and hope I may that she,

157
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.030
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,

158
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:26.330
Led hither by pure love: which of them both

159
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.270
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense

160
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.170
To make distinction: provide this messenger:

161
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.470
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;

162
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.470
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

163
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.700
They say the French count has done most honourable service.

164
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.800
It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander;

165
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.230
and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother.

166
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.930
Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl:

167
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.900
the honour of a maid is her name;

168
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.900
and no legacy is so rich as honesty.

169
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.670
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited

170
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.600
by a gentleman his companion.

171
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.770
I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles:

172
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.030
a filthy officer he is in those suggestions

173
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.900
for the young earl.

174
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.770
Beware of them, Diana; their promises,

175
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.330
enticements, oaths, tokens,

176
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.300
and all these engines of lust,

177
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.730
are not the things they go under:

178
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.700
many a maid hath been seduced by them;

179
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.930
and the misery is,

180
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.730
example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood,

181
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.770
cannot for all that dissuade succession,

182
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.900
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them.

183
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.770
I hope I need not to advise you further;

184
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.930
but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,

185
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.230
though there were no further danger known

186
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.470
but the modesty which is so lost.

187
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.700
You shall not need to fear me.

188
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.070
I hope so.

189
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.430
Look, here comes a pilgrim:

190
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.770
God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

191
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.000
To Saint Jaques le Grand.

192
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.730
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

193
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.030
At the Saint Francis here

194
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.700
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,

195
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.070
But till the troops come by,

196
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.270
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;

197
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.730
The rather, for I think I know your hostess

198
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.500
As ample as myself.

199
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.470
Is it yourself?

200
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.830
If you shall please so, pilgrim.

201
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.770
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

202
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.370
You came, I think, from France?

203
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.900
I did so.

204
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.800
Here you shall see a countryman of yours

205
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.830
That has done worthy service.

206
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.770
His name, I pray you.

207
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:12.830
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

208
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.100
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:

209
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.370
His face I know not.

210
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.370
Whatsome'er he is,

211
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.300
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,

212
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.100
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him

213
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.700
Against his liking: think you it is so?

214
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.070
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

215
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:30.770
There is a gentleman that serves the count

216
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.730
Reports but coarsely of her.

217
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.670
What's his name?

218
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.970
Monsieur Parolles.

219
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.500
O, I believe with him,

220
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.230
In argument of praise, or to the worth

221
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.970
Of the great count himself, she is too mean

222
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.930
To have her name repeated: all her deserving

223
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:46.800
Is a reserved honesty, and that

224
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.700
I have not heard examined.

225
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.570
Alas, poor lady!

226
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.270
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife

227
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.670
of a detesting lord.

228
00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.330
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,

229
00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.730
Her heart weighs sadly:

230
00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.300
this young maid might do her a shrewd turn,

231
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.970
if she so chose.

232
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.270
How do you mean?

233
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.030
May be the amorous count solicits her

234
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.700
In the unlawful purpose.

235
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.400
He does indeed;

236
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.800
And brokes with all that can in such a suit

237
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.030
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:

238
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.570
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard

239
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.100
In honestest defence.

240
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.530
The gods forbid else!

241
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.730
So, now they come:

242
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.170
That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;

243
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.530
That, Escalus.

244
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.900
Which is the Frenchman?

245
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.830
He; That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.

246
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.200
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester

247
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.270
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

248
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.730
I like him well.

249
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.400
'Tis pity he is not honest:

250
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.600
yond's that same knave

251
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.330
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,

252
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.200
I would Poison that vile rascal.

253
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.030
Which is he?

254
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:17.030
That jack-an-apes with scarfs:

255
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.400
why is he melancholy?

256
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.030
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

257
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.570
Lose our drum! well.

258
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.700
He's shrewdly vexed at something:

259
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.530
look, he has spied us.

260
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:30.330
Marry, hang you!

261
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.170
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

262
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.730
The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you

263
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.800
Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents

264
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.100
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,

265
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.100
Already at my house.

266
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.800
I humbly thank you:

267
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.900
Please it this matron and this gentle maid

268
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.300
To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking

269
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.600
Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,

270
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.030
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin

271
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.330
Worthy the note.

272
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.570
We'll take your offer kindly.

273
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.030
Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.

274
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.730
If your lordship find him not a hilding,

275
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.770
hold me no more in your respect.

276
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.170
On my life, my lord, a bubble.

277
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.530
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

278
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.200
Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,

279
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.070
without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman,

280
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.930
he's a most notable coward,

281
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.870
an infinite and endless liar,

282
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.370
an hourly promise-breaker,

283
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.030
the owner of no one good quality

284
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.970
worthy your lordship's entertainment.

285
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.400
It were fit you knew him;

286
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.800
lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not,

287
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.670
he might at some great and trusty business

288
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.830
in a main danger fail you.

289
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.770
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

290
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.570
None better than to let him fetch off his drum,

291
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.000
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.

292
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.070
I, with a troop of Florentines,

293
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.670
will suddenly surprise him;

294
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.100
such I will have, whom I am sure

295
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.130
he knows not from the enemy:

296
00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.970
we will bind and hoodwink him

297
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.830
so, that he shall suppose no other but that

298
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.400
he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries,

299
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.400
when we bring him to our own tents.

300
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.700
Be but your lordship present at his examination:

301
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.200
if he do not, for the promise of his life

302
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.130
and in the highest compulsion of base fear,

303
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.470
offer to betray you

304
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.670
and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you,

305
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.630
and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath,

306
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.630
never trust my judgment in any thing.

307
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.970
O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;

308
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.400
he says he has a stratagem for't:

309
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.870
when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't,

310
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.970
and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore

311
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:40.970
will be melted,

312
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.830
if you give him not John Drum's entertainment,

313
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.330
your inclining cannot be removed.

314
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.270
Here he comes.

315
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:48.570
O, for the love of laughter,

316
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.370
hinder not the honour of his design:

317
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.900
let him fetch off his drum in any hand.

318
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.570
How now, monsieur!

319
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.270
this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.

320
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.170
A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

321
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.430
'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!

322
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.930
There was excellent command,

323
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.330
to charge in with our horse upon our own wings,

324
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.300
and to rend our own soldiers!

325
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.470
That was not to be blamed in the command of the service:

326
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.000
it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself

327
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.300
could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.

328
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.730
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success:

329
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.770
some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum;

330
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.100
but it is not to be recovered.

331
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.330
It might have been recovered.

332
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:50.700
It might; but it is not now.

333
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.770
It is to be recovered:

334
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.170
but that the merit of service is seldom attributed

335
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.470
to the true and exact performer,

336
00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.700
I would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'

337
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.400
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur:

338
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.100
if you think your mystery in stratagem

339
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.130
can bring this instrument of honour again

340
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.970
into his native quarter,

341
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.970
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on;

342
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.570
I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit:

343
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.830
if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it

344
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:25.200
and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,

345
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.530
even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.

346
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.370
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

347
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.500
But you must not now slumber in it.

348
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.370
I'll about it this evening:

349
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.470
and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,

350
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.170
encourage myself in my certainty,

351
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.930
put myself into my mortal preparation;

352
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.430
and by midnight look to hear further from me.

353
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.570
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

354
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.670
I know not what the success will be, my lord;

355
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.870
but the attempt I vow.

356
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.770
I know thou'rt valiant;

357
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.200
and, to the possibility of thy soldiership,

358
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.230
will subscribe for thee.

359
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.470
Farewell.

360
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.000
I love not many words.

361
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.470
No more than a fish loves water.

362
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.870
Is not this a strange fellow, my lord,

363
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.670
that so confidently seems to undertake this business,

364
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.470
which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do

365
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.330
and dares better be damned than to do't?

366
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.500
You do not know him, my lord, as we do:

367
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:26.030
certain it is that he will steal himself

368
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:27.330
into a man's favour

369
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.230
and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries;

370
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.870
but when you find him out, you have him ever after.

371
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.770
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all

372
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.070
of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

373
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.700
None in the world; but return with an invention

374
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.970
and clap upon you two or three probable lies:

375
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.570
but we have almost embossed him;

376
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.830
you shall see his fall to-night;

377
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.300
for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

378
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.930
We'll make you some sport with the fox

379
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.230
ere we case him.

380
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.670
He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:

381
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.570
when his disguise and he is parted,

382
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.230
you tell me what a sprat you shall find him;

383
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.170
which you shall see this very night.

384
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.470
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

385
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.000
Your brother he shall go along with me.

386
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.170
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

387
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:20.000
Now will I lead you to the house,

388
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.330
and show you The lass I spoke of.

389
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:23.970
But you say she's honest.

390
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.130
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once

391
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.230
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,

392
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.570
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,

393
00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.230
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;

394
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.630
And this is all I have done.

395
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.200
She's a fair creature:

396
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.700
Will you go see her?

397
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.430
With all my heart, my lord.

398
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.570
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,

399
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.600
I know not how I shall assure you further,

400
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.500
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

401
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.000
Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,

402
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.770
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;

403
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.270
And would not put my reputation now

404
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.400
In any staining act.

405
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.900
Nor would I wish you.

406
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.930
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,

407
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.870
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken

408
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.970
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,

409
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:23.030
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,

410
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.700
Err in bestowing it.

411
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.430
I should believe you:

412
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.570
For you have show'd me that which well approves

413
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.600
You're great in fortune.

414
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:37.070
Take this purse of gold,

415
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.000
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,

416
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.030
Which I will over-pay and pay again

417
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:43.030
when I have found it.

418
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:49.030
The count he wooes your daughter,

419
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.770
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,

420
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.830
Resolved to carry her:

421
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.330
let her in fine consent,

422
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.330
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.

423
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.030
Now his important blood will nought deny

424
00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.030
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,

425
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.870
That downward hath succeeded in his house

426
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.230
From son to son, some four or five descents

427
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.470
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds

428
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.430
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,

429
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.530
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,

430
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.200
Howe'er repented after.

431
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.100
Now I see

432
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.770
The bottom of your purpose.

433
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:28.800
You see it lawful, then: it is no more,

434
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.200
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,

435
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.570
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;

436
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.770
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,

437
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.100
Herself most chastely absent:

438
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.630
after this,

439
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.300
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns

440
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.700
To what is passed already.

441
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.070
I have yielded:

442
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.830
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,

443
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:13.000
That time and place with this deceit so lawful

444
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.330
May prove coherent. Every night he comes

445
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:20.100
With musics of all sorts and songs composed

446
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.070
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us

447
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.100
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists

448
00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.200
As if his life lay on't.

449
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.430
Why then to-night

450
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.870
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,

451
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.030
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed

452
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.000
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,

453
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:

454
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.770
But let's about it.

455
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.900


456
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.900
