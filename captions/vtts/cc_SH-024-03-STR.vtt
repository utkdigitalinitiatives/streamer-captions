00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500


2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.330
Here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehersal.

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.930
And we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.030
Peter Quince.

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.530
What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.970
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.230
that will never please.

8
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.830
First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself,

9
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.300
which the ladies cannot abide.

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.570
How answer you that?

11
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.870
By'r lakin, a parlous fear.

12
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.470
I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.

13
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.430
Not a whit. I have a device to make all well.

14
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.030
Write me a prologue.

15
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.500
Let the prologue seem to say

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.430
that we will do no harm with our swords

17
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.270
and that Pyramus is not killed indeed.

18
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.870
And for the more better assurance,

19
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.000
tell them that I, Pyramus, am not Pyramus,

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.430
but Bottom the weaver.

21
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.830
This will put them out of fear.

22
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.500
Well, we will have such a prologue,

23
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.370
and it shall be written in eight and six.

24
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.630
No, let it be two more.

25
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.300
Let it be written in eight and eight.

26
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.270
Will the ladies not be afeard of the lion?

27
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.530
I fear it, I promise you.

28
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.870
Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves.

29
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.300
To bring in-- God shield us--

30
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.370
a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing,

31
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.370
for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living.

32
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.830
And we ought to look to it.

33
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.570
Therefore, another prologue should tell it that he's not a lion.

34
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.200
Nay, you must name his name.

35
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.700
And half his face must be seen through the lion's neck.

36
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.270
And he himself must speak through

37
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.200
saying thus, or to the same defect,

38
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500
"Ladies,"--or "Fair ladies"--

39
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.070
"I would wish you,"-- or "I would request you"--

40
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.330
or "I would--

41
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.430
Entreat you.

42
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.000
"I would entreat you not to fear,

43
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.600
"not to tremble my life for yours.

44
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.370
"If you think I come hither as a lion, "it were pity of my life.

45
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.800
"No, I am no such thing.

46
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.230
I am a man as other men are."

47
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.000
And there indeed let him name his name

48
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.770
and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

49
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.600
Well, it shall be so.

50
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.130
But there is two hard things.

51
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.970
That is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,

52
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.330
for Pyramus and Thisbe you know meet by moonlight.

53
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.030
Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?

54
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.900
A calendar, a calendar.

55
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100
Look in the almanac.

56
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.200
Find out moonshine.

57
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.600
Yes, it doth shine that night.

58
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.270
Why, then, may you leave a casement

59
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.570
of the great chamber window, where we play, open,

60
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.570
and the moon may shine in at the casement.

61
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.830
Ay, or else one must come in

62
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.770
with a bush of thorns and a lantern,

63
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.870
and say he comes to disfigure, or to present,

64
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.070
the person of moonshine.

65
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.000
And there is another thing.

66
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.870
We must have a wall in the great chamber,

67
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.530
for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,

68
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.430
did talk through the chink of a wall.

69
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.200
You can never bring in a wall.

70
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.930
What say you, Bottom?

71
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.470
Some man or other must present wall,

72
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.430
and let him have some plaster or some loam

73
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.930
or some rough-cast about him to signify wall.

74
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.670
And let him hold his fingers thus,

75
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.330
and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.

76
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.000
If that may be, then all is well.

77
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.800
Come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.

78
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.370
Now, Pyramus, you begin.

79
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.930
When you have spoken your speech,

80
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.630
enter into that brake,

81
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.130
and so every one according to his cue.

82
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.300
What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here

83
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.530
so near the cradle of the fairy queen?

84
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.100
What, a play toward.

85
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.800
I'll be an auditor, an actor too, perhaps,

86
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.130
if I see cause.

87
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.830
Speak, Pyramus.

88
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.430
Thisbe, stand forth.

89
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.130
Thisbe, the flowers of odious savours sweet--

90
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.330
Odious--Odorous!

91
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.100
Odorous savors sweet,

92
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.930
so hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.

93
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.470
But hark, a voice.

94
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.330
Stay thou but here awhile,

95
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.400
and by and by I will to thee appear.

96
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.930
A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.

97
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.530
Must I speak now?

98
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.170
Ay, marry, must you, for you must understand

99
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.930
he goes but to see a noise that he heard

100
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.430
and is to come again.

101
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.100
Oh, most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,

102
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.670
of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,

103
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.970
most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,

104
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.570
as true as truest horse that yet would never tire,

105
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.030
I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.

106
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.000
"Ninus' tomb," man.

107
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Why, you mustn't speak that yet, that you answer to Pyramus.

108
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.300
You speak all your part at once, cues and all.

109
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.630
Pyramus, enter.

110
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.830
Your cue is past.

111
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.070
It is, "never tire."

112
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.230
Oh, as true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.

113
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.570
If I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.

114
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.430
Oh, monstrous.

115
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.800
Oh, strange.

116
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.130
We are haunted.

117
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.270
Pray, masters.

118
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.530
Fly, masters!

119
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.630
Help!

120
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.770
I'll follow you. I'll lead you about, around,

121
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.470
through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier.

122
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.500
Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,

123
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.930
a hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire

124
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.470
and neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,

125
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.330
like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.

126
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.430
I see their knavery.

127
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.700
This is to make an ass of me, to fright me if they could.

128
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.630
But I will not stir from this place, do what they can.

129
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.930
I will walk up and down here, and I will sing,

130
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.830
that they shall hear I am not afraid.

131
00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.630
The ousel cock so black of hue with orange-tawny bill.

132
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.630
The throstle with his note so true.

133
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.370
The wren with little quill--

134
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.370
The finch, the sparrow and the lark.

135
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.700
What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?

136
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.370
A plain-song cuckoo gray,

137
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.930
whose note full many a man doth mark,

138
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.000
and dares not answer nay.

139
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.500
For, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird?

140
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.670
Who would give a bird the lie, though it cry "cuckoo" never so?

141
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.130
I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.

142
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.570
Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note.

143
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.830
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape.

144
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.970
And thy fair virtue's force

145
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.930
perforce doth move me on the first view

146
00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.200
to say, to swear,

147
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.430
I love thee.

148
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.570
Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that.

149
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.970
And yet, to say the truth,

150
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.570
reason and love keep little company together nowadays.

151
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.700
The more the pity that some honest neighbours

152
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.870
will not make them friends.

153
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.530
Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

154
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:23.300
Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

155
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.830
Not so, neither,

156
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.130
but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood,

157
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.100
I have enough to serve mine own turn.

158
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.770
Out of this wood do not desire to go.

159
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.070
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.

160
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.900
I am a spirit of no common rate.

161
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.970
The summer still doth tend upon my state.

162
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.000
And I do love thee.

163
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.730
Therefore, go with me.

164
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.900
I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,

165
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.030
and they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep

166
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:54.900
and sing whilst thou on pressed flowers dost sleep.

167
00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.970
And I will purge thy mortal grossness

168
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.500
so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

169
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.000
Peaseblossom, Cobweb,

170
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.670
Moth, and Mustardseed.

171
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.770
- Ready. - And I.

172
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.870
- And I. - And I.

173
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.070
Where shall we go?

174
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.400
Be kind and courteous to this gentleman.

175
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.730
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes.

176
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.630
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,

177
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.130
with purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries.

178
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.870
The honey-bags steal from the humble-bee.

179
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.270
And for night-tapers, crop their waxen thighs

180
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.000
and light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,

181
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.230
to have my love to bed and to arise.

182
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.700
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies

183
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.170
to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.

184
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.500
Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

185
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.100
- Hail. - Hail.

186
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.300
- Hail. - Hail.

187
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.000
I cry your worship's mercy, heartily.

188
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.630
I beseech your worship's name.

189
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.730
Cobweb.

190
00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.670
I shall desire you of more acquaintance,

191
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.900
good Master Cobweb.

192
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.400
If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you.

193
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.470
Your name, honest gentleman?

194
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.730
Peaseblossom.

195
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.900
Good Master Peaseblossom,

196
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.430
I shall desire you of more acquaintance too.

197
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.900
Your name, I beseech you, sir?

198
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.030
Mustardseed.

199
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.370
Good Master Mustardseed,

200
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.570
Your kindred had made my eyes water ere now.

201
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.170
I desire your more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.

202
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.730
Come, wait upon him.

203
00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.170
Lead him to my bower.

204
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.130
The moon methinks looks with a watery eye.

205
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.900
And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,

206
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.900
lamenting some enforced chastity.

207
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:02.400
Tie up my love's tongue.

208
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.200
Bring him silently.

209
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.370
How now, mad spirit!

210
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.330
What night-rule now about this haunted grove?

211
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.570
My mistress with a monster is in love.

212
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:46.300
This falls out better than I could devise.

213
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.000
Oh, why rebuke you him that loves you so?

214
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.870
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

215
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.900
Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse.

216
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.030
For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.

217
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.230
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,

218
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.000
being o'er shoes in blood,

219
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.030
plunge in the deep and kill me too.

220
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.700
The sun was not so true unto the day as he to me.

221
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.370
Would he have stolen away from sleeping Hermia?

222
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.930
I'll believe as soon this whole earth may be bored

223
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.070
and that the moon may through the centre creep

224
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.870
and so displease her brother's noontide with the Antipodes.

225
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.230
It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.

226
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:43.100
So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

227
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.130
So should the murdered look and so should I,

228
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.530
pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.

229
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.800
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear

230
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.300
as yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

231
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.600
What's this to my Lysander?

232
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.930
Where is he?

233
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.170
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

234
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:02.430
I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

235
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.670
Out, dog.

236
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.870
Out, cur.

237
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.370
Thou drivest me past the bounds of maiden's patience.

238
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.800
Hast thou slain him, then?

239
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.730
Henceforth be never numbered among men.

240
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.570
Oh, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake.

241
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.230
Durst thou have looked upon him being awake,

242
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.170
and hast thou killed him sleeping?

243
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.170
Oh, brave touch.

244
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.000
Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?

245
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.400
An adder did it,

246
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.370
for with doubler tongue than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

247
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.400
You spend your passion on a misprised mood.

248
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.130
I am not guilty of Lysander's blood,

249
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.000
nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

250
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.870
I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

251
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.730
If I could, what should I get therefore?

252
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.230
A privilege never to see me more.

253
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.030
And from thy hated presence part I so.

254
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.300
See me no more, whether he be dead or no.

255
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.570
ierce vein.

256
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.030
Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.

257
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.800
What hast thou done?

258
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.100
Thou hast mistaken quite and laid the love-juice

259
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.500
on some true-love's sight.

260
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.530
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue.

261
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.830
Some true love turned and not a false turned true.

262
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.230
Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,

263
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.170
a million fail, confounding oath on oath.

264
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.030
About the wood go swifter than the wind

265
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.770
and Helena of Athens look thou find.

266
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.670
All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,

267
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.000
with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.

268
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.100
By some illusion see thou bring her here.

269
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.100
I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.

270
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.330
I go. I go.

271
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.430
Look how I go, swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.

272
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.230
Flower of this purple dye hit with Cupid's archery,

273
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.430
Sink in apple of his eye.

274
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.730
When his love he doth espy,

275
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.830
let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky.

276
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.800
When thou wakest, if she be by,

277
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:45.000
beg of her for remedy.

278
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.900
Captain of our fairy band, Helena is here at hand,

279
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.630
and the youth, mistook by me, pleading for a lover's fee.

280
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.630
Shall we their fond pageant see?

281
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.270
Lord, what fools these mortals be.

282
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.300
Draw aside: the noise they make will cause Demetrius to awake.

283
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.030
Then will two at once woo one.

284
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.430
That must needs be sport alone.

285
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:10.600
And those things do best please me that befall preposterously.

286
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.270
Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?

287
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.300
Scorn and derision never come in tears.

288
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.430
Look, when I vow, I weep.

289
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.000
And vows so born, in their nativity,

290
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.830
all truth appears.

291
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.100
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,

292
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.800
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?

293
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.030
You do advance your cunning more and more.

294
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.570
These vows are Hermia's.

295
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.800
Will you give her o'er?

296
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.730
I had no judgment when to her I swore.

297
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.130
Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

298
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.630
Demetrius loves her and loves not you.

299
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:51.130
Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine.

300
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.570
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?

301
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.000
Crystal is muddy.

302
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.130
Oh, how ripe in show thy lips, those kissing cherries,

303
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.500
tempting grow.

304
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.800
Oh, spite.

305
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.730
Pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,

306
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.270
Fanned with the eastern wind,

307
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.330
turns to a crow when thou holdest up thy hand.

308
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.030
I see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment.

309
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.570
You are unkind, Demetrius.

310
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.030
Be not so, for you love Hermia.

311
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.530
If you were civil, you would not do me this much injury.

312
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.330
Can you not hate me, as I know you do?

313
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.430
But you must join in souls to mock me too?

314
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.800
You love Hermia.

315
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.970
This you know I know.

316
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.270
And here, with all my good will, with all my heart,

317
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.370
In Hermia's love, I yield you up my part.

318
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.400
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts

319
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.930
when I am sure you hate me with your hearts.

320
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.370
You both are rivals and love Hermia.

321
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.570
In Hermia's love, I yield you up my part.

322
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.230
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,

323
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.630
And now both rivals to mock Helena.

324
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.570
Whom I do love and will do till my death.

325
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.100
A trim exploit,

326
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.370
a manly enterprise to conjure tears up

327
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.400
in a poor maid's eyes with your derision.

328
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.830
If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.

329
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:57.600
Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,

330
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.570
the ear more quick of apprehension makes.

331
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.100
And now to Helen, is it home returned.

332
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.230
There to remain.

333
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.130
Helen, it is not so.

334
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.370
Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

335
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.600
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found.

336
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.200
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.

337
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.730
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

338
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.870
Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

339
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.270
What love could press Lysander from my side?

340
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.800
Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,

341
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.470
fair Helena, who more engilds the night

342
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.630
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.

343
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.900
Why seekest thou me?

344
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.500
Could not this make thee know

345
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.570
the hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?

346
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.430
Lo, she is one of this confederacy

347
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.170
Now I perceive they have conjoined all three

348
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:49.170
to fashion this false sport in spite of me.

349
00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:52.100
Injurious Hermia,

350
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.900
most ungrateful maid,

351
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.670
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived

352
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.230
to bait me with this foul derision?

353
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.430
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,

354
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.700
the sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,

355
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.000
when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us.

356
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.800
Oh, is all forgot--

357
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.730
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?

358
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:19.030
We, Hermia, have like two artificial gods,

359
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.430
have with our needles created both one flower,

360
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:28.030
both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,

361
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.900
both warbling of one song, both in one key,

362
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.970
as if our hands, our sides,

363
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.800
voices and minds, had been incorporate.

364
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.100
So we grew together, like...

365
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.130
to a double cherry,

366
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:52.030
seeming parted, but yet an union in partition,

367
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.830
two lovely berries moulded on one stem,

368
00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.300
so, with two seeming bodies, but one heart,

369
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.630
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,

370
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.870
to join with men in scorning your poor friend?

371
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.670
It is not friendly.

372
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.100
'Tis not maidenly.

373
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.300
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,

374
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.070
though I alone do feel the injury.

375
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.300
I am amazed at your passionate words.

376
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.400
I scorn you not.

377
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.230
It seems that you scorn me.

378
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.200
Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,

379
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.070
to follow me and praise my eyes and face?

380
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.870
And made your other love, Demetrius,

381
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.000
who even but now did spurn me with his foot,

382
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.070
to call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,

383
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.070
precious, celestial?

384
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.000
Wherefore speaks he this to her he hates?

385
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.130
And wherefore doth Lysander deny your love,

386
00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.830
so rich within his soul,

387
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.030
and tender me, forsooth, affection,

388
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.700
but by your setting on by your consent?

389
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.470
What though I be not so in grace as you,

390
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.530
so hung upon with love, so fortunate,

391
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:07.200
but miserable most, to love unloved?

392
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.000
This you should pity rather than despise.

393
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.200
I understand not what you mean by this.

394
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.200
Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,

395
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.470
make mouths upon me when I turn my back,

396
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.470
wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.

397
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.470
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.

398
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.930
If you had any pity, grace, or manners,

399
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.930
you would not make me such an argument.

400
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.500
But fare ye well.

401
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.730
No, stay, gentle Helena.

402
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.030
'Tis partly my own fault--

403
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.230
Hear my excuse.

404
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:46.230
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

405
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.130
My life, my love, my soul, fair Helena.

406
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.130
Oh, excellent.

407
00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.900
Sweet, do not scorn her so.

408
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.700
If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

409
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.930
Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.

410
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.730
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.

411
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:07.770
Helen, I love thee, by my life, I do.

412
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.900
I swear by that which I will lose for thee

413
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.930
to prove him false that says I love thee not.

414
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.700
I say I love thee more than he can do.

415
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.700
If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

416
00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.870
Quick, come!

417
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.500
Lysander, whereto tends all this?

418
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.800
Away, you Ethiope.

419
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.330
Hang off, thou cat, thou burr.

420
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.000
Vile thing, let loose, or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.

421
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.730
Thy love--Ha!

422
00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:29.700
Out, tawny Tartar, out!

423
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.770
You loathed medicine, hated potion, hence!

424
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:32.870
Do you not jest?

425
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.270
Yes, sooth, and so do you.

426
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.400
You're a tame man.

427
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.500
Go.

428
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.470
Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

429
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.170
I would I had your bond, for I perceive a weak bond holds you.

430
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.500
I'll not trust your word.

431
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.970
What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?

432
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.230
No, although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.

433
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.130
What, can you do me greater harm than hate?

434
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.300
Hate me?

435
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.000
Wherefore?

436
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.400
Oh me, what news, my love.

437
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.870
Am not I Hermia?

438
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.000
Are not you Lysander?

439
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.370
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.

440
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.470
Since night you loved me, yet since night you left me.

441
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:06.600
Why, then you left me-- oh, the gods forbid--

442
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.130
in earnest, shall I say?

443
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.530
Ay, by my life, and never did desire to see thee more.

444
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.400
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.

445
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.230
Be certain, nothing truer: 'tis no jest that I do hate thee

446
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.230
and love Helena.

447
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.930
Oh, me.

448
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.230
You juggler.

449
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.470
You canker-blossom.

450
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.630
You thief of love!

451
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:50.030
What, have you come by night and stolen my love's heart from him?

452
00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.000
What, will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue?

453
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.770
Fie, fie.

454
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.400
You counterfeit, you puppet, you.

455
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.470
Puppet?

456
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.000
Why so?

457
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.300
Ay, that way goes the game.

458
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.230
Now I perceive that she hath made compare between our statures.

459
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.430
She hath urged her height, and with her personage,

460
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.430
her tall personage, her height, forsooth,

461
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.830
she hath prevailed with him.

462
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.800
I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,

463
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.900
let her not hurt me.

464
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.700
And are you grown so high in his esteem

465
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.830
because I am so--

466
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.970
dwarfish--

467
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.070
And so low?

468
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.400
I was never cursed.

469
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.370
I have no gift at all in shrewishness.

470
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:32.630
How low am I, thou painted maypole?

471
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.830
Speak.

472
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:35.430
How low am I?

473
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.730
I am a right maid for my cowardice.

474
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.170
I am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

475
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.730
Let her not strike me.

476
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.930
You perhaps may think because she is something

477
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.770
lower than myself that I can match her.

478
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:47.870
Lower! Hark, again.

479
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.770
Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.

480
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.570
I evermore did love you, Hermia, did ever keep your counsels,

481
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.700
never wronged you.

482
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.470
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,

483
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.400
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.

484
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.570
AAHH!

485
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.170
He followed you.

486
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.470
For love, I followed him,

487
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.630
but he hath chid me hence and threatened me

488
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.970
to spurn me, strike me, nay, to kill me too.

489
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.830
And now, so you will let me quiet go.

490
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:21.670
To Athens will I bear my folly back and follow you no further.

491
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.370
Let me go.

492
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.000
You see how simple and how fond I am.

493
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.400
Why, get you gone.

494
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.730
Who is it that hinders you?

495
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.030
A foolish heart that I leave here behind.

496
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.400
What, with Lysander?

497
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.700
No, with Demetrius.

498
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.300
Ooh, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd.

499
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.530
She was a vixen when she went to school,

500
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:44.070
and though she be but little, she is fierce.

501
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.170
"Little" again.

502
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.730
Nothing but "low" and "little."

503
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.630
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?

504
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:49.730
Let me come to her.

505
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.000
Get you gone, you dwarf,

506
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.300
you minimus of hindering knot-grass made,

507
00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.130
you bead, you acorn!

508
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.500
Let her alone.

509
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.830
Speak not of Helena.

510
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.100
Take not her part.

511
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.670
For, if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her,

512
00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.000
thou shalt aby it.

513
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.100
Now she holds me not.

514
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.430
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right

515
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.800
of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

516
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.930
Follow?

517
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:22.230
Nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.

518
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:26.570
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.

519
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.170
I will not trust you, I,

520
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.070
nor longer stay in your cursed company.

521
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.130
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.

522
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:40.070
My legs are longer though, to run away.

523
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.670
I am amazed and know not what to say.

524
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:47.370
This is thy negligence still thou mistakest

525
00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.800
or else committest thy knaveries willfully.

526
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.200
Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.

527
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.100
Did not you tell me I should know the man

528
00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.000
by the Athenian garments he had on?

529
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.870
And so far blameless proves my enterprise

530
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.130
that I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes.

531
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.170
And so far, am I glad it so did sort

532
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.570
as this their jangling I esteem a sport.

533
00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:11.830
Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.

534
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.770
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night.

535
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.200
The starry welkin cover

536
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.800
thou anon with drooping fog as black as Acheron

537
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.630
and lead these testy rivals so astray

538
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.830
as one come not within another's way.

539
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.230
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue.

540
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.200
Then stir Demetrius upwith bitter wrong.

541
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.170
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius.

542
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.230
And from each other look thou lead them thus,

543
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.770
till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep

544
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.270
with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep,

545
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.330
Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye,

546
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:43.700
whose liquor hath this virtuous property

547
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.270
to take from thence all error with his might

548
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.900
and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.

549
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.230
When they next wake, all this derision

550
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.570
shall seem a dream and fruitless vision

551
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.500
and back to Athens shall the lovers wend,

552
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.500
with league whose date till death shall never end.

553
00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.600
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,

554
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.000
I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy.

555
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.900
And then I will her charmed eye release

556
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.600
from monster's view,

557
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.630
and all things shall be peace.

558
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.030
My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,

559
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.030
for night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,

560
00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.200
and yonder shines Aurora's harbinger

561
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.770
at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there

562
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.470
troop home to churchyards, damned spirits

563
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.430
that in crossways and floods have burial,

564
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.370
already to their wormy beds are gone.

565
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.000
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,

566
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.430
they willfully themselves exile from light

567
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.770
and must for aye consort with black-browed night.

568
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:37.030
But we are spirits of another sort.

569
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.170
I with the morning's love have oft made sport.

570
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.270
And, like the forester, the groves may tread

571
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.230
even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,

572
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:46.970
opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,

573
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:50.400
turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.

574
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.970
But, notwithstanding, haste.

575
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:53.130
Make no delay.

576
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.200
We may effect this business yet ere day.

577
00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.530
Up and down, up and down, I will lead them up and down.

578
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.100
I am feared in field and town.

579
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.070
Goblin, lead them up and down.

580
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.600
Here comes one.

581
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.370
Where art thou now, proud Demetrius?

582
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.630
Speak thou now.

583
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.730
Here, villain.

584
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.900
Drawn and ready.

585
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.000
Where art thou?

586
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.370
I will be with thee straight.

587
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:21.530
Follow me, then, to plainer ground.

588
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.870
Lysander, speak again.

589
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.300
Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?

590
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.400
Speak!

591
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.630
In some bush?

592
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.200
Where dost thou hide thy head?

593
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.530
Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,

594
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.670
telling the bushes that thou lookest for wars

595
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:36.870
and wilt not come?

596
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:39.600
Come, recreant; Come, thou child.

597
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.130
I'll whip thee with a rod.

598
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:44.430
He is defiled that draws a sword on thee.

599
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.670
Yea, art thou there?

600
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.770
Follow my voice.

601
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.770
We'll try no manhood here.

602
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.330
He goes before me and still dares me on.

603
00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.630
When I come where he calls, then he is gone.

604
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.770
The villain is much lighter-heeled than I.

605
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.630
I followed fast, but faster he did fly,

606
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.330
that fallen am I in dark uneven way

607
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:09.200
and here will rest me.

608
00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.270
Come, thou gentle day.

609
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.930
For if but once thou show me thy grey light,

610
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.070
I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.

611
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.500
Ho, ho, ho!

612
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.270
Coward, why comest thou not?

613
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.130
Abide me, if thou darest, for well I wot.

614
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.270
Thou runnest before me, shifting every place

615
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.300
and darest not stand nor look me in the face.

616
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.130
Where art thou now?

617
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.870
Come hither; I am here.

618
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.330
Nay, then, thou mockest me.

619
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.530
Thou shalt buy this dear if ever I thy face by daylight see:

620
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:45.400
Now go thy way.

621
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.100
Faintness constraineth me

622
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:50.230
to measure out my length on this cold bed.

623
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:52.270
Oh weary night,

624
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.970
Oh long and tedious night.

625
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.330
Abate thy hours.

626
00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.900
Shine comforts from the east

627
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.870
that I may back to Athens by daylight

628
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:07.500
from these that my poor company detest.

629
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.030
And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,

630
00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:14.530
steal me awhile from mine own company.

631
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.800
Yet but three?

632
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.000
Come one more.

633
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.370
Two of both kinds makes up four.

634
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.030
Here she comes, curst and sad.

635
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:26.730
Cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad.

636
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.770
Never so weary, never so in woe.

637
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:32.830
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,

638
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.200
I can no further crawl, no further go.

639
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.500
My legs can keep no pace with my desires.

640
00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.070
Here will I rest me till the break of day.

641
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:49.070
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray.

642
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.030
On the ground, sleep sound.

643
00:29:52.030 --> 00:30:00.730
I'll apply to your eye, gentle lover, remedy.

644
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:06.300
When thou wakest, thou takest true delight

645
00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.970
in the sight of thy former lady's eye.

646
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.330
And the country proverb known

647
00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:18.700
that every man should take his own

648
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:24.070
in your waking shall be shown.

649
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.830
Jack shall have Jill.

650
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.670
Nought shall go ill.

651
00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:34.930
The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

652
00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.330
Jack shall have Jill.

653
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:39.470
Nought shall go ill.

654
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.700
The man shall have his mare again,

655
00:30:42.700 --> 00:31:17.930
and all shall be well.

656
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.930
