00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400
THERE ARE SOME
GREAT QUESTIONS

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.600
THAT HAVE INTRIGUED
AND HAUNTED US

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.830
SINCE THE DAWN
OF HUMANITY.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.870
WHAT IS
OUT THERE?

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:29.000
HOW DID WE
GET HERE?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.200
WHAT IS THE
WORLD MADE OF?

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.570
THE STORY OF OUR SEARCH
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.070
IS THE STORY
OF SCIENCE.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.900
OF ALL HUMAN
ENDEAVORS,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.470
SCIENCE HAS HAD THE
GREATEST IMPACT ON OUR LIVES,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.400
ON HOW WE SEE THE WORLD,
ON HOW WE SEE OURSELVES.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:01.300
ITS IDEAS, ITS ACHIEVEMENTS,
ITS RESULTS ARE ALL AROUND US.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.100
BUT THE STORY OF SCIENCE
HAS BEEN SHAPED AS MUCH

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.470
BY WHAT'S OUTSIDE THE
LABORATORY AS INSIDE.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.730
POWER AND PASSION,
RIVALRY AND SHEER CHANCE

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.470
HAVE ALL PLAYED
SIGNIFICANT ROLES.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.400
THIS IS THE STORY OF
HOW HISTORY MADE SCIENCE

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.700
AND HOW SCIENCE
MADE HISTORY.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.870


00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.170
THIS TIME, A
QUESTION WE'VE ASKED

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.070
SINCE HUMANS FIRST
STARED AT THE HEAVENS.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.100
WHAT IS OUT THERE?

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.070


00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.130
TODAY, YOU HAVE TO DRIVE
INTO THE WILDERNESS

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.730
TO SEE THE NIGHT
SKY IN ALL ITS GLORY.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:09.070


00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.670
SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME
WE'VE BEEN MESMERIZED

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.000
BY ITS BEAUTY
AND MYSTERY.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.930
FROM DOWN HERE ALL LOOKS
QUIET, STILL AND PEACEFUL.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:33.000


00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.900
YET WE ARE IN FACT
ON A LARGE ROCK

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.630
SPINNING AROUND ITS OWN AXIS
AT OVER 1,500 KM AN HOUR.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.530
WE, AND OUR COMPANION
THE MOON, ARE TRAVELING

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.730
IN A GIANT LOOP AROUND THE
SUN AT 100,000 KM AN HOUR.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.670
AND WE'RE JUST ONE
PART OF THE GALAXY

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.570
MADE OF OVER
100 BILLION STARS.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.500
TODAY WE KNOW OUR
UNIVERSE IS A PLACE OF

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.500
EXTRAORDINARY WONDER AND
UNIMAGINABLE STRANGENESS.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.230
IT'S SO HARD
TO UNDERSTAND

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.900
THAT IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT
FOR MOST OF OUR HISTORY

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.300
WE HAD A VERY DIFFERENT
VIEW OF WHAT'S OUT THERE.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.900
THIS IS THE STORY
OF HOW WE DISCOVERED

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.570
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS
BIZARRE AND DAZZLING UNIVERSE.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.430


00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.070
OUR STORY
BEGINS IN PRAGUE

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.500
IN THE OPENING DAYS
OF THE 17TH CENTURY.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.330
A DEFINING MOMENT IN
THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.070
IT WAS HERE THAT THE
STORY OF OUR PLANET

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:10.030
WAS CHANGED FOREVER
BY THREE CRUCIAL FORCES:

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.170
PEOPLE WITH
DARING IDEAS...

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.370
COLLECTORS
OF EVIDENCE...

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.030
AND SOMEONE PREPARED
TO PAY FOR IT ALL.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.470
THE PLACE WAS THE COURT OF THE
HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR, RUDOLF II.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.070
RUDOLF WAS HUNGRY
FOR NEW IDEAS,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.670
FRESH DISCOVERIES
ABOUT THE HEAVENS,

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.870
AND SO HE
BROUGHT TO PRAGUE

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.870
THE WORLD'S
GREATEST ASTRONOMER

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.600
- AN ECCENTRIC DANISH
NOBLEMAN CALLED TYCHO BRAHE.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.100


00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.430
ALLAN CHAPMAN HAS
BEEN FASCINATED BY

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.270
TYCHO'S LIFE AND WORK
SINCE HE WAS A BOY.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.070
HE WAS HAUGHTY AND POWERFUL,
IMMENSELY CLEVER.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.000
HE WAS AN ARISTOCRAT
TO HIS FINGERTIPS

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.100
AND HE'D BEEN
ABDUCTED AS A BABY.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.300
SO HE REALLY HAS EVERY
EXOTIC TRAIT ABOUT HIM.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.230


00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.670
SCIENCE RELIES ON
EVIDENCE AND TYCHO WAS

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.770
AN EXTRAORDINARY
EVIDENCE GATHERER.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.100
HE BUILT HIS OWN
OBSERVATORY

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.470
AND FILLED IT WITH THE BEST
ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:44.200
ALLAN HAS RECREATED THE MOST
FAMOUS: TYCHO'S QUADRANT.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.270
FOR ASTRONOMERS OF THE TIME,
OBSERVING THE HEAVENS

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.200
MEANT PEERING AT THE
STARS WITH THE NAKED EYE.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.370
IT WAS PAINSTAKING
AND DIFFICULT WORK.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.930


00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.800
YOU'D USE THAT CENTRAL
PEG AS YOUR FRONT SIGHT

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.500
AND INSIDE HERE ARE A
PAIR OF LITTLE SLITS.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.570
YOU OBSERVE A STAR THROUGH
THE TOP PART OF THE SLIT,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.130
THEN THROUGH THE
BOTTOM ON THE TOP

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.100
AND THE BOTTOM
OF THAT PEG.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.500
AND THEN YOU'D NOTICE
THE ANGLE UNDER HERE

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.530
AND THAT WOULD GIVE
YOU THE VERTICAL ANGLE

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.470
OF THE OBJECT
ABOVE THE HORIZON.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.900
AND IF YOU COLLECTED
A LOT OF THIS DATA,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.970
AND TYCHO COLLECTED
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.170
OF SUCH OBSERVATIONS
OVER 20 YEARS,

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.570
THAT'S THE BASIS
OF A STAR CATALOG.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.230
TYCHO COLLECTED
ENORMOUS QUANTITIES OF DATA.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.000
AND WHAT'S MORE, IT WAS
THE MOST ACCURATE EVER.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.130
TYCHO'S INSTRUMENTS
WERE THE LATEST

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.630
IN A LONG LINE
OF DEVICES.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.930
THEY AND THE CRAFTSMEN
WHO BUILT THEM

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:57.000
PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN
THE STORY OF ASTRONOMY.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.100
THE EVIDENCE TYCHO GATHERED
WAS THE FIRST STAGE

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.370
IN UNDERMINING A BELIEF THAT
HAD LASTED OVER 2,000 YEARS.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:22.430


00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.600
THE STORY OF
WESTERN SCIENCE

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.170
HAS ITS ROOTS IN
ANCIENT GREECE.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.200
LIKE MANY EARLY CIVILIZATIONS,
THE GREEKS BELIEVED

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.330
THE EARTH WAS AT THE
CENTER OF THE COSMOS.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.970
IT WAS OBVIOUS.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:46.370
EVERY DAY THE SUN
ROSE AND SET AROUND US.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:53.000
THEY CREATED A
SIMPLE, ELEGANT VIEW

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.070
OF HOW THE
UNIVERSE WORKED.

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.000
THE SUN, MOON
AND PLANETS

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.400
REVOLVED AROUND
THE EARTH IN CIRCLES...

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.500
FOR THEM A PERFECT
AND DIVINE SHAPE.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:18.470
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
TO BE QUITE THAT SIMPLE.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.970
A CHANCE DISCOVERY
MADE A CENTURY AGO

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:29.200
GIVES US A STRIKING INSIGHT
INTO THE GREEK COSMOS.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.230


00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.000
IN 1900 SOME GREEK SPONGE
DIVERS WERE FORCED TO

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.570
TAKE SHELTER NEAR A SMALL
ISLAND CALLED ANTIKYTHERA.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.430
WHEN THE STORM HAD
BLOWN OUT THEY THOUGHT

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.870
"THIS IS WATER
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.270
LET'S SEE WHAT'S ON THE BOTTOM.
MIGHT BE SPONGES HERE"

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.030
AND THEY SENT
A MAN DOWN.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.730
BUT THIS WAS NO
ORDINARY DIVE.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.500
HE CAME UP SOME MINUTES
LATER BABBLING ABOUT

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.630
NAKED MEN ON
HORSES ON THE SEABED.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.130
WHAT ON EARTH
IS GOING ON?

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.170
WAS HE JUST ILL OR WAS THERE
SOMETHING REALLY DOWN THERE?

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:21.970


00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.630
THERE <i>WAS</i> SOMETHING
DOWN THERE.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:32.430
A WRECKED SHIP
FROM 2,000 YEARS AGO.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:42.600
AND AMONGST ITS CARGO THERE
WAS SOMETHING ASTONISHING.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.000
IT'S BECOME KNOWN AS THE
ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM...

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.200
A BEAUTIFULLY CRAFTED SYSTEM
OF BRONZE WHEELS AND COGS.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.900
NOTHING THIS SOPHISTICATED
WOULD BE MADE AGAIN

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.800
FOR OVER A
THOUSAND YEARS.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.600
ITS EXACT CONSTRUCTION
AND PURPOSE

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.970
HAS BEEN AN
INTRIGUING PUZZLE.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.130
MICHAEL WRIGHT FELL IN LOVE WITH
THE MECHANISM AT FIRST SIGHT

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.700
AND HAS SPENT 20 YEARS
TRYING TO DECIPHER IT.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.200
WORKING OUT WHAT'S THERE
IN THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.600
AND THEN AGAIN WORKING
OUT HOW TO COMPLETE IT,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.430
I FEEL I'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE
KNOWN THE MAN WHO MADE THIS.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.600
IT'S BEEN A FASCINATING
ROLLER COASTER RIDE

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.530
TRYING TO WORK OUT
THE ROUTE HE TOOK.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.670
I WISH I WAS HALF AS CLEVER AS
I THINK THE ORIGINAL MAN WAS.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.230
MICHAEL'S MODEL IS
HIS INTERPRETATION

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.230
OF HOW THE BRONZE
FRAGMENTS MIGHT HAVE WORKED.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.300
WE HAVE
EIGHT HANDS...

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.530
THE LONG HAND SHOWS THE DAY
OF THE YEAR ON THE OUTER RING.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.530
THE OTHER ONES SHOW THE
PLACE IN THE SKY OF THE MOON,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.100
THE SUN, AND THE FIVE PLANETS
THAT THE ANCIENTS KNEW ABOUT:

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.870
MERCURY, VENUS, MARS,
JUPITER AND SATURN.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.870
THIS MODEL IS A
REPRESENTATION

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.800
OF THE UNIVERSE AS
THE GREEKS KNEW IT

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.370
WITH THE SUN,
MOON AND PLANETS

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.030
GOING AROUND THE EARTH
IN PERFECT CIRCLES.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.930
AND IT'S REMARKABLY
SOPHISTICATED.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.100
MARS...

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.200
JUPITER...

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.930
THAT'S SATURN...
ALL OUT IN A LUMP.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:32.070
BUT WHAT'S INTRIGUING ABOUT
THIS MODEL IS THAT IT SUGGESTS

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.370
THE GREEKS HAD STUMBLED
UPON A TRICKY PROBLEM...

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.670
ONE THAT ONLY
APPEARS IF YOU BELIEVE

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.370
THE EARTH IS THE
CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.570
FROM TIME TO TIME THE
PLANETS APPEAR TO STOP

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.530
AGAINST THE
BACKGROUND OF STARS.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.430
IN GENERAL YOU
SEE THEM MOVING

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:49.270
A LITTLE FURTHER
EAST EVERY NIGHT.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.770
BUT THERE COME TIMES
WITH EACH OF THE PLANETS

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.770
WHEN THEY SEEM TO STOP
AMONGST THE STARS AND GO

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.230
WESTWARD FOR A MOMENT,
FOR A PERIOD OF DAYS,

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.670
AND THEN THEY STOP AGAIN
AND GO BACK EASTWARD

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:05.070
AND THIS INSTRUMENT
REPLICATES THAT BEHAVIOR.

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.070
THE FACT THAT THE PLANETS
APPEAR TO GO BACKWARDS

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.700
IN THE SKY MEANT THE GREEK
MODEL OF THE HEAVENS

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.630
GOT MUCH MORE
COMPLICATED.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.700
THEY DIDN'T ABANDON THE PERFECT
CIRCLES AROUND THE EARTH,

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.270
BUT INSTEAD THEY ADDED
MORE, WELL OVER 40,

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.270
ALLOWING THE PLANETS
TO SPIRAL ACROSS THE SKY.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.730


00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:39.770
A UNIVERSE OF PERFECT
CIRCLES WAS ONE OF THE MOST

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.170
ENDURING IDEAS
IN HUMAN HISTORY.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:48.200
IT TOOK ROOT IN THE ARAB WORLD
AFTER THE THE COLLAPSE OF ROME.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.830
IT BECAME EMBEDDED
IN THE CATHOLIC FAITH.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.400
DISLODGING IT WOULD NEED
MORE THAN ACCURATE EVIDENCE.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.800
IT WOULD TAKE A RADICAL
SHIFT IN THINKING

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.230
AND THAT WAS TRIGGERED BY
A GREAT FORCE OF HISTORY:

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.830


00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:16.130
THE REFORMATION.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.130
IT STARTED AS A MOVEMENT TO
REFORM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:24.370
BUT SOON SPLIT
EUROPE IN TWO.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.670
THE CONFLICT TURNED VIOLENT
AND PEOPLE OF THE "WRONG"

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.630
FAITH WERE PERSECUTED
OR EVEN EXECUTED.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.530
RELIGIOUS TRUTH
CAME UNDER FIRE

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.330
AND AUTHORITY WAS
OPEN TO QUESTION.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:44.300
AND AS REFUGEES
SPREAD ACROSS EUROPE,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:49.600
ONE OF THEM TOOK
REFUGE IN PRAGUE.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.570
TYCHO THE STARGAZER
GAINED AN ASSISTANT.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:00.300
SLIGHTLY BUILT, SICKLY AND
EXTREMELY SHORTSIGHTED,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.900
JOHANNES KEPLER WAS
AN UNLIKELY ASTRONOMER.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.670
HIS STRENGTH WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY GIFT

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.370
FOR MATHEMATICS.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:17.100
HE WAS OBSESSED WITH GEOMETRY
AND BEAUTY IN THE HEAVENS.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:23.470
AND HE CARRIED OUT HIS
OBSESSION IN A SURPRISING WAY.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.700
KEPLER WAS
AN ASTROLOGER.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:32.870
KEPLER'S CONNECTION WITH
ASTROLOGY IS SIGNIFICANT.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:38.470
EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE
POSITION OF THE SUN AND MOON

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:43.900
WENT WITH THE SEASONS AND
THE CYCLE OF DAY AND NIGHT.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:49.830
SO IT MADE SENSE THAT THE
PLANETS AFFECTED LIFE TOO.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:55.770
CHARTING POSITIONS IN THE ZODIAC
NEEDED ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.970
AND PRECISE MATHEMATICS
AND BOTH OF THESE

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:06.300
WERE ALSO VITAL TO THE
SCIENCE OF ASTRONOMY.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.430
YOU COULD CALL SOMEONE AN
ASTRONOMER AND IT MIGHT MEAN

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.570
THAT THEY WERE AN
ASTROLOGER AND VICE VERSA.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:17.630
ASTRONOMY IS THE ACTUAL
MAPPING OF THE HEAVENS,

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:22.630
BUT ASTROLOGY, BECAUSE IT IS
INTERESTED IN THE CONNECTIONS

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.330
BETWEEN THE EVENTS IN THE
HEAVENS AND LIFE ON EARTH,

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:32.100
BECOMES AN IMPETUS FOR
DOING THE ASTRONOMY AT ALL.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.630
IN THE COURT OF RUDOLF
AND OTHER PRINCES LIKE HIM,

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.030
ASTROLOGERS LIKE KEPLER
PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.400
IN THE RUNNING
OF THE STATE.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.000
IN A LOT OF WAYS IT'S NOT
DISSIMILAR TO THE WAY WE LOOK

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.670
AT ECONOMIC ADVISERS TODAY
OR EVEN DEFENSE ADVISORS.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:58.530
THEY'RE ALL GIVING THE RULER
CERTAIN KINDS OF INFORMATION

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.330
AND THE ASTROLOGER
WOULD DO THAT AS WELL.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.100
THE FACT THAT PRINCES LIKE
RUDOLF BELIEVED IN ASTROLOGY

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.100
MEANT THEY WERE PREPARED
TO PAY FOR DETAILED STUDIES

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.600
OF THE PLANETS
AND STARS.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.070
BUT FOR KEPLER ASTROLOGY WAS
MORE THAN A WAY OF MAKING MONEY.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.830
IT HAD A PROFOUND
INFLUENCE ON HIM.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.900
HE DOESN'T SEE THE
HEAVENS AS A DEAD THING.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:28.270
HE DOESN'T SEE THE
PLANETS AS CHUNKS OF ROCK.

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.530
HE THINKS OF THE HEAVENS
IN SOME WAY AS DIVINE.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:39.430


00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.670
IN PRAGUE THERE
WAS NOW A POWERFUL

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.500
COMBINATION
OF FORCES:

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.200
AN OBSESSION WITH THE HEAVENS
FUNDED BY THE EMPEROR...

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.900
EVIDENCE GATHERED
BY TYCHO BRAHE...

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:57.830
MATHEMATICAL IDEAS
FROM JOHANNES KEPLER...

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:05.630
AND THE INTELLECTUAL TURMOIL
UNLEASHED BY THE REFORMATION.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:14.070
FROM THESE FORCES EMERGED
A NEW MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE...

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:25.100
ONE WHICH PLACED NOT THE EARTH
BUT THE SUN AT THE CENTER.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:30.900
IT WAS NOT A NEW IDEA BUT IT
HAD RECENTLY BEEN REDISCOVERED

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:37.670
BY A POLISH CLERIC CALLED
NICHOLAS COPERNICUS.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.130
COPERNICUS IS OFTEN
HAILED AS THE MAN

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.300
WHO CHANGED OUR
VISION OF THE UNIVERSE.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:50.000
BUT IN FACT HE WAS ONLY TRYING
TO SIMPLIFY THE GREEK SYSTEM.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.300
NOW KEPLER BEGAN TO FOCUS ON
THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLANETS.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.200
THIS IS WHAT HE
WAS WRESTLING WITH:

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.500
HIS OWN DRAWING OF HOW
MARS MOVES THROUGH THE SKY.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.630
HE THOUGHT THIS ANCIENT
PROBLEM COULD BE SOLVED

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:17.830
WHILST ALSO KEEPING THE
CIRCULAR ORBITS AROUND THE SUN.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:26.200
ARMED WITH TYCHO'S DATA, HE SET
OUT TO PROVE IT MATHEMATICALLY.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.930
IT WAS
TEDIOUS WORK.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.300
HUNDREDS OF
CALCULATIONS

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.730
SPREAD OVER MORE
THAN FIVE YEARS.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.670
HE VARIED THE SPEED
OF THE PLANETS.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.270
HE SHIFTED THE POSITION
OF THE CENTER OF THE ORBIT.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.470
BUT HE COULDN'T MAKE
CIRCULAR MOVEMENTS

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.270
FIT TYCHO'S
OBSERVATIONS.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:55.530
AND SO HE TOOK
A RADICAL STEP.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.430
HE DROPPED THE DIVINE
PERFECT CIRCLES

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:04.400
AND TRIED ANOTHER
SHAPE: AN ELLIPSE.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.300


00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.370
IT WORKED. IT
MATCHED THE DATA.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.170
KEPLER HAD FOUND
THE TRUE SHAPE

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:19.630
OF THE ORBIT
OF THE PLANETS.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:24.000
IN 1609 HE PUBLISHED.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.070
THE ANCIENT MODEL OF THE
UNIVERSE SHOULD HAVE

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:35.230
COME TUMBLING DOWN
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.900
BEING RIGHT
WAS NOT ENOUGH.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:49.800


00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.270
FOR A 2,000 YEAR OLD
BELIEF TO BE OVERTHROWN

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.230
REQUIRED SOMETHING
FAR MORE POWERFUL.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.370
ASTRONOMY WOULD
HAVE TO GO TABLOID.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:06.230


00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.300
THE STORY OF
WHAT'S OUT THERE

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:12.200
NOW MOVES SOUTH
ACROSS THE ALPS.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.100
RENAISSANCE ITALY
WAS AWASH WITH MONEY

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.630
AND HUNGRY
FOR NOVELTIES.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.570
IT WAS THE PERFECT WORLD FOR
A MAN WITH TALENT AND AMBITION.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.700
A MAN LIKE
GALILEO GALILEI.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:39.530


00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.900
GALILEO WAS ON THE LOOKOUT
FOR A WAY OF MAKING MONEY.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.730
IN HIS 40'S, A
MATHEMATICIAN WITH

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.570
THREE ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN
HE HAD LIMITED PROSPECTS,

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.970
BUT A HUNGER
FOR GREATNESS.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.130
AND IN 1609 HIS
OPPORTUNITY AROSE.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.500
WORD REACHED HIM
OF A NEW DEVICE

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.330
WHICH MADE DISTANT
OBJECTS APPEAR CLOSER.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:13.300
IF HE COULD COPY THE
DEVICE AND MAKE IT BETTER

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.300
HE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO MAKE SOME MONEY.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:23.500
BUT HE'D HAVE
TO ACT QUICKLY.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.000
SVEN DUPRE IS A
HISTORIAN OF SCIENCE.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.930
TODAY HE'S FOLLOWING
IN GALILEO'S FOOTSTEPS

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:34.400
ON A
SHOPPING TRIP.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.200
WE HAVE A LETTER OF GALILEO AND
ON THE BACK OF THAT LETTER

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.300
THERE'S JOTTED DOWN
A SHOPPING LIST -

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.270
A SHOPPING LIST OF ITEMS
THAT GALILEO HIMSELF

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.870
OR ONE OF HIS SERVANTS
WAS SUPPOSED TO BRING BACK

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.270
FROM A SHOPPING
TRIP TO VENICE.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.630
VERY ORDINARY ITEMS,
DAILY ITEMS THAT HE NEEDED.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:55.100
THINGS LIKE PEAS,
ORANGES, SUGAR, PEPPER,

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.570
A HAT AND SLIPPERS
FOR HIS SON.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:03.200
SO FAR SO ORDINARY,
BUT THE LIST CONTINUES.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.600
AND THIS IS WHERE WE FIND
SOME MORE SURPRISING ITEMS

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.130
LIKE PIECES OF
FLAT MIRROR GLASS

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.930
AND ONE OF THESE,
AN ARTILLERY BALL.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.600
STRANGE AS IT SOUNDS,
THE ARTILLERY BALL

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.100
IS A CRUCIAL CLUE.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.270
NOW THIS MAKES US
SUSPECT THAT WHAT GALILEO

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.800
WAS ACTUALLY AFTER
WAS TO BUY IN VENICE

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.870
- AT THAT TIME ONE OF
THE PREMIER CENTERS

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.930
OF GLASSMAKING AND
MIRROR MAKING IN THE WORLD

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.500
- TO BUY MIRROR GLASS
TO ACTUALLY GRIND LENSES.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.530
GALILEO WAS MAKING WHAT WOULD
BECOME KNOWN AS A TELESCOPE.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:41.530
HE SAW THE TELESCOPE AS A
CHANCE TO CHANGE HIS LIFE.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.630
HIS PLAN WAS TO SHOW IT
TO THE RULER OF VENICE

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.130
IN THE HOPE HE
WOULD BE REWARDED.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:56.170
BUT FIRST OF ALL
HE NEEDED GLASS.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.630
THE HOME OF VENETIAN GLASS
MAKING IS THE ISLAND OF MURANO.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.200
AND GALILEO WOULD
HAVE HAD GOOD REASON

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.070
TO BUY HIS GLASS
FROM HERE.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.900
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
MURANO GLASS AND OTHER GLASS

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.300
IS THAT MURANO GLASS IS MUCH
MORE CLEAR THAN OTHER GLASS

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.530
OF THE SAME PERIOD WHICH
OFTEN HAS A GREENISH TINT.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:22.900
TO MAKE A TELESCOPE LENS YOU
HAD TO START WITH FLAT GLASS.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.630
NOWADAYS IT CAN BE SIMPLY
ROLLED INTO A SHEET,

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:33.500
BUT 400 YEARS AGO
IT WASN'T SO SIMPLE.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.930
WHAT YOU WOULD DO
IS BLOW A GLASS BULB

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.930
AND ONCE YOU
HAVE THE GLASS BULB

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.700
YOU SHAPE IT
INTO A CYLINDER

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:44.700
BY ROLLING IT
ONTO A FLAT PLATE.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.470
ONCE WE HAVE
THE HOT CYLINDER

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.800
WE MAKE CUTS IN IT
SO THAT IT OPENS

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.830
AND BY HEATING IT AGAIN TO
ABOUT 700 DEGREES CELSIUS

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.030
IT UNFOLDS LIKE
YOU SEE HERE.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:02.300
THE RESULT IS A
PIECE OF FLAT GLASS.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.900
BUT FINDING THE GLASS
WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.930
GALILEO HAD TO WORK OUT A WAY
OF TURNING THE RAW MATERIAL

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:14.530
INTO A LENS FIT
FOR HIS TELESCOPE.

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:22.070


00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.830
HIDDEN IN ANOTHER PART
OF VENICE IS THE WORKSHOP

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:30.700
OF A WORLD RENOWNED
LENS MAKER, ROMANO ZEN.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.200
ROMANO HAS TAKEN SVEN'S
CLEAR PIECE OF GLASS

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.270
AND IS SHAPING IT,
READY FOR GRINDING.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.530
AND THIS IS WHERE
THE MYSTERIOUS

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:44.400
ARTILLERY
BALL COMES IN.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.530
TRANSLATOR: THE RIGHT WAY
TO GET A CONCAVE SURFACE

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.500
IS TO USE A
CONVEX OBJECT.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.630
BY MAKING HIS
OWN LENSES

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.030
GALILEO WAS JOINING
KNOWLEDGE AND REASON

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.870
WITH THE PRACTICALITY
OF CRAFTSMANSHIP.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.700
IT'S A TREND THAT'S
IMPORTANT IN WESTERN SCIENCE.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.800
TRANSLATOR: THIS TYPE
OF ABRASION REMOVES

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.930
LESS MATERIAL BUT
LEAVES A CLEANER SURFACE.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:18.470
UNLIKE ROMANO, GALILEO
WASN'T AN EXPERT IN OPTICS.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.970
TO MAKE LENSES WITH
GREATER MAGNIFICATION

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:26.930
HE SIMPLY EXPERIMENTED
WITH THE CURVE OF THE GLASS.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:32.300
OUT OF A HUNDRED LENSES GALILEO
WAS HAPPY WITH ONLY ONE OR TWO.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.500
BUT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS,
BY TRIAL AND ERROR

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.730
HE HAD MADE THE MOST
POWERFUL LENSES IN THE WORLD.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:46.330


00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:52.200
HE PUT THEM TOGETHER IN A
TELESCOPE, TOOK IT UP THE

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:59.200
HIGHEST BELL TOWER IN VENICE,
AND POINTED IT TOWARDS THE SEA.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:07.830
THROUGH IT, SHIPS THAT WERE 50
KM AWAY LOOKED TEN TIMES CLOSER.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.670
THE RULER OF VENICE
WAS SO IMPRESSED

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.830
HE DOUBLED
GALILEO'S SALARY.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.270
IT SEEMED HIS
FORTUNE WAS MADE...

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.900
UNTIL HE LIFTED THE
TELESCOPE TO THE HEAVENS.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:35.870


00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:39.670
BY TURNING AWAY FROM THE
SEA AND TOWARDS THE STARS,

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:45.870
GALILEO'S TELESCOPE CREATED
DRAMATIC NEW EVIDENCE...

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.730
EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF A UNIVERSE
WITH THE SUN AT THE CENTER.

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.000
AND IN THE HEART OF
THE TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.630
ASTRONOMER FRANCESCO
PALLA HAS BEEN RECREATING

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:02.870
WHAT GALILEO SAW.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:06.100
TRANSLATOR: THE PROJECT
WAS TO BUILD A REPLICA

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.200
OF GALILEO'S
ORIGINAL TELESCOPE.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.130
THE MAIN PART WAS
THE REPRODUCTION

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.900
OF THE OPTICAL
SYSTEM, THE LENSES.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.100
THIS OPTICAL SYSTEM
IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.800
THERE'S ONE LENS AT ONE END
AND ONE AT THE OTHER END.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:31.200


00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.700
DESPITE ITS SIMPLICITY,
GALILEO'S TELESCOPE

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.700
WAS A SMALL
TECHNOLOGICAL LEAP

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.870
THAT CREATED A GREAT
ADVANCE IN SCIENCE.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.000
THROUGH HIS LENSES HE WAS
ABLE TO SEE THE NIGHT SKY

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.570
AS NO ONE HAD
EVER DONE BEFORE.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:59.000
THIS IS HOW HE SAW THE
SURFACE OF THE MOON.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE
OBSERVED ITS PHASES

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.300
AND RECORDED THEM
IN BEAUTIFUL SKETCHES.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.930
BUT IT WAS THE LARGEST
PLANET IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:21.500
WHICH BROUGHT
DISTURBING NEW EVIDENCE.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:26.900
WHEN GALILEO LOOKED AT
JUPITER THIS IS WHAT HE SAW.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.270
THERE WERE OBJECTS
HOVERING BESIDE IT.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:35.200
AT FIRST HE
WAS PUZZLED.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.730
TRANSLATOR: IT'S ONLY
WHEN A FEW DAYS LATER

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.800
HE REPEATED OBSERVATIONS
THAT HE SEES THAT

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.570
THE POSITION OF THE
OBJECTS HAVE CHANGED.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.200
THEY ARE NOT IN THE SAME
PLACE AS HE RECORDED

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.730
IN HIS JOURNAL A
FEW DAYS BEFORE.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.130
THIS IS AN
EPIC MOMENT.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:55.000
HE MUST HAVE
BURST WITH JOY.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.200
NO ONE HAD SEEN
THESE BRIGHT OBJECTS

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.830
EITHER SIDE OF
JUPITER BEFORE.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:06.330
THEY ARE MOONS
CIRCLING THE PLANET.

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.200
THIS WASN'T DEFINITE PROOF
OF A SUN CENTERED COSMOS

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.170
BUT IT DID HELP
UNDERMINE THE OLD VIEW.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:22.400
THESE WERE OBJECTS ORBITING A
PLANET OTHER THAN THE EARTH.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:31.200
THE NEWS OF GALILEO'S FINDINGS
QUICKLY SPREAD ACROSS EUROPE

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.900
AND THAT'S WHEN THE
TROUBLE REALLY STARTED

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:42.600
BECAUSE THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH TOOK NOTICE.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:51.630
IN 1632 GALILEO TOOK A STEP
WHICH WOULD RUIN HIS LIFE.

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:55.370
HE PUBLISHED HIS THOUGHTS
ON THE NATURE OF THE COSMOS.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:30:00.100
THE BOOK IS CALLED
<i>THE</i><i>DIALOGUE.</i>

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:06.600


00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:12.270
PAOLO GALLUZZI HAS SPENT
HIS LIFE STUDYING GALILEO.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.600
FOR HIM AND
MANY OTHERS

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.600
<i>THE DIALOGUE</i> IS A
BOOK OF BRILLIANCE.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.200
TRANSLATOR: IF I HAD TO
CHOOSE 20 MAJOR BOOKS

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.900
OF ALL TIMES THAT
MUST BE PRESERVED

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.430
FROM THE BEGINNING OF HUMAN
TRADITION UP UNTIL TODAY

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:35.830
I WOULD PLACE <i>THE DIALOGUE</i> IN
THIS KIND OF MODERN NOAH'S ARK.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:41.270
WHAT WAS PARTICULARLY
DANGEROUS ABOUT THE BOOK

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:46.670
WAS THAT IT WAS WRITTEN
FOR A POPULAR AUDIENCE.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.730
TRANSLATOR: <i>THE DIALOGUE</i>
IS QUITE DIFFERENT

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.670
FROM THE SCIENTIFIC
WORKS OF ITS TIME.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.130
IT IS EASILY READABLE, IT DOES
NOT INCLUDE MATHEMATICAL

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:03.000
FORMULAE, AND IT IS WRITTEN
IN A VERY LIVELY LANGUAGE.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.130
THE BOOK IS PRESENTED AS
A SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.770
ABOUT THE COSMOS.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.230
ONE SIDE ARGUING FOR A
STATIONARY EARTH AT THE CENTER,

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:16.130
THE OTHER
FAVORING THE SUN.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:20.300
IT GIVES CONSIDERATION
TO BOTH SYSTEMS

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.200
BUT GALILEO CLEARLY
COMES DOWN ON THE SIDE

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:28.300
OF THE SUN AS THE HUB
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:35.430
THIS WAS A HUGE
CHALLENGE TO THE CHURCH.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:38.500
GALILEO SEEMED
TO BE QUESTIONING

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.170
THE AUTHORITY
OF SCRIPTURE.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:50.430
TRANSLATOR: GALILEO SAYS THE
BIBLE IS A BOOK DICTATED BY GOD.

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.830
NATURE IS A BOOK
CREATED BY GOD.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:32:01.970
BOTH HAVE A COMMON ORIGIN
AND HAVE EQUAL AUTHORITY.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.530
GALILEO WAS SUGGESTING THAT
THE CONCLUSIONS OF SCIENCE

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:13.100
WERE JUST AS VALID AS THE
TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:19.900


00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.030
HE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND
WAS SUMMONED TO ROME

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:28.570
TO STAND TRIAL
BEFORE THE INQUISITION.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:30.930
UNDER THE THREAT
OF TORTURE

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:36.300
HE WAS FORCED TO
RENOUNCE HIS VIEWS.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.570
TRANSLATOR: THE
RENUNCIATION IS A DRAMATIC ACT.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:44.400
YOU MUST CONFESS NOT TO
BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.100
THIS IS ONE OF THE
WORST ACTS THAT

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:53.000
A MAN WITH INTELLECTUAL
INTEGRITY CAN UNDERGO.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.930
<i>THE DIALOGUE</i> WAS PLACED ON
THE INDEX OF PROHIBITED BOOKS

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:06.500
AND REMAINED THERE
FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:10.930
GALILEO WAS PUT
UNDER HOUSE ARREST

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.000
IN HIS VILLA
OUTSIDE FLORENCE.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.230
BUT THE ATTEMPTS TO GAG
HIM WERE UTTERLY FUTILE.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.000
WITHIN A GENERATION
THE EDUCATED CLASSES

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.670
THROUGHOUT EUROPE HAD
ACCEPTED THE EVIDENCE

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.070
THAT THE SUN AND
NOT THE EARTH

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:34.700
WAS AT THE CENTER
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.600
IT HAPPENED NOW BECAUSE
OF THE CONNECTIONS

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:44.200
BETWEEN THE PATRONAGE
OF RENAISSANCE PRINCES...

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.100
A COMBINATION OF
DIFFERENT TALENTS:

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:55.530
TYCHO BRAHE, JOHANNES
KEPLER AND GALILEO...

00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:00.200
AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION
- RAW DATA FROM TELESCOPES

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:08.000
AND THE POWER OF THE PRINTED
WORD TO SPREAD NEW KNOWLEDGE.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.270
THE STORY OF THE COSMOS
HAD CHANGED FOREVER.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:24.530


00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.700
ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE
THERE WAS A NEW FORCE

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:33.970
DRIVING INTEREST IN
THE HEAVENS: TRADE.

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:37.130
AS NEW TRADE
ROUTES OPENED UP

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:41.170
NATIONS FOUGHT
TO RULE THE WAVES.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:48.800
AND CRUCIAL TO THE BATTLE WAS
NEW ASTRONOMICAL EVIDENCE.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:57.230
THE ONLY WAY TO NAVIGATE ON THE
OPEN SEAS WAS TO USE THE STARS.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.970
AS VOYAGES BECAME LONGER
AND MORE DANGEROUS

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.100
NAVIGATORS NEEDED
NEW TECHNIQUES

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:12.230
AND BETTER ASTRONOMICAL
INSTRUMENTS LIKE THE SEXTANT.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:19.170
THE LOVE OF THE SEXTANT FOR
ME GOES BACK A LONG LONG WAY.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.370
WHEN I FIRST STARTED IT
WAS A TOOL OF MY TRADE

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.800
AND NOW IT'S
BECOME A LOVE.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.600
BUT INSTRUMENTS ALONE
WERE NOT ENOUGH.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.830
TO SAFELY NAVIGATE THE
GLOBE, SAILORS NEEDED

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:36.230
MORE INFORMATION ON THE
POSITIONS OF THE STARS.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.800
THE BETTER THE
STARS WERE CHARTED

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:41.200
THE MORE ACCURATE
THE SAILORS COULD BE.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.900
AND DUE TO THIS THEY NEEDED
TO DRIVE THE ASTRONOMERS MORE

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.270
TO PRODUCE MORE TABLES, AND
THE MORE ACCURATE THEY GOT

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.330
THE BETTER IT WAS
FOR EVERYBODY.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.700
TO ENSURE THEIR SHIPS HAD
ALL THE DATA THEY NEEDED,

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:03.770
RULERS AND GOVERNMENTS FUNDED
NEWER AND BETTER TELESCOPES.

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.600
SO AS THEY WORKED
TO CHART THE PLANET,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.870
THE STARS WERE
CHARTED TOO.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:15.230
TODAY EVERY STAR IN THE SKY IS
NOW CALCULATED TO THE SECOND.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.600
WE HAVE 57 STARS GIVING
POSITIONS NOW FOR EVERY DAY,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.370
FOR EVERY HOUR, EVERY
MINUTE AND EVERY SECOND

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.800
FOR A WHOLE YEAR.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:33.600
AND THE NEW KNOWLEDGE
CREATED TO HELP WITH NAVIGATION

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.030
ALSO FUELED THE QUESTION
"WHAT'S OUT THERE?"

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:44.730


00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:50.130
ONE OF THE CARGOS BROUGHT
IN BY TRADE WAS COFFEE.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.470
COFFEE SHOPS SPRUNG
UP ACROSS LONDON.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:58.170
TRADERS, SHIP'S CAPTAINS,
AND GENTLEMEN MET THERE

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.870
TO DO DEALS,
ARGUE, AND DEBATE.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.100
AND AMONGST
THE DISCUSSIONS

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.870
WAS THE LATEST
ASTRONOMICAL PROBLEM:

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:12.600
WHAT HOLDS THE
COSMOS TOGETHER?

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.770
IN 1684 THIS LED TO A BET
FOR THE SUM OF TWO POUNDS,

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.800
ABOUT A
WEEK'S WAGES.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.000
ONE OF THOSE TO TAKE UP THE
CHALLENGE WAS EDMUND HALLEY,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.170
OF HALLEY'S
COMET FAME.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.670
THE BET WAS ABOUT
THE ELLIPTICAL

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.570
MOVEMENT OF
THE PLANETS

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.470
AND THE MATHEMATICS OF
HOW THEY STAYED IN ORBIT.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.770
EAGER TO FIND
THE SOLUTION,

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:46.530
HALLEY SET OFF IN
SEARCH OF HELP.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:54.330
HE WENT TO SEE A MAN WHO
WAS AN ALCHEMIST, A RECLUSE,

00:37:54.330 --> 00:38:01.670
A MAN WITH NEAR
HERETICAL RELIGIOUS VIEWS.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:06.700
IT WAS
ISAAC NEWTON.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.070
NEWTON IS A GIANT IN
THE STORY OF SCIENCE.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.470
BY THE TIME HALLEY VISITED
HIM HE'D ALREADY DONE

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:19.770
GROUNDBREAKING WORK IN
OPTICS AND MATHEMATICS.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:26.600
BUT WHAT NEWTON IS MOST FAMOUS
FOR IS A STORY ABOUT AN APPLE.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.670
EVERYONE KNOWS IT - HOW
NEWTON DISCOVERED GRAVITY

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.900
WHEN HE SAW
AN APPLE FALL...

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.500
SAT IN THE ORCHARD OF HIS FAMILY
HOME HE HAD A MOMENT OF GENIUS.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.600
HE ASKED "WHY IS IT THE
APPLE ALWAYS FALLS DOWN

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.330
AND NOT UP
OR SIDEWAYS?"

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.630
EXCEPT IT DIDN'T
HAPPEN LIKE THAT.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:55.470
NEWTON PROBABLY MADE UP
THE STORY AS AN OLD MAN

00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:00.770
TO MAKE SURE HE
ALONE GOT THE CREDIT.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:04.870
BUT WHAT <i>IS</i> TRUE IS
AFTER HALLEY'S VISIT

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:11.500
NEWTON REALLY BEGAN TO
THINK HOW GRAVITY WORKS.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.470
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS,
AS HALLEY SPURRED HIM ON,

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.970
NEWTON DEVELOPED
HIS IDEAS.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:27.570
HE WAS SO OBSESSED HE FORGOT
TO EAT AND OFTEN HARDLY SLEPT.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:31.500
HIS THEORY OF GRAVITY
SLOWLY TOOK SHAPE.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.800
AND HE APPLIED IT TO THE
MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAVENS.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:41.830


00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:45.070
HE IMAGINED A CANNON
ON A MOUNTAIN

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.030
FAR ABOVE THE
ATMOSPHERE.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:52.070
HE THOUGHT, IF THE BALL
LEAVES THE CANNON SLOWLY,

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.470
THEN GRAVITY WILL
PULL IT TO EARTH.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.800
IF IT'S FIRED TOO QUICKLY, IT
WILL DISAPPEAR INTO SPACE.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.670
BUT IF THE SPEED
IS JUST RIGHT,

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.430
GRAVITY WILL HOLD
THE BALL IN ORBIT,

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.730
ENDLESSLY TRAVELING AROUND
THE EARTH JUST LIKE OUR MOON.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:17.170


00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.170
HIS WORK EXPLAINING
HOW GRAVITY

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:25.970
HELD THE UNIVERSE TOGETHER
WAS PUBLISHED IN 1687.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.500
KNOWN AS <i>PRINCIPIA,</i>
OR PRINCIPLES,

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:34.430
IT SET OUT FUNDAMENTAL
AND UNIVERSAL LAWS.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:39.200
THIS WAS WHEN THE NEW
VISION OF THE UNIVERSE

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:45.230
WAS TRULY EXPLAINED BUILT ON
TYCHO BRAHE'S OBSERVATIONS,

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:53.870
KEPLER'S ELLIPTICAL ORBITS
AND GALILEO'S DISCOVERIES.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:41:02.200
NOW NEWTON HAD EXPLAINED
WHY THE PLANETS MOVED.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.600


00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.700
THE IMPACT OF
NEWTON'S UNIVERSAL LAWS

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.130
SPREAD FAR
BEYOND ASTRONOMY.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.630
HE BECAME A HERO
TO REVOLUTIONARIES

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.570
WHO DREAMED OF UTOPIAN
SOCIETIES FOUNDED ON REASON.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:25.930
IN AMERICA, POLITICIANS WERE
INSPIRED BY NEWTON'S LAWS

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.130
WHEN THEY SHAPED
THEIR POLITICAL SYSTEM.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.930
AND IN RELIGION, AN
ORDERED UNIVERSE WAS TAKEN

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:40.670
TO DEMONSTRATE THE EXISTENCE
OF A GOD OF INFINITE POWER.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:49.870
AND AS FOR ASTRONOMY,
THERE WAS NOW A NEW MODEL.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:42:01.370
A CLOCKWORK UNIVERSE
GOVERNED BY A FEW SIMPLE LAWS.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:06.530
AND THAT'S HOW IT STAYED
FOR THE NEXT 200 YEARS.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:22.170


00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:26.930
THE QUESTION OF WHAT'S OUT THERE
HAS ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE MONEY.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.970
AND IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY
IT HEADED ACROSS THE ATLANTIC

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:35.970
TO THE HEART OF THE
CALIFORNIAN OIL RUSH.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.030
OIL AND
RAILWAY BARONS,

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.930
LIKE RENAISSANCE
PRINCES BEFORE THEM,

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:46.300
FINANCED ANOTHER RADICAL SHIFT
IN THE VIEW OF THE COSMOS.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.230
ONE MAN WHO MADE HIS
FORTUNE WAS JOHN D. HOOKER.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:54.000
HE WAS PERSUADED
TO GIVE $45,000

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.330
TOWARDS THE WORLD'S
LARGEST TELESCOPE.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:07.230
IT WAS SET ON THE TOP OF MOUNT
WILSON JUST OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:16.430


00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:21.070
IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO
BUILD, IT WEIGHS 100 TONS,

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.630
AND IT FLOATS ON
A BED OF MERCURY

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:27.330
COMPENSATING FOR
THE EARTH'S ROTATION.

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.270
AND THIS GARGANTUAN
TELESCOPE WAS PARTNERED

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:35.930
WITH A MAN WHO WAS
ALSO LARGER THAN LIFE:

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:43.630
EDWIN HUBBLE, AN ECCENTRIC
BUT TALENTED ASTRONOMER.

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:48.370
AFTER A SPELL AT
OXFORD UNIVERSITY

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.830
HE CAME HOME WITH A
FAUX UPPER CLASS ACCENT

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:57.170
AND WORKED IN
JODHPURS AND RIDING BOOTS.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:44:03.900
HUBBLE WAS INTERESTED IN THE
OUTER REACHES OF THE MILKY WAY

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:08.900
- AT THAT TIME THE ONLY KNOWN
GALAXY IN THE UNIVERSE.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.200
IT WAS AN INTEREST
THAT WOULD EXPAND

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.870
OUR WHOLE NOTION
OF THE COSMOS.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:23.330


00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.170
THE HUMAN EYE IS
NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.000
TO PICK UP THE NECESSARY
DETAIL ON ITS OWN,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.970
SO THE TELESCOPE IS DESIGNED
TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:37.070
AND ON THE 6TH
OF OCTOBER 1923,

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:41.900
HUBBLE TOOK AN IMAGE
THAT'S BECOME FAMOUS.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:48.070
THIS IMAGE IS ONE OF THE
MOST SIGNIFICANT IMAGES

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:51.770
EVER TAKEN IN THE ENTIRE
HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:58.330
THIS IS THE MONA LISA
OF ASTRONOMICAL IMAGES.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:02.200
THE PHOTOGRAPH IS OF
THE ANDROMEDA NEBULA,

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:07.470
A SWIRLING CLOUD-LIKE
AREA IN THE NIGHT SKY.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.400
BUT TAKEN WITH A
TELESCOPE OF THIS SIZE,

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.530
THE PHOTO REVEALED A
VERY SPECIAL DETAIL.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:16.870
WHAT'S REMARKABLE
ABOUT THIS IMAGE

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.130
IS IN THE UPPER
RIGHT HAND CORNER.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.000
THERE'S A NOTATION THAT
EDWIN HUBBLE PUT HERE:

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.100
"VAR" FOR VARIABLE STAR, WITH
AN EXCLAMATION POINT AFTER IT.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:30.270


00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.070
THIS WAS A
HUGE DISCOVERY.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:39.830
THE PASSING OF A VARIABLE
STAR COULD BE USED

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:45.270
TO CALCULATE ITS
DISTANCE FROM THE EARTH.

00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:50.030
AND THE RESULT
WAS ASTONISHING.

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:52.400
WHEN HUBBLE AND
HIS COLLEAGUES

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.030
DID THE CALCULATION
THEY DETERMINED THAT

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.230
THIS OBJECT WAS ACTUALLY
OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.330
OF THE MILKY WAY GALAXY,
SHATTERING OUR IDEA

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.500
THAT OUR GALAXY WAS THE
ENTIRE UNIVERSE ITSELF.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.000


00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.530
THE NEBULA WAS IN
FACT ANOTHER GALAXY.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:20.470
WE WERE NO LONGER
UNIQUE IN THE UNIVERSE.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.970
WE WERE JUST ONE
PLANET IN ONE GALAXY

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:28.270
AMONGST BILLIONS
OF OTHERS.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:33.130
OUR RACE, OUR WORLD,
AND ALL OUR CONCERNS

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.200
WERE COSMICALLY
INSIGNIFICANT.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:43.730


00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.470
BUT THAT WAS
JUST THE START.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.070
AS HUBBLE AND HIS COLLEAGUES
CONTINUED TO SEARCH THE SKY,

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:52.770
THEY MEASURED THE SPEED AT
WHICH GALAXIES WERE MOVING

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:56.370
EITHER TOWARDS
OR AWAY FROM US.

00:46:56.370 --> 00:46:59.630
THE VAST MAJORITY WERE
ACTUALLY RECEDING

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:04.930
AND OFTEN AT MIND
BLOWING SPEEDS.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:11.600
THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT
THE UNIVERSE WAS EXPANDING.

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:24.300


00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.130
OUR UNIVERSE
HAD A BEGINNING

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:34.770
13 BILLION
YEARS AGO...

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:40.200
IT'S KNOWN AS
"THE BIG BANG".

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.570
EDWIN HUBBLE AT THE
TIME NEVER RECEIVED

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.100
THE RECOGNITION
HE CRAVED

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:49.870
FOR HIS DISCOVERY OF THE
VASTNESS OF THE COSMOS.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.370
BUT FLOATING
HIGH ABOVE EARTH

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:56.570
IS THE ULTIMATE TRIBUTE
TO THIS ECCENTRIC MAN:

00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.600
THE HUBBLE
SPACE TELESCOPE.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.570
400 YEARS SINCE GALILEO
GROUND HIS FIRST LENSES,

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:10.600
THIS IS WHAT WE NOW USE
TO SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.730
IT CAN PEER BILLIONS OF LIGHT
YEARS ACROSS THE UNIVERSE,

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:19.430
BACK IN TIME, TOWARDS THE
BIRTH OF EVERYTHING IN IT.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:25.200


00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.700
OUR JOURNEY TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S OUT THERE

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.630
HAS BEEN SHAPED BY
POWERFUL FORCES AND BELIEFS,

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.570
BY THE GREEK OBSESSION
WITH DIVINE CIRCLES,

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.170
BY THE COURTS OF
THE RENAISSANCE,

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.700
AND BY RELIGIOUS
UPHEAVAL.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:44.570
ABOVE ALL BY THE
MARRIAGE OF TWO SKILLS:

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.300
THE PRACTICAL MAKERS
OF INSTRUMENTS

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.130
AND THE
GREAT THINKERS.

00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:53.630
AND IT'S STILL GOING ON
WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.270
CREATING MORE
POWERFUL WAYS

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.670
OF LOOKING DEEP
INTO THE COSMOS.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:04.470


00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:06.770
SO WHAT <i>IS</i>
OUT THERE?

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.330
THE DEEPER AND
FURTHER WE LOOK

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.830
THE STRANGER
IT BECOMES

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:15.300
AND THE MORE
WONDROUS IT SEEMS.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:21.970
WE'VE SEEN THE BIRTH OF STARS
IN NURSERIES OF GAS AND DUST,

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:25.030
EVIDENCE OF
SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES,

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:27.330
AND CLUES TO
DARK ENERGY

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:33.330
THAT MAY MAKE UP
MOST OF OUR UNIVERSE.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:37.170
THESE IDEAS ARE AS
UNSETTLING TO US

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:43.770
AS THE EARTH GOING AROUND
THE SUN WAS TO OUR ANCESTORS.

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:46.970
BUT OUR 2,000 YEAR JOURNEY
THROUGH ASTRONOMY

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.930
HAS CHANGED US.

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.970
NO MATTER HOW STRANGE
THE CONCLUSIONS MAY SEEM,

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.530
BY ACCEPTING
EVIDENCE

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.730
WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND
NOT JUST THE UNIVERSE

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:08.100
BUT OUR PLACE
HERE WITHIN IT.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.100
