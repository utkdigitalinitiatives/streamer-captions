3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.800
Ready.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.300
Scratch my head, Peaseblossom.

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.570
Come, sit thee down upon thisflowery bed

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.730
while I thy amiable cheeks docoy

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
and stick musk-roses in thysleek, smooth head

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.130
and kiss thy fair, large ears,my gentle joy.

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.500
Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.600
Ready.

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.000
Mounsieur Cobweb, goodmounsieur,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.570
get you your weapons in yourhand

13
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630
and kill me a red-hippedhumble-bee

14
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.330
on the top of a thistle.

15
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.370
And, good mounsieur, bring methe honey-bag.

16
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.730
Don't fret yourself too much inthe action, mounsieur.

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.800
And, good mounsieur, have a carethe honey-bag break not.

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.770
I would be loath to have youoverflown

19
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.730
with a honey-bag, signior.

20
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.400
Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.600
Ready.

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.670
Give me your neaf, MounsieurMustardseed.

23
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.200
Pray you, leave your courtesy,good mounsieur.

24
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.500
What's your Will?

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.770
Nothing, good mounsieur, but tohelp Cavalery Cobweb to scratch.

26
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.000
I must to the barber's,monsieur,

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.230
for methinks I am marvelloushairy about the face.

28
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.570
And I am such a tender ass,

29
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.000
if my hair do but tickle me, Imust scratch.

30
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.570
What, wilt thou hear some music,my sweet love?

31
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.670
I have a reasonable good ear inmusic.

32
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.330
Let's have the tongs and thebones.

33
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.330
Or say, sweet love, what thoudesirest to eat.

34
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.530
Truly, a peck of provender.

35
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.400
I could munch your good dryoats.

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.670
Methinks I have a great desireto a bottle of hay.

37
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.100
Good hay, sweet hay, hath nofellow.

38
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.430
I have a venturous fairy

39
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.270
that shall seek the squirrel'shoard and fetch thee new nuts.

40
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.030
I had rather have a handful ortwo of dried peas.

41
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.230
But let none of your people stirme.

42
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.030
I have an exposition of sleepcome upon me.

43
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.400
Sleep thou, and I will wind theein my arms.

44
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.800
Fairies, away, and be all waysaway.

45
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.030
So doth the woodbine the sweethoneysuckle gently entwist.

46
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.370
The female ivy so enrings thebarky fingers of the elm.

47
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.870
Oh, how I love thee.

48
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.770
Oh, how I dote on thee.

49
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.600
See'st thou this sweet sight?

50
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.000
Her dotage now I do begin topity.

51
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.970
For, meeting her of late behindthe wood

52
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.970
seeking sweet favours for thishateful fool,

53
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.670
I did upbraid her and fall outwith her.

54
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.130
For she his hairy temples

55
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.500
then had rounded with a coronetof fresh and fragrant flowers.

56
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.870
And that same dew, whichsometime on the buds

57
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.100
was wont to swell like round andorient pearls

58
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.570
stood now within the prettyflowerets' eyes

59
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.400
like tears that did their owndisgrace bewail.

60
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.630
When I had at my pleasuretaunted her

61
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.700
and she in mild terms begged mypatience,

62
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.100
I then did ask of her herchangeling child,

63
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.670
which straight she gave me.

64
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.630
And her fairy sent to bear himto my bower in fairy land.

65
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.870
And now I have the boy,

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.570
I will undo this hatefulimperfection of her eyes.

67
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.570
And, gentle Puck, take thistransformed scalp

68
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.600
from off the head of thisAthenian swain.

69
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.470
That, he awaking when the otherdo,

70
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.170
may all to Athens back againrepair

71
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.430
and think no more of thisnight's accidents

72
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.530
but as the fierce vexation of adream.

73
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.230
But first, I will release thefairy queen.

74
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.400
Be as thou wast wont to be.

75
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.130
See as thou wast wont to see.

76
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.230
Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower

77
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.570
hath such force and blessedpower.

78
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.300
Now, my Titania,

79
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.970
wake you, my sweet queen.

80
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.130
My Oberon.

81
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.430
What visions have I seen.

82
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.100
Methought I was enamoured of anass.

83
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.300
There lies your love.

84
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.430
How came these things to pass?

85
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.670
Oh, how mine eyes do loathe hisvisage now.

86
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.000
Silence awhile.

87
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.630
Robin, take off this head.

88
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.530
Titania, music call.

89
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.870
Music, music, such as charmethsleep.

90
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.170
Now, when thou wakest, withthine own fool's eyes peep.

91
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.800
Sound, music.

92
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.500
Come, my queen, take hands withme

93
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.100
and rock the ground whereonthese sleepers be.

94
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.330
Now thou and I are new in amity,

95
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.070
and will to-morrow midnightsolemnly dance

96
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.230
in Duke Theseus' housetriumphantly

97
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.300
and bless it to all fairprosperity.

98
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.200
There shall the pairs offaithful lovers be wedded

99
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.630
with Theseus all in jollity.

100
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.100
Fairy king, attend, and mark.

101
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.400
I do hear the morning lark.

102
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.900
Then, my queen, in silence sad,

103
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.570
trip we after night's shade.

104
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.430
We the globe can compass soonswifter than the wandering moon.

105
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.130
Come, my lord, and in ourflight,

106
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.470
tell me how it came this nightthat I sleeping here was found

107
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.430
with these mortals on theground.

108
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.030
I was with Hercules and Cadmusonce,

109
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.230
when in a wood of Crete,

110
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.800
they bayed the bear with houndsof Sparta.

111
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.600
Never did I hear such gallantchiding.

112
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.730
For besides the groves, theskies, the fountains,

113
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.930
every region near seemed all onemutual cry.

114
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:35.770
I never heard so musical adiscord, such sweet thunder.

115
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.670
Good morrow, friends.

116
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.970
Saint Valentine is passed.

117
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.770
Begin these wood-birds but tocouple now?

118
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.430
But speak, Egeus,

119
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.600
is this not the day

120
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.970
that Hermia should give answerof her choice.

121
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.400
It is, my Lord.

122
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400
I pray, all, stand up.

123
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.870
I know you two are rivalenemies.

124
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.430
How comes this gentle concord inthe world,

125
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.270
that hatred is so far fromjealousy

126
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.170
to sleep by hate and fear noenmity?

127
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.400
My lord, I shall reply amazedly,half sleep, half waking,

128
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.800
but as yet, I swear, I cannottruly say how I came here.

129
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.430
But, as I think--

130
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.500
for truly would I speak, and nowdo I bethink me, so it is--

131
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.370
I came hither with Hermia.

132
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.130
Our intent was to be gone fromAthens,

133
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.700
where we might, without theperil of the Athenian law--

134
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.870
Enough, enough, my lord.

135
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.130
You have enough.

136
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.670
I beg the law, the law upon hishead.

137
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.130
They would have stolen away.

138
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.470
They would, Demetrius,

139
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.130
thereby to have defeated you andme,

140
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.370
you of your wife, and me of myconsent,

141
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.970
of my consent that she should beyour wife.

142
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.170
My lord, fair Helen told me oftheir stealth,

143
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.630
of this their purpose hither tothis wood.

144
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.830
And I, in fury, hither followedthem,

145
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.870
fair Helena, in fancy, followingme.

146
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.330
But, my good lord, I wot not bywhat power--

147
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.030
but by some power it is--

148
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.230
my love to Hermia, melted as thesnow,

149
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.270
seems to me now as theremembrance of an idle gaud

150
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.100
which in my childhood I did doteupon.

151
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.070
All the faith, the virtue of myheart,

152
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:21.470
the object and the pleasure ofmine eye is only Helena.

153
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.530
To her, my lord, was I betrothedere I saw Hermia.

154
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.370
But, like in sickness, did Iloathe this food.

155
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.770
But, as in health, come to mynatural taste.

156
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:34.230
Now I do wish it, love it, longfor it,

157
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.300
and will, for evermore, be trueto it.

158
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.730
Egeus, I will overbear yourwill.

159
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.470
For in the temple by and by withus

160
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.770
these couples shall eternally beknit.

161
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.770
These things seem small andindistinguishable,

162
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.670
like far off mountains turnedinto clouds.

163
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.270
Methinks I see these things withparted eye

164
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.870
when everything seems double.

165
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.470
So methinks, and I have foundDemetrius like a jewel,

166
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.030
mine own, and not mine own.

167
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.570
Are you sure that we are awake?

168
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.470
It seems to me that yet wesleep, we dream.

169
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.900
Do not you think The duke washere, and bid us follow him?

170
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.600
Yea, and my father.

171
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.730
And Hippolyta.

172
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.200
And he bid us follow to thetemple.

173
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.430
Why, then, we are awake.

174
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.200
Let's follow him and by the waylet us recount our dream.

175
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.670
When my cue comes, call me, andI will answer.

176
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.900
My next is, "Most fair Pyramus."

177
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.330
Heigh-ho, Peter Quince.

178
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.000
Flute, the bellows-mender.

179
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.070
Snout, the tinker.

180
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.300
Starveling.

181
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:13.100
God's my life, stolen hence, andleft me asleep.

182
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.570
I have had a most rare vision.

183
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:28.330
I have had a dream, past the witof man to say what dream it was.

184
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.270
Man is but an ass if he go aboutto expound this dream.

185
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:40.530
Methought I was-- there is noman can tell what.

186
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.270
Methought I was-- and methoughtI had--

187
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.300
but man is but a patched fool,

188
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.300
if he will offer to say whatmethought I had.

189
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.100
The eye of man hath not heard.

190
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.600
The ear of man hath not seen.

191
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.170
Man's hand is not able to taste,his tongue to conceive,

192
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:08.830
nor his heart to report what mydream was.

193
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.670
I will get Peter Quince to writea ballad of this dream.

194
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:18.800
It shall be called Bottom'sDream,

195
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:22.570
because it hath no bottom.

196
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.470
And I will sing it in the latterend of a play

197
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.170
before the duke.

198
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.600
Peradventure, to make it themore gracious,

199
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.230
I shall sing it at her death.

200
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.370
'Tis strange my Theseus, thatthese lovers speak of.

201
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.030
More strange than true.

202
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.600
I never may believe theseantique fables,

203
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.600
nor these fairy toys.

204
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:52.200
Lovers and madmen have suchseething brains,

205
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.100
such shaping fantasies

206
00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:00.170
that apprehend more than coolreason ever comprehends.

207
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.170
The lunatic, the lover, and thepoet

208
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.370
are of imagination all compact.

209
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.400
One sees more devils than vasthell can hold.

210
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.830
That is the madman.

211
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.770
The lover, all as frantic,

212
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.370
sees Helen's beauty in a brow ofEgypt.

213
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.470
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzyrolling

214
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.000
doth glance from heaven toearth, from earth to heaven

215
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.230
and as imagination bodies forththe forms of things unknown.

216
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.630
The poet's pen turns them toshapes

217
00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:38.870
and gives to airy nothing alocal habitation and a name.

218
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.830
Such tricks hath strongimagination

219
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.070
that if it would but apprehendsome joy,

220
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:52.330
it comprehends some bringer ofthat joy.

221
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.730
Or in the night, imagining somefear,

222
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.800
how easy is a bush supposed abear.

223
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.900
But all the story of the nighttold over,

224
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.400
and all their minds transfiguredso together,

225
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.570
more witnesseth than fancy'simages

226
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.200
and grows to something of greatconstancy,

227
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.400
but, howsoever, strange andadmirable.

228
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.400
Have you sent to Bottom's house?

229
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.070
Is he come home yet?

230
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.730
He cannot be heard of.

231
00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.070
Out of doubt, he is transported.

232
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.800
If he come not, then the play ismarred.

233
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.300
It goes not forward, doth it?

234
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.300
It is not possible.

235
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.770
You have not a man in all Athens

236
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.630
able to discharge Pyramus buthe.

237
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.170
No, he hath simply the best witof any handicraft man in Athens.

238
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.900
Yea.

239
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.100
And the best person too.

240
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.370
And he is a very paramour for asweet voice.

241
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:51.930
You must say "paragon."

242
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.070
A paramour is, God bless us, athing of naught.

243
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.330
Masters, the duke is coming fromthe temple,

244
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.770
and there is two or three lordsand ladies more married.

245
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:05.370
If our sport had gone forward,we had all been made men.

246
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.370
Oh, sweet bully Bottom.

247
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.070
Thus hath he lost sixpence a dayduring his life.

248
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.370
He could not have 'scapedsixpence a day.

249
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.730
An the duke had not given himsixpence a day

250
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.500
for playing Pyramus, I'll behanged.

251
00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.700
He would have deserved it.

252
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.500
Sixpence a day in Pyramus ornothing.

253
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.530
Where are these lads?

254
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.730
Where are these hearts?

255
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.730
Bottom?

256
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.070
Bottom?

257
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.200
Bottom!

258
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.670
Oh, most courageous day.

259
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.100
Oh, most happy hour.

260
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.100
Masters, I am to discoursewonders,

261
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.830
but ask me not what, for if Itell you, I am no true Athenian.

262
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.230
I will tell you every thing,right as it fell out.

263
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.670
Let us hear, sweet Bottom.

264
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.930
Not a word of me.

265
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.600
All that I will tell you is thatthe duke hath dined.

266
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.730
Get your apparel together, goodstrings to your beards,

267
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.170
new ribbons to your pumps.

268
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.900
Meet presently at the palace.

269
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.630
Every man look o'er his part.

270
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.270
For the short and the long is,

271
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:08.570
our play is preferred!

272
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.300
In any case, let Thisbe haveclean linen,

273
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.870
and let not him that plays thelion pair his nails,

274
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.330
for they shall hang out for thelion's claws.

275
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.970
And, most dear actors, eat noonions nor garlic,

276
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.200
for we are to utter sweetbreath,

277
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.000
and I do not doubt but to hearthem say

278
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.330
it is a sweet comedy.

279
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.070
No more words: away!

280
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.100
Go, away.

281
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.600
