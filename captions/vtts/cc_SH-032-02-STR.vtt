00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500


2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.600


3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.800
And the moon, were she earthly,no nobler.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.730
Whither do you follow your eyesso fast?

5
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.000
Honorable Menenius, my boyMarcius approaches.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.630
For the love of Juno, let's go.

7
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.870
Marcius coming home?

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.030
Ay, worthy Menenius, and withmost prosperous approbation.

9
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.570
Take my cap, Jupiter, and Ithank thee.

10
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
Marcius coming home!

11
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.730
Nay, 'tis true.

12
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.800
Is he not wounded?

13
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.100
He was wont to come homewounded.

14
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.300
O, no, no, no.

15
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.770
O, he is wounded.

16
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.370
I thank the gods for it.

17
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.630
So do I too, and it be not toomuch,

18
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.030
brings a victory in his pocket?

19
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.100
The wounds become him.

20
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.400
On's brows, Menenius,

21
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.130
he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.

22
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.070
Has he disciplined Aufidiussoundly?

23
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.700
Titus Lartius writes they foughttogether,

24
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.970
but Aufidius got off.

25
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.900
And 'twas time for him too, I'llwarrant him that.

26
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.100
And he had stayed by him,

27
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.930
I would not be so fidiused forall the chests in Corioli

28
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.030
and the gold that's in them.

29
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.800
Is the senate possessed of this?

30
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500
Good ladies, let's go.

31
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.800
Yes, yes, yes.

32
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.130
The senate has letters from thegeneral

33
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.170
in which he gives my son thewhole name of the war.

34
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.100
He has in this action outdonehis former deeds doubly.

35
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.700
In troth, there's wondrousthings spoke of him.

36
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Wondrous.

37
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.870
Ay, I warrant you,

38
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.500
and not without his truepurchasing.

39
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.230
The gods grant them true.

40
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.230
True.

41
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.270
Pow, wow.

42
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.330
True; I'll be sworn they aretrue.

43
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.700
Where is he wounded?

44
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.700
Where is he wounded?

45
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.270
In the shoulder and in the leftarm.

46
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330
There will be large cicatricesto show the people

47
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.870
when he shall stand for hisplace.

48
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.670
He received in the repulse ofTarquin

49
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.970
seven hurts in the body.

50
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.270
One in the neck; two in thethigh.

51
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.370
That's nine that I know.

52
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.970
He had, before this lastexpedition,

53
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.270
25 wounds upon him.

54
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.970
Now it is 27.

55
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.330
Every gash an enemy's grave.

56
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.800
Hark, the trumpets.

57
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.300
These are the ushers of Marcius.

58
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.030
Before him he carries noise, andbehind him he leaves tears.

59
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.430
Death, that dark spirit, in hisnervy arm doth lie,

60
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.170
which, being advanced, declines,and then men die.

61
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.270
Know, Rome, that all alone

62
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.670
Marcius did fight within Corioligates,

63
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.400
where he hath won, with fame, aname to Caius Marcius.

64
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.000
These in honor followsCoriolanus.

65
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.670
Welcome to Rome, renownedCoriolanus.

66
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.300
No more of this.

67
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.070
It does offend my heart.

68
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.530
Pray now, no more.

69
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.970
Look, sir, your mother.

70
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.070
O, you have, I know, petitionedall the gods for my prosperity.

71
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.930
Nay, my good soldier, up.

72
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.430
My gentle Marcius,

73
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.830
worthy Caius,

74
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.400
and by deed-achieving honornewly namedó

75
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.170
What is it?

76
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.730
Coriolanus must I call thee?

77
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.330
But O, thy wife.

78
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.900
My gracious silence,

79
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.670
hail.

80
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.870
Wouldst thou have laughed had Icome coffined home,

81
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.000
that weepest to see me triumph?

82
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.600
Ah, my dear, such eyes thewidows in Corioli wear,

83
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.000
and mothers that lack sons.

84
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.270
Now, the gods crown thee.

85
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.400
And live you yet?

86
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.100
O, sweet lady, pardon.

87
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.070
I know not where to turn.

88
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.100
O, welcome home.

89
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.000
Welcome, General.

90
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.900
And you're welcome all.

91
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.170
100,000 welcomes.

92
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.170
I could weep, and I could laugh.

93
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.500
I am light and heavy.

94
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.930
Welcome.

95
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.630
The good patricians must bevisited,

96
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.730
from whom I have received notonly greetings,

97
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.830
but with them change of honors.

98
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.630
I have lived to see inherited myvery wishes

99
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.670
and the buildings of my fancy.

100
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.430
Only there's one thing wanting,

101
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.730
which I doubt not but our Romewill cast upon thee.

102
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.370
Know, good mother, I had ratherbe their servant in my way

103
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.770
than sway with them in theirs.

104
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.570
On the sudden, I warrant himconsul.

105
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.200
Then our office may, during hispower, go sleep.

106
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.600
He cannot temperately transporthis honors

107
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.170
from where he should begin andend,

108
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.730
but will lose those he hath won.

109
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.770
In that, there's comfort.

110
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.300
Doubt not the commoners, withwhom we stand,

111
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.970
but they upon their ancientmalice

112
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.330
will forget with the least causethese his new honors,

113
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.670
which that he will give them

114
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.830
make I as little question as heis proud to do it.

115
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.630
I heard him swear, were he tostand for consul,

116
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.770
never would he appear in themarketplace,

117
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.030
nor on him put the naplessvesture of humility,

118
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.630
nor showing, as the manner is,

119
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.770
his wounds to the people, begtheir stinking breaths.

120
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.770
'Tis right.

121
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.230
It was his word.

122
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.770
O, he would miss it rather thancarry it

123
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.100
but by the suit of the gentry tohim

124
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.030
and the desire of the nobles.

125
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.300
I wish no better than have himhold that purpose

126
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.570
and to put it in execution.

127
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.900
'Tis most like he will.

128
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.130
It shall be to him then as ourgood wills a sure destruction.

129
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.330
So it must fall out to him

130
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.630
or our authorities for an end.

131
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.530
We must suggest to the people

132
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.270
in what hatred he still hathheld them,

133
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.470
that to his power he would havemade them mules,

134
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.770
silenced their pleaders

135
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.670
and dispropertied theirfreedoms,

136
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.800
holding them, in human actionand capacity,

137
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.900
of no more soul nor fitness forthe world than...

138
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.000
Camels in the war?

139
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.830
Camels in the war

140
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.570
who have their provand only forbearing burdens

141
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.770
and sore blows for sinking underthem.

142
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.370
This, as you say, suggested atsome time

143
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.370
when his soaring insolence shalltouch the peopleó

144
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.770
which time shall not want, if hebe put upon it,

145
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.330
and that's as easy as to setdogs on sheepó

146
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.600
will be his fire to kindle theirdry stubble,

147
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.100
and their blaze shall darken himforever.

148
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.300
What's the matter?

149
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.630
You are sent for to the capitol.

150
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.970
'Tis thought that Marcius shallbe consul.

151
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.370
I have seen the dumb men throngto see him

152
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.770
and the blind to hear him speak.

153
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.230
Matrons flung gloves,

154
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.170
ladies and maids their scarfsand handkerchiefs

155
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.200
upon him as he passed.

156
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.200
The nobles bended as to Jove'sstatue,

157
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.330
and the commons made a showerand thunder

158
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.200
with their caps and shouts.

159
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.530
I never saw the like.

160
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.370
Having determined of the Volscesand to send for Titus Lartius,

161
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.770
it remains, as the main point inthis our after-meeting,

162
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.570
to gratify his noble service

163
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.630
that hath thus stood for hiscountry.

164
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.530
Therefore, please you, mostreverend and grave elders,

165
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.200
to desire the present consul,

166
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.930
and last general in ourwell-found successes,

167
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.330
to report a little of the worthywork performed

168
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.770
by Caius Marcius Coriolanus,

169
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.470
whom we met here both to thank

170
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.270
and to remember with honors likehimself.

171
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.430
Speak, good Cominius.

172
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.770
Leave nothing out for length,

173
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.130
and make us think rather ourstate's defective

174
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.370
for requital than we to stretchit out.

175
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.870
Masters of the people, we dorequest your kindest ears,

176
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.500
and after, your loving motiontoward the common body

177
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.230
to yield what passes here.

178
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.170
We are convented upon a pleasingtreaty

179
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.130
and have hearts inclinable

180
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.030
to honor and advance the themeof our assembly.

181
00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.170
Which the rather we shall beblessed to do,

182
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.170
if he remember a kinder value ofthe people

183
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.630
than he hath hereto prized themat.

184
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.000
That's off; that's off.

185
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.030
I would you rather had beensilent.

186
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.200
Please you to hear Cominiusspeak?

187
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.070
Most willingly, but yet mycaution was more pertinent

188
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.930
than the rebuke you give it.

189
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:14.970
He loves your people

190
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:17.270
but tie him not to be theirbedfellow.

191
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.870
Worthy Cominius, speak.

192
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.870
Nay, keep your place.

193
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.900
Sit, Coriolanus;

194
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.330
never shame to hear what youhave nobly done.

195
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:24.470
Your honor's pardon.

196
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.370
I'd rather have my wounds toheal again

197
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.200
than hear say how I got them.

198
00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.830
Sir, I hope my words disbenchedyou not.

199
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.070
No, sir.

200
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.970
Yet oft, when blows have made mestay,

201
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.700
I fled from words.

202
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.800
You soothed not, therefore hurtnot.

203
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.570
But your people, I love them asthey weigh.

204
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.570
Pray now, sit down.

205
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.400
I had rather have one scratch myhead in the sun

206
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.500
when the alarum were struck

207
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.330
than idly sit to hear mynothings monstered.

208
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.170
Proceed, Cominius.

209
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.700
I shall lack voice.

210
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.200
The deeds of Coriolanus shouldnot be uttered feebly.

211
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.100
It is held that valor is thechiefest virtue

212
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.000
and most dignifies the haver.

213
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.230
If it be, the man I speak of

214
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.170
cannot in the world be singlycounterpoised.

215
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.130
At 16 years, when Tarquin made ahead for Rome,

216
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.700
he fought beyond the mark ofothers.

217
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.830
Our then dictator,

218
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.730
whom with all praise I point at,saw him fight,

219
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.800
when with his Amazonian chin

220
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.800
he drove the bristled lipsbefore him.

221
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.370
He bestrid an o'er-pressed Roman

222
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.830
and in the consul's view slewthree opposers.

223
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:47.400
Tarquin's self he met and struckhim on his knee.

224
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.770
In that day's feats,

225
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.400
when he might act the woman inthe scene,

226
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.900
he proved best man in the field,

227
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.470
and for his meed was brow-boundwith the oak.

228
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.800
His pupil age man-entered, thus,he waxed like a sea,

229
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.400
and in the brunt of 17 battlessince,

230
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.070
he lurched all swords of thegarland.

231
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.770
For this last,

232
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.300
before and in Corioli,

233
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.070
let me say, I cannot speak himhome.

234
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.530
He stopped the fliers

235
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.500
and, by his rare example,

236
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.870
made the coward turn terror intosport.

237
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.900
As weeds before a vessel undersail,

238
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.430
so men obeyed and fell below hisstem.

239
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:44.030
His sword, death's stamp whereit did mark, it took.

240
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:51.600
From face to foot, he was athing of blood

241
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.400
whose every motion was timedwith dying cries.

242
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.270
Alone he entered the mortal gateof the city,

243
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.670
which he painted with shunlessdestiny,

244
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.270
aidless came off

245
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:10.900
and with a sudden reinforcementstruck Corioli like a planet.

246
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.770
Now all's his.

247
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.100
When, by and by, the din of wargan pierce his ready sense,

248
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.870
then straight his doubledspirit,

249
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.100
re-quickened what in flesh wasfatigate,

250
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.030
and to the battle came he,

251
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.470
where he did run reeking overthe lives of men

252
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.000
as if 'twere a perpetual spoil.

253
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.070
And till we called both fieldand city ours,

254
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.530
he never stood to ease hisbreast with panting.

255
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.130
Worthy man.

256
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.230
He cannot but with measure fitthe honors

257
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.500
which we devise him.

258
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.630
Our spoils he kicked at andlooked upon things precious

259
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.230
as they were the common muck ofthe world.

260
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.800
He covets less than miseryitself would give,

261
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.430
rewards his deeds with doingthem,

262
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.030
and is content to spend the timeto end it.

263
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.770
He's right noble.

264
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.000
Let him be called for.

265
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.100
Call Coriolanus.

266
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.200
The senate, Coriolanus,

267
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.030
are well pleased to make theeconsul.

268
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.370
I do owe them still my life andservices.

269
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.600
It then remains that you dospeak to the people.

270
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.600
I do beseech you, let meo'erleap that custom,

271
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.370
for I cannot put on the gown,stand naked and entreat them

272
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.130
for my wounds' sake to givetheir suffrage.

273
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.900
Please you that I may pass thisdoing.

274
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:35.470
Sir, the people must have theirvoices,

275
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.130
neither will they bate one jotof ceremony.

276
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.930
Put them not to it.

277
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.570
Pray you, go fit you to thecustom and take to you,

278
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.700
as your predecessors have, yourhonor with your form.

279
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.730
It is apart that I shall blushin acting

280
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.300
and might well be taken from thepeople.

281
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.300
Mark you that?

282
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.930
To brag unto them, thus I did,and thus,

283
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.500
to show them the unaching scarswhich I should hide

284
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.800
as if I had received them

285
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.400
for the hire of their breathonly.

286
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.770
Do not stand upon it.

287
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.100
We recommend to you, tribunes ofthe people,

288
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.900
our purpose to them,

289
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.930
and to our noble consul wish weall joy and honor.

290
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.170
Once, if he do require ourvoices,

291
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.070
we ought not to deny him.

292
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.230
We may, sir, if we will.

293
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:17.000
We have power in ourselves to doit,

294
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.670
but it is a power that we haveno power to do,

295
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.100
for if he show us his wounds andtell us his deeds,

296
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.970
we are to put our tongues intothose wounds

297
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.900
and speak for them.

298
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.200
So if he tell us his nobledeeds,

299
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.770
we must also tell him our nobleacceptance of them.

300
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.500
Ingratitude is monstrous,

301
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.700
and for the multitude to beingrateful

302
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.400
were to make a monster of themultitude,

303
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.900
of the which we being members,

304
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.600
should bring ourselves to bemonstrous members.

305
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.000
And to make us no better thoughtof, a little help will serve,

306
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.670
for once we stood up about thecorn,

307
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.530
he himself stuck not to call usthe many-headed multitude.

308
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.370
We have been called so of many;

309
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.930
not that our head are somebrown, some black,

310
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.870
some auburn, some bald,

311
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.700
but that our wits are sodiversely colored.

312
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.000
And truly, I think,

313
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.300
if all our wits were to issueout of one skull,

314
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.030
they would fly east, west,north, south,

315
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.530
and their consent of one directway

316
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.730
should be at once to all thepoints of the compass.

317
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.000
Think you so?

318
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.470
Which way do you judge my witwould fly?

319
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.770
Nay, your wit will not so soonout as another man's will.

320
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.900
'Tis strongly wedged up in ablockhead,

321
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.700
but if it were at liberty,'twould, sure, southward.

322
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.000
Why that way?

323
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.630
To lose itself in a fog,

324
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.570
where being three parts meltedaway with rotten dews,

325
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.570
the fourth would return forconscience sake

326
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:34.800
to help to get thee a wife.

327
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.400
You are never without yourtricks.

328
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.800
O, you may, you may.

329
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.030
Are you all resolved to giveyour voices?

330
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.130
- No - Yes.

331
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.600
But that's no matter; thegreater part carries it.

332
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.130
I say, if he would incline tothe people,

333
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:50.930
there never was a worthier man.

334
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.470
Here he comes,

335
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.500
and in the gown of humility.

336
00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.370
Mark his behavior.

337
00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.830
We are not to stay all together

338
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.530
but to come by him where hestands,

339
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.030
by ones, by twos, by threes.

340
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.070
He's to make his requests byparticulars.

341
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.300
Have you not known the worthiestmen have done it?

342
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.370
What must I say?

343
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.600
"I pray, sir"ó

344
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.670
plague upon it.

345
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.800
I cannot bring my tongue to sucha pace.

346
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.230
"Look, sir, my wounds.

347
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.730
"I got them in my country'sservice,

348
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.230
"when some certain of yourbrethren

349
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.230
roared and ran from the noise ofour own drums."

350
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.270
O, me, the gods.

351
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.530
You must not speak of that.

352
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.200
You must desire them to thinkupon you.

353
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.670
Think upon me?

354
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.230
Hang them.

355
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.730
I would they would forget me,

356
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.570
like the virtues which ourdivines lose by them.

357
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.330
You'll mar all.

358
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.530
I'll leave you.

359
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.130
Pray you, speak to them, I prayyou, in wholesome manner.

360
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.000
Bid them wash their faces andkeep their teeth clean.

361
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.230
So here comes a brace.

362
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:36.470
You know the cause, sir, of mystanding here.

363
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.170
We do, sir.

364
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.730
Tell us what hath brought you toit.

365
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:43.800
Mine own desert.

366
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.900
Your own desert.

367
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.270
Ay, but not mine own desire.

368
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.330
How not your own desire?

369
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.630
No, sir, 'twas never my desire

370
00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.770
yet to trouble the poor withbegging.

371
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.770
You must think, if we give youany thing,

372
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.030
we hope to gain by you.

373
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.330
Well, then, I pray, your priceof the consulship?

374
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.900
The price is to ask it kindly.

375
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.030
Kindly, sir.

376
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.530
I pray, let me have it.

377
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.170
I have wounds to show you,

378
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.630
which shall be yours in private.

379
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:33.830
Your good voice, sir.

380
00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.670
What say you?

381
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.070
You shall have it, worthy sir.

382
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.070
A match, sir.

383
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.500
There's in all two worthy voicesbegged.

384
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.800
I have your alms.

385
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.430
Adieu.

386
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.130
But this is something odd.

387
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.730
An 'twere to give againó

388
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:55.970
'tis no matter.

389
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.730
Pray you now,

390
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.530
if it may stand with the tune ofyour voices

391
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.400
that I may be consul,

392
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.670
I have here the customary gown.

393
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.900
You have deserved nobly of yourcountry,

394
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.530
and you have not deserved nobly.

395
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:22.330
Your enigma?

396
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.200
You have been a scourge to herenemies;

397
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.100
you have been a rod to herfriends.

398
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.970
You have not indeed loved thecommon people.

399
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.530
You should account me the morevirtuous

400
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.770
that I have not been common inmy love.

401
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.570
I will, sir, flatter my swornbrother, the people,

402
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.270
to earn a dearer estimation ofthem.

403
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.070
'Tis a condition they accountgentle,

404
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.800
and since the wisdom of theirchoice

405
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.270
is rather to have my hat than myheart,

406
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.600
I will, sir, practice theinsinuating nod

407
00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.770
and be off to them mostcounterfeitly.

408
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.400
That is, sir, I will counterfeit

409
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.000
the bewitchment of some popularman

410
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.300
and give it bountiful to thedesirers.

411
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.370
Therefore, beseech you, I may beconsul.

412
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.930
We hope to find you our friend

413
00:18:57.930 --> 00:19:00.170
and therefore give you ourvoices heartily.

414
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.030
You have received many woundsfor your country.

415
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.930
I will not seal your knowledgewith showing them.

416
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:06.430
I will make much of your voices,and so trouble you no further.

417
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.900
The gods give you joy, sir,heartily.

418
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.570
Most sweet voices.

419
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.570
Better it is to die,

420
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.430
better to starve,

421
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.970
than crave the hire which firstwe do deserve.

422
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.770
Why in this woolvish toge shouldI stand here

423
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.070
to beg of Hob and Dick,

424
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:37.100
that does appear, their needlessvouches?

425
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.000
Custom calls me to it.

426
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.030
What custom wills, in all thingsshould we do it,

427
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.530
the dust on antique time wouldlie unswept

428
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.300
and mountainous error be toohighly heapt

429
00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.900
for truth to over-peer.

430
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.300
Rather than fool it so,

431
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.600
let the high office and thehonor

432
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.100
go to one that would do thus.

433
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.970
I am half through.

434
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.300
The one part suffered; the otherwill I do.

435
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.330
Here come more voices.

436
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.270
Your voices.

437
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.100
For your voices, I have fought,

438
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:20.300
watched for your voices,

439
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.530
for your voices bear of woundstwo dozen odd,

440
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.070
battles thrice six I have seenand heard of,

441
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.500
for your voices have done manythings,

442
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.130
some less, some more;

443
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.330
your voices.

444
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:42.200
Indeed, I would be consul.

445
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.200
He has done nobly

446
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.270
and cannot go without any honestman's voice.

447
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:47.030
Therefore, let him be consul.

448
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.030
Amen.

449
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.230
God save thee, noble consul.

450
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.000
Worthy voices.

451
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.300
You have stood your limitation,

452
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:56.470
and the tribunes endue you withthe people's voice.

453
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:58.370
Remains that, in the officialmarks invested,

454
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.900
you anon do meet the senate.

455
00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.000
Is this done?

456
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.570
The custom of request you havedischarged.

457
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.500
The people do admit you and aresummoned to meet anon

458
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.970
upon your approbation.

459
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:09.070
Where, at the senate house?

460
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.600
- There, Coriolanus. - May Ichange these garments?

461
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.730
You may, sir.

462
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.600
That I'll straight do, and,knowing myself again,

463
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.670
repair to the senate house.

464
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:15.670
I'll keep you company.

465
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.900
He has it now,

466
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.800
and by his looks, methinks 'tiswarm at his heart.

467
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.230
With a proud heart he wore hishumble weeds.

468
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.670
Will you dismiss the people?

469
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.830
How now, my masters?

470
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.370
Have you chose this man?

471
00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.800
He has our voices, sir.

472
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.200
To my poor unworthy notice,

473
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200
he mocked us when he begged ourvoices.

474
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.230
Certainly, he flouted usdownright.

475
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.570
No, 'tis his kind of speech.

476
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.070
He did not mock us.

477
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.570
Not one amongst us, saveyourself,

478
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:49.470
but says he used us scornfully.

479
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.270
He should have showed us hismarks of merit,

480
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.900
wounds received for his country.

481
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.130
Why, so he did, I'm sure.

482
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.170
No, no;

483
00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.570
no man saw them.

484
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.330
He said he had wounds, which hecould show in private.

485
00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.270
And with his hat, thus waving itin scorn,

486
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.600
"I would be consul," says he.

487
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.330
"Aged custom, but by yourvoices,

488
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.670
"will not so permit me.

489
00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.500
Your voices therefore."

490
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.330
When we granted that, here was,

491
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.770
"I thank you for your voices.

492
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.830
"Thank you for your most sweetvoices.

493
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.670
Now you have left your voices, Ihave no further with you."

494
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.100
Was not this mockery?

495
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:28.200
Why either were you ignorant tosee it, or, seeing it,

496
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.300
of such childish friendliness toyield your voices?

497
00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.330
Did you perceive he did solicityou in free contempt

498
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:38.830
when he did need your loves,

499
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.170
and do you think that hiscontempt

500
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.530
shall not be bruising to you,

501
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.330
when he hath power to crush?

502
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.870
Why had your bodies no heartamong you?

503
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.430
Or had you tongues to cry

504
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:50.300
against the rectorship ofjudgment?

505
00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.470
Have you ere now denied theasker?

506
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.300
And now again of him that didnot ask but mock,

507
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.500
bestow your sued-for tongues?

508
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:01.670
He's not confirmed.

509
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.130
We may deny him yet.

510
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.170
And will deny him.

511
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.530
I'll have 500 voices of thatsound.

512
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.470
Let them assemble, and on asafer judgment,

513
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.200
all revoke your ignorantelection.

514
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.370
