00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.330


2
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.200
Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you

3
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.970
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?

4
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.430
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?

5
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.370
Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;

6
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.830
How could he stay till Warwick made return?

7
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.800
My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.170
And his well-chosen bride.

9
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.500
I mind to tell him plainly what I think.

10
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.800
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,

11
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.170
That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?

12
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.100
As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,

13
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.530
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment

14
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.670
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

15
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.370
Suppose they take offence without a cause,

16
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.270
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,

17
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.070
Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.

18
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.270
And shall have your will, because our king:

19
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.900
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

20
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.030
Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?

21
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.100
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd

22
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.970
Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity

23
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.430
To sunder them that yoke so well together.

24
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.100
(laughing)

25
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.530
Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,

26
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.930
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey

27
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.800
Should not become my wife and England's queen.

28
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.400
And you too, Somerset and Montague,

29
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.300
Speak freely what you think.

30
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.270
Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis

31
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.930
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him

32
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.830
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.

33
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.400
And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,

34
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.030
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.

35
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.830
What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased

36
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.800
By such invention as I can devise?

37
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.500
Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance

38
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.130
Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth

39
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.000
'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.

40
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.670
Why, knows not Montague that of itself

41
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.300
England is safe, if true within itself?

42
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.030
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.

43
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.700
'Tis better using France than trusting France:

44
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.630
Let us be back'd with God and with the seas

45
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.070
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,

46
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.430
And with their helps only defend ourselves;

47
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.130
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.

48
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.430
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves

49
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.330
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

50
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.030
Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;

51
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.330
And for this once my will shall stand for law.

52
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.570
And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,

53
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.630
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales

54
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.400
Unto the brother of your loving bride;

55
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.200
She better would have fitted me or Clarence:

56
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.630
But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

57
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.470
Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir

58
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.430
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,

59
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.400
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

60
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife

61
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.370
That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

62
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.830
In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,

63
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.600
Which being shallow, you give me leave

64
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.530
To play the broker in mine own behalf;

65
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.200
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

66
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.330
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,

67
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.930
And not be tied unto his brother's will.

68
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.200
My lords, before it pleased his majesty

69
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.800
To raise my state to title of a queen,

70
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.230
Do me but right, and you must all confess

71
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.970
That I was not ignoble of descent;

72
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.770
And meaner than myself have had like fortune.

73
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.330
But as this title honours me and mine,

74
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.400
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,

75
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.970
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.

76
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.370
My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:

77
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.700
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,

78
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.730
So long as Edward is thy constant friend,

79
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.470
And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?

80
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.100
Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,

81
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.700
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;

82
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.000
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,

83
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.470
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.

84
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.

85
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.130
Now, messenger, what letters or what news

86
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.130
From France?

87
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.230
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,

88
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.600
But such as I, without your special pardon,

89
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.570
Dare not relate.

90
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.770
Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,

91
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.270
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.

92
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.670
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?

93
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.200
At my depart, these were his very words:

94
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.130
'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,

95
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.870
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers

96
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.730
To revel it with him and his new bride.'

97
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.400
Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.

98
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.230
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?

99
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.400
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:

100
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.370
'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,

101
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.800
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'

102
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.800
I blame not her, she could say little less;

103
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.570
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?

104
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.330
For I have heard that she was there in place.

105
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.870
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,

106
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.770
And I am ready to put armour on.'

107
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.530
Belike she minds to play the Amazon.

108
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.970
But what said Warwick to these injuries?

109
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.470
He, more incensed against your majesty

110
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.500
Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:

111
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.270
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,

112
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.770
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'

113
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:26.230
Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?

114
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.770
Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:

115
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.630
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.

116
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.300
But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

117
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.330
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in friendship

118
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.430
That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.

119
00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.900
Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.

120
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.000
Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,

121
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.430
For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;

122
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.230
That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage

123
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.700
I may not prove inferior to yourself.

124
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.630
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.

125
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.470
Not I:

126
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.230
My thoughts aim at a further matter; I

127
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:35.000
Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.

128
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.700
Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!

129
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.400
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;

130
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.530
And haste is needful in this desperate case.

131
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.900
Go levy men, and make prepare for war;

132
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.170
Myself in person will straight follow you.

133
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.900
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,

134
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.530
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,

135
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.830
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:

136
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.100
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?

137
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.770
If it be so, then both depart to him;

138
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.400
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:

139
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.570
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,

140
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.730
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,

141
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.600
That I may never have you in suspect.

142
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.230
So God help Montague as he proves true!

143
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.370
And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!

144
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.030
Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?

145
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.600
Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.

146
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.070
Why, so! then am I sure of victory.

147
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.030
Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,

148
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.000
Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.

149
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.670
Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;

150
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.330
The common people by numbers swarm to us.

151
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.370
But see where Somerset and Clarence come!

152
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.000
Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?

153
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.570
Fear not that, my lord.

154
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.070
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;

155
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:36.630
And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice

156
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.030
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart

157
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.530
Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;

158
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.030
Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,

159
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.530
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:

160
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.930
But come, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.

161
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.070
And now what rests but, in night's coverture,

162
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.900
Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,

163
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.030
His soldiers lurking in the towns about,

164
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.500
And but attended by a simple guard,

165
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.170
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?

166
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.030
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:

167
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.470
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,

168
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.870
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard

169
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.500
And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,

170
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.200
For I intend but only to surprise him.

171
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.170
You that will follow me to this attempt,

172
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.400
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.

173
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.400
Henry! Henry! Henry

174
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.700
Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:

175
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.570
For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!

176
00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:04.470
Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:

177
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.470
The king by this is set him down to sleep.

178
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.970
What, will he not to bed?

179
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.270
Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow

180
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.030
Never to lie and take his natural rest

181
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.030
Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.

182
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.700
To-morrow then belike shall be the day,

183
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.900
If Warwick be so near as men report.

184
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.730
But say, I pray, what nobleman is that

185
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.330
That with the king here resteth in his tent?

186
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.800
'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.

187
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:47.670
O, is it so? But why commands the king

188
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.300
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,

189
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:56.400
While he himself keeps in the cold field?

190
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.470
'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.

191
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.070
Ay, but give me worship and quietness;

192
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.100
I like it better than a dangerous honour.

193
00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.500
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,

194
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.830
'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.

195
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.630
Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.

196
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:18.800
Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,

197
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.830
But to defend his person from night-foes?

198
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:32.470
(whistles sound from different directions)

199
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.000
Who goes there?

200
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.570
(whistle)

201
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.530
Stay, or thou diest!

202
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.000
(screams)

203
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.730
What are they that fly there?

204
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:59.330
Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.

205
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.370
Why, Warwick, when we parted,

206
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.530
Thou call'dst me king.

207
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.530
Ay, but the case is alter'd:

208
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.070
When you disgraced me in my embassade,

209
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.770
Then I degraded you from being king,

210
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.600
And come now to create you Duke of York.

211
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.370
Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,

212
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.030
That know not how to use ambassadors,

213
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.930
Nor how to be contented with one wife,

214
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.600
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,

215
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.570
Nor how to study for the people's welfare,

216
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.170
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

217
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.200
Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?

218
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.770
Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.

219
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.970
Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,

220
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.900
Of thee thyself and all thy complices,

221
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:03.230
Edward will always bear himself as king:

222
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.670
Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,

223
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:12.900
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.

224
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.870
Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:

225
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.730
But Henry now shall wear the English crown,

226
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:35.700
And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.

227
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.230
My Lord of Somerset, at my request,

228
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.000
See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd

229
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.700
Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.

230
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:58.230
So, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.

231
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.200
What fates impose, that men must needs abide;

232
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.700
It boots not to resist both wind and tide.

233
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.870
What now remains, my lords, for us to do

234
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:25.370
But march to London with our soldiers?

235
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.830
Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;

236
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.230
To free King Henry from imprisonment

237
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.800
And see him seated in the regal throne.

238
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.970
These news I must confess are full of grief;

239
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.230
Yet, dearest sister, bear it as you may:

240
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.270
Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.

241
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.930
Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.

242
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.230
And I the rather wean me from despair

243
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.370
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:

244
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:59.000
This is it that makes me bridle passion

245
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.630
And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;

246
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.070
Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear

247
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.070
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,

248
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.700
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown

249
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:16.300
King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.

250
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.500
But, madam, where is Warwick then become?

251
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.970
I am inform'd that he comes towards London,

252
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.430
To set the crown once more on Henry's head:

253
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.400
Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,

254
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.530
But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--

255
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.700
For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--

256
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.970
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,

257
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:35.130
To save at least the heir of Edward's right:

258
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.670
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.

259
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.970
Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:

260
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.530
If Warwick take us we are sure to die.

261
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:56.700
Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,

262
00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.200
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,

263
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.600
Into this chiefest thicket of the park.

264
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.930
Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,

265
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.030
Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands

266
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.170
He hath good usage and great liberty,

267
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.370
And, often but attended with weak guard,

268
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:12.930
Comes hunting this way to disport himself.

269
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.730
I have advertised him by secret means

270
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.600
That if about this hour he make this way

271
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.700
He shall here find his friends with horse and men

272
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.930
To set him free from his captivity.

273
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.500
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.

274
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:31.270
Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.

275
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.900
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,

276
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.030
Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?

277
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.600
Brother, the time and case requireth haste:

278
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.500
Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

279
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.770
But whither shall we then?

280
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:42.900
To Lynn, my lord,

281
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.400
And ship from thence to Flanders.

282
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.370
Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.

283
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.030
Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

284
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.530
But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.

285
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:54.200
Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?

286
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.600
Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.

287
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.470
Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.

288
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.770
Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;

289
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:08.070
And pray that I may repossess the crown.

290
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:27.000
Master lieutenant, now that God and friends

291
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.970
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,

292
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.970
And turn'd my captive state to liberty,

293
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:34.200
My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,

294
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.900
At our enlargement what are thy due fees?

295
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.970
Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;

296
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.230
But if an humble prayer may prevail,

297
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.030
I then crave pardon of your majesty.

298
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.100
For what, lieutenant? for well using me?

299
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:52.170
Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,

300
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.170
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;

301
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.870
Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds

302
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.630
Conceive when after many moody thoughts

303
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.770
At last by notes of household harmony

304
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:06.600
They quite forget their loss of liberty.

305
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.830
But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,

306
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.200
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;

307
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.600
He was the author, thou the instrument.

308
00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.100
Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite

309
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.730
By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,

310
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.370
And that the people of this blessed land

311
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.400
May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,

312
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.200
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,

313
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.700
I here resign my government to thee,

314
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.930
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

315
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.000
Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;

316
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.300
And now may seem as wise as virtuous,

317
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.230
By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,

318
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.400
For few men rightly temper with the stars:

319
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.900
Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,

320
00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.070
For choosing me when Clarence is in place.

321
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.570
No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,

322
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.400
To whom the heavens in thy nativity

323
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.270
Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,

324
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.700
As likely to be blest in peace and war;

325
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.270
And therefore I yield thee my free consent.

326
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.100
And I choose Clarence only for protector.

327
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.900
Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:

328
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.470
Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,

329
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.600
That no dissension hinder government:

330
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.470
I make you both protectors of this land,

331
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.600
While I myself will lead a private life

332
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.830
And in devotion spend my latter days,

333
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.970
To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.

334
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:41.870
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?

335
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.700
That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;

336
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.330
For on thy fortune I repose myself.

337
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:51.970
Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:

338
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.270
We'll yoke together, like a double shadow

339
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.070
To Henry's body, and supply his place;

340
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.470
I mean, in bearing weight of government,

341
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.370
While he enjoys the honour and his ease.

342
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.430
And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful

343
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.630
Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,

344
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.730
And all his lands and goods be confiscate.

345
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.530
What else? and that succession be determined.

346
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.270
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.

347
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.700
But, with the first of all your chief affairs,

348
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.330
Let me entreat, for I command no more,

349
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.370
That Margaret your queen and my son Edward

350
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.800
Be sent for, to return from France with speed;

351
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.230
For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear

352
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.230
My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.

353
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.370
It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

354
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.630
My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,

355
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.300
Of whom you seem to have so tender care?

356
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.800
My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.

357
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:55.900
Come hither, England's hope.

358
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.830
If secret powers

359
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.970
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,

360
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.430
This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.

361
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:07.230
His looks are full of peaceful majesty,

362
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.570
His head by nature framed to wear a crown,

363
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.400
His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself

364
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:21.700
Likely in time to bless a regal throne.

365
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.800
Make much of him, my lords, for this is he

366
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.870
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

367
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.270
(trumpets sound)

368
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:31.500
What news, my friend?

369
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.000
That Edward is escaped from your brother,

370
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.370
And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.

371
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.800
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?

372
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.400
He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester

373
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.600
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him

374
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.170
In secret ambush on the forest side

375
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.830
And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;

376
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.570
For hunting was his daily exercise.

377
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.870
My brother was too careless of his charge.

378
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.130
But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide

379
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.570
A salve for any sore that may betide.

380
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:11.430
My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;

381
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.870
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,

382
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.370
And we shall have more wars before 't be long.

383
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.100
As Henry's late presaging prophecy

384
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.530
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,

385
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.300
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts

386
00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:28.470
What may befall him, to his harm and ours:

387
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.130
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,

388
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.800
Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,

389
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.270
Till storms be past of civil enmity.

390
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:39.200
Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,

391
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.970
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.

392
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.570
It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.

393
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.700
Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.

394
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:10.330
Now, brother Richard, Hastings, and Lord Stanley,

395
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:13.230
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,

396
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.570
And says that once more I shall interchange

397
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:18.730
My waned state for Henry's regal crown.

398
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.100
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas

399
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.230
And brought desired help from Burgundy:

400
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.630
What then remains, we being thus arrived

401
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.070
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,

402
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:37.100
But that we enter, as into our dukedom?

403
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:54.730
The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;

404
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.030
For many men that stumble at the threshold

405
00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:58.730
Are well foretold that danger lurks within.

406
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.570
Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:

407
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:06.430
By fair or foul means we must enter in,

408
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.630
For hither will our friends repair to us.

409
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.770
My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.

410
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:15.170
My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,

411
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:18.500
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;

412
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.800
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.

413
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.900
But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,

414
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.400
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.

415
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.270
True, my good lord; I know you for no less.

416
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.930
Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,

417
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:34.170
As being well content with that alone.

418
00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.070
But when the fox hath once got in his nose,

419
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.000
He'll soon find means to make the body follow.

420
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.400
Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?

421
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:47.000
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.

422
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:58.800
Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.

423
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.370
A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!

424
00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.030
The good old man would fain that all were well,

425
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.300
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,

426
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.870
I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade

427
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:12.870
Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

428
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:16.930
So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut

429
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:21.100
But in the night or in the time of war.

430
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.900
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;

431
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.800
For Edward will defend the town and thee,

432
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.000
And all those friends that deign to follow me.

433
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.170
(♪drums)

434
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.930
Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,

435
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:37.100
Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.

436
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.870
Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

437
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.600
To help King Edward in his time of storm,

438
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.970
As every loyal subject ought to do.

439
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.400
Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget

440
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.370
Our title to the crown and only claim

441
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:54.370
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.

442
00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.700
Then fare you well, for I will hence again:

443
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.870
I came to serve a king and not a duke.

444
00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:00.930
Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.

445
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:05.030
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile,  and we'll debate

446
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:08.070
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.

447
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.230
What talk you of debating? In few words,

448
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.370
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,

449
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:15.170
I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone

450
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.630
To keep them back that come to succor you:

451
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.070
Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?

452
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.600
(group) Ay!

453
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.800
Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?

454
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.370
Resolve yourself and let us claim the crown.

455
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.670
When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:

456
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.430
Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.

457
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:33.900
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.

458
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.970
And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.

459
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.030
Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:

460
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.000
The brut thereof will bring you many friends.

461
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.200
Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,

462
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.870
And Henry but usurps the diadem.

463
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.530
Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;

464
00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.600
And now will I be Edward's champion.

465
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.630
Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:

466
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.230
Come, master-mayor, make thou proclamation.

467
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.470
(trumpet sounds, crowd cheers)

468
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:25.000
Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of

469
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.770
England and France, and lord of Ireland.

470
00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:37.330
True and just heir, Duke of York, Earl of March and Ulster

471
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.470
And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,

472
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.270
By this I challenge him to single fight.

473
00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.470
(trumpet sounds. crowd cheers)

474
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.500
Long live Edward the Fourth!

475
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.300
Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:

476
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.200
If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.

477
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.530
Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;

478
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.870
And when the morning sun shall raise his car

479
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.900
Above the border of this horizon,

480
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.100
We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;

481
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.300
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.

482
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.300
Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,

483
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.470
And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.

484
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.170
(bells ring)

485
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.100
What counsel, lords?

486
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.200
For Edward now doth march amain to London;

487
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.170
And many giddy people flock to him.

488
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.900
Let's levy men, and beat him back again.

489
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.470
A little fire is quickly trodden out;

490
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.730
Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.

491
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.630
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,

492
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.230
Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,

493
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.570
Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,

494
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.370
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:

495
00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.400
Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,

496
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.000
Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find

497
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.200
Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:

498
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.100
And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,

499
00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.470
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.

500
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.300
My sovereign, with the loving citizens,

501
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.400
Like to his island girt in with the ocean,

502
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.770
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,

503
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.630
Shall rest in London till we come to him.

504
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.430
Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.

505
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.530
Farewell, my sovereign.

506
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.300
Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.

507
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.970
In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.

508
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:31.300
Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!

509
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.200
Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.

510
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.900
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.

511
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.000
Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,

512
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.970
And all at once, once more a happy farewell.

513
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.230
Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.

514
00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.100
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.

515
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.130
Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?

516
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.100
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field

517
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.430
Should not be able to encounter mine.

518
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.300
The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

519
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.170
That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:

520
00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.770
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,

521
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:27.000
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;

522
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.100
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,

523
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.070
My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,

524
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:39.470
My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;

525
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.030
I have not been desirous of their wealth,

526
00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.870
Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.

527
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:49.900
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:

528
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.130
Then why should they love Edward more than me?

529
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.400
No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:

530
00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.370
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,

531
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:02.030
The lamb will never cease to follow him.

532
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.570
Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?

533
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.900
Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;

534
00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.170
And once again proclaim us King of England.

535
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.200
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:

536
00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:26.300
Now stops thy spring; my sea shall suck them dry,

537
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:31.570
And swell so much the higher by their ebb.

538
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:37.900
Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.

539
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.430
And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course

540
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.800
Where peremptory Warwick now remains:

541
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.330
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,

542
00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:51.100
Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.

543
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.970
(♪drums and trumpets)

544
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.970
