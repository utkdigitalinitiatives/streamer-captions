WEBVTT

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
( blues music playing )

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Man:
 * I NEVER MEANT
 TO HURT YOU *

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
* NEVER MEANT
 TO MAKE YOU CRY *

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
* NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
* NEVER MEANT
 TO MAKE YOU CRY *

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
* NOW I'M LOST
 IN THIS HOUSE *

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
* AND I CAN'T
 REMEMBER WHY. *

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Ron Levine:
 THERE'S ALWAYS
 BEEN A FASCINATION

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
WITH THE DEEP SOUTH
 FOR ME,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
THIS KIND OF LIKE
 LOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIP
 WITH THE DEEP SOUTH.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I FEAR IT YET I HAVE
 THIS INSANE CURIOSITY

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
TO GO DOWN THERE
 AND PHOTOGRAPH PEOPLE.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
WE PHOTOGRAPHED
 ALLIGATOR WRESTLERS IN '95

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
AND THEN I HEARD
 THIS RADIO PIECE ON THIS
 GERIATRIC PRISON.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
FROM THERE
 IT JUST KIND OF...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
CATAPULTED INTO
 THIS EIGHT-YEAR ODYSSEY.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
THE FIRST PRISON WE
 WENT TO WAS HAMILTON A&I.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
THAT STANDS
 FOR THE HAMILTON INSTITUTE
 FOR THE AGED AND INFIRM.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
IT'S REALLY JUST A NURSING HOME
 WITH BARBED WIRE
 SURROUNDING IT.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
LOOSEN UP
A BIT ON THAT.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Levine:
 I TAKE PICTURES ABOUT THINGS
 I'M CURIOUS ABOUT.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
THIS IS WHAT I DO.
 I'M FASCINATED BY
 THIS LIFESTYLE.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'M ALLOWED ENTRANCE
 INTO THEIR WORLD BECAUSE
 OF THIS CAMERA I'M HOLDING.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
THE CAMERA IS
 THIS GREAT VISA THAT SAYS,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
"HEY, HERE'S YOUR TICKET
 TO ENTER THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
HERE'S A LIFESTYLE
 YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
HERE'S A LIFESTYLE
 NO ONE WILL LET YOU INTO.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
HERE'S A LIFESTYLE
 THAT'S NOT YOUR OWN.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
COME ON IN AND VISIT."

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING
 TO PASS ON TO THE PUBLIC

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
THROUGH THE BOOK,
 THROUGH THE EXHIBITION:

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
HERE'S YOUR VISA
 INTO THEIR LIVES
 THROUGH MY IMAGES.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Robert Braxton:
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A FANATIC FOR WORKING OUT.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
YOU'RE
IN AMAZING SHAPE.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Levine:
 ROBERT BRAXTON'S 63,
 HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S 53.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I MEAN, THE GUY KEEPS HIMSELF
 IN GREAT CONDITION.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
HE'S THE BIG GUY ON CAMPUS
 IN HAMILTON RIGHT NOW.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
HE'S 63 BUT NO ONE'S
 EVER GOING TO SCREW WITH HIM.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Braxton:
 I HAD A CHANCE ONE TIME TO GO
 MAYBE PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
PITCHING THE BALL,
 BUT MY ATTITUDE MESSED ME UP.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
- SEE? IT'S 11-7, SO 11-5?
- 11-5, THEN I'LL PUSH IT 1/3.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Braxton:
 YOU BE TENSED UP SOMETIME,
 STRESSED OUT SOMETIME.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I FIND THAT
 WEIGHTS AND WORKING OUT,
 THAT BURNS A LOT OF IT.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
YOU KNOW?
 TAKES A LOT OF TENSION,
 FRUSTRATION,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
KEEP YOU IN A GOOD MOOD.
 WHEN YOU FEEL GOOD PHYSICALLY,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
YOU FEEL GOOD MENTALLY,
 YOU KNOW?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
AND WHEN YOU'RE FEELING GOOD,
 YOU'RE ABLE TO DO GOOD.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
WHEN YOU'RE MISERABLE
 FEELING-- AMEN.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING FROM?
 YOU FEEL BAD.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
YOU FEEL REAL BAD.
 YOU DO BAD THINGS.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
( muttering )

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
GOOD.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
NICE!
 GOT IT.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
63.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Braxton:
 MOST OF THESE FOLKS
 SHOULD BE AT HOME, I SAY.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
 ELSE THERE. I BELIEVE THEY'VE
 BEEN BROKE.  I KNOW I'M BROKE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I'M QUITE SURE
 A LOT OF THEM GUYS IN
 THEIR CONDITION, THEY'RE BROKE.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
ALL THEY WANT TO DO IS
 CATCH ANOTHER FISH AND KISS
 THEIR GRANDKIDS, YOU KNOW.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
THEY AIN'T GOT THAT
 MANY MORE YEARS ON THIS EARTH,
 SOME OF THEM GUYS.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
AND I CAN LOOK AT IT AND SEE IT.
IT'S A SAD THING.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
LATELY, WHEN YOU GET OLD, MAN,
 YOU STARTED THINKING ABOUT
 A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
YOU KNOW
 WHERE I'M COMING FROM?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
YOU STARTED THINKING ABOUT,
 "IS THERE A HEAVEN OR A HELL?"

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
YOU START THINKING ABOUT THESE
 THINGS BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'RE
 GETTING NEAR THAT TIME.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
HEY, WHAT CAN I SAY, MAN?
I JUST BE TRYING,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
AND HOPE THAT ONE DAY I'LL BE
ABLE TO GET OUT OF HERE AGAIN,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
AND DO THE RIGHT THINGS
BEFORE I LEAVE THIS EARTH,
YOU KNOW?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I SURE HOPE SO.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
THERE WE GO.
ONE LIKE THIS-- GOOD.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
OKAY, THAT'S ONE.
 THAT'S GREAT.  ALL RIGHT,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
NOW: ONE, TWO, THREE.
ALL RIGHT.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
LET'S JUST SEE WHAT THIS LOOKS
LIKE AND THEN WE'LL START.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Levine:
 THE YOUNG GUYS IN HAMILTON A&I

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
ARE THERE BASICALLY
 TO TAKE CARE OF THE OLD GUYS.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
- THERE'S TEX.
- IS HE STILL HERE?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
NO, HE DIED
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Levine:
 THE FIRST TIME WE WENT IN,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
WE SAID WE MIGHT BE
 DOING A BOOK PROJECT.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
SO WHEN WE RETURN
 TO THE PRISONS NOW
 WITH THE BOOK,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
WE GET MUCH DIFFERENT
 SENTIMENT TOWARDS US,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE VERY
 WILLING TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED,
 MOST OF THE MEN NOW.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THEY WANT THEIR PICTURES TAKEN.
 THEY WANT THEIR STORIES TOLD.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
YOUR EYES RIGHT HERE.
YOUR EYES RIGHT IN THE LENS.
THANKS, GOOD.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Levine:
 ONE GUY KILLED HIS WIFE
 BECAUSE SHE WAS JEALOUS.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
AND WHEN WE ASKED HIM,
 "WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?"

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
HE GOES, "DAMN RIGHT
 I'D DO IT AGAIN!"

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
HE HAD NO REMORSE AT ALL,
 YOU KNOW?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
AND THEN YOU SEE THE OPPOSITE
 IN VICTOR HAMILTON,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
WHO IS SO REMORSEFUL,
 SO SAD,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
AND JUST SO PITIABLE
 WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT IT,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
THAT YOU CAN'T BUT
 FEEL EMPATHY FOR HIM.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
LIFE SENTENCE,
SO THAT MEANS THERE'S
NO CHANCE OF PAROLE.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THAT'S INSANE.
SO YOU'RE BASICALLY
GOING TO DIE IN PRISON.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
- RIGHT.
- WHY DID THEY GIVE YOU
 A LIFE SENTENCE?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
BECAUSE I WAS A PARAMEDIC.
THAT INCENSED THE JUDGE.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
- WHY?
- BECAUSE MY
 PROFESSIONAL CALLING

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
WAS TO SAVE LIVES,
NOT TO TAKE IT.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
BUT ALL OF THAT KIND OF
GOES UP IN SMOKE

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
WHEN YOU'RE USING DRUGS.
THAT'S EXACTLY--

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I HAVE A SCAR
ON MY HAND RIGHT HERE
WHERE I INJECTED DRUGS.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I WAS DIVORCED.
 I MOVED IN WITH A GIRL
 THAT WAS A GO-GO GIRL.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AND WE BECAME KIND
 OF SOUL MATES.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I ASKED HER,
 PLEASE DON'T BRING

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
DRUG DEALERS
 TO THIS HOUSE.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
THIS IS OUR HAVEN--
 OUR SAFE HAVEN.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
THAT'S WHEN THIS WHOLE
 SITUATION STARTED.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
IT ESCALATED FROM AN ARGUMENT
 TO A SLAP FIGHT TO...

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
SHE STRUCK ME WITH A HAMMER
 AND I TOOK IT AWAY FROM HER.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
AND SHE HAD A LITTLE
ASTRA .380 AUTOMATIC PISTOL,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
AND THAT'S WHAT--
I WENT OFF THE DEEP END.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I STRUCK HER WITH THE HAMMER,
 AND SHE DIED FROM HER INJURIES.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
SO I'M TOTALLY
 RESPONSIBLE FOR IT.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I'VE MADE MY BED
 AND NOW I'M LYING IN IT.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I STILL MISS HER.
 I STILL MISS HER.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
- YOUR WHOLE LIFE
 IS HERE, YOU KNOW?
- THAT'S THE WHOLE DEAL?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
THAT'S EVERYTHING.
THAT'S ALL YOUR TOILETRIES
AND ALL YOUR STORE ITEMS

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
AND ALL THAT'S PILED INTO
THIS BOX. THAT'S WHAT'S YOU--
LITERALLY, YOU LIVE OUT OF.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
BECAUSE OF THE LOW CEILINGS--
YOU CAN TOUCH THE CEILING.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
THEY'RE DOUBLE BUNKS
BUT THIS GUY CAN'T SIT UP.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
HE HAS TO SIT LIKE THIS.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
THERE ARE TWO
THINGS THAT CAN'T HAPPEN.
I CAN'T GET ANY CLOSURE,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
YOU CAN'T EVER SIT DOWN
FACE TO FACE AND LOOK
IN HER EYES

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
AND SAY,
"I'M REALLY SORRY FOR THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PROMPTED IT.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I DON'T ASK YOUR FORGIVENESS,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
ALL I WANT YOU TO DO
IS LISTEN TO ME."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT OPTION'S GONE.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
HOW DO YOU APOLOGIZE
 TO SOMEBODY WHOSE LIFE
 YOU'VE TAKEN?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
WHAT JUSTIFIES IT?
 HOW DO YOU RATIONALIZE IT?
 YOU CAN'T.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
YOU CAN SIT HERE AND GO THROUGH
 EVERY WORD IN THE DICTIONARY

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
AND YOU CAN'T COME UP
 WITH THE APPROPRIATE
 THING TO SAY

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
TO SOMEONE WHOSE LIFE
 YOU'VE TAKEN.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
OR TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.
 NOTHING FITS.  NOTHING.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
IT'S A TENSION.
 IT'S ALMOST A--

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
A FORCE FIELD OF TENSION
 AND HOPELESSNESS.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS CAMP IS PARTICULARLY.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
HAMILTON A&I-- THE JOKE IS
IT'S HAMILTON "LAY AND DIE."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE A FAMILY.
 BUT THEN AGAIN,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
 IT'S US AGAINST THE WORLD
 IN SOME SITUATIONS.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
THAT PEOPLE HAVE
 OSTRACIZED US

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
AND WE'RE THE GARBAGE
 OF SOCIETY.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
WE'RE STILL HUMAN BEINGS.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I WOULD HATE TO THINK
 THAT I WAS BORN

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
AND WENT THROUGH MY WHOLE LIFE
 TO END UP IN PRISON FOR MURDER.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
THAT DOESN'T FIT.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
BUT IT SEEMS A WASTE
TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
AND ACCOMPLISHING
NOTHING-- NOTHING.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
JUST A WASTE OF TIME,
A WASTE OF TAXPAYER'S MONEY.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
IF I'D KNOWN I WAS
GOING TO HAVE TO BE HERE
ALL THIS TIME,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I WISH THEY'D JUST CARRIED
ME OUT TO THE PARKING LOT
AND SHOT ME IN THE HEAD.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
WHO PLANNED ON
 COMING TO PRISON?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
SO, YOU HAVE THIS SHOOT.
EVERYTHING COMES OUT.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
ALL THE PICTURES ARE GREAT.
TRANSPORTATION'S GOOD.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
YOUR RECORDERS
WHILE YOU WERE HERE WERE GOOD.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
EVERYTHING'S WORKING ON TIME,
ON BUDGET, ON EVERYTHING,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
AND THEN YOU CELEBRATE.
YOU'RE OUT RIDING AROUND.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
YOU HAVE MAYBE ONE
OR TWO DRINKS TOO MUCH

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
AND IT IMPAIRS YOUR REACTION
TIME AND YOUR VISION.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
YOU BUST AN INTERSECTION.
YOU KILL SOMEBODY IN ANOTHER CAR

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
OR KILL SOMEBODY IN YOUR CAR.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
- IN ALABAMA,
 THAT'S VEHICULAR MURDER.
- RIGHT.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
THAT'S IT.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Jerry Jackson:
 THAT WAS A SATURDAY NIGHT
 PARTY.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH
 TO DRINK AND HAD A CAR WRECK.
 BROTHER GOT KILLED--

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
MY BABY BROTHER.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
HE WAS AT THAT TIME... 29.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
A LOT OF TIMES
 I WISH THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
 ME DIED INSTEAD OF HIM.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
ME AND HIM WAS
IN SOME WAYS SO CLOSE,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
SO THAT'S WHY IT WAS
SO HARD WHEN HE DIED,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
YOU KNOW,
FOR ME TO ACCEPT IT.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AND MY MOM AND THEM,
THEY WOULDN'T LET ME GO
TO THE FUNERAL,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
SO I NEVER DID GET
A CLOSING IN THE SITUATION.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
AND I FINALLY GOT ENOUGH NERVE
 TO GO TO THE CEMETERY.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
AND NOTHING COULD COME OUT.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I COULDN'T SAY NOTHING.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I JUST STOOD THERE

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
FOR 4 HOURS.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
PEOPLE SAY HOW THEY FEEL
WHEN THEY SHOOT SOMEBODY,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
SOMEBODY YOU DON'T KNOW,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN
TO SOMEBODY YOU KNOW,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
AND YOU'RE CLOSE TO HIM,
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
A PERSON GOES THROUGH.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO BE
IN MY PRISON THE REST OF MY LIFE

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
AND IT DON'T
 HAVE WALLS ON IT.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
SO THAT'S WHAT HURTS
 THE MOST, YOU KNOW?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I GOT TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE
 THE REST OF MY LIFE.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
THAT I'M THE CAUSE
 OF MY BROTHER'S DEATH.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
SO, YOU KNOW,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
THAT'S MY ISSUE.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Levine:
GOOD. I LIKE THE BLACK
AND WHITE ON HIM.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
- Assistant: YOU WANT BLACK?
- YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT.
 THAT'S GREAT.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
HOW ABOUT A SMILE
TO GET THAT TOOTH?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
YEAH, YEAH, OH YEAH.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
PERFECT. JUST KIND OF
COCK YOUR HEAD A TOUCH.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Jackson:
 I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND SAID
 I GOT EXACTLY 10 MONTHS.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I TOLD MY WIFE
IT DOESN'T MATTER

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
IF I GET OUT BEFORE SCHOOL'S OUT
OR THROUGH THE SCHOOL DAYS,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I'M TAKING OUT THE KIDS
 AND WE'RE GOING TO FLORIDA.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
YOU CAN BE READY OR NOT.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Levine:
OKAY. THAT'S GREAT.
YOU'RE COOKED, SIR.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
SO SHE SAID, "WELL, I ALWAYS
KEEP OUR BAG PACKED, DEAR."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
FLORIDA, I'M COMING.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Man:
 * LORD, I'M LOOKING

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
* LORD, FOR THE ROAD

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
* LEAD ME HOME

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
* I'VE BEEN SEARCHING

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
* NIGHT AND DAY

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
* LORD, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
* I LOST MY WAY

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
* TELL ME WHERE

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
* LORD, IS THE ROAD?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
* I WANT TO GO HOME.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Michael Wou:
THIS ONE SEEMS PUNCHIER. WE GET
BETTER CONTRAST AND EVERYTHING.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
IT REALLY BRINGS OUT
ALL HIS WRINKLES
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Levine:
 YOU'RE STARING
 INTO A GUY'S FACE

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
THAT IS FOUR TIMES
 THE SIZE OF LIFE-SIZE.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
AND YOU CAN'T HELP BUT JUST
 KIND OF BE AWED BY IT.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
AND BE AWED BY THE FACT THAT
 HE LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER
 OLD GUY ON THE STREET.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
YOU DON'T KNOW HE'S AN INMATE.
 YOU DON'T KNOW HE'S A MURDERER
 OR A PEDOPHILE.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
HE'S JUST A HUMAN BEING.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
YOU JUST LOOK AT HIM AND SAY,
 "THERE'S AN OLD MAN."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
HOWEVER, THEN YOU READ
 WHAT THEY'RE IN FOR,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
AND YOU'RE EITHER REPULSED,
 OR YOU GO, "OH MY GOD,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
HE COULD BE
 MY GREAT GRANDFATHER."

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
THEY WERE BOTH BROUGHT
IN A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
HAMILTON IS 70 OR 71.
JACKSON'S ONLY 51,
HE'S A YOUNG GUY.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
- OKAY, OKAY. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- BUT EQUALLY GOOD STORIES.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
YEAH, THE DETAIL'S AMAZING
ON THAT CAMERA.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Levine:
 MICHAEL WOU IS A GREAT
 GRAPHIC DESIGNER, FIRST OF ALL.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
WE'VE WORKED
 SINCE THE EARLY '90s
 ON COMMERCIAL PROJECTS,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
AND WE'VE WON A LOT
 OF AWARDS TOGETHER.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
ON THIS PROJECT,
 MICHAEL AND I HAVE BEEN
 COLLABORATING SINCE DAY ONE.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
WE DECIDED, LET'S TRY TO GET
 AN EXHIBITION TOGETHER,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
WITH THE LARGE PRINTS.
 LET'S TRY TO GET A BOOK
 TOGETHER

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
AND TELL THIS UNTOLD STORY
 TO THE PUBLIC.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
SIMON'S GOOD, THIS GUY HERE.
I PROCESSED--

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Wou:
 WE ARE RIDING A VERY FINE LINE.
 BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
IF I WAS
 ON THE VICTIM'S SIDE,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I WOULD BE VERY
 ANGRY AND WANT THESE GUYS
 TO BE PUT AWAY FOREVER.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
KNOWING THEIR STORIES,
COMING FACE TO FACE,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
ALMOST LIVING WITH THEM,
YOU SEE A WHOLE OTHER
SIDE TO IT.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.
WE DON'T WANT TO DEMONIZE THEM,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
BUT WE DON'T WANT
TO GLORIFY THEM. SO IT'S ALWAYS
RIDING THE FINE LINE.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO
IS LET EVERYONE MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MINDS,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
MAKE UP THEIR OWN DECISION.
 WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THIS
 IS UP TO YOU.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I STILL THINK WE
GO WITH THESE SHOTS
OF CALVIN FROM '97.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Wou:
HE'S LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.
HE'S LOST SOME TEETH TOO.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
- IS HE STILL SINGING?
- STILL SINGING.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Calvin Selman:
 I BEEN IN PRISON
 EVER SINCE '68.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
HAMILTON IS THE BEST
 SYSTEM I'VE BEEN TO.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
- YOU'RE IN PRISON--
- UH-HUH.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
BECAUSE OF THE OLD CRIME
YOU DONE, BACK IN WHAT?
ABOUT 1960...

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
- '67.
- 1967?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
- UH-HUH.
- JUST BRIEFLY,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
IF YOU WANT TO,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
TELL A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT IT. AND THEN,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
YOU WROTE
THIS SONG ABOUT IT.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I WROTE
TWO SONG ABOUT IT.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
DO YOU MIND SINGING
 ONE OF THEM SONGS?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
* I'M DOWN IN KILBY PRISON
DOING LIFE WITH NO PAROLE *

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
* MURDERED TWO GOOD PEOPLE
AND I DIDN'T HAVE NO CAUSE *

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
* I WAS DRINKING
 BEER AND WHISKEY *

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
* TAKING DOPE,
 SO DON'T YOU SEE? *

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
* THAT'S THE REASON WHY
 THEY GAVE ME LIFE *

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
* INSTEAD OF KILLING ME

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
* IF I COULD LIVE MY LIFE OVER
 I KNOW THAT I WOULD CHANGE *

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
* I KNOW I WOULD
 NOT KILL NO ONE *

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
* FOR IT'S A DIRTY SHAME

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
* I WOULD NOT DRINK
 ANY WHISKEY, TAKE NO DOPE,
 DRINK NO BEER *

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000
* THAT'S THE HONEST REASON WHY
THAT I HAVE LIFE IN HERE. *

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, CALVIN.
WHEN DID YOU WRITE THAT SONG?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I WROTE IT IN 1968.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A MOVIE STAR, I BETCHA.
THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE THIS,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
SEND IT OFF TO HOLLYWOOD.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
ME AND YOU,
WE'LL GO TO HOLLYWOOD.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
- WE'LL GO TO HOLLYWOOD.
- YEAH.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
JUST TURN YOUR HEAD
TOWARDS ME A BIT.
THAT'S GREAT.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
AND AGAIN. GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO NOW?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
PUT THE COFFEE CUP DOWN.
WE'RE JUST GOING TO PHOTOGRAPH
YOUR HANDS.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Billy Owen:
 A LOT OF THESE GUYS
 WILL DIE HERE.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
A LARGE PORTION
 OF THE OLDER INMATES

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
HAVE SPENT THE LARGEST PART
 OF THEIR LIFE IN PRISON.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AND THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS--
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM
TO EVER GET A PAROLE

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA
AND THEY'LL END UP DYING HERE.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Levine:
 YOU KNOW WHAT
 WE'RE GOING TO DO?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME
POLAROIDS AND SEND YOU SOME
PICTURES IN A FEW MONTHS.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Owen:
 THEY REALIZE, AT THEIR
 POINT IN TIME IN LIFE,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
IF THEY COULD TELL THEIR STORY,
 IF THEY COULD SHOW THEIR
 PICTURE TO A YOUNG MAN,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
AND MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND THIS
 IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU AFTER 20
 OR 30 OR 40 YEARS OF CRIME,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I THINK THEY'D LIKE
 TO MAKE THAT POINT.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
RIGHT OVER HERE.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
MR. DAVIS!
YOU SEE, I DIDN'T
FORGET YOU.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
- YOU FORGOT ME.
- I DIDN'T FORGET YOU AT ALL.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I KNOW YOU AIN'T.
THE REST OF THEM FORGOT ME.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
NO, NO, WE'RE GOING
 TO GET A PICTURE OF YOU

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET AS MANY
POLAROIDS AS YOU WANT, OKAY?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Wou:
 RON'S UNIQUE TAKE
 ON PHOTOGRAPHY

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
IS THAT HE ALWAYS MANAGES

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
TO BRING OUT THE BEST
 IN A PERSON-- WHAT I MEAN BY
 THE BEST IN A PERSON,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
I'M NOT SAYING TO MAKE EVERYONE
 LOOK LIKE A MOVIE STAR.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I'M JUST SAYING, TO FIND OUT
 WHO THIS PERSON IS IN ESSENCE,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
WHO THIS PERSON TRULY IS,
 AND TO BRING THAT OUT
 IN A PERSON.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
- Levine: I TELL YOU.
- Wou: YOU CAN JUST FEEL THINGS.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I KNOW. I CAN.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Wou:
 THEY ARE NO WAY DEMONIZED.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
THEY ARE NO WAY GLORIFIED.
 THAT IS HIS TALENT.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Levine:
HOW DID YOU END UP IN
THE PREDICAMENT YOU'RE IN NOW?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
HOW DID YOU END UP
SHOOTING HER?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
- FIRST TIME I HIT HER
 RIGHT IN THERE.
- OH!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
NEXT TIME I HIT HER TWICE
IN THE STOMACH, AND A HALF INCH
FROM HER HEART.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
IF SHE HADN'T BEEN DRINKING,
SHE WOULD'VE DIED.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
BUT I STILL CARE FOR HER.
I AIN'T GOING TO LIE.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
- Levine: SHE DIDN'T DIE?
- HUH-UH.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
THEY SAID IF SHE HADN'T
BEEN DRINKING,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
SHE WOULD'VE
DIED THOUGH.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Gary Pinyon:
 I NEVER BEEN IN TROUBLE
 BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
MATTER OF FACT, I WAS IN LAW
 ENFORCEMENT FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I BEEN ON BOTH SIDES NOW.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
AND HOW ABOUT PUTTING
THE CHIN DOWN A LITTLE MORE.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
GOOD. THAT'S GREAT.
LET'S TRY IT WITH THE HAT OFF.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
JUST TAKE THE HAT OFF
 AND PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS.
 GOOD.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Pinyon:
 I BEEN LOCKED UP
 ABOUT 14 YEARS NOW.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OKAY, THAT'S NICE.
GREAT. GREAT.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
WE'LL JUST SHOOT
A LITTLE BIT HIGHER
ON THE TREE.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
GOOD.
THAT'S NICE.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Pinyon:
 I GOT A LIFE SENTENCE.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I GOT A LIFE SENTENCE.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE
HOW HE GOT IN THERE TOO.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
HE FELL IN LOVE
WITH THE WRONG WOMAN,
I THINK.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
FELL IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN
WANTED TO...

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
SHE WANTED TO HAVE
HER HUSBAND KILLED.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
HE SAID IT TOOK HER
ABOUT A YEAR.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
- BEFORE SHE TALKED HIM INTO IT.
- AND THEN HE HIRED A HIT MAN
 TO DO THE JOB.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
SHE WAS AN ABUSED WOMAN.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
SHE WAS ABUSED REAL BAD.
AND THAT'S...

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
ONE OF THE REASONS
I HELPED HER DO IT.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE
THINK IT WAS THE MONEY.
MONEY NEVER MADE ME HAPPY.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I WAS GOING THROUGH
A REAL BAD TIME IN MY LIFE THEN,
THAT'S WHY I LEFT MY WIFE.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I WASN'T HAPPY WITH ANYTHING.
I WASN'T HAPPY WITH EVEN MYSELF.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I JUST--
NOTHING MADE ME HAPPY.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
LIKE I SAY, I'VE BEEN MORE
CONTENT NOW THAN I'VE EVER HAVE
IN MY LIFE I GUESS.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
NOT THAT I'M LOCKED UP,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE
TO BE, IN PRISON.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
BUT I THINK I'D BE REAL
HAPPY ON THE STREET,
IF I EVER GET OUT.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I'D BE CONTENT
IN MOST ANYTHING I DID.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
WE WAS PUTTING OUT SQUASH,
SETTING OUT SQUASH.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
WE GOT ABOUT...

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
400 PLANTS
WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
I GOT FIVE ROWS
AND I USUALLY GET ABOUT
2500 LBS. A SEASON OFF OF THEM.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
THEY PLANTED 200 LBS.
OF SWEET POTATOES

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
AND WE'LL PROBABLY GET
ABOUT 3,000 LBS. OFF OF THEM,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
WHICH DON'T LAST LONG
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FEED
300 PEOPLE.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
HUNGRY MOUTHS.
SOMETHING FRESH
OUT OF THE GARDEN.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
- Man: HOW MANY DO YOU GOT?
- 39.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Levine:
 YOU BASICALLY BECOME
 POWERLESS IN PRISON,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
BECAUSE YOU LOSE YOUR POWER
 IN PRISON ANYWAY TO RUN
 YOUR LIFE.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
EVERYTHING IS DONE FOR YOU.
 YOU'RE TOLD WHEN TO COME
 FOR BREAKFAST,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
YOU'RE TOLD WHEN TO COME
 FOR PILL CALL.  YOU'RE TOLD
 BY THE OTHER INMATES

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO,
 IF YOU'RE AN OLDER FEEBLE GUY.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
AND YOU SEE THAT
 IN SOME OF THESE OLD GUYS.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
THEY'RE VERY HAPPY JUST TO SIT
 IN FRONT OF THE TV ALL DAY,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
WATCH "COURT TV"
 OR WATCH CRIME SHOWS,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
PLAY PINOCHLE OR DOMINOES,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
SMOKE THEIR CIGARETTES,
 GO BACK INTO THEIR BUNK,
 TAKE A NAP.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
IT'S LIKE AN OLD AGE HOME.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
IT IS AN OLD AGE HOME
 BASICALLY-- THEY'RE BEING
 TAKEN CARE OF,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
THEY'RE BEING CATERED TO,
 BEING GIVEN THEIR MEALS

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
AT 5:00 A.M.,
 11:00 A.M. AND 4:00 P.M.,
 PUT TO BED AT 6:00.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
AND THAT'S THEIR LIFE
 FOR THE NEXT 30, 40 YEARS,
 OR UNTIL THEY DIE.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
SO YOU FEEL POWERLESS,
 YOU PROBABLY FEEL EMPTY,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
AND YOU FEEL HOPELESS.
 THAT AGES YOU,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
THAT DETERIORATES YOU,
 YOU WIND UP IN THE INFIRMARY,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
YOU DIE AT 65 OR 70.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
* MY, MY, MY,
 MY, MY, MY, MY OH. *

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Jay Boyett:
WE'RE LINING UP RIGHT HERE
FOR PILL CALL.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
WE DO PILL CALL HERE
ABOUT FIVE TIMES A DAY.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
 ABOUT ANY KIND OF ILLNESS

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
THAT THERE IS
 HERE AT THIS CAMP.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
THANK YOU.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Cheryl Cofield:
 I HAVE SEVERAL SCHIZOPHRENICS,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
SCHIZO-AFFECTIVE,
I HAVE BI-POLAR.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I HAVE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE
WITH PSYCHOSIS.
I HAVE P.T.S.D.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
I HAVE DEPRESSION,
ANXIETY, PANIC DISORDER.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
WE HAVE SEVERAL THAT HAVE
 DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
AND THEY GO THE SAME ROUTE AS
 SOMEONE IN A NURSING HOME

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
OR HOSPITAL WITH THAT.
 THERE'S JUST NOT A WHOLE LOT
 YOU CAN DO

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
WHEN THEY COME
 TO THAT STAGE OF LIFE.
 JUST MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
THEY KNOW THEY'RE NOT
 GOING ANYWHERE.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
IT'S HARD TO HAVE HOPE

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE
 NOT GOING ANY PLACE.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
YOU'RE HERE FOREVER.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
A YOUNGER PRISONER COSTS
ABOUT $20,000 A YEAR TO KEEP,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
WHEREAS AN OLDER ONE
IS $60,000 TO $75,000,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
JUST BECAUSE OF ALL
OF THE MEDICAL COSTS.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
OF COURSE,
 THEY NEED THE OXYGEN.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
THEY NEED THE DOCTORS.
 THEY NEED THE NURSES.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
THEY NEED ALL SORTS
 OF SPECIAL EQUIPMENT,
 FROM CRUTCHES TO WHEELCHAIRS.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
THEY NEED PRETTY MUCH
 24-HOUR CARE.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Dr. Wyndol Hamer:
 WE SEE EVERYTHING FROM
 SEVERE DIABETES

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
TO INFECTIONS TO TUMORS,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
HYPERTENSION,
CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
MENTAL ILLNESS,
JUST THE WHOLE GAMUT.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
NOW THIS IS
DIABETIC NEUROPATHY.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
- I DON'T THINK--
- NEUROPATHY--
 YEAH, IT'S DIABETES.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
THAT LOOKS BETTER,
 I THINK.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
CLOSE YOUR EYES,
DON'T CHEAT ON ME.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I'M NOT GOING TO STAB YOU.
I JUST WANT YOU TO TELL ME
IF YOU FEEL SOMETHING.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
- WHAT ABOUT THAT?
- Patient: NO.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
- THAT?
- YEAH.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
- THAT?
- NO.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
- NOW?
- NO.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Hamer:
 MOST ALL OF THESE
 HAVE CHRONIC DISEASE

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE HERE.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
THEY'RE ALL

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
GROUPED INTO THIS
INFIRMARY SITUATION,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
HOUSED TOGETHER.
 THEY TEND TO TRADE INFECTIONS.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE
 AN ARMY OR A NURSING HOME,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
BECAUSE OF STAPH INFECTIONS
 AND BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ARE
 EASILY SPREAD BY CONTACT.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Autrey Nichols:
 I HAVE CRONE'S DISEASE.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
IT'S A TYPE OF CANCER.
THEY SAY IT'S WORSE
THAN ACTUAL CANCER

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
BECAUSE IT ATTACKS
EVERY ORGAN IN YOUR BODY.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
SO IT'S DEADLY.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
THEY GIVE ME A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF TIME TO LIVE.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
SO FAR I'VE OUTLIVED--

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I'VE LIVED FOUR YEARS LONGER
 THAN THEY SAID I WOULD.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
BUT I'M A STRONG-WILLED
 PERSON.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
MULE HEADED IS WHAT
 MY DADDY USED TO CALL ME.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
SO I'M PRETTY STRONG WILLED,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'LL DIE
 IN PENITENTIARY.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I WANT TO GO HOME TO MY FAMILY,
 AND, YOU KNOW,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
HOPEFULLY LIVE THAT LONG
 TO GO HOME AND DIE AT HOME,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
IN MY OWN BED.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
SO THIS PLACE HAS
CHANGED SINCE '99, HUH?
'CAUSE THIS ROOM WASN'T HERE.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
YEAH, WHEN YOU
WERE HERE LAST,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
THIS ROOM HERE HOUSED
 THE HEALTHY INMATES.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
EXACTLY.
 I REMEMBER THAT.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
WE'VE HAD TO EXPAND IT.
 WE'VE GOT 21 GUYS HERE.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
ONE OF THEM, RIGHT NOW,
IS ON HIS DEATHBED
RIGHT OVER HERE.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
HE'S NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE
VERY MUCH LONGER AT ALL.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
OKAY, SO FRANKIE,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
A READING?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
5.6, STRONG, ALMOST 8.
YOU WANT ME TO CLOSE AT 8?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
NO, WE WON'T--
BECAUSE WE WON'T NEED TO.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
WE'RE GONNA LOAD...
LOCK AND LOAD.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
AND LOOK RIGHT
IN THE LENS.
GOOD.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Levine:
 MR. WHITLEY, WHY DON'T YOU
 TELL US YOUR FULL NAME?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
- BOYD WHITLEY.
- AND HOW OLD ARE YOU,
  MR. WHITLEY?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Whitely:
 80, I'LL BE 80 IN AUGUST.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Levine:
 OKAY, GREAT.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
NOW, YOU'RE HERE
IN THE HOSPITAL

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
BECAUSE, WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT DID THEY FIND OUT?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
THERE'S CANCER IN ME,
IN HERE.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
- IN THE ESOPHAGUS.
- YEAH.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
IT'S A LITTLE TUMOR.
THEY SAID, ABOUT THAT BIG,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
IN BETWEEN MY HEART
AND MY ESOPHAGUS.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
IT GOT IT PUSHED TOGETHER AND I
GOT A HOLE IN MY ESOPHAGUS.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
IF I TRY TO SWALLOW,
IT MISSES--

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
IT MISSES THE BELLY
AND GOES IN THROUGH THE HOLE.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Levine:
AND MEANWHILE, THEY GOT YOU
EATING OUT OF A TUBE.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
OKAY, I SEE, I SEE.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I THINK OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS,
 IT'LL WILL TURN

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
MORE INTO
 A CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL,
 MORE THAN ANYTHING.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE FUTURE
 OF THE PRISON SYSTEM.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE
 CARE OF THE OLD GUYS.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
IF YOU KEEP PUTTING GUYS
 INTO PRISON AND THEY KEEP
 GROWING OLD IN PRISON,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
AND CUT BACK ON THE PAROLES
 AND THE PARDONS,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
 THESE OLD GUYS IN EVERY STATE.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRISON
 LIKE THIS IN EVERY STATE.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Wou:
 THIS IS WHAT SOCIETY
 IS PAYING FOR.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY
INMATES ARE IN THERE,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
THAT ARE IN THE ELDERLY
POPULATION,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
WE'RE TALKING THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
AND WHAT IS THAT
 ALL COSTING US?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
SO THERE'S GOT TO BE
 A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Levine:
 BACK IN '97,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
WE DECIDED, "WELL, WE'VE GOT
 TO GET SOME OTHER PRISONS
 IN HERE.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT
 A MORE GLOBAL STORY."

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
AND SO

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
I DECIDED TO START
 PHOTOGRAPHING IN CANADA.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
WE PHOTOGRAPHED IN ARCHAMBAULT.
 WE PHOTOGRAPHED A COUPLE
 OTHER PRISONS IN QUEBEC.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
WE PHOTOGRAPHED
 A COUPLE OF WOMEN'S PRISONS
 OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
AND THEN WE PHOTOGRAPHED
 IN WARKWORTH.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
IT'S JUST ABOUT
 TWO HOURS OUT OF TORONTO.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
INITIALLY
 WE WENT THERE IN '99.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
IT'S A STANDARD PRISON.
 IT'S BASICALLY A HUGE
 PRISON FACILITY,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
HUGE STEEL GATES, CEMENT WALLS.
 NOTHING LIKE HAMILTON AT ALL.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
NOW WARKWORTH IS THE LARGEST
 PENITENTIARY IN CANADA.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
IT'S ONLY 600 INMATES,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
THAT'S LIKE
 A MINISCULE PENITENTIARY
 IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
BUT WARKWORTH IS A PLACE
 WHERE THEY SEEM

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
TO SEGREGATE MOST
 OF THE ELDERLY INMATES
 FROM ACROSS CANADA.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
IN FACT, THEY STARTED
 A SENIORS' GROUP IN WARKWORTH

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
BECAUSE OF THAT,
 BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY
 ELDERLY INMATES.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Don Campbell:
 DO YOU WANT THE GLOVE UP?
 OR ANYTHING DIFFERENT?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Levine:
 NO, JUST LIKE THAT'S NICE.
 THAT'S GREAT.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?
 DON, GET THE LEGS
 A LITTLE CLOSER TOGETHER,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
MAYBE TURN YOUR BODY
A BIT MORE THAT WAY.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
THAT'S IT.  THAT'S GOOD.
 LET'S SEE HOW THAT LOOKS.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
DON CAMPBELL IS THE DIRECTOR
 OF THE SENIORS' GROUP AT
 THE WARKWORTH PRISON.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Campbell:
 THERE'S 174 LIFERS
 HERE RIGHT NOW.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
AND HOW MANY
 IN THE ELDERLY GROUP?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
THERE'S ABOUT 170,
AND IT'S NOT THE SAME NUMBERS,
OF COURSE.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
- THERE'S A CROSSOVER?
- BUT YES.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
FOR ABOUT 23 YEARS,
 I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
OF AN ORGANIZATION
 FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY
 HANDICAPPED.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
ONE EVENING IN JANUARY 1998,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
AFTER A CAR CRASH,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I WAS CHARGED
WITH FIRST DEGREE MURDER.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I'M NOW SERVING LIFE 25,
WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER APPEAL

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
FOR BOTH THE SENTENCE
AND THE CONVICTION.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
I'M IN THE NON-SMOKING
80-MAN UNIT

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
AND I'M INVOLVED IN WORK
AT THE LIBRARY.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I DO A NUMBER
OF SPECIAL PROJECTS
AROUND THE INSTITUTION,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
SUCH AS THE HEALTH FAIR
AND RUNNING VARIOUS SYMPOSIUMS,

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
SUCH AS
 THE SENIORS' SYMPOSIUM.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
THIS IS THE 2004 HEALTH FAIR,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
AND THIS IS THE FOURTH YEAR
WE'VE HELD THIS EVENT.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
HEALTH CARE IS
A MAJOR CONCERN

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
TO INDIVIDUALS
THAT ARE AGING IN PRISON.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
AND IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO
 DEAL WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
THAT HAVE HEALTH CONCERNS
 AND WANT TO GET BETTER ADVICE

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
AND INFORMATION ON HEALTH.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
WE'RE EXPECTING OVER
 400 MEN HERE THIS AFTERNOON
 FROM THE POPULATION.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
FELLOWS THAT ARE CONCERNED
 ABOUT DIABETES AND THEIR
 HEART AND STROKE,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
AND THIS IS OF MAJOR
 CONSEQUENCE TO THE PEOPLE.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Levine:
 I THINK IN CANADA

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
WHAT WE'VE NOTICED IS THAT
 THEY TRY TO REHABILITATE
 THE INMATES,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
MORE THAN THEY HAVE
 IN THE STATES.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
THEY TRY TO WEAN THE PRISONERS
 OUT OF THE PRISON SYSTEM,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
SO EVENTUALLY THEY CAN
 GO TO HALFWAY HOMES,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
EVENTUALLY THEY CAN BE CITIZENS
 AGAIN ON THE OUTSIDE.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
IN WARKWORTH, WHAT THEY HAD

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
WAS THIS AREA
 CALLED THE CORCAN AREA.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
THERE'S A BARBERSHOP.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
THERE'S CAR REPAIR.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
THERE'S ENGINE REBUILDING.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
THEY TEACH THE INMATES
 CABINETMAKING.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
AND THERE WAS ALSO
 A CAR BODY SHOP.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
ONE OF THE SIDELINES
THAT THE CORCAN OPERATION

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
CAN SOMETIMES GET INVOLVED IN
IS COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECTS.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
THAT BRINGS A WHOLE DIFFERENT
DIMENSION OF LEARNING
FOR THE INMATES.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
THE FIRE TRUCK,
 FOR INSTANCE,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
IT'S ONE OF MANY THEY'VE DONE
 IN THE PAST FOR VARIOUS
 COMMUNITY GROUPS.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
AND IT GIVES THE INMATES
 A REAL SENSE OF FULFILLMENT
 FROM DOING THAT,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
AS WELL AS GIVING BACK
 TO THE COMMUNITY.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
RIGHT OVER HERE.
THAT'S GOOD, GUYS.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
LET ME TAKE A FAST LOOK
INSIDE THERE.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
NOW WE SEE THE CAB
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER.
SO...

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
GONNA GET
 SOME GUY IN THERE.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Levine:
 IT'S A UNIQUE OBJECTIVE
 FOR THE PRISON SYSTEM

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
TO ACTUALLY GIVE THESE GUYS
 A TRADE, SO WHEN THEY
 GET OUT THERE,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
THEY CAN BE MEMBERS
 OF SOCIETY AGAIN.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
SO THEY WON'T BE
 WITHOUT A TRADE

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
AFTER BEING IN PRISON
 FOR 15, 20 YEARS,
 LIKE ED FRANCIS.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Edward Francis:
 I WAS A PRODUCT OF
 THE CHILDREN'S AID SOCIETY,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
BECAUSE OF MY DAD'S DRINKING.
 I SPENT A LOT OF YEARS

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
ON THE STREETS
 AS A YOUNG MAN,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
AND I HAD A HOME TO GO TO.
IT'S NOT LIKE I GOT KICKED OUT.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I HAD A HOME TO GO TO,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT
AT THE TIME.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME.
I'D SEE ME IN THE WINTERTIME

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
IN THE HALLWAYS,
SHAKING, COLD, HUNGRY,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO HOME.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID TO GO HOME.
I WAS TERRIFIED TO GO HOME.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
AND SO I THINK SEXUAL ABUSE,
 VERBAL ABUSE,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
PHYSICAL ABUSE,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
JUST MENTAL ABUSE--
 FOR YEARS AND YEARS OF MY LIFE.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Levine:
 I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE GOT
 SOME INTERESTING TATTOOS.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
- YOU KNOW WHAT--
- OH, THAT'S GREAT.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
THE CROW IS ACTUALLY--

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
- I'M OJIBWAY, EH?
- SURE.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
AND THE CROW
IS MY SPIRIT BIRD.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I'M AN ALCOHOLIC,
 I'M A DRUG ADDICT.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM
 ADMITTING THAT.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I'VE DONE SPEED,
 L.S.D.,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
POT, HASH, PEYOTE.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
BUT ALCOHOL HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MY THING, EH?

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN, LIKE,
MY DRUG OF CHOICE, EH?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
RIGHT NOW I'M DOING
 A DOUBLE LIFE SENTENCE

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
AND MY PAROLE DOESN'T
 COME UP UNTIL 2013.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
THE POLICE SAID AFTER

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
THAT IT WAS JUST A COLD-BLOODED
 OLD GANGLAND-STYLE THING,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
AND I RESENTED THAT.
 I RESENTED THAT BECAUSE
 THEY HAD NO IDEA

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
WHAT TRANSPIRED
 UP THERE THAT NIGHT.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
YOU GOT THE MOTHER--
THE ONE MOTHER-- MY ONE
VICTIM'S MOTHER, YOU KNOW?

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
OUT IN COURT,
AND SHE'D LOOK AT ME,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
SHE'D JUST LOOK AT MY EYES
AND SHE'D SAY, "WHY DID
YOU KILL MY SON?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
WHY DID YOU KILL MY SON?"

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
I CAN'T BRING THEM BACK.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
YOU KNOW?
UM...

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
THEY'RE GONE. AND THERE
WAS A HEAVY PRICE TO PAY
FOR MY ALCOHOLISM.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
THERE'S A HEAVY PRICE TO PAY
 FOR MY STUBBORNNESS,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
FOR MY PRIDE, FOR MY EGO.
 AND THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
MY BUDDY SAYS, "WELL, YOU WON."
 I SAID, "HOW DID I WIN?"

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
HE GOES, "WELL, YOU'RE ALIVE
 AND THEY'RE DEAD."

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
I GO, "HOW DID I WIN?
 YES, THEY'RE DEAD, I'M GOING
 AWAY FOR LIFE.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
WHO THE HELL WON
 OUT OF THIS SITUATION?
 WHO WON?"

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
AND GUYS WILL SAY TO ME,
"HEY, COME ON, HAVE A DRINK.
HAVE A DRINK."

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
AND I SAY, "WHY DO I
WANT A DRINK, MAN?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
WHY WOULD I WANT A DRINK?
THE LAST TIME I DRANK

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
TWO PEOPLE ENDED UP
DEAD AND I'M DOING LIFE.
WHY DO I WANT THAT?"

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
OKAY, I'M GOING
TO MOVE THE CAMERA IN
A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
- YOU WANNA STICK WITH
 BLACK AND WHITE FOR BIT?
- YEAH.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
David McClure:
 I WAS AN ORGANIST IN CHURCHES
 FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
AND SOLOIST IN CHURCHES,
 AND A CHOIR LEADER.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
I HAD A BRIEF STINT AT--

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
TWO DIFFERENT STINTS
 AT THE ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM
 AS A LECTURER THERE.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I WORKED FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
AS A MUSIC SUPERVISOR
 IN CENTRAL ONTARIO.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
SO I'VE HAD A WEALTH
 OF EXPERIENCE.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Levine:
 ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
 GOOD, THAT'S ONE.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
McClure:
 I'M IN FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Levine:
 HOW MANY YEARS DID THEY
 GIVE YOU FOR THE CRIME?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
- McClure: INDEFINITE.
- INDEFINITE?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
YES, SO I COULD DIE HERE.
A LOT OF MEN HAVE.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
FIVE MEN HAVE DIED
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
AGING IN PRISON IS VERY
DIFFICULT BECAUSE, REALLY,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
THE SYSTEM'S NOT SET UP
TO TAKE CARE

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
OF THE AGING INDIVIDUALS
WHO ARE HERE.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
FOR EXAMPLE, I TAKE
 AT LEAST 25 PILLS A DAY,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
I HAVE 12 DIFFERENT
 PRESCRIPTIONS OF MEDICATION.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
I HAVE HEART PROBLEMS,
 LUNG PROBLEMS, THYROID,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
AND I'M A DIABETIC.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Levine:
McCLURE LIVES
IN THE 80-MAN UNIT,

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
THE GERIATRIC UNIT,
OVER AT WARKWORTH.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
AND THE PLACE IS MORE SUITED
FOR A FELLOW LIKE HIM--
THE 80-MAN UNIT,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
BECAUSE HE HAS
THE WHEELCHAIR ACCESS.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
THEY'VE ADDED ALL KINDS OF
 RAMPS AT WARKWORTH,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
WHICH IS SOMETHING
 I HAVEN'T SEEN AT MANY
 OF THE OTHER PRISONS.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
SO IT'S EASIER FOR THEM
 TO GET AROUND.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
EASIER FOR A MAN LIKE
 McCLURE WHO'S GOING TO BE IN
 FOR A LONG TIME.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
I THINK HE'S GOT AN
 INDETERMINATE SENTENCE ON HIM.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
THE 80-MAN UNIT
 IS PROBABLY A LOT SAFER
 FOR THE SEX CRIMINALS

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
 SEEM TO GET PREYED UPON
 BY THE YOUNGER GUYS.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
IT'S A LITTLE MORE PRIVACY,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
A LITTLE MORE SAFETY.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
IN 1989 WE OPENED
THE 80-MAN UNIT HERE.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
A VERY MODERN FACILITY

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
WITH A NUMBER OF
 HANDICAPPED CELLS

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
AND AREAS WHERE THE INMATES
 CAN MOVE FREELY ABOUT,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO DOWN
 STAIRS TO ACCESS THEIR CELLS,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
AND TO ACCESS
 COMMON ROOMS.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
I WAS JUST IN AWE
OF THE COMMENTS
IN THE BOOK.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
- THEY WERE VERY TOUCHING.
- YOU KNOW...

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
IT WAS SUCH
AN ELOQUENT STATEMENT
TO GROWING OLD IN PRISON,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
BUT BEING OLD IN PRISON
AND HOW HARSH IT IS.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
AND TO SEE THE OLD MEN
DIE IN PRISON

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
I THINK IS THE OTHER POINT
OF THIS WHOLE BOOK.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
- I LOVED THE BOOK AND IT'S
 A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
- THANK YOU.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Levine:
MICHAEL WORKED OUT
PRETTY GOOD IN 2 1/4,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
ALTHOUGH I THINK I LIKE
THE 4x5 BETTER.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
I MEAN,
THE GUY WAS HIGHLY EDUCATED.
IT WAS KIND OF BIZARRE.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
HE'S GOT A PhD
IN RUSSIAN HISTORY,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
I THINK HE TAUGHT
AT U. OF T. FOR A WHILE.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Michael Ostopovich-Vorontsov:
 MY CRIME IS OF SEXUAL ABUSE,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
SPECIFICALLY MY BROTHER.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
WHEN HE WAS A CHILD,
 I GUESS,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
AND I WAS IN MY TEENS,
 I SEXUALLY ABUSED HIM.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
IT WHEN ON
 FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
LET ME JUST DO
A TEST SHOT HERE.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
WE'LL GET YOU
STANDING UP FOR NOW.
YEAH, THAT'S NICE.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
NO, WITH YOUR HANDS CLASPED,
 THAT'S VERY NICE, ACTUALLY.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
FRANCIS, PULL BACK A BIT.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Ostopovich-Vorontsov:
 SO PHALLOMETRIC TESTING
 TELLS ME

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
THAT I'M WAY UP THERE
IN THE DEVIANCY SCALE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
THEY PUT THIS LITTLE
ELASTIC THING ON YOUR PENIS

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
AND YOU GO FROM THERE
 AND THEY SHOW YOU,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
OH, THE MOST
 UNBELIEVABLE VIDEOTAPES.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I HAD A REACTION
 TO ALMOST ALL OF IT,
 RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
REALLY IT'S JUST THE SHOCK,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000
THE ABSOLUTE SHOCK
 OF THE TEST.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
AND I HAD NO IDEA
 I WOULD HAVE SCORED SO HIGH.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I'M NOT
GOING TO PRETEND I'M NOT GOING
TO DO ANY OF THIS ANYMORE.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I'M GOING TO FACE THE DEMONS
AND GET OVER THEM.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
AND HOPEFULLY GET
TO GO HOME ONE DAY.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
IF I COULD GO BACK
 AND TAKE IT AWAY, I WOULD.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I TRULY WOULD.
 I'D TAKE IT ALL AWAY.
 BUT I CAN'T.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
I-I LOVE MY BROTHER
 VERY MUCH

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
AND I-I-- I REGRET EVERY--
 EVERY-- EVERY HURT

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
THAT I'VE CAUSED HIM,
 ABSOLUTELY.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
WHEN YOU START REALIZING
 THE ABSOLUTE HORROR OF IT,

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I MEAN,
THE PAIN AND THE ANGST

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
AND HOW MANY YEARS
THAT WENT ON.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
AND YOU KNOW, YOU JUST--

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
YOU BLIND YOURSELF TO IT,
ABSOLUTELY.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
AND WHEN YOU
ACTUALLY FACE IT,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
IT JUST--

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
IT'S MIND-BOGGLING.
IT REALLY IS.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
NOW, READY. LOOK RIGHT
IN THE LENS, SIR.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
- GOOD, PERFECT.
- Laroche: AM I IN?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
NO, YOU'RE NOT. THAT'S GREAT.
OKAY, READY, I'LL TELL YOU WHEN.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
READY, ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Levine:
 MY ROLE IS TO REALLY GET
 THE IMAGES OUT THERE.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I DON'T THINK I TREAT THEM
 ANY BETTER OR ANY WORSE

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
THAN I WOULD ANY OTHER
 HUMAN BEING ON THE OUTSIDE.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I DON'T THINK
 BECAUSE THEY'RE INMATES,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN
 GIVEN A LONG SENTENCE AND ARE
 IN PRISON, INCARCERATED,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I DON'T THINK I HAVE
 THE RIGHT TO TREAT THEM
 ANY DIFFERENTLY.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
SURE, SOME OF THEM REPULSE ME.
 WHAT THEY'VE DONE REPULSES ME.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
BUT I STILL THINK
 THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
THEY DESERVE

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
SOME RESPECT FROM ME,
 FROM ANYONE WHO TALKS TO THEM.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
ROBERT HENDERSON
 BASICALLY SPENT MOST
 OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
I THINK THERE WAS FIVE YEARS
 HE SAID THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY
 OUT OF PRISON.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
AND NOW HE'S BACK IN
 AT 70 YEARS OLD.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Robert Henderson:
 I'VE GOT OVER 45 YEARS
 IN PRISON.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
SO, THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH
 THEY CAN TELL ME
 ABOUT A PRISON.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
OKAY.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Henderson:
 I ONLY KNEW MY STEPFATHER.
 HE WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
AND SO WAS MY MOTHER.
THEY WERE BOTH ALCOHOLICS.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
AND WHEN I WAS A KID,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
THEY USED TO HAVE A LOT
OF PARTIES AROUND THE HOUSE
AND GET DRUNK.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
THEY USED TO GIVE ME BEER
IN A BOTTLE WITH A NIPPLE ON IT.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
I CAN REMEMBER DRINKING BEER
THAT WAY, RIGHT OUT
OF A NIPPLE.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
AND THEN I REMEMBER DRINKING IT
 OUT OF A BABY'S BOTTLE.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
AND OF COURSE YOU CRAWL AROUND
 ON THE FLOOR, YOU GET DRUNK

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
AND THEY THINK THAT'S FUNNY.
 SO THEY'D SIT THERE AND LAUGH.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
BUT IT WASN'T FUNNY FOR ME.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
LATER ON, I GUESS, MYSELF JUST
 TURNED INTO AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
AND THE MURDER THAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU WERE 55 YEARS OLD,
YOU SAID?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
YEAH, THAT'S THE MURDER,
SECOND-DEGREE MURDER.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
- HOW'D THAT END UP?
- DRINKING.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
DRINKING AND RAISING HELL.
DRINKING AND RAISING HELL.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
IT WASN'T PREMEDITATED
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
- NO, IT JUST HAPPENED.
- YOU GET INTO A FIGHT?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
I DRANK
A 40-POUNDER OF J.D.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
I DRANK A 40-POUNDER OF RUM.
I DRANK BEER

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
- AND SHOTS OF LIQUOR
 ALL DAY LONG.
- RIGHT.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
SO THEN I GO TO THE HOTEL.
I'M IN AND OUT OF THE BARS.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
SO THEN I SAYS,
"WELL, I GOT TO GET HIGHER.
I'M NOT DRUNK ENOUGH."

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
SO THEN I BOUGHT MYSELF
FIVE HITS OF THAT PURPLE
CRYSTAL ACID.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
SO I TOOK A COUPLE.
THEY WEREN'T WORK--
I TOOK A COUPLE MORE.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
I DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT DRUGS. I ENDED UP
TAKING FIVE OF THOSE.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
I RODE MY BIKE 250 MILES,
DON'T REMEMBER EVEN RIDING IT.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER COMMITTING
THE MURDER, BUT IT LOOKED PRETTY
CONVINCING IN THE COURT.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
SO I PLEADED GUILTY TO
SECOND-DEGREE MURDER, JUST TO
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
BECAUSE I WAS LAYING
IN A BUCKET FOR 17 MONTHS.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
THE HEALTH IS REALLY BAD.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
LIKE I SAY,
 IT'S DETERIORATING.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
THE DOCTOR SAID
 IT'S GOING DOWNHILL.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
AND I CAN FEEL IT
 GOING DOWNHILL.  EVERY YEAR
 IT GETS WORSE.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
I SHAKE MORE.
 I AM A DIABETIC.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
THEY PUT ME ON MEDICATION,
 AND I KEEP GOING FROM THERE,

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
FROM DAY TO DAY.
 IT'S ALL YOU CAN DO.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
IF THEY LET ME OUT, FINE.
 AND IF THEY DON'T,
 THAT'S FINE TOO.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
BECAUSE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
 I GOT 15 YEARS LEFT.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
WHEN YOU GET TO THE POINT
IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU
DON'T CARE ANYMORE,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
WHAT HAPPENS?
THEN THAT'S IT.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
YOU GOT TO HAVE
SOMETHING TO...

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
TO REACH OUT FOR.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
HOPEFULLY, YOU MIGHT SEE
A LITTLE FLICKER OF LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
BUT SHE'S AWFULLY DIM.
YEP.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Dr. Andrew Harris:
 ONE THING ABOUT PRISON IS IT
 DOES GIVE PEOPLE TIME TO THINK.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
OLDER MEN CHANGE
THEIR BEHAVIOR

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
AND WE DO SEE
A GREAT DEAL OF REMORSE,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
A FEELING OF A LOST LIFE,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
A FEELING OF HAVING
HAD ONE HAND TO PLAY

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
AND THEY'VE PLAYED IT
POORLY.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
THEY'VE BECOME AWARE
 THAT THEY NO LONGER
 HAVE THE SKILLS

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
TO SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
OR EVEN IN A FAIRLY
 SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
IN THE COMMUNITY,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'VE BEEN
LIFETIME CRIMINALS.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
THEY LITERALLY DON'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A MEAL FOR THEMSELVES.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
AND LONG-TERM
 INSTITUTIONALIZATION

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
CAN DECREASE THOSE SKILLS,
 BECAUSE THERE'S NO...

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
CHANCE IN MANY CASES
 TO PRACTICE INDEPENDENT SKILLS.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
SO THEY BECOME
 INCREASINGLY AWARE

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T
 MAKE IT OUT THERE.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
I WOULD THINK THAT THIS IS MADE
 WORSE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
AND THE WAY LIFE HAS
 SPEEDED UP.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
WE HAVE MEN IN HERE
 WHO LITERALLY HAVE NEVER
 SEEN A BANK MACHINE.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
IT'S A COMBINATION OF BEING
 FRIGHTENED AND, OF COURSE,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
IN THE MEDIA,
 THE OUTSIDE WORLD
 IS PORTRAYED

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
AS FAST-PACED,
 TECHNOLOGICAL.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
AND THESE MEN KNOW THAT
 THEY JUST CAN'T PARTICIPATE

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Levine:
 I WANT TO CONFRONT PEOPLE
 WITH THESE IMAGES.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
I WANT TO SAY,
 "WHAT ARE WE DOING?
 WHY ARE THESE MEN IN PRISON?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THIS?"

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Wou:
 THE ELDERLY POPULATION
 IN PRISON

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
IS REALLY STARTING TO MUSHROOM,
 BECAUSE OF THE BABY BOOMERS.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT?
 HOW DO WE TAKE CARE OF THIS?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
IS IT SIMPLY JUST OPENING
MORE GERIATRIC PRISONS

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
OR ARE THERE DIFFERENT WAYS
TO DEAL WITH THIS?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
AND I KNOW THE CORRECTIONAL
 FACILITIES IN CANADA

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
AND THE UNITED STATES
 ARE ADDRESSING THIS, 
 AND IT'S ALL NEW TERRITORY.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Levine:
 THEY'RE STRUCK, I THINK, BY
 LIVES THEY NEVER KNEW EXISTED.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
THEY'RE STRUCK
 BY A PRISON SYSTEM
 THEY NEVER KNEW EXISTED.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Billy Owen:
 WE DO HAVE A HABITUAL OFFENDER
 ACT IN ALABAMA.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
IT HAS INCREASED OUR PRISON
 POPULATION TREMENDOUSLY,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
ESPECIALLY
 AFTER THREE STRIKES.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
IF THE CRIME RATE
REMAINS AS IT IS,

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
NATIONWIDE YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE AN OLDER AGED POPULATION
AS TIME GOES ON.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
IT'S GONNA GROW.
 THERE'S GONNA BE MORE
 AND MORE OF A NEED

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
FOR AGED AND INFIRMED
 FACILITIES TO HANDLE AGED
 AND INFIRM INMATES.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Hamer:
 20 YEARS FROM NOW,
 CAN YOU IMAGINE?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
WHEN THE POPULATION'S
GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY
60, 65 AND OLDER,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN PRISON,
 JUST LIKE THEY ARE
 ON THE OUTSIDE.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Arbuckle:
 WE DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER
 OF THOSE AGING OFFENDERS

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
WHO ARE SERVING
INDEFINITE SENTENCES,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
AND THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THEY
MAY NEVER GET OUT OF JAIL.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000
AND THAT'S OUR PROBLEM, BECAUSE
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
AS THEY AGE UP
 TO THE POINT OF DEATH.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
SO WHAT WE'VE SEEN TO DATE

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
IS JUST THE TIP
 OF THE ICEBERG.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Levine:
 IN A SENSE, YOU WANT TO SHOCK
 PEOPLE A BIT INTO SAYING

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
"HOLY SHIT,
 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
WHAT ARE THESE OLD MEN
 DOING IN PRISON AND WHY
 ARE THEY STILL THERE?"

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
AND, SAME SENSE,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL WALK AWAY
FROM THAT SHOW AND SAY,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
"THANK GOD THEY'RE IN PRISON.
LET THEM STAY THERE."

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
* LORD, I'M LOOKING

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
* LORD, FOR THE ROAD

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
* LEAD ME HOME

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
* I'VE BEEN SEARCHING

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
* NIGHT AND DAY

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
* LORD, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000
* I LOST MY WAY

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
* TELL ME WHERE

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
* LORD, IS THE ROAD

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
* I WANT TO GO HOME.
