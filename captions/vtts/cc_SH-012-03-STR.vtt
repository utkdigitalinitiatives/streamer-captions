00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.470


2
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.070
There be some sports arepainful, and their labour

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.570
Delight in them sets off:some kinds of baseness

4
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.800
Are nobly undergone andmost poor matters

5
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.300
Point to rich ends.

6
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.730
This my mean task

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.700
Would be as heavy to me asodious, but

8
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.670
The mistress which I servequickens what's dead

9
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.600
And makes my labourspleasures: O, she is

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.930
Ten times more gentle thanher father's crabbed,

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.000
And he's composed ofharshness.

12
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.200
I must remove

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.330
Some thousands of theselogs and pile them up,

14
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.930
Upon a sore injunction: mysweet mistress

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.030
Weeps when she sees me work,and says, such baseness

16
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.600
Had never like executor.

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.100
I forget:

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.500
But these sweet thoughts doeven refresh my labours,

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.130
Most busy lest, when I doit.

20
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.530
Alas, now, pray you,

21
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100
Work not so hard: I wouldthe lightning had

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.500
Burnt up these logs thatyou are enjoin'd to pile.

23
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.570
Pray, set it down and restyou: when this burns,

24
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.670
'Twill weep for havingwearied you.

25
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.100
My father

26
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.570
Is hard at study; praynow, rest yourself;

27
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.230
He's safe these threehours.

28
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.800
O most dear mistress,

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.100
The sun will set before Ishall discharge

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.630
What I must strive to do.

31
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.870
If you'll sit down,

32
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.170
I'll bear your logs thewhile: pray, give me that;

33
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.430
I'll carry it to the pile.

34
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.700
No, precious creature;

35
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.730
I had rather crack mysinews, break my back,

36
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.670
Than you should suchdishonour undergo,

37
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.770
While I sit lazy by.

38
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.870
It would become me

39
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.870
As well as it does you:and I should do it

40
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.000
With much more ease; formy good will is to it,

41
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.470
And yours it is against.

42
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.030
Poor worm, thou artinfected.

43
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.700
This visitation shows it.

44
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.970
You look wearily.

45
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.830
No, noble mistress; 'tisfresh morning with me

46
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.900
When you are by at night.

47
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.230
I do beseech you--

48
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.830
Chiefly that I might setit in my prayers--

49
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.330
What is your name?

50
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.630
Miranda--

51
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.430
O my father, I have brokeyour hest to say so.

52
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.300
Admired Miranda.

53
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.130
Indeed the top ofadmiration.

54
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.630
Worth what's dearest tothe world.

55
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.830
Full many a lady I haveeyed with best regard andmany a time

56
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.130
The harmony of theirtongues hath into bondage

57
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.530
Brought my too diligentear:

58
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.730
for several virtues

59
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.030
Have I liked severalwomen; never any

60
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.570
With so full soul, butsome defect in her

61
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.630
Did quarrel with thenoblest grace she owed

62
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.500
And put it to the foil:but you, O you,

63
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.870
So perfect and sopeerless, are created

64
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.870
Of every creature's best.

65
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.800
I do not know

66
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.030
One of my sex; no woman'sface remember,

67
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.830
Save, from my glass, mineown; nor have I seen

68
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.370
More that I may call menthan you, good friend,

69
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.600
And my dear father: howfeatures are abroad,

70
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.830
I am skilless of; but, bymy modesty,

71
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.400
The jewel in my dower, Iwould not wish

72
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.800
Any companion in the worldbut you,

73
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.130
Nor can imagination form ashape,

74
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.270
Besides yourself, to likeof.

75
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.300
But I prattle

76
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.500
Something too wildly andmy father's precepts

77
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.770
I therein do forget.

78
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.930
I am in my condition

79
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.830
A prince, Miranda; I dothink, a king;

80
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.370
I would, not so-- andwould no more endure

81
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.100
This wooden slavery thanto suffer

82
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.500
The flesh-fly blow mymouth.

83
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.600
Hear my soul speak:

84
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.300
The very instant that Isaw you, did

85
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.730
My heart fly to yourservice; there resides,

86
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.700
To make me slave to it;and for your sake

87
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.270
Am I this patient log-man.

88
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.170
Do you love me?

89
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.370
O heaven, O earth, bearwitness to this sound

90
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.830
And crown what I professwith kind event

91
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.530
If I speak true.

92
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.570
If hollowly, invert

93
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.670
What best is boded me tomischief.

94
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.700
I beyond all limit of whatelse i' the world

95
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.100
Do love, prize, honouryou.

96
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.370
Oh.

97
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.600
I am a fool

98
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.300
To weep at what I am gladof.

99
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.530
Fair encounter

100
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.200
Of two most rareaffections.

101
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.700
Heavens rain grace

102
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.470
On that which breedsbetween 'em.

103
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.370
Wherefore weep you?

104
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.000
At my unworthiness thatdare not offer

105
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.070
What I desire to give, andmuch less take

106
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.270
What I shall die to want.

107
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.370
But this is trifling;

108
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.230
And all the more it seeksto hide itself,

109
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.200
The bigger bulk it shows.

110
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.930
Hence, bashful cunning.

111
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.470
And prompt me, plain andholy innocence.

112
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.170
I am your wife, if youwill marry me;

113
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.330
If not, I'll die yourmaid: to be your fellow

114
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.700
You may deny me; but I'llbe your servant,

115
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.400
Whether you will or no.

116
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.200
My mistress, dearest;

117
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.670
And I thus humble ever.

118
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.870
My husband, then?

119
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.970
Ay, with a heart aswilling

120
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.030
As bondage e'er offreedom: here's my hand.

121
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.300
And mine, with my heartin't;

122
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.200
and now farewell Till halfan hour hence.

123
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.700
A thousand thousand.

124
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.930
So glad of this as they Icannot be,

125
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.000
Who are surprised withal;my rejoicing

126
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.700
At nothing can be more.

127
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.970
I'll to my book,

128
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.900
For yet ere supper-timemust I perform

129
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.800
Much businessappertaining.

130
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.030
Tell not me; when the buttis out,

131
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.870
we will drink water; not adrop before:

132
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.100
therefore bear up, andboard 'em.

133
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.070
Servant-monster, drink tome.

134
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.370
Servant-monster.

135
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.500
The folly of this island.

136
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.000
They say there's but fiveupon this isle:

137
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.430
we are three of them; ifth' other two

138
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.000
be brained like us, thestate totters.

139
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.970
Drink, servant-monster,when I bid thee:

140
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.670
thy eyes are almost set inthy head.

141
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.370
Where should they be setelse?

142
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.570
He were a brave monsterindeed, if they were setin his tail.

143
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.630
My man-monster hathdrown'd his tongue insack:

144
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.370
for my part, the seacannot drown me;

145
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.330
I swam, ere I couldrecover the shore,

146
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.230
five and thirty leagues...

147
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:43.330
Ha!

148
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.200
Off and on.

149
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.600
By this light, thou shaltbe my lieutenant, monster,

150
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.930
or my standard.

151
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.430
Your lieutenant, if youlist; he's no standard.

152
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.800
We'll not run, MonsieurMonster.

153
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.500
Nor go neither; but you'lllie like dogs

154
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.270
and yet say nothingneither.

155
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.070
Moon-calf, speak once inthy life,

156
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.970
if thou beest a goodmoon-calf.

157
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.630
How does thy honour?

158
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.570
Let me lick thy shoe.

159
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.670
I'll not serve him; he isnot valiant.

160
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.730
Thou liest, most ignorantmonster:

161
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.230
I am in case to justle aconstable.

162
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.870
Why, thou deboshed fish thou,was there ever man a coward

163
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.130
that hath drunk so muchsack as I to-day?

164
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.830
Wilt thou tell a monstrouslie,

165
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.730
being but half a fish andhalf a monster?

166
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.200
Lo, how he mocks me!

167
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.930
Wilt thou let him, mylord?

168
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.570
"Lord" quoth he.

169
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.300
That a monster should besuch a natural.

170
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.800
Lo, lo, again!

171
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.270
Bite him to death, Iprithee.

172
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.230
Trinculo, keep a goodtongue in your head:

173
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.700
if you prove a mutineer,the next tree.

174
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.130
The poor monster's mysubject

175
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.170
and he shall not sufferindignity.

176
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.270
I thank my noble lord.

177
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.430
Wilt thou be pleased tohearken

178
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.170
to the suit I made tothee?

179
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.830
Marry, will I; kneel andrepeat it;

180
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.170
I will stand, and so shallTrinculo.

181
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.430
As I told thee before,

182
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.800
I am subject to a tyrant,a sorcerer,

183
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.230
that by his cunning hathcheated me of the island.

184
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.970
Thou liest.

185
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.600
Thou liest, thou jestingmonkey, thou:

186
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.970
I would my valiant masterwould destroy thee!

187
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.230
I do not lie!

188
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.530
Trinculo, if you troublehim any more in's tale,

189
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.600
by this hand, I willsupplant some of your teeth.

190
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.770
Well, I said nothing.

191
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.070
Mum, then, and no more.

192
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.700
Proceed.

193
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.030
I say, by sorcery he gotthis isle;

194
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.570
From me he got it.

195
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.030
If thy greatness will

196
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.500
Revenge it on him-- for Iknow thou darest,

197
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.100
But this thing dare not.

198
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.230
That's most certain.

199
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:01.430
Thou shalt be lord of itand I'll serve thee.

200
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.500
How now shall this becompassed?

201
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.070
Canst thou bring me to theparty?

202
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.970
Yea, yea, my lord: I'llyield him thee asleep,

203
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.070
Where thou mayst knock anail into his head.

204
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.970
Thou liest; thou canstnot.

205
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.800
What a pied ninny's this!

206
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.170
Thou scurvy patch!

207
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.470
I do beseech thygreatness, give him blows

208
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.870
And take his bottle fromhim: when that's gone

209
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.700
He shall drink nought butbrine; for I'll not show him

210
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.500
Where the quick freshesare.

211
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.630
Trinculo, run into nofurther danger:

212
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.900
interrupt the monster oneword further,

213
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.670
and, by this hand, I'llturn my mercy out o' doors

214
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.200
and make a stock-fish ofthee.

215
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.400
Why, what did I?

216
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.500
I did nothing.

217
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.800
I'll go farther off.

218
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.170
Didst thou not say helied?

219
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.270
Thou liest.

220
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.030
Do I so?

221
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.430
Take thou that.

222
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.570
As you like this, give methe lie another time.

223
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.270
I did not give the lie.

224
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.000
Out o' your wits andhearing too?

225
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.530
A pox o' your bottle!

226
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.530
This can sack and drinkingdo.

227
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.800
A murrain on your monster, andthe devil take your fingers!

228
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.570
Now, forward with yourtale.

229
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.600
Prithee, stand fartheroff.

230
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.830
Beat him enough:

231
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.270
after a little time I'llbeat him too.

232
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.530
Stand farther.

233
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.100
Come, proceed.

234
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.830
Why, as I told thee, 'tisa custom with him,

235
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.630
I' th' afternoon to sleep:there thou mayst brain him,

236
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.930
Having first seized hisbooks, or with a log

237
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.800
Batter his skull, orpaunch him with a stake,

238
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.730
Or cut his wezand with thyknife.

239
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.370
Remember first to possesshis books; for without them

240
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.970
He's but a sot, as I am,nor hath not

241
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.030
One spirit to command:they all do hate him

242
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.100
As rootedly as I.

243
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.930
Burn but his books.

244
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.070
He has brave utensils--for so he calls them--

245
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.230
Which when he has a house,he'll deck withal

246
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.500
And that most deeply toconsider is

247
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.170
The beauty of hisdaughter; he himself

248
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.200
Calls her a nonpareil: Inever saw a woman,

249
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.100
But only Sycorax my damand she;

250
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.170
But she as far surpassethSycorax

251
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.200
As great'st does least.

252
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.230
Is it so brave a lass?

253
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.400
Ay, lord; she will becomethy bed, I warrant.

254
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.830
And bring thee forth bravebrood.

255
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.000
Monster, I will kill thisman:

256
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.900
his daughter and I will beking and queen--

257
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.300
save our graces--

258
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.370
and Trinculo and thyselfshall be viceroys.

259
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.170
Dost thou like the plot,Trinculo?

260
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.600
Excellent.

261
00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.870
Give me thy hand: I amsorry I beat thee;

262
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.700
but, while thou livest, keepa good tongue in thy head.

263
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.500
Within this half hour willhe be asleep:

264
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.570
Wilt thou destroy himthen?

265
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.830
Ay, on mine honour.

266
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.030
This will I tell mymaster.

267
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:20.130
Thou makest me merry; I amfull of pleasure:

268
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.800
Let us be jocund: will youtroll the catch

269
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.500
You taught me butwhile-ere?

270
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.500
At thy request, monster, Iwill do reason, any reason.

271
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.770
Come on, Trinculo, let ussing.

272
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:35.770
Flout 'em and scout 'em

273
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.600
And scout 'em and flout'em.

274
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.700
Thought is free.

275
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.330
That's not the tune!

276
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.200
What is this same?

277
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.630
Shh!

278
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.430
This is the tune of ourcatch, played by thepicture of Nobody.

279
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.670
If thou beest a man, showthyself in thy likeness:

280
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:03.530
if thou beest a devil,take't as thou list.

281
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.330
O, forgive me my sins!

282
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.830
He that dies pays alldebts: I defy thee!

283
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.830
Mercy upon us.

284
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.400
Art thou afeard?

285
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.230
No, monster, not I.

286
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.300
Be not afeard; the isle isfull of noises,

287
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.330
Sounds and sweet airs, thatgive delight and hurt not.

288
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:31.670
Sometimes a thousandtwangling instruments

289
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.570
Will hum about mine ears,and sometime voices

290
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:38.100
That, if I then had wakedafter long sleep,

291
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.830
Will make me sleep again:and then, in dreaming,

292
00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.830
The clouds methought wouldopen and show riches

293
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.070
Ready to drop upon methat, when I waked,

294
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.000
I cried to dream again.

295
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.100
This will prove a bravekingdom to me,

296
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.400
where I shall have mymusic for nothing.

297
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.200
When Prospero isdestroyed.

298
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.670
That shall be by and by: Iremember the story.

299
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.330
The sound is going away;

300
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.670
let's follow it, and afterdo our work.

301
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:17.300
Lead, monster; we'llfollow.

302
00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.130
I would I could see thistabourer; he lays it on.

303
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.770
Wilt come?

304
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.430
I'll follow, Stephano.

305
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.900
By'r lakin, I can go nofurther, sir;

306
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:55.000
My old bones ache: here'sa maze trod indeed

307
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.730
Through forth-rights andmeanders.

308
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.330
By your patience, I needsmust rest me.

309
00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.030
Old lord, I cannot blamethee,

310
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.270
Who am myself attach'dwith weariness,

311
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.800
To the dulling of myspirits: sit down, and rest.

312
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.330
Even here will I put offmy hope and keep it

313
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.430
No longer for myflatterer.

314
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.600
He is drown'd

315
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.600
Whom thus we stray tofind, and the sea mocks

316
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.630
Our frustrate search onland.

317
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.630
Well, let him go.

318
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.200
I am right glad that he'sso out of hope.

319
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.870
Do not, for one repulse,forego the purpose

320
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.370
You resolved to effect.

321
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.630
The next advantage will wetake throughly.

322
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.730
Let it be to-night;

323
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.870
For, now they are oppress'dwith travel, they

324
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.800
Will not, nor cannot, usesuch vigilance

325
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.270
As when they are fresh.

326
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.500
I say, to-night: no more.

327
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.230
What harmony is this?

328
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.570
My good friends, hark.

329
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.630
Marvellous sweet music.

330
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.070
Give us kind keepers,heavens.

331
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.770
What were these?

332
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.400
A living drollery.

333
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.630
Now I will believe

334
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.900
That there are unicorns,that in Arabia

335
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.670
There is one tree, thephoenix' throne, one phoenix

336
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.470
At this hour reigningthere.

337
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.670
I'll believe both;

338
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.700
And what does else wantcredit, come to me,

339
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.930
And I'll be sworn 'tis true:travellers ne'er did lie,

340
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.830
Though fools at homecondemn 'em.

341
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:19.000
If in Naples I shouldreport this now,

342
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.470
would they believe me?

343
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.570
If I should say, I sawsuch islanders--

344
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:24.970
For, certes, these arepeople of the island--

345
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.930
Who, though they are ofmonstrous shape, yet, note,

346
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.230
Their manners are moregentle-kind than of

347
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.370
Our human generation youshall find

348
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.570
Many, nay, almost any.

349
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.870
Honest lord,

350
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.400
Thou hast said well; forsome of you there present

351
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.330
Are worse than devils.

352
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.130
I cannot too much muse

353
00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:46.730
Such shapes, such gestureand such sounds, expressing,

354
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.030
Although they want the useof tongue, a kind

355
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.130
Of excellent dumbdiscourse.

356
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.700
Praise in departing.

357
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.170
They vanish'd strangely.

358
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.270
No matter, since

359
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.000
They have left theirviands behind;

360
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.170
for we have stomachs.

361
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.400
Will't please you taste ofwhat is here?

362
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.500
Not I.

363
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.100
Faith, sir, you need notfear.

364
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.270
When we were boys,

365
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.500
Who would believe thatthere were mountaineers

366
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.930
Dew-lapp'd like bulls,whose throats had hangingat 'em

367
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.330
Wallets of flesh?

368
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.630
Or that there were suchmen

369
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.500
Whose heads stood in theirbreasts?

370
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.700
Which now we find

371
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.030
Each putter-out of fivefor one will bring us

372
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.230
Good warrant of.

373
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.670
I will stand to and feed,

374
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.100
Although my last: nomatter, since I feel

375
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.500
The best is past.

376
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.430
Brother, my lord the duke,

377
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.070
Stand to and do as we.

378
00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.200
You are three men of sin,whom Destiny,

379
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.130
That hath to instrumentthis lower world

380
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.270
And what is in't, thenever-surfeited sea

381
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.470
Hath caused to belch upyou; and on this island

382
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.100
Where man doth notinhabit; you 'mongst men

383
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.570
Being most unfit to live.

384
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.270
I have made you mad;

385
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.470
And even with such-likevalour men hang and drown

386
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.070
Their proper selves.

387
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.500
You fools!

388
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.830
I and my fellows

389
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.700
Are ministers of Fate: theelements,

390
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.800
Of whom your swords aretemper'd, may as well

391
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.670
Wound the loud winds, orwith bemock'd-at stabs

392
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.770
Kill the still-closingwaters, as diminish

393
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:20.270
One dowle that's in myplume: my fellow-ministers

394
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.000
Are like invulnerable.

395
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.270
If you could hurt,

396
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.500
Your swords are now toomassy for your strengths

397
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.370
And will not be uplifted.

398
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.070
But remember--

399
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.970
For that's my business toyou-- that you three

400
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.700
From Milan did supplantgood Prospero;

401
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.500
Exposed unto the sea,which hath requit it,

402
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.870
Him and his innocentchild: for which foul deed

403
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.900
The powers, delaying, notforgetting, have

404
00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.730
Incensed the seas and shores,yea, all the creatures,

405
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.570
Against your peace!

406
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.430
Thee of thy son, Alonso,

407
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.330
They have bereft; and dopronounce by me:

408
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.930
Lingering perdition, worsethan any death

409
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.600
Can be at once, shall stepby step attend

410
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.430
You and your ways; whosewraths to guard you from--

411
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.970
Which here, in this mostdesolate isle, else falls

412
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.430
Upon your heads-- isnothing but heart-sorrow

413
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.030
And a clear life ensuing.

414
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.330
I' the name of somethingholy, sir, why stand you

415
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.000
In this strange stare?

416
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.930
O, it is monstrous,monstrous:

417
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.170
Methought the billowsspoke and told me of it;

418
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.800
The winds did sing it tome, and the thunder,

419
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.800
That deep and dreadfulorgan-pipe, pronounced

420
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.270
The name of Prosper: itdid bass my trespass.

421
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:34.430
Therefore my son i' theooze is bedded,

422
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.170
and I'll seek him deeperthan e'er plummet sounded

423
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.270
And with him there liemudded.

424
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.230
But one fiend at a time, I'llfight their legions o'er.

425
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.700
I'll be thy second.

426
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.770
All three of them aredesperate: their great guilt,

427
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.700
Like poison given to worka great time after,

428
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.770
Now 'gins to bite thespirits.

429
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.070
I do beseech you

430
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.670
That are of suppler joints,follow them swiftly

431
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.230
And hinder them from whatthis ecstasy

432
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.000
May now provoke them to.

433
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.700
Follow, I pray you.

434
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.630
Bravely the figure of thisharpy hast thou

435
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.830
Perform'd, my Ariel; agrace it had, devouring:

436
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.570
Of my instructions hastthou nothing bated

437
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.600
In what thou hadst to say:so, with good life

438
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.370
And observation strange,my meaner ministers

439
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.330
Their several kinds havedone.

440
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.430
My high charms work

441
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.000
And these mine enemies areall knit up

442
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.500
In their distractions;they now are in my power.

443
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.430
