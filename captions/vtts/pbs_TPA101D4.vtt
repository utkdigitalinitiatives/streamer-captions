WEBVTT

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.930
A CELEBRATION OF
MUSIC AND MEMORIES.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.830
[Captioning sponsored by WGBH]

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:58.360
"( band plays klezmer-style
version of ""Dayenu"" )"

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.300
Bikel: PASSOVER HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ONE OF MY FAVORITE HOLIDAYS.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.330
IT'S A TIME FOR SHARING

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
WHEN FAMILY AND FRIENDS
ACROSS ALL GENERATIONS

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.200
SIT DOWN TOGETHER TO
ENJOY THE SEDER DINNER.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.300
WE EAT WONDERFUL FOOD

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.760
WE TELL THE STORY OF THE
EXODUS FROM SLAVERY IN EGYPT

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.830
"AND MOST OF ALL, WE CELEBRATE
WITH A RICH TRADITION OF MUSIC."

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.830
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO SHARE
SOME OF THAT TRADITION.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.560
"WE CAN'T QUITE MANAGE ALL OF
THE FOOD, BUT WITH THE HELP"

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.900
OF THE NEW ENGLAND CONSERVATORY
OF MUSIC IN BOSTON

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.500
WE WILL TRY TO GIVE YOU

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.930
A TASTE OF PASSOVER
TRADITIONS AND RECIPES

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.560
AND MOST OF ALL... MUSIC.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:53.660
"( ""Dayenu"" continues )"

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.330
( music ends )

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:09.200
( applause )

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.560
"HELLO, I'M THEODORE BIKEL."

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:27.800
AND I AM CHASIA SIEGEL.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.260
"Bikel: YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY"

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.500
THE THINGS THAT STAY WITH
YOU FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.630
ONE OF MY STRONGEST
PASSOVER MEMORIES

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.900
IS THE TASTE OF THE SWEET--
OVERLY SWEET-- RED WINE

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.400
THAT MY FATHER POURED FOR ME

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.430
"AND THE LITTLE SILVER WINE CUP
I DRANK OUT OF, THE BEKHER."

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.330
"THERE'S A SONG ABOUT THAT
CUP, THE OLD HEIRLOOM."

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.600
"IT SAYS, ""FOR WHOM
SHALL WE DRINK THIS WINE?"

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
"""LET'S DRINK L'CHAYIM"

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.000
"""FOR THE LITTLE JEW
WHO TOILS AWAY HIS DAYS."

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.030
"""LET'S EVEN DRINK
TO OUR ENEMIES"

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.730
"BUT DON'T LET'S TELL THEM."""

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.730
( audience chuckles softly )

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.700
"""AND LET'S DRINK TO ALL THOSE"

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.860
"WHO HAVE GONE... FROM
OUR LIVES FOREVER."""

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.930
"""DER BEKHER""--
""THE WINE CUP."""

00:03:22.930 --> 00:05:56.000
( singing in Yiddish ):

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:09.300
( song ends )

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.130
"WELCOME OUR MUSICAL
DIRECTOR, HANKUS NETSKY."

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.730
( applause )

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.060
THOSE CHILDHOOD SEDERS-- IT
STILL FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.700
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT
MUSIC AND FOOD TOGETHER

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.230
HAVE ALMOST A MAGICAL ABILITY
TO BIND OUR MEMORIES TO US.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.900
"IT WAS OVER 3,500 YEARS AGO"

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.900
THAT THE ISRAELITES WON
THEIR FREEDOM FROM EGYPT.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.060
AND I'M CONVINCED
THAT WE'VE MANAGED

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.330
TO KEEP THE PASSOVER STORY
ALIVE OVER ALL THESE YEARS

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.860
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
THAT WE HAVE WOVEN IT

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.560
INTO THE TRADITIONS
OF THE SEDER DINNER.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.730
"FOR EXAMPLE, FROM THE
TIME THAT THEY ARE SMALL"

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.230
WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO
ASK FOUR RITUAL QUESTIONS

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.430
TO REMIND US ABOUT WHY
THIS NIGHT IS DIFFERENT

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.000
FROM ALL OTHER NIGHTS.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.500
"NOW, IN AMERICA,
IT'S DIFFERENT."

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.030
IN AMERICA THEY SAY

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.260
"""WHY DO I ALWAYS HAVE TO
ASK THE FOUR QUESTIONS?"""

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.300
"IN EUROPE A KID WOULD
SAY, ""I WANT TO ASK..."

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.860
"I WANT TO ASK THE
FOUR QUESTIONS."""

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.230
"AND THEY SAY, ""YOU CAN'T,
YOU'RE NOT THE YOUNGEST."""

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.160
TONIGHT WE ARE
PARTICULARLY LUCKY

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.900
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE NEW ENGLAND
CONSERVATORY CHILDREN'S CHORUS

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.630
TO HELP US REMEMBER.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.360
( applause )

00:07:20.360 --> 00:08:15.630
( singing in Hebrew ):

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:30.260
( applause )

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.860
WE'VE BEEN BUSY WORKING
ON A SEDER PLATE ROUND.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.700
IT HAS FOUR PARTS

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.030
AND EACH ONE REPRESENTS ONE OF
THE ITEMS ON THE SEDER PLATE.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.460
"THE FIRST ONE IS A
Z'ROAH, THE ROASTED BONE."

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.830
"THE SECOND ARE THE
BITTER HERBS, SOMETHING
LIKE HORSERADISH"

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.730
REMINDING US THE BITTERNESS
AND HARDSHIP OF SLAVERY.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.730
"THE THIRD IS BEYTZAH,
A ROASTED EGG."

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.500
AND THE LAST IS MATZOH.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.760
THE PHARAOH DIDN'T
GIVE THE JEWISH PEOPLE

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.400
VERY MUCH TIME TO LEAVE EGYPT

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.960
AND THEY COULDN'T WAIT
FOR THEIR BREAD TO RISE

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.760
"SO THEY NEEDED TO EAT
UNLEAVENED BREAD, OR MATZOH."

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.160
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT ROUND.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.260
I'VE NEVER HEARD A
ROUND LIKE THAT BEFORE

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.900
BUT HOW DOES THAT GO?

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.860
Chorus: Z'ROAH MEANS
STRENGTH AND MIGHT

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.800
WHICH TAUGHT THE PHARAOH
WHAT WAS WRONG AND RIGHT

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.030
Z'ROAH MEANS STRENGTH AND MIGHT

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.500
WHICH TAUGHT THE
PHARAOH WHAT WAS RIGHT.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.160
"THE BITTER HERBS,
THE BITTER HERBS"

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.800
REMIND US OF THE
TEARS OUR FATHERS SHED

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.500
"THE BITTER HERBS,
THE BITTER HERBS"

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.800
REMIND US OF THE
TEARS THEY SHED.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.860
"BEYTZAH, BEYTZAH IS
AN OFFERING OF THANKS"

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.530
TO GOD ABOVE WE
OFFER OUR THANKS.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.930
THE MATZOH REMINDS US

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.430
OF THE GREAT ESCAPE
FROM PHARAOH'S LAND

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.160
THE MATZOH REMINDS US

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.960
OF THE GREAT ESCAPE
FROM PHARAOH'S LAND.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.360
Z'ROAH MEANS STRENGTH AND MIGHT

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.760
WHICH TAUGHT THE PHARAOH
WHAT WAS WRONG AND RIGHT

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.430
Partial chorus: Z'ROAH
MEANS STRENGTH AND MIGHT

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.730
WHICH TAUGHT THE
PHARAOH WHAT WAS RIGHT.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:08.700
( more of chorus joins to sing
parts one and two as round )

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:18.530
( more of chorus joins to sing
first three parts as round )

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:39.300
( full chorus singing
all four parts as round )

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.060
( holding final
note as round ends )

00:10:42.060 --> 00:11:04.030
( applause )

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.160
Siegel: PASSOVER
TAKES PREPARATION:

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.300
"CLEANING, SCRUBBING,
SEWING AND COOKING."

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.560
IT'S ALL A LOT OF HARD WORK.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:17.230
AND GUESS WHO DOES IT
MOST: THE MEN OR THE WOMEN?

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.730
( audience chuckling )

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.930
THERE'S A SONG
ABOUT THAT IN LADINO

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.200
THE OLD LANGUAGE OF
THE SPANISH JEWS.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.200
"WHAT WITH ALL THE ACTIVITY,
THE HUSTLE AND BUSTLE"

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.330
EVERYONE IN A JEWISH
NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.600
"THAT PASSOVER IS AT HAND--
""PESACH A LA MANO."""

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:58.930
"( band plays ""Pesach
a la Mano"" )"

00:11:58.930 --> 00:13:54.500
( singing in Ladino ):

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.130
( final notes playing )

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:07.500
( applause )

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.860
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE
DONE-- CLEANING AND COOKING--

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.360
"BUT IF IT'S A BURDEN,
IT'S A JOYFUL ONE."

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.900
SPRING IS HERE.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.630
FAMILY AND FRIENDS GATHER.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.900
AND EVERY SERIOUS
COOK IS CONVINCED

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.830
THAT ONLY SHE REALLY KNOWS HOW
TO MAKE THE TRADITIONAL FOODS

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.500
SERVED AT A PROPER SEDER.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.130
AND WHAT IS A SEDER
WITHOUT A KNAYDL?

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.760
A DUMPLING?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.500
A MATZO BALL?

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.600
Bikel: I LIKE MINE

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.400
DENSE AND CHEWY.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.800
( loud applause )

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.530
I LOVE MINE LARGE
AND FLUFFY AS CLOUDS.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.930
( loud applause )

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.960
"NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO... THE HARD ONES."

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.530
THAT'S WHAT MY MOTHER MADE.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.930
( applause )

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.360
DON'T TELL ME HOW
TO MAKE MATZO BALLS.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.500
"LOOK, I'LL SHOW YOU."

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.960
( quiet laughter )

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.400
NOW WE'RE COMING

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.900
TO THE EDUCATIONAL
PART OF THIS EVENING.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.560
UP TO NOW WAS ENTERTAINMENT.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.600
( laughter )

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.860
"OH, THE MATZO BALL WAS CREATED"

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.530
"40 YEARS AFTER THE JEWISH
PEOPLE, OR THE ISRAELITES"

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.430
LEFT EGYPT.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.500
"ALL THE 40 YEARS IN THE DESERT,
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO COOK."

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.960
EVERYTHING WAS PREPARED.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.730
USED TO GET UP IN THE MORNING

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.930
AND THEY FOUND MANNA
WHITE AND FLUFFY.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.660
IT DIDN'T COST THEM A PENNY.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.660
AND THE WOMEN
FORGOT HOW TO COOK.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.900
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL THING.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.260
"AFTER 40 YEARS, THEY
HAD TO MAKE A SEDER"

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.060
AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.430
WHAT DO YOU COOK?

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.760
HOW DO YOU MAKE?

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.000
BUT THERE WAS ONE
JEWISH WOMAN THERE.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.460
I KNOW SHE WAS JEWISH--

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.860
WHO ELSE WAS GOING TO
THINK ABOUT A MATZO BALL?

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.760
OF COURSE SHE WAS JEWISH.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.660
"NOW, I'M GOING TO
TAKE FOUR EGGS."

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.800
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN MEASURED.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.260
AND I PUT IT IN HERE.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.260
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
BEAT-- IT'S NOT A CAKE.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.800
YOU HAVE TO JUST
MIX IT UP A LITTLE.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.160
"AND YOU TAKE SALT,
EITHER TO YOUR TASTE"

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.060
OR TO YOUR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.760
( laughter )

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.630
AND YOU MIX IT UP A LITTLE.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.360
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
A BIG TSIMMES OUT OF IT.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.760
( laughter )

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.260
I TAKE A HALF A CUP--

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:29.000
INSTEAD OF WATER I
PUT CHICKEN SOUP.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.300
( quiet laughter )

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.630
AND I MIX IT UP.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.960
AND NOW I HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.600
I ALWAYS USED TO PUT THE THING
THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.360
"I CALL IT SHMALTZ,
OR CHICKEN FAT."

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.500
"AND WELL, SHMALTZ IS
NOT EXACTLY A FOOD;"

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.700
SHMALTZ IS A WAY OF LIVING.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:53.000
( loud laughter )

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.260
( applause )

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.030
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE ANY MORE SHMALTZ

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:05.360
"SO I'M GOING TO HAVE A
SUBSTITUTE, AND THAT IS OIL."

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.100
"YOU MIX IT IN, A
THIRD OF A CUP OIL."

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.800
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MARK IT DOWN.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.900
I'LL GIVE YOU THE
RECIPE AFTERWARDS.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.730
( laughter )

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:18.630
"YOU MIX IT UP, AND THEN
YOU TAKE THE MATZO MEAL."

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.430
"NOW, HERE'S A PROBLEM:"

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.730
"IF YOU LIKE MATZO
BALL LIKE I DO, FLUFFY"

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.660
YOU JUST PUT IN
THREE-QUARTERS OF A CUP

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.730
BUT IF YOU WANT A
REAL HARD MATZO BALL

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.330
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN A LITTLE
BIT SOFTER THAN CEMENT.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.960
( loud laughter )

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.460
AND YOU START MAKING THE
KNAYDLACH VERY NICE AND ROUND.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.800
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.100
THEY SHOULD COME OUT
NICE AND BEAUTIFUL

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.900
SO THE PEOPLE WILL LIKE THEM.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.430
"YOU SEE, IF IT DOESN'T
COME OUT SO ROUND..."

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.400
"YOU SEE ONE THING IS
STICKING OUT, GIVE A
KNACK, YOU DO, YEAH."

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.230
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE AFRAID OF IT.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.260
IT WON'T HIT YOU BACK.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.260
AND YOU JUST MAKE IT... YOU
SEE-- IT'S ALMOST PERFECT.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.100
AND I PUT IT IN THE HOT WATER.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.530
THEY DON'T HAVE TO
BE ALL THE SAME SIZE.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.830
"THE BIGGER ONES YOU TAKE
FOR YOUR FAMILY, SO..."

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.400
( loud laughter )

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.230
AND THE SMALLER ONES
YOU CAN GIVE THE GUESTS.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.730
WHAT DO THEY KNOW?

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.900
BECAUSE WE ARE DOING
A DEMONSTRATION

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.960
I HAVE IT ALL DONE AND ALL READY

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.800
SO YOU'LL SEE HOW THE
MATZO BALLS COME OUT.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.960
WE HAVE HOT SOUP
PREPARED FOR YOU

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:37.060
AND YOU HAVE IT RIGHT HERE.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.800
AND THAT IS THE READY PRODUCT.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:48.130
( applause )

00:18:48.130 --> 00:20:13.660
( band begins playing
very lively melody )

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:21.560
( band plays final notes )

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.830
( song ends )

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:30.030

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:37.760
( choir singing more upbeat
tempo with drum accompaniment )

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:51.360
( choir returns to fluid backup
with saxophone soloing )

00:22:51.360 --> 00:23:06.160

( applause and cheering )

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.460
THERE ARE A LOT OF STRONG
FEELINGS AND IDEAS

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.330
ASSOCIATED WITH PASSOVER.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.430
IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:25.760
THINK OF THE DRAMA OF THE STORY.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.100
"HERE WAS YOUNG MOSES,
BROUGHT UP AS A PRINCE
IN PHARAOH'S COURT."

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.560
ONE DAY HE LEARNED

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.400
"THAT HE WAS, IN FACT, THE
SON OF A JEWISH SLAVE WOMAN."

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.960
WHEN HE CAME ACROSS
A CRUEL OVERSEER

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.560
"MISTREATING A JEWISH SLAVE,
HE COULDN'T IGNORE IT."

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:44.930
"ENRAGED, HE KILLED THE SLAVE
MASTER AND FLED FROM EGYPT."

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:48.530
"YEARS LATER, HE RETURNED,
FULL OF RIGHTEOUS ANGER"

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.800
AND DEMANDED THAT PHARAOH
RELEASE HIS PEOPLE--

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.230
THE JEWISH SLAVES--
FROM BONDAGE.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.330
"""LET MY PEOPLE GO."""

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.160
BUT PHARAOH WOULDN'T LET THEM GO

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.900
UNTIL THE LORD PUNISHED EGYPT

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.300
WITH HORRIBLE PLAGUES:

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.300
"BLOOD, FROGS, LOCUSTS, BOILS"

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.660
"DISEASE, HAIL AND... DARKNESS."

00:25:10.660 --> 00:26:12.730
"( orchestra begins playing
slow, somber melody )"

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:28.430
OVER ALL THE LAND.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:36.300
IN THE DARKNESS

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:42.900
HIS LIGHT BE FAIR

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:54.230
AND IN DARKNESS

00:26:54.230 --> 00:27:03.830
HE SENT A THICK DARKNESS

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.930
Men: A THICK DARKNESS...

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.730
Women: OVER ALL THE LAND...

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:20.400
Men: OVER ALL THE LAND.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.900
All: IN DARKNESS

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.860
WHICH MIGHT BE FAIR

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.430
Men: A THICK DARKNESS...

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:37.700
Women: OVER ALL THE LAND...

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:44.500
All: DARKNESS
WHICH MIGHT BE FAIR

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:52.330
A THICK DARKNESS

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.300
A DARKNESS

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.930
OVER THE LAND

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:07.460
WHICH MIGHT BE FAIR

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:14.230
IN THE DARKNESS

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:19.200
WHICH MIGHT BE FAIR.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:29.000
( orchestra plays final notes )

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:47.030
( applause )

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.400
OUT OF THAT DARKNESS

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.500
THE JEWISH PEOPLE FOUND
THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.030
"AT THE PASSOVER SEDER, WE
CELEBRATE THAT FREEDOM"

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.630
BUT WE'RE ALSO MINDFUL

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.300
OF THOSE WHO HAVEN'T BEEN LUCKY
ENOUGH TO TASTE ITS SWEETNESS.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:03.400
MANY OF US SET ASIDE
A MOMENT IN THE SEDER

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.560
TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO
DID NOT ESCAPE OPPRESSION

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.200
AND TO PRAY FOR THOSE
WHO STILL ENDURE IT...

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.200
WHEREVER THEY MAY BE...

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.560
AND WHOEVER THEY MAY BE.

Bikel: ONE OF MY FAVORITE
SONGS ABOUT FREEDOM

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.560
WAS NOT WRITTEN
AS A PASSOVER SONG

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.730
BUT IT'S A SONG ABOUT FREEDOM--

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.700
"A SONG ABOUT A CALF,
BOUND FOR SLAUGHTER"

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.130
WHO SEES A SWALLOW
FLYING FREELY IN THE SKY.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:34.700
AND THE FARMER TELLS
THE BLEATING CALF:

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.230
"""WHY ARE YOU BLEATING?"

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:45.330
"YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A BIRD,
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN FREE."""

00:29:45.330 --> 00:30:12.230
( singing in Yiddish ):

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.660
"DONA, DONA, DONA, DONAI"

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.960

"DONA, DONA, DONAI, DAI."

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:12.230
CALVES ARE EASILY
BOUND AND SLAUGHTERED

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.160
NEVER KNOWING THE REASON WHY

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.600
BUT ALL THOSE WHO
CHERISH FREEDOM

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.730
LIKE THE SWALLOW
CAN LEARN TO FLY

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.730
HOW THE WINDS ARE LAUGHING

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.300
THEY LAUGH WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.760
LAUGH AND LAUGH THE
WHOLE DAY THROUGH

IS CELEBRATED

ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.460
TO KEEP THE FLAME
OF HOPE BURNING.

HANDED FROM GENERATION
TO GENERATION

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.030
THROUGH TRADITIONS LIKE PASSOVER

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.200

WANDERING IN THE DESERT

LAND, ISRAEL."

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.700
THE PASSOVER STORY TEACHES
US TO CHERISH LIFE--

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.230
THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS SAVOR
OUR TIME HERE ON EARTH

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.000
"AND ABOVE ALL, TO
TRY TO FIND EACH DAY"

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.860
THOSE SWEET MOMENTS FOR
WHICH WE SHOULD BE THANKFUL.

"YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE
SING HYMNS OF PRAISE"

ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.300
