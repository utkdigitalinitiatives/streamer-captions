00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
THE EVOLUTION OF LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
HAS FOLLOWED A COMPLEX
AND TWISTING PATH,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
NOT UNLIKE THE
EVOLVING HISTORY

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
OF THE CONTINENT
ITSELF.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
AT ITS CORE, THE PROGRAM
OF THE LITERATURE

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
IS TO ESTABLISH
AND DEFINE

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
A CULTURAL AND
SOCIAL IDENTITY.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
THE WEST INDIES,
AMERICA, THE NEW WORLD

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
- EACH OF THESE NAMES
ATTEMPTED TO ENCAPSULATE

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
THIS NEW REALITY AS
IT WAS BEING SHAPED.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
THE PRE-HISPANIC WORLD
AND ITS LITERATURE

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
SUFFERED AN IRREPARABLE
RUPTURE FROM ITS PAST

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF
EUROPEAN CONQUISTADORS.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
THIS EVENT GAVE
RISE TO A NEW GENRE:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
THE CHRONICLES
OF THE INDIES.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:14.000
*

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
*

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
*

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
INTERMINGLING THE
EXPERIENCE OF THE

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
NEW WORLD WITH THE
LANGUAGE AND TRADITION

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
OF THE OLD, LATIN-AMERICAN
LITERATURE STANDS IN A

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP OF
IMITATION, INNOVATION,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
AND ANTAGONISM WITH
ITS EUROPEAN PARENTAGE.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
THIS DYNAMIC CHANGED
RADICALLY IN THE PERIOD

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
BETWEEN THE
END OF THE 18TH

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
AND MIDDLE OF THE
19TH CENTURIES.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
FIRST, THE ENLIGHTENMENT
REACHED THE AMERICAS;

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
THEN, THE GOVERNMENT
OF CARLOS III

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
LAUNCHED THE BOURBON
REFORMS WHICH

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
ATTEMPTED TO REORGANIZE
THE AMERICAN TERRITORIES

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
AND MAXIMIZE THEIR
PROFITABILITY.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
THESE POLICIES
ALSO HAD THE EFFECT

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
OF INVOLVING
THE COLONIES IN

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
EUROPEAN MILITARY
CONFLICTS OF THE TIME.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
CURIOUSLY, THESE BOURBON
LAWS WERE THEMSELVES

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
THE BYPRODUCT OF VARIOUS
TRAVEL NARRATIVES:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
THE WRITINGS OF
JUAN DE ULLOA

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
AND OF THE LA
CONDAMINE EXPEDITION;

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
AND THE STORIES OF
CAMPILLO AND COSSIO

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
WHO TRAVERSED THE CONTINENT
WHILE SENDING BACK

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
A SERIES OF REPORTS
TO THE FRENCH KINGS.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
HISTORIANS HAVE CALLED
DRASTIC REFORMS IMPOSED BY

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
THE BOURBONS "THE SECOND
CONQUEST OF AMERICA".

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
THESE MEASURES LED TO
A REALIGNMENT BETWEEN

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
MOTHER COUNTRY AND COLONY,
AND FORGED THE CRUCIBLE

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
FOR MANY A LATIN
AMERICAN REBELLION.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
MANY OTHER CHANGES
WRACKED THE CONTINENT:

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
THE 1767 EXPULSION
OF THE JESUITS

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
WHO RAN SOME OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
IN THE NEW WORLD;

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
AND INDIGENOUS
REBELLIONS,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
SUCH AS THAT OF TUPAC
AMARU IN PERU IN 1780,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
WHICH WAS FORCEFULLY
SUPPRESSED.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
THE LATIN-AMERICAN
LITERATURE OF THE ERA

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
- INCLUDING TRAVEL
NARRATIVES, MEMOIRS,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
POETRY, AND NOVELS,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
ECHOED A BURGEONING
SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
LIBERTY WAS A CENTRAL THEME
FOR WRITERS OF EVERY GENRE.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
JOURNALISM SPREAD NEW
IDEAS; LETTERS, SPEECHES,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
AND POLITICAL ESSAYS WERE
A SIGNIFICANT FORM OF

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
LITERARY OUTPUT ON THE
CONTINENT AT A MOMENT WHEN

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
WRITING AND REVOLUTION
WERE INTRINSICALLY UNITED.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
HOWEVER, CULTURAL
INDEPENDENCE

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
CAN BE EVEN MORE
DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
THAN POLITICAL
INDEPENDENCE.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
EVEN AS LATIN-AMERICAN
LITERATURE BEGAN TO

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
COME INTO ITS OWN,
AUTHORS CONTINUED TO

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
RELY ON MODELS AND THEMES
IMPORTED FROM SPAIN.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
THERE WAS SOMETHING
THE FOUNDING FATHERS

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
OF THE LATIN AMERICAN
NATIONS DID WELL;

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
DURING THE DAY THEY WERE
GENERALS, PRESIDENTS,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
LEGISLATORS, BUT AT NIGHT
THEY BECAME NOVELISTS,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
AND THEY WOULD IMITATE
AND PURPOSEFULLY CHANGE

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
THE MODELS OF POPULAR
EUROPEAN NOVELS.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
FOR EXAMPLE,
A EUROPEAN NOVEL

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
COULD BE ABOUT LOVE,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:55.000
ABOUT AN EROTIC RELATIONSHIP
THAT WAS FRUSTRATED

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
BECAUSE IT WENT AGAINST
THEIR SENSE OF DUTY.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
LATIN AMERICANS UNDERSTOOD
VERY WELL THAT WITHOUT DESIRE

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
THERE WOULDN'T EXIST ANY
DUTY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
A NEW SOCIETY.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
THE DESIRE WAS PLACED
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
AT THE SAME TIME, THIS NEW
LITERATURE ESTABLISHED

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
A DIALOGUE WITH OTHER
LITERARY TRADITIONS

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
AND AESTHETIC MOVEMENTS:

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
NEOCLASSICISM,
ROMANTICISM,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
AND LATER,
REALISM AND SYMBOLISM.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
IN THIS INTERWEAVING
ONE FINDS

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
THE "LITERATURE
OF INDEPENDENCE"

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
THAT IS PARTICULAR
TO THE NEW WORLD.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
FAR FROM THE
TRADITIONS OF EUROPE,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
LITERATURE THREADS TOGETHER
THE OLD AND THE NEW,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THE ALIEN AND
THE INDIGENOUS,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
TO FORM ITS OWN
NEW CREATIONS.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
AMONG THESE ARE LATIN
AMERICAN NOVELS

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
AND THE BEGINNINGS
OF "GAUCHO" POETRY.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
THE ARGENTINEAN ESSAYIST,
SUSANA ZANETTI,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
CLAIMS THAT "AMERICA
OWES ITS FIRST NOVEL

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
TO CENSORSHIP
OF THE PRESS".

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THE GENESIS OF THE FIRST
LATIN AMERICAN NOVEL,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
"SARMIENTO'S PARROT",
BEARS OUT HER ASSERTION.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
LIZARDI BELONGS TO,
LET'S SAY, HIS THOUGHTS

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
ARE VERY ATTACHED TO
THOSE OF THE ILLUMINATI,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
TO ENLIGHTENMENT.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
AND HE ENVISIONS A
SOCIETY FOUNDED UPON

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
A STRONG REFORMATION OF
ETHICAL AND MORAL VALUES

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
AND BEHAVIOR,
AND DUE TO THAT,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
HE WOULD HAVE BIG
PROBLEMS WITH CENSORSHIP.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
AT THE BEGINNING OF
THE 19TH CENTURY,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTIONARIES
DON MIGUEL HIDALGO

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
AND JOSE MARIA MORELOS
WERE ISSUING DEFIANT

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST
SPANISH DOMINANCE.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
SPAIN REACTED SWIFTLY AND
ANGRILY, QUELLING DISSENT

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
AND EXERCISING CENSORSHIP
OVER THE MEDIA.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
THE MEXICAN AUTHOR,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
JOSE JOAQUIM
FERNANDEZ DE LIZARDI,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
A JOURNALIST WHO WROTE
UNDER THE PEN NAME

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
"THE MEXICAN THINKER",

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
ATTEMPTED TO DODGE
GOVERNMENT CENSORS

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
BY PUBLISHING HIS
NOVEL IN INSTALLMENTS.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
HE WAS NOT ENTIRELY
SUCCESSFUL, HOWEVER.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
THOUGH HE STARTED
PUBLISHING IN 1816,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
THE LAST FOUR VOLUMES WERE
NOT PUBLISHED UNTIL 1831.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
THE NOVEL IS WRITTEN IN
THE PICARESQUE TRADITION,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
A SATIRICAL WORK THAT
FOLLOWS THE CAREER

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
OF A ROGUISH HERO WHO
LIVES BY HIS WITS.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
DESPITE ITS
COMIC DIMENSIONS,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
THE NOVEL HAS A CLEAR
PEDAGOGICAL INTENT:

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.000
TO INSTRUCT AND EDUCATE THE
FLEDGLING MIDDLE CLASSES.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
THIS CHARACTER IS
RATHER TYPICAL

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
IN THE SPANISH
PICARESQUE GENRE,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
AND IN THAT SENSE IT IS THE
FIRST LATIN AMERICAN NOVEL

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
PLACED HALFWAY
BETWEEN

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
INDEPENDENCE FROM
THE EUROPEAN MODELS

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:23.000
AND THE GENERATION
WITH NEW PERSPECTIVES.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
THE NOVEL MARRIES LOW
COMEDY WITH A HIGH

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
MORAL TONE - A SYNTHESIS
THAT WAS TO BECOME

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
A RECURRENT MOTIF
OF MEXICAN NOVELS.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
IT ALSO VIVIDLY DEPICTS
THE SOCIETY OF THE TIME -

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
SATIRIZING ITS SHORTCOMINGS
WHILE AFFECTIONATELY

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
RECORDING THE VOICES,
PLACES, AND CHARACTERS

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000
THAT POPULATE
SARMIENTO'S WORLD.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I WAS BORN IN THE CITY
 OF MEXICO, THE CAPITAL

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
OF NORTH AMERICA,
 IN NEW SPAIN.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
NEVER COULD MY MOUTH SING
 SUFFICIENT PRAISE IN HONOR

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
OF MY DEAR COUNTRY;
 BUT SINCE IT IS MINE,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
SUCH PRAISE WOULD
 BE EVER SUSPECT.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
THOSE WHO LIVE THERE, AND
 THE FOREIGNERS WHO HAVE

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
SEEN IT, CAN GIVE MORE
 BELIEVABLE PANEGYRICS,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
FOR THEY ARE NOT
 CONSTRAINED BY PARTIALITY,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
WHOSE MAGNIFYING LENS
 CAN AT TIMES HIDE DEFECTS

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
WHILE ENLARGING THE
 ADVANTAGES OF A COUNTRY,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
EVEN TO THOSE
 BORN THERE.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I LEAVE, THEREFORE, THE
 DESCRIPTION OF MEXICO

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
TO IMPARTIAL OBSERVERS.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
LIZARDI WROTE
"SARMIENTO'S PARROT"

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME
THAT THE FAMOUS PRIEST,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
FRAY SERVANDO
TERESA DE MIER,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
WAS PUTTING DOWN HIS
ADVENTURES IN WRITING.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
A MEXICAN DOMINICAN PRIEST
WHO STRUGGLED FOR HIS

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
COUNTRY'S INDEPENDENCE,
FRAY SERVANDO WAS

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
BOLD ENOUGH TO STAND UP
TO THE CHURCH ITSELF,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
AND ENDED UP
EXILED IN SPAIN

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
FOR HIS PRO-INDEPENDENCE
ACTIVITIES.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
IN THE CASE OF
FRAY SERVANDO,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
HIS STRUGGLE FOR THE
INDEPENDENCE OF MEXICO

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
ENCOMPASSED ALL THE
LEVELS OF CONTACT,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
INCLUDING THE PRESS,
IDEOLOGICAL SPEECHES,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
BOOKS OF HISTORY
AND ARMED COMBAT

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
- HE PARTICIPATES
IN ALL OF THESE.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
INSPIRED BY THE WRITINGS
OF FRAY BARTOLOME

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
DE LAS CASAS, HE USED HIS
MEMOIRS TO EXAMINE THE

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
SPAIN AND ITS COLONIES,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
AND IN THE PROCESS HE ARGUED
FOR LOCAL INDEPENDENCE.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
FRAY SERVANDO HAD AN
AMAZING MEMORY -

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AKIN TO BERNAL DIAZ'S
DETAILED RECOLLECTIONS

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
IN HIS "TRUE HISTORY OF
THE CONQUEST OF NEW SPAIN".

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
HE USED THIS TROVE TO
CHRONICLE THE POLITICAL

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS
OF HIS HOMELAND.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
AT THE SAME TIME, HE
REACHED OUT TO EDUCATED

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
EUROPEANS IN
FRANCE AND SPAIN,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
HOPING FOR
THEIR SUPPORT.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
FOR HIS EFFORTS, HE WAS
IMPRISONED AND TRIED.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
IN HIS "MEMOIRS" HE
HOLDS NO PUNCHES

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
IN HIS CRITICISM OF
THE FUNCTIONARIES

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
WHO PERSECUTE HIM
AND HIS COUNTRYMEN.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
THE AGENTS OF THE
 INDIES, TO BE GOOD,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
MUST BE ABSOLUTE KNAVES,
 WITHOUT SOUL OR CONSCIENCE.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THEY HAD THE
 KEYS TO THE COURT

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AND THE COUNCIL OF
 THE INDIES BOUGHT OFF.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
WITH HUMOR AND DRAMA, THE
DOMINICAN ALSO RECOUNTS

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
HIS STOPOVER IN A
JAIL CLOSE TO MADRID.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
AFTER THREE DAYS, EVEN
 THOUGH THE BISHOP'S

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
SENTENCE RULED NOTHING
 BUT JUST RECLUSION IN THE

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
CONVENT, I WAS PUT IN A
 CELL, FROM WHERE I WAS

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
TAKEN OUT ONLY FOR CHORUS,
 REFECTORY, AND THEY COULD

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
ALSO TAKE ME OUT
 TO ROUSE THE RATS.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
SO MANY WERE THEY AND SO
 BIG, THAT THEY ATE MY HAT,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
AND I HAD TO SLEEP ARMED
 WITH A WOODEN STICK

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
SO THEY WOULD
 NOT EAT ME.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
LIKE LIZARDI, FRAY
SERVANDO WROTE IN THE

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
PICARESQUE TRADITION,
TAKING AS HIS MODEL

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
THE FANTASTICAL
TRAVEL NARRATIVE.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
HE USED HYPERBOLE, SATIRE,
AND BURLESQUE TO ADDRESS

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
SERIOUS TOPICS - HUNGER,
DESPAIR, AND PERSECUTION.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
THROUGH HIS NARRATIVE
LENS, THE THEMES OF

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
PERSECUTION AND BETRAYAL
ARE RE-SIGNIFIED

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
AS ARGUMENTS FOR
INDEPENDENCE.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
BIZARRE INCIDENTS THAT
CROP UP IN HIS "MEMOIRS"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
POINT THE WAY TO AN
ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDING

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
OF THE TALE AND OF
EXPERIENCE ITSELF.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
THIS INTENTIONALLY SKEWED
WORLDVIEW WILL RECUR

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
LATER IN LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
SUCH AS WHEN THE CUBAN
WRITER, REINALDO ARENAS,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
REPRISED THE FIGURE
OF FRAY SERVANDO

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
IN HIS NOVEL "THE
HALLUCINATING WORLD".

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
AN AESTHETIC STORM
SWEPT THROUGH EUROPE

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
IN THE 18TH CENTURY, A
POWERFUL AND COMPELLING

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
MOVEMENT THAT CAME TO BE
KNOWN AS "ROMANTICISM".

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
THE ROMANTICS RENOUNCED
THE ENLIGHTENMENTS'

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
RATIONALIZATION OF
NATURE, AND STAGED A

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
PHILOSOPHICAL REVOLT
AGAINST ARISTOCRATIC

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
NORMS OF THE DAY.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
NATURALLY, SOUTH AMERICAN
REVOLUTIONARIES EMBRACED

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
ROMANTICISM, WHICH ARRIVED
ON THEIR CONTINENT

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
BY WAY OF WRITERS SUCH
AS ESTEBAN ECHEVERRIA.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
ECHEVERRIA SPENT
FIVE YEARS IN PARIS

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
JUST AS ROMANTICISM
WAS AT ITS ZENITH,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
RETURNING TO BUENOS
AIRES IN 1830.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
IN 1832, HE INTRODUCED THE
MOVEMENT TO THE NEW WORLD,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
STARTING WITH THE
PUBLICATION OF HIS POEM

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
"ELVIRA" OR "THE
BRIDE OF THE PLATA".

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
HIS LATER PUBLICATIONS -
A BOOK OF POEMS ENTITLED

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
"CONSOLATIONS", THE
POEM "THE CAPTIVE",

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
AND HIS STORY "THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE",

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
ALSO EXHIBIT MANY
HALLMARKS OF ROMANTICISM:

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
THE EXALTATION OF THE EGO;
THE REJECTION OF TRADITION

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
AND CLASSICAL RULES; A
RETURN TO WHAT IS SIMPLE;

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
EXALTATION OF NATURE AS
BOTH MODEL AND MOTIVE;

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
AND THE QUEST FOR A
NATIONAL LITERATURE.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
THESE BECAME BASIC
TENETS OF LATIN AMERICAN

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
ROMANTICISM, HELPING
DEFINE THE AESTHETICS

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
AND PHILOSOPHY OF
THE CONTINENT'S

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
NEWLY EMERGING
NATIONAL CULTURES.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
THE QUEST WAS TO
FIND THEMES, FORMS,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
AND A VERNACULAR
THAT DEPOSED

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
SPANISH
IMPERIAL INFLUENCE.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
TO THIS END, THE
ARGENTINE CRITIC,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
JUAN MARIA GUTIERREZ,
PUBLISHED THE FIRST

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
ANTHOLOGY OF LATIN
AMERICAN POETRY,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
"AMERICA POETICA",
IN 1846.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
GUTIERREZ WAS A NOTED
INTELLECTUAL AND FOUNDER,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
ALONG WITH ANDRES BELLO,
OF THE MAGAZINE CALLED

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
THE AMERICAN LIBRARY.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
HE CALLED FOR A CLEAN BREAK
WITH THE COLONIAL PAST.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
SPANISH SCIENCE AND
 LITERATURE ARE NULL AND VOID,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
WE SHOULD DIVORCE OURSELVES
 ENTIRELY FROM THEM,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
EMANCIPATE OURSELVES
 IN THIS RESPECT

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
FROM THE PENINSULAR
 TRADITIONS,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
AS WE WERE ABLE TO
 DO IN POLITICS

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
WHEN WE DECLARED
 OURSELVES FREE.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
YET WE REMAIN BOUND
 BY THE STRONG

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
AND NARROW BOND
 OF LANGUAGE:

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
BUT THIS SHOULD
 WEAKEN IN TIME,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
AS WE ENTER INTO THE
 INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:18.000
OF THE ADVANCED
 PEOPLES OF EUROPE.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
LATIN-AMERICAN
INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
GAVE BIRTH TO A NEW
TYPE OF POPULAR VERSE:

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
GAUCHO POETRY.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
GAUCHOS WERE SOUTH
AMERICAN CATTLE HERDERS,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THE
NORTH AMERICAN COWBOY,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
AND ALSO A SYMBOL OF
ROUGH-HEWN INDIVIDUALISM.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
AS SUCH, GAUCHO LITERATURE
SPRANG FROM THE EARTH

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
AND SPOKE FROM THE HEART OF
THE LATIN AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
THE URUGUAYAN POET,
BARTOLOME HIDALGO,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
COMPOSED HIS WORKS
"PATRIOTIC SKIES"

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
AND "PATRIOTIC DIALOGS"
IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
1812 AND 1822.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
HIDALGO WROTE IN
SUPPORT OF THE PUSH FOR

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
INDEPENDENCE SPEARHEADED
BY JOSE GERVASIO ARTIGAS.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
HE WORKED IN A FORM
OF POPULAR POETRY

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
CALLED THE OCTAVE,
WHICH ECHOED

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
THE RHYTHM AND CADENCE
OF GAUCHO MINSTRELS.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
IN A MEMORABLE SERIES OF
POEMS, HIDALGO BOLDLY

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
EVANGELIZED HIS READERS
TO JOIN THE REVOLUTION,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
AS IN HIS
FAMOUS POEM

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
"LITTLE SKY OF
INDEPENDENCE".

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
IF OF EVERYTHING IN
 CREATION IT IS HEAVEN

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
THAT IS THE BEST,
 "HEAVEN" MUST BE

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
THE DANCE OF THE
 PEOPLES OF THE UNION.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
HEAVEN, LITTLE HEAVEN
 AND MORE HEAVEN,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
LITTLE HEAVEN ALWAYS
 SING THE HAPPINESS

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
COMES FROM HEAVEN, FROM
 HEAVEN COMES FREEDOM.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
TODAY A NATION IS
 INTRODUCING ITSELF

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
TO THE WORLD, WELL
 THE UNITED PROVINCES

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
PROCLAIM THEIR
 INDEPENDENCE.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
LITTLE SKY, MERRY SKY,
 SKY OF LIBERTY,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
SWEARING INDEPENDENCE
 WE ARE SLAVES NO MORE.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
HIDALGO'S EIGHT-SYLLABLE
VERSES, WRITTEN IN THE

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
TRADITION OF SPANISH
POPULAR POETRY,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
ADDRESS THE SENSIBILITIES
OF LESS-EDUCATED FOLK

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
WHO, BEING UNABLE TO
READ, IMMERSE THEMSELVES

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
IN LITERATURE BY
MEMORIZING WORKS

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
THAT ARE
RECITED TO THEM.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
THIS IS A WHOLLY
DISTINCT WAY

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
OF READING
AND LISTENING,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
COMPLETELY ALIEN FROM
THAT OF THE UPPER CLASSES.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
MOREOVER, THIS POETRY
EMPLOYED WHAT WAS THEN

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
A NOVEL STRATEGY - THE
PERSON NARRATING THE PIECE

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
IN FIRST PERSON IS
THE GAUCHO HIMSELF.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
SOUTH AMERICAN LITERATURE,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IS
HEARD, AS ECHOED THROUGH

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
THE PRISM OF THE
EDUCATED PERSON

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
WHO ADAPTS THAT
VOICE TO THE PAGE.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
GAUCHO POETRY IS A
GENRE ORIGINAL TO

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
IT HAS DIFFERENT STAGES
THAT TAKE PLACE BETWEEN

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
THE PERIOD THAT STARTS
DURING THE MAY REVOLUTION

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD,
AND THE PERIOD WHEN

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THE NATIONAL STATE IS
BEING CONSOLIDATED.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
THIS HAPPENED IN
ARGENTINA AROUND 1880.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
SO DURING THAT PERIOD YOU
CAN FIND DIFFERENT AUTHORS

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
SOME QUITE IMPORTANT,
SOME NOT THAT WELL KNOWN

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
BUT WHO WERE ALSO
PART OF THIS GENRE.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
ANOTHER POET OF GREAT
IMPORT FROM THIS PERIOD

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
IS THE PERUVIAN WRITER
MARIANO MELGAR.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
MELGAR WAS A MESTIZO
- A PERSON OF MIXED

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN
INDIAN ANCESTRY.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
HE TYPICALLY ADHERED TO
TRADITIONAL NEOCLASSICAL

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
FORMS IN HIS ODES, SONNETS
AND FABLES; HOWEVER,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
SOME OF HIS WORKS,
SUCH AS "YARAVIES",

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
LOOSELY TRANSLATED AS
"MELANCHOLY INDIAN SONGS"

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
INCORPORATE A
POPULIST VOICE,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
ENGAGING PLOT CONVENTIONS,
AND INDIGENOUS FORMS.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
MELGAR BROUGHT TOGETHER
THE STANDARD ELEMENTS

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
OF "HIGH" POETRY WITH
THE MOTIFS AND TIMBRE

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
OF INDIGENOUS
TRADITIONS.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
NATURALLY, MUCH OF HIS
WORK RESONATED WITH

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
THE CRY FOR INDEPENDENCE,
AS IS DEMONSTRATED

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000
IN HIS CELEBRATED WORK,
"ODE TO LIBERTY".

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
FINALLY FREE AND
 SAFE I CAN SING.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THE HARD BRIDLE HAS
 BROKEN, I WILL DISCOVER

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
MY HAVEN, AND WITH PURE
 LANGUAGE I WILL SHOW

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
THE TRUTH THAT
 TAKES REFUGE IN IT,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
MY WELL UNDERSTOOD
 FREEDOM.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
HEAR: CEASE YOUR WEEPING;
 RAISE YOUR DOWNCAST FACES,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
INDIANS WHO WITH FEAR,
 OPPRESSED SLAVES,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
WITHOUT CONSOLATION
 FROM HEAVEN OR EARTH,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
YOU HAVE BEEN
 CAPTIVES IN OUR SOIL.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
THE POPULIST STYLE
OF POETRY GAVE VOICE

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
TO THE YEARNINGS
OF THE PEOPLE

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
AND ECHOED CRIES
FOR INDEPENDENCE.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
YET MANY POETS WORKING IN
THE NEOCLASSICAL STYLE OF

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
THE TIME WERE ALSO SINGING
THE PRAISES OF LIBERTY,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
ALBEIT IN REFINED METER
AND HIGH-TONED LANGUAGE.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
WRITERS SUCH AS
JUAN CRUZ VARELA

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
AND JOSE JOAQUIN
DE OLMEDO

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
WERE UNDOUBTEDLY
UNDER THE INFLUENCE

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
OF BOTH SPANISH AND
CLASSICAL POETS,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
BUT THEY CREATED WORKS
THAT WERE PATRIOTIC,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
ANTI-SPAIN,
AND PRO-INDIAN.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
NOT COINCIDENTALLY,
THIS IS ALSO THE PERIOD

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
DURING WHICH SEVERAL LATIN
AMERICAN NATIONAL ANTHEMS

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
WERE COMPOSED.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
THESE WORKS
WERE TYPICALLY

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
NEOCLASSIC POEMS SET
TO MUSIC, AS IS THE CASE

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
WITH THE ARGENTINEAN
NATIONAL ANTHEM,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
WRITTEN BY VICENTE
LOPEZ Y PLANES.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
THE MEN WHO LED THE
CHARGE FOR LATIN AMERICAN

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
INDEPENDENCE WERE ALSO
FORCES TO BE RECKONED WITH

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
IN THE WORLD
OF LITERATURE.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
THESE DYNAMIC
PERSONALITIES,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
INSTRUMENTAL IN DRIVING
A WEDGE BETWEEN THE

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
NEW WORLD AND THE OLD,
ALSO LEFT A LEGACY OF

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
LETTERS, SPEECHES,
AND MANIFESTOS -

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
WORK THAT TODAY
CONSTITUTES A CENTRAL

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
PART OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN ARCHIVE.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
AMONG THESE LEADERS
WAS THE ARISTOCRATIC

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
REVOLUTIONARY
SIMON BOLIVAR.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
KNOWN AND BELOVED
AS "THE LIBERATOR",

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
BOLIVAR WIELDED THE WORD
AS WELL AS THE SWORD

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
IN HIS FIGHT FOR
INDEPENDENCE.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
HE LEFT BEHIND WORKS SUCH
AS "LETTER FROM JAMAICA",

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
WRITTEN IN
EXILE IN 1815,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
IN WHICH HE SUPPORTED
LATIN AMERICAN UNITY;

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
AND THE FAMOUS
"ANGOSTURA SPEECH"

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
IN WHICH HE RENOUNCED
THE SPECIAL POWERS

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
THAT HAD BEEN
GRANTED HIM

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
AND OUTLINED THE REPUBLIC
THAT WAS TO FOLLOW.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
"THE LETTER FROM JAMAICA"
WAS WRITTEN WHEN BOLIVAR

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
HAD RETREATED TO THAT
ISLAND AFTER A SERIES

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
OF MILITARY AND
POLITICAL SETBACKS.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
IT IS ACTUALLY A RESPONSE
TO A LETTER FROM AN

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
ENGLISHMAN, HENRY CULLEN,
THROUGH WHOM BOLIVAR

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
SOUGHT TO REACH THE
ANGLO-SAXON WORLD.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
HIS GOAL WAS TO
EXPLAIN THE MOTIVES

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
FOR THE LATIN AMERICAN
QUEST FOR INDEPENDENCE,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
AND TO SECURE THE
COLLABORATION OF ENGLAND.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
IN HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH
CULLEN, BOLIVAR WOVE A

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
TALE OF SPANISH INIQUITY
AND CUNNING WHOSE GENESIS

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
REACHED BACK TO THE FIRST
MOMENTS OF THE CONQUEST.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
HE LEVELS SCORCHING
CRITICISM AT THE MISDEEDS

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
OF THE SPANIARDS, CALLING
THEM, "ATROCITIES THAT

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
SEEM GREATER THAN HUMAN
PERVERSITY COULD ALLOW;

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
AND THEY WOULD NEVER BE
BELIEVED BY MODERN CRITICS

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
IF COUNTLESS DOCUMENTS
DID NOT TESTIFY

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
TO THESE
ILL-FATED TRUTHS".

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
HE CONCLUDED THIS
REMARKABLE WORK

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
WITH A VISION DEAR TO HIS
HEART - THAT OF AMERICA

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000
AS A "GREAT
IMPOSSIBLE REPUBLIC".

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
IT IS A GRANDIOSE IDEA TO
 THINK OF CONSOLIDATING

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
THE NEW WORLD INTO
 A SINGLE NATION,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
UNIFIED BY PACTS
 INTO A SINGLE BOND.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
IT IS REASONED THAT, AS
 THESE PARTS HAVE A COMMON

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
ORIGIN, LANGUAGE,
 CUSTOMS, AND RELIGION,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A SINGLE
 GOVERNMENT TO PERMIT THE

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
NEWLY FORMED STATES TO
 UNITE IN A CONFEDERATION.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
BUT THIS IS
 NOT POSSIBLE.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
ACTUALLY, AMERICA IS
 SEPARATED BY CLIMATIC

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
DIFFERENCES, GEOGRAPHIC
 DIVERSITY, CONFLICTING

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
INTERESTS, AND DISSIMILAR
 CHARACTERISTICS.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
THE DREAM OF FORMING A
UNITED LATIN AMERICA -

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
"OUR AMERICA", AS THE
WRITER JOSE MARTI

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
WOULD CALL IT 70
YEARS LATER -

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
WOULD BECOME AN
OBSESSIVE PREOCCUPATION

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
FOR LATIN AMERICANS
IN THE COMING YEARS.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
THIS CONVERSATION BEGAN
WITH THE WRITINGS OF

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
REVOLUTIONARIES LIKE SIMON
BOLIVAR, THE ARGENTINEAN

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
GENERAL JOSE DE SAN
MARTIN, AND THE URUGUAYAN

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
NATIONAL HERO
JOSE ARTIGAS.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
INDEPENDENCE FROM SPAIN
WAS NOT TO BE ACHIEVED

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
SOLELY BY FORCE OF
ARMS, NOR COULD IT

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY
MERE PROCLAMATIONS.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
DECLARING INDEPENDENCE FOR
THE NEW WORLD COLONIES

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
DID NOT MEAN THAT
NEW SOVEREIGN NATIONS

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
WOULD SIMPLY SPRING
UP IN THEIR PLACE.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
HOWEVER, THE LITERATURE
OF REVOLUTION

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
DID FOSTER A GOOD
DEAL OF REFLECTION

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
ON THE IDEA OF LATIN
AMERICA ITSELF;

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
ON INDIVIDUAL
AND SHARED IDENTITY,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
ON FUTURE NATIONS, ON
CULTURAL INDEPENDENCE,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
AND ON SUBMISSION
TO A LANGUAGE

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
THAT REPRESENTED
COLONIAL OPPRESSION.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
YET THAT LANGUAGE WAS
ALREADY AN ESSENTIAL

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
COMPONENT OF LATIN
AMERICAN IDENTITY.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
ONE FIGURE LIES AT THE
CENTER OF THESE DEBATES -

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
THE VENEZUELAN HUMANIST,
POET, LAWMAKER,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
PHILOSOPHER, EDUCATOR, AND
PHILOLOGIST ANDRES BELLO.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
HE HAS BEEN CALLED THE
"ARCHETYPE OF THE 19TH

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
CENTURY LATIN AMERICAN
EDUCATOR AND CIVIC POET"

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
AND HIS BIOGRAPHY
READS LIKE

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
A HISTORY OF
THE CONTINENT.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
BELLO WAS BORN IN CARACAS,
BUT LIVED MUCH OF HIS LIFE

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
ON THE MOVE,
TRAVELING OR IN EXILE.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
HE WAS A FRIEND OF THE
FAMED GERMAN NATURALIST

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
AND EXPLORER,
ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
AND A COMPANION ON
SOME OF HIS JOURNEYS.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
HE WAS A FIXTURE IN
EUROPEAN INTELLECTUAL

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
CIRCLES, AND HE WAS EVEN
SIMON BOLIVAR'S TEACHER

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
DESPITE HIS IMPRESSIVE
RESUME, BELLO WAS AN

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
OBJECT OF CONTROVERSY, AND
HIS HIGH PROFILE MADE HIM

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
A TARGET FOR PERSONAL
ATTACKS AND ACCUSATIONS.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
AT THE AGE OF 48,
BELLO ARRIVED IN CHILE,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
HOUNDED BY DEBATES
AND RIVALRIES

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
SUCH AS DOMINGO
FAUSTINO SARMIENTO,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
THE ARGENTINE WRITER
AND POLITICIAN,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
AND JOSE LASTARRIA.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
LASTARRIA ARGUED THAT
THE WRITER MUST TEASE OUT

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
THE MEANING OF
HISTORICAL FACTS

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
TO DRAW LESSONS
FOR THE PRESENT.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
BELLO, BY CONTRAST, FELT
THAT BECAUSE OUR KNOWLEDGE

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
OF HISTORY ó PARTICULARLY
SOUTH AMERICAN HISTORY -

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
WAS INCOMPLETE,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
THE BEST COURSE WAS TO
STICK TO KNOWN FACTS.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
DISPUTES SUCH AS THESE,
THOUGH SEEMINGLY ARCANE

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
TO OUR EARS, GENERATED
HUGE FIRESTORMS OF DEBATE

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
IN BELLO'S TIME.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
BELLO BECAME A PROMINENT
FIGURE IN CHILE,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
AN OFFICIAL IN THE MINISTRY
OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
THE FIRST RECTOR OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF CHILE,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
AND A MEMBER OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT LEGAL

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
AND EDUCATIONAL
COMMISSIONS.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
WELL-VERSED IN GREEK AND
LATIN LITERATURE AND THE

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
SPANISH CLASSICS, HE WAS
A HIGHLY ERUDITE MAN WHO

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
LEVERAGED THE POWER OF
EDUCATION AND LANGUAGE

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
TO HELP CHART THE
DESTINIES OF A CONTINENT.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
HE LEFT BEHIND A HUGE
LITERARY LEGACY,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
INCLUDING HIS "GRAMMAR OF
THE CASTILIAN LANGUAGE,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
DEDICATED FOR THE
USE BY AMERICANS".

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000
ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS
POEMS WAS "SILVA TO THE

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
AGRICULTURE OF THE TORRID
ZONE" WRITTEN IN 1826.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
IT WAS INTENDED TO BE PART
OF AN EPIC WORK ENTITLED

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
"AMERICA", WHICH
HE NEVER FINISHED.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
A CLASSICAL
REVOLUTIONARY,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
BELLO IS A STUDY
IN CONTRASTS,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
DEDICATED TO WIELDING
THE SPANISH LANGUAGE

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
IN HIS CALL FOR THE END
OF SPANISH DOMINATION.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
SAVE, FRUITFUL LAND,
 WHO CIRCUMSCRIBED THE

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
PASSIONATE SUN TO THE
 VAGUE COURSE, AND AS A

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
BEING DARE YOURSELF ONTO
 EVERY DISTINCT CLIMATE,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
CARESSED BY ITS
 LIGHT, BEGET!

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
YOU KNIT FOR
 THE SUMMER

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
ITS GARLAND OF
 POMEGRANATE SPIKES;

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
YOU GIVE THE GRAPES
 TO THE BURNING BARREL,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
NOT OF PURPLISH FRUIT,
 OR RED, OR YELLOW;

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL
 FORESTS, NO LACK OF SHADE,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
AND DRINK FROM THEM THE
 THOUSAND SMELLS OF THE WIND.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
DURING THE QUEST FOR
INDEPENDENCE AND IN ITS

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
AFTERMATH, THE PROSE
ESSAY BECAME A FIXTURE

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
IN LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
AS THE 19TH CENTURY
PROGRESSED AND THE PACE

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
OF CHANGE ACCELERATED, THE
ESSAY BECAME A FLASH POINT

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
OF DIALOGUE, A MEANS OF
ACHIEVING NOTHING LESS

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
THAN NATIONAL
COHESIVENESS.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
THE MOST OUTSTANDING NEW
WORLD ESSAYISTS WERE THE

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
PUERTO RICAN JOSE MARIA
DE HOSTOS, THE BOLIVIAN

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
GABRIEL RENE-MORENO, THE
ECUADORIAN JOSE MONTALVO,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
AND THE ARGENTINEAN
DOMINGO FAUSTINO SARMIENTO.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
THE GENRE OF THE ESSAY
HAD, IN MY OPINION,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
HIGH AND LOW POINTS.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
THERE ARE GREAT
ESSAY WRITERS,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
SUCH AS JOSE
MARIA LUIS MORA,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
WHO WAS A MAN WITH
AN ENORMOUS ABILITY

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
TO ANALYZE A SITUATION
AND HANDLE IT MODERATELY,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
RENDERING A DIAGNOSIS
OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
WITH GOOD JUDGMENT.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
THERE WERE OTHERS WHO
WEREN'T AS MODERATE,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
AND IN THESE CASES THE
ESSAY BECOMES A PAMPHLET.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
BORN IN THE FINAL STAGES OF
THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
THESE WRITERS REPRESENTED
A NEW GENERATION;

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
ONE THAT AGGRESSIVELY
QUESTIONED

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
OLD-GUARD INTELLECTUALS
ON THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
THE NATURE OF CULTURE,
AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATION.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
OF THESE MEN, SARMIENTO IS
PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
HE SERVED AS PRESIDENT OF
ARGENTINA FOR SIX YEARS

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
BUT IS REMEMBERED AS
MUCH FOR HIS PERSISTENT

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
DIATRIBES, BRILLIANT
POLEMICS, AND INCISIVE

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
ATTACKS AS HE IS FOR HIS
POLITICAL ACHIEVEMENTS.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
HIS MOST FAMOUS
WORK IS "FACUNDO",

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
AN ESSAY THAT EXAMINES
THE COMPLEX DYNAMIC

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
OF CIVILIZATION
AND BRUTALITY.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT
NONE OF SARMIENTO'S WORKS

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
CAN BE COMPLETELY CONTAINED
WITHIN ONE LITERARY GENRE.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
HE WOVE TOGETHER
BIOGRAPHY, MEMOIR,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
DIATRIBE, AND PEDAGOGICAL
DISCOURSE, ALWAYS WITH THE

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
STAMP OF THE EGO THROUGH
WHICH ALL IS FILTERED.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
HE WAS ALSO AN OPPONENT OF
THE ARGENTINEAN DICTATOR,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
JUAN MANUEL DE ROSAS, AND
LATER EMIGRATED TO CHILE

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
WHERE HE WROTE "FACUNDO",
WHOSE OPENING LINES

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
REVERBERATE DOWN
TO THIS DAY.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
TERRIBLE SHADOW OF
 FACUNDO, I WILL SUMMON YOU

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
SO THAT, BRUSHING OFF THE
 BLOODY DUST THAT COVERS

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
YOUR ASHES, YOU ARISE
 TO EXPLAIN TO US

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
THE SECRET LIFE AND THE
 INTERNAL CONVULSIONS

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
THAT ARE RENDING THE CORE
 OF THIS NOBLE PEOPLE!

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
SARMIENTO ANALYZED THE
GEOGRAPHY, HISTORY,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
AND SOCIAL CLIMATE
OF HIS COUNTRY -

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
AT TIMES WITH
AN EXALTED TONE,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
ALWAYS EMPHATIC, GROUNDED
IN PHILOSOPHICAL LIBERALISM,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
AND THE BELIEF THAT EUROPE
IS A DEBTOR CIVILIZATION.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
IN HIS TEXTS, SARMIENTO
ESSENTIALLY WROTE HIS WAY

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF
WHAT NATIONHOOD MEANS,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
AN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE
THEN RIGOROUSLY APPLIED

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
IN HIS ONGOING
POLITICAL STRUGGLE.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
HIS WORLDVIEW COUNTERPOSED
RURAL "BARBARITY" WITH

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
URBAN "CIVILIZATION" AND
IMPLICITLY CRITICIZED

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
THE DICTATOR, ROSAS, BY
ASSERTING THAT THE WAY

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
TO PROGRESS WAS THROUGH
EDUCATION AND THE

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
ELIMINATION OF BARBARIAN
AUTHORITARIANISM.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
ABOUT SARMIENTO, I'D SAY

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
HIS NAME IS MOST OFTEN LINKED
TO HIS ROLE AS AN EDUCATOR.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
IN CHILE HE HAD VERY
IMPORTANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
ON ONE HAND HE CREATED
THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
THAT WAS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR
HIM AND HE FOUGHT INTENSELY

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
TO IMPOSE NEW IDEAS,
A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
ONE THAT WOULD NOT
BE ATTACHED TO

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
THE RULES OF THE
EUROPEAN SPANISH.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
SARMIENTO WORKED WITHIN
THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
WESTERN CANON, EMPLOYING
THE EUROPEAN OUTLOOK

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
TO EXAMINE THE LATIN
AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
AT THE SAME TIME, HE WAS
ABLE TO PARSE EXPERIENCE

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
IN A WAY THAT WAS TOTALLY
DIVORCED FROM THE OLD

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
WORLD'S DISCIPLINED AND
HIERARCHICAL EPISTEMOLOGY.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
HIS WORLDVIEW PRESENTS
ITSELF TO THE SENSES

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
IN A DISTINCTLY
NEW WORLD MANNER.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
SARMIENTO CREATED A
LANGUAGE THAT IS LITERARY,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
NATIONAL, AND PERSONAL;
ONE THAT IS ESSENTIAL

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
FOR THE GENESIS OF A
NEW LATIN AMERICA.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
AND HE DEFINED AFRESH THE
ROLE OF THE AMERICAN WRITER.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
THERE IS AN EXEMPLARY
 JUSTICE TO DO,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
AND A GLORY TO OBTAIN
 AS AN ARGENTINE WRITER:

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
TO UPBRAID THE
 WORLD AND HUMILIATE

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
THE HAUGHTINESS OF THE
 BIG NAMES IN THE WORLD,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
WHETHER THEY
 CALL THEMSELVES

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
SCHOLARS OR GOVERNORS.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
NO DISCUSSION OF THE
INTERSECTION BETWEEN

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS
AND LITERATURE

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
WOULD BE COMPLETE
WITHOUT CONSIDERING

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
THE WORKS OF THE CUBAN
WRITER JOSE MARTI.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
MARTI WAS ONE OF THE
FOREMOST INTELLECTUALS

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
AND POETS OF
THE NEW WORLD,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
A PIONEERING VOICE
OF MODERNISM,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
A NOTED POLITICIAN,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
A PAINTER, AND A
GIFTED JOURNALIST.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
OF HIS EXTENSIVE
OEUVRE, ONE WORK

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
IN PARTICULAR SEEKS
TO ARTICULATE THE

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
POLITICS AND WRITING -

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
THE ESSAY ENTITLED
"OUR AMERICA".

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
IN IT, MARTI CALLS FOR
GOVERNANCE THAT IS UNIQUE

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
AND APPROPRIATE
TO THE AMERICAS,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
ONE THAT REJECTS THE
VESTIGES OF COLONIALISM,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
ENCOMPASSES THE DIVERSITY
OF THE AMERICAS,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
AND ACKNOWLEDGES THEIR
PRE-COLUMBIAN PAST.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
HE ALSO WARNED OF
THE THREAT POSED BY

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
"THE GIANT OF THE NORTH"
- THE UNITED STATES.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
THE ESSAY'S THEMES ARE
BOUND UP WITH MARTI'S

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
MODERNIST WORLDVIEW AND
HIS DESIRE FOR A STRONG,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.000
COHESIVE, AND COHERENT
LATIN AMERICA.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
THE TEXT INTENDS TO
BE VERY INFLUENTIAL.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
WHEN YOU READ IT, YOU GET
THE FOLLOWING IMPRESSION:

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
"YOU'RE WITH ME OR
YOU'RE AGAINST ME."

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
THERE IS NO
MIDDLE POINT.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
HE CREATES AN ACCOUNT OF
LATIN AMERICAN HISTORY,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
THE COLONIAL PERIOD,
THE REVOLUTIONS...

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.000
WHAT HE SAYS IS AS IMPORTANT
AS HOW HE SAYS IT,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
BECAUSE IT IS
STRONGLY POETIC.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
AT THE TIME THAT
MARTI WAS WRITING,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
CUBA WAS STILL
A SPANISH COLONY.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
CUBA FOUND ITSELF IN A
PRECARIOUS SITUATION,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
AT RISK OF BEING PURCHASED
BY THE UNITED STATES

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
- THE FATE OF ALASKA
AND LOUISIANA -

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
OR OF SIMPLY BEING ANNEXED,
AS HAD HAPPENED

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
WITH A LARGE PART OF
MEXICO'S TERRITORY.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
MARTI HAD LIVED MUCH
OF HIS LIFE IN THE U.S.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
AND HE FELT ACUTELY
CUBA'S WANING OPPORTUNITY

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
FOR INDEPENDENCE,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
AND THE ATTENDANT
LOSS OF IDENTITY -

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
BOTH NATIONAL AND
LATIN AMERICAN.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
"OUR AMERICA" IS AT ITS
CORE A MEDITATION ON WHAT

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
IT IS THAT WE MEAN WHEN
WE SAY "LATIN AMERICA".

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
IN IT, MARTI OFFERED A
PROPOSAL FOR CULTURAL

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
AUTONOMY THAT INCLUDES
EVERYONE ON THE CONTINENT,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE
WHOM MARTI CALLS

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
THE "NATURAL MAN" -
THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLES,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000
BLACKS, MESTIZOS,
THE OPPRESSED.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
WHAT REMAINS OF THE VILLAGE
 IN AMERICA MUST AWAKEN.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
THESE TIMES ARE NOT FOR
 SLEEPING IN A NIGHTCAP,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
BUT WITH WEAPONS
 FOR A PILLOW:

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
THE WEAPONS OF REASON,
 WHICH CONQUER ALL OTHERS.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
BARRICADES OF IDEAS
 ARE BETTER THAN

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
BARRICADES OF STONES.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
WITH A LANGUAGE RICH IN
METAPHOR AND MUSICALITY,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
MARTI INTRODUCED CUBA
TO THE CONTINENT

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
AS A FEMININE FIGURE,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
A LOVING MOTHER WHO
IS IN MORTAL DANGER.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
MARTI CAST HIMSELF AS AN
INTERNATIONAL MEDIATOR,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
A VOICE CRYING OUT TO
FELLOW INTELLECTUALS

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
EXHORTING THEM
TO PAY ATTENTION

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
TO THE DESTINY OF
THEIR CONTINENT.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
ABOVE ALL, "OUR AMERICA"
ENVISIONS A UTOPIA

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000
OF LATIN AMERICAN UNITY.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
WITH A SINGLE VOICE THE HYMN
 IS ALREADY BEING SUNG;

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
THE CURRENT GENERATION
 IS CARRYING

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
INDUSTRIOUS AMERICA ALONG
 THE ROAD LAID DOWN

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
BY ITS NOBLE FATHERS;

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
FROM THE RIO GRANDE TO
 THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
THE GREAT SEMI,
 ASTRIDE ITS CONDOR,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
SPREAD THE SEED OF
 THE NEW AMERICA

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
ON THE ROMANTIC NATIONS
 OF THE CONTINENT

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.000
AND ON THE SEA'S
 SORROWFUL ISLANDS!

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
THE PROCESS OF GAINING
INDEPENDENCE WAS NOT

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
INSTANTANEOUS, NOR DID
IT UNFOLD UNIFORMLY

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
THROUGHOUT
THE CONTINENT.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
CERTAIN AREAS, SUCH AS
THE RIO DE LA PLATA

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
OR THE ANDES,
WERE LIBERATED IN

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
THE FIRST YEARS OF
THE 19TH CENTURY,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
WHILE OTHERS HAD TO
WAIT MUCH LONGER,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
SUCH AS MEXICO, GRANTED
INDEPENDENCE IN 1824.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
AND ONCE MEXICO HAD
GAINED INDEPENDENCE,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
IT THEN HAD TO
SUFFER THROUGH

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
A BLOODY WAR WITH
THE UNITED STATES,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
A WAR IN WHICH IT LOST HALF
ITS ORIGINAL TERRITORY.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
SOME AREAS, SUCH
AS CENTRAL AMERICA,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
ENGAGED IN A HIGHLY
COMPLEX PATTERN

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
OF SEPARATION
FROM EUROPE.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
HAITI, SWAYED BY THE
INFLUENCE OF THE FRENCH

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
REVOLUTION, WAS THE FIRST
TERRITORY ON THE CONTINENT

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
TO PROCLAIM ITSELF
FREE IN 1806,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
WHILE CUBA ONLY ACHIEVED
ITS INDEPENDENCE

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
20TH CENTURY, IN 1902.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENT
THERE WAS A LARGE

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
SLAVE POPULATION,
MUCH OF IT TO BE FOUND

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
IN CENTRAL
AMERICA AND BRAZIL.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
TO A LARGE EXTENT,
THESE REGIONAL ECONOMIES

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
WERE SUSTAINED
BY SLAVE LABOR.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
IN CUBA, THE PRESENCE
OF TOBACCO AND SUGAR

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
PLANTATIONS LED TO
THE DEVELOPMENT

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
OF A SOCIAL STRUCTURE
COMPOSED OF

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
RURAL REFINERIES
AND HACIENDAS.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
DUE IN LARGE MEASURE TO
THE TOTAL EXTERMINATION

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
OF THE INDIGENOUS
PEOPLES, SLAVES WERE

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
DEEMED NECESSARY TO
PERFORM MANUAL LABOR

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
IN GRUELING CONDITIONS.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
THE BRUTAL REALITY
OF THIS INSTITUTION

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
GENERATED
FIERCE CRITICISM

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
IN THE ABOLITIONIST
LITERATURE OF THE TIME.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
THE ABOLITIONIST MOVEMENT
BEGAN IN ENGLAND

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
TOWARDS THE END OF
THE 18TH CENTURY

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
AND WAS TAKEN UP BY
LATIN AMERICAN WRITERS

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE
POWER OF THE PEN

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
TO CREATE
SOCIAL CHANGE.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
THEIR MISSION WAS TO
AWAKEN PEOPLE TO THE

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
HORRORS OF SLAVERY AND
TO THE IRONY OF ITS

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
PERSISTENCE ON A CONTINENT
THAT WAS CALLING ITSELF

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
"INDEPENDENT".

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
WITH THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION
OF JUAN FRANCISCO MANZANO'S

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:08.000
"AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF A SLAVE",

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
THE NOVEL WAS FOREMOST
AMONG THE GENRES

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
THAT CARRIED THE
ABOLITIONIST BANNER.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
THE CUBAN AUTHOR,
GERTRUDIS GOMEZ DE

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
AVELLANEDA Y ARTEAGA,
ATTACKED THE INSTITUTION

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
OF SLAVERY, AND THE
INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
IN A NOVEL ENTITLED
"SAB", PUBLISHED IN 1841.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
ITS PROTAGONIST IS A CUBAN
SLAVE IN LOVE WITH A

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
WHITE WOMAN, WHO IN TURN
MARRIES A WHITE ENGLISHMAN.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
THE STORY IS OFTEN
COMPARED TO HARRIET

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
BEECHER STOWE'S SEMINAL
WORK, "UNCLE TOM'S CABIN",

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
AND THE CONTROVERSIAL
SUBJECT MATTER

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
LED TO THE BOOK'S
BEING BANNED IN CUBA.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
BUT ARGUABLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT ABOLITIONIST NOVEL

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
BOTH ARTISTICALLY AND
IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACT,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
WAS "CECILIA VALDES"
BY CIRILO VILLAVERDE.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
THE FIRST PART WAS
PUBLISHED IN HAVANA

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
IN 1839, BUT THE FINAL
VERSION DID NOT COME OUT

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
UNTIL OVER 40 YEARS
LATER, IN 1882.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
I REMEMBER WHEN MY MASTER
 SENT ME TO CONFESS

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
MY GUILT ONTO THE
 FEET OF A PRIEST.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
I ASKED GOD'S
 MINISTER

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
WHAT I COULD DO
 TO REACH VIRTUE.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
THE SLAVE VIRTUE, HE
 ANSWERED, IS TO OBEY AND

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
BE SILENT, SERVE WITH
 HUMILITY AND RESIGNATION

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
THEIR LEGITIMATE OWNERS,
 AND NEVER JUDGE THEM.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
THIS ANSWER WAS
 NOT ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
SO WHAT? I THOUGHT,
 CAN VIRTUE BE RELATIVE?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
IS VIRTUE NOT THE SAME
 FOR ALL HUMAN BEINGS?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
HAS THE GREAT BOSS FROM
 THIS BIG FAMILY MADE

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
DIFFERENT LAWS FOR THE
 ONES BORN WITH BLACK SKIN

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
THAN THOSE WITH
 WHITE SKIN?

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
DOES NOT EVERYBODY
 HAVE THE SAME NEEDS,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
PASSIONS AND DEFECTS?

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
WHY WOULD SOME HAVE
 THE RIGHT TO ENSLAVE

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
AND OTHERS THE
 OBLIGATION TO OBEY?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
CIRILO VILLAVERDE WAS
BORN IN CUBA IN 1812

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
IN A SUGAR REFINERY WHERE
HIS FATHER WAS A DOCTOR.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
DRAWING ON HIS CHILDHOOD
EXPERIENCES AND IMPRESSIONS

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
VILLAVERDE'S
NOVEL RECOUNTS IN

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
EXCRUCIATING DETAIL
THE BRUTAL LIFE

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
IN A REFINERY
CALLED "LA TINAJA".

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
VILLAVERDE CASTS HIS
EYE OVER A WIDE-RANGING

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
SOCIAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED
OF WHITE LANDOWNERS,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
FREED AND
MESTIZO SLAVES,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
DOOMED LOVERS AND
INCESTUOUS RELATIONSHIPS.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000
THE NOVEL ADROITLY
WEAVES TOGETHER ELEMENTS

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
FROM A VARIETY OF
LITERARY TRADITIONS -

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
FROM ROMANTICISM, REALISM,
THE NOVELS OF WALTER SCOTT,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
MELODRAMA, AND
NEWSPAPER SERIALS.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
FROM THIS PATCHWORK
VILLAVERDE CRAFTS A STORY

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
OF IMPOSSIBLE LOVE BETWEEN
A WHITE MAN AND A MESTIZO

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
WOMAN WHO, WITHOUT KNOWING
IT, ARE HALF-SIBLINGS.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
THE MECHANICS OF HIS PLOT
EXPOSE THE HYPOCRISY

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
OF THE CULTURE AND THE
OPPRESSIVE CRUELTY

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
DIRECTED TOWARDS SLAVES;

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
CRUELTY WHICH HE
HIMSELF WITNESSED.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
THE LITERATURE OF
ABOLITION DREW ITS

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
INSPIRATION IN PART FROM
THE FIRST-PERSON TESTIMONY

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
OF A CUBAN SLAVE NAMED
JUAN FRANCISCO MANZANO.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
THE GENESIS OF
HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY,

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
WRITTEN TOWARDS THE
END OF THE 1830'S,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
HIGHLIGHTS THE COMPLEX
SOCIAL DYNAMIC OF

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
SUBORDINATION AND DEPENDENCE
THAT MARKED THE TIMES.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
MANZANO WAS THE FREQUENT
GUEST OF DOMINGO DEL MONTE,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
A WEALTHY CUBAN
INTELLECTUAL FROM HAVANA,

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
AN ABOLITIONIST AND
SUGAR PLANTATION OWNER

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
WHO HIMSELF
OWNED MANY SLAVES.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
DEL MONTE COMMISSIONED
MANZANO'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
AND ENSURED THAT IT
ARRIVED IN THE HANDS OF

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
RICHARD MADDEN, A BRITISH
JUDGE ON THE MIXED COURT -

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
AN ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL
FOR THE SLAVE TRADE.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
MADDEN TRANSLATED
THE TEXT INTO ENGLISH,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
LIBERALLY REWRITING,
EDITING, AND CENSORING

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
ALONG THE WAY, AND
PRESENTED IT AT THE

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
1840 GENERAL ANTI-SLAVERY
CONVENTION IN LONDON.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
IN CUBA, THE MANUSCRIPT
CIRCULATED UNDERGROUND.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
THE SECOND PART WAS LOST
AND THE REST REMAINED

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
IN THE POSSESSION OF
DEL MONTE'S HEIRS.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
IT WAS ONLY PUBLISHED
IN ITS ORIGINAL

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:26.000
SPANISH VERSION
IN 1937.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
IT IS QUITE ADMIRABLE
 OF MY MASTER

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
THAT SHE CANNOT BE WITHOUT
 ME TEN DAYS IN A ROW.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
THUS, MY IMPRISONMENTS NEVER
 LAST MORE THAN 11 OR 12 DAYS.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
SHE'S ALWAYS PORTRAYED
 ME AS THE MEANEST ONE

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
EVER TO BE BORN IN MOLINO,
 WHERE SHE SAID I WAS A CREOLE.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
THIS WAS ANOTHER KIND OF
 MORTIFICATION I HAD.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:55.000
I LOVED HER DESPITE THE
 HARSHNESS OF HER TREATMENT.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
DESPITE ITS
CHECKERED HISTORY,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
THE "AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF
A SLAVE" REPRESENTS

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
A UNIQUE TESTIMONY TO
THE EXPLOITATION THAT

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
SUSTAINED THE COLONIAL
ECONOMY AND SOCIAL ORDER.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
AT THE SAME TIME,
IT HIGHLIGHTED

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
WHAT HAD TO BE
ENDURED IN ORDER TO

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
ACHIEVE FREEDOM
AND INDEPENDENCE.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
"A SLAVE", MANZANO
WROTE, "IS A DEAD SOUL".

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
THE PLANTATION ECONOMY
MANZANO DEPICTED

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
WAS AN ALL-ENCOMPASSING
SYSTEM OF CONTROL

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
THAT MARKED THE SLAVE'S
BODY AS AN OBJECT

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
TO BE EXPLOITED
FOR ECONOMIC GAIN.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
SLAVE OWNERS KEPT THEM
WORKING ALL THE TIME,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
NOT ONLY TO ENHANCE
PRODUCTIVITY

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
BUT TO PREVENT THEM
FROM HAVING FREE TIME

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
IN WHICH THEY COULD
CONTEMPLATE THEIR FATE.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
THIS MIND CONTROL
WAS SO IMPORTANT

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
TO MAINTAINING ORDER
THAT OVERSEERS OFTEN

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
FORCED THE SLAVES TO
SING WHILE THEY WORKED.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
SILENCE WAS DANGEROUS
BECAUSE IT LED,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
INEVITABLY, TO THINKING.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
MANZANO'S WRITINGS
ARE INTERESTING

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000
BECAUSE THEY BECOME
EVIDENCE, FIRSTLY,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
OF THE FICKLE WAY IN
WHICH THEY WERE TREATED.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
THE DIFFICULTIES, THE SENSE
OF BEING TOTALLY DEFENSELESS,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000
WITHOUT A POSSIBILITY,
HOWEVER MINIMAL,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
OF ASSUMING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ONE'S OWN DESTINY.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
MANZANO HAD
DIFFERENT MASTERS

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:48.000
WHO HAD ATTITUDES THAT WERE
OFTEN RADICALLY DIFFERENT.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
MANZANO LEARNED HOW
TO READ AND WRITE BY

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:01.000
LISTENING TO CLASSES GIVEN
TO HIS MASTER'S CHILDREN.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
MANZANO'S WORK HIGHLIGHTS
THE HORRIFIC CONSEQUENCES

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
OF THIS
ALL-CONSUMING POWER.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
IT DESCRIBES A
SOCIAL SYSTEM

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
OF ENFORCED
SILENCE, TERROR,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
THE SUPPRESSION OF
TRAUMATIC MEMORY,

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
AND ABJECT SURRENDER
OF BASIC HUMAN DIGNITY.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
AND YET THE SPIRIT
SOMEHOW ENDURES.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT
IN THE LOWER DEPTHS OF

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
CUBAN SOCIETY, MANZANO
WROTE WHAT AMOUNTED TO

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
A LITERARY WRIT
OF HABEUS CORPUS.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
USING STUBS OF
LEFT-OVER PENCILS

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
AND SCRIBBLING ON
ODD BITS OF PAPER,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
HE TRANSFORMED HIMSELF
FROM SLAVE TO SCRIBE.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
THOUGH LIVING IN A WORLD
OF CHAOS AND SERVITUDE,

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
MONZANO WAS ABLE TO
CRAFT A SINGULAR TEXT,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
A PORTRAIT
OF A SOCIETY,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
AND A TESTAMENT TO THE
POWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL WILL.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE
OF THE 19TH CENTURY

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
IS A STUDY IN
DYNAMIC TENSION;

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
THE TUG-OF-WAR BETWEEN
MOTHER COUNTRY AND COLONY,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
BETWEEN DEPENDENCE
AND INDEPENDENCE,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
BETWEEN EUROPEAN AND
INDIGENOUS CULTURES.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
THESE ARE THE CONFLICTS
THAT FUEL THE WRITERS

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
OF THIS PERIOD.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
THEIR MISSION, AS THEY
SAW IT, WAS TO DEFINE

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
A CULTURE BOTH IN
TERMS OF ITS ORIGINS

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
AND OF THE
HERE AND NOW.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
IN THE STRUGGLES
FOR INDEPENDENCE

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
THAT DOMINATE
THIS PERIOD,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
NOVELISTS, ESSAYISTS,
POETS, AND OTHER AUTHORS

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
FROM ACROSS THE CONTINENT
TOOK UP THE ENORMOUS TASK

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
OF CONCEIVING
A NEW IDENTITY

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
- ONE THAT WOULD RETRIEVE
WHAT WAS RESCUABLE

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
FROM THE COLONIAL PAST.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
THEY STRUGGLED WITH A
PRIMEVAL NOTION OF AMERICA

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
AS A KIND OF UTOPIA, AN
IDEA INHERITED FROM THE

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
CONQUISTADORS AND
INTERPRETED VARIOUSLY

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
AS POLITICAL, SOCIAL, OR
EVEN BIBLICAL IN NATURE.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
TO FIND ANSWERS TO THE
QUESTIONS PUT BEFORE THEM,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
WRITERS OF THIS
PERIOD JOURNEYED TO

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
THE SPIRITUAL CORE
OF LATIN AMERICA.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
WRITING WAS THEIR COMPASS
IN THIS EXPEDITION -

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
THE ESSAYS, POEMS,
NOVELS, AND SHORT STORIES

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
THAT LED THE WAY TO A
NEW POLITICAL REALITY.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
THE WORK OF THE PEN AND
THE WORK OF THE SWORD

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
WERE UNITED IN
EACH INDIVIDUAL.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
AS A RESULT, THE SEMINAL
WRITERS OF THE FIRST HALF

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
OF THE 19TH CENTURY
ACTED WITH THE ABSOLUTE

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
CONVICTION THAT THEY WERE
LAYING OUT THE BASIS

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
OF A NEW LATIN AMERICAN
CULTURAL IDENTITY.
