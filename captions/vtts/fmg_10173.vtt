00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
IF YOU GET ON THE ELEVATOR

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
AND YOU SAY,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.000

EVERYBODY KNOW, OH, SOMEBODY

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.000

YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Reporter: THE NEXT THING

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.000
YOU LEARN HERE IS THAT THERE ARE

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
ABOUT SEVEN MAJOR GANGS

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
OPERATING INSIDE WESTERN YOUTH.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
THERE ARE COMPLICATED

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
HIERARCHIES WITH SECRET

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
LANGUAGES, HAND SIGNALS.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
THROW DOWN YOUR HAND, IT MEANS

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
DISRESPECT TO YOUR ENEMY.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
THE SIGNAL OF HIS GANG --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
THIS IS WHAT I REPRESENT.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.000
THIS IS WHAT I BANG FOR.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
SIX POINT STAR.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
THIS IS MY LIFE.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Reporter: GANG MEMBERS LOOK

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
OUT FOR EACH OTHER, LIKE FAMILY,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
BUT TO JOIN, YOU MAY HAVE

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
TO FIGHT, STEAL OR SELL DRUGS.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DECIDE TO

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
TURN TO OFFICERS FOR PROTECTION?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
THERE'S A SAYING, SNITCHES GET

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I HAVE LIKE ENEMIES OUT THERE

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Reporter: CONSIDER THE SOURCE

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
BUT SEVERAL PRISONERS DID TELL

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
VIOLENT AS THE INMATES.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
WHILE YOU'RE IN HANDCUFFS,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
THEY BEAT YOU DOWN LIKE YOU

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000

HOLLERING AND SCREAMING.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.000
REALIZE.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
THEY COME HERE 15 YEARS OLD.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
THEY THINK THIS IS LIKE TRAINING

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.000
SCHOOL.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
THIS AIN'T TRAINING SCHOOL.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
THIS IS PRISON.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
YOU CAN'T COME THROUGH -- CAN'T

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.000
GO THROUGH THIS WITHOUT

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
NO SCARS.

EITHER PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
VIOLENT KIDS?

THE ROUTINE BEGINS,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
SHUFFLED FROM ONE PART

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000

THEY'LL WAIT TILL LIKE

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000

MOST IMPORTANT POSSESSION

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
AN INMATE HAS.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
IT'S HIS CANTEEN CARD.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
IT WORKS LIKE A CREDIT CARD.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
EACH ONE WORTH $40 A WEEK.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
COME ON.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
GIVE ME YOUR CARD.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
THE WEAK GET STRONG-ARMED

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
SNEAKERS, SNACKS OR EXTRA FOOD.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
HE GONNA GIVE YOU SOMETHING

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000

YOU KNOW IT, BABY.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IT WOULD BE LIKE, "YO, BUY ME

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
THIS OR THAT.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
YOU GOT ENOUGH TO BUY ME THIS."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
THEN IF YOU SAY THAT

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
YOU CAN'T DO IT OR

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THEY'LL SAY, "WELL, YOU WAIT.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I'M GONNA YOKE YOU UP."

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
YOKE IS CHOKE YOU TO DEATH.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
GRAB HIM BY THE THROAT.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
CHOKE HIM.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BREATHE

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
SOONER OR LATER OR THEY'RE GONNA

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
THROUGH THE CANTEEN LINE ALL

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
RIGHT, AS WE SAID BEFORE,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.000
THERE'S THE ELEVATOR.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
AS SOON AS THE ELEVATOR DOOR

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
CLOSE, THEY WILL HIT YOU.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
AND ALL OF THEM START BEATING.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Reporter: ON OWEN FRANCIS'

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
SECOND DAY IN PRISON, HE'S

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ALREADY BEEN GIVEN A WARNING.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
TODAY I GOT ON THE ELEVATOR.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
THERE WAS LIKE SIX DUDES UP

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
THERE.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
AND THEY STARTED FOOLING AROUND

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
WITH THE CAMERA.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
EVERYBODY SAYS IF THEY COVER UP

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
THE CAMERA, THEY'RE FIXING

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
TO JUMP YOU.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
SO I GOT SCARED WHEN

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.000
THEY STARTED MESSING

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
WITH THE CAMERA.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Reporter: IT WAS JUST A TEST

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
TO SEE HOW HE'D REACT,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
BUT THE EXPERIENCE HAS HIM

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
SHAKEN.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
AND REMEMBER MIKE LEGGETT, WHO

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
TALKED SO TOUGH ABOUT BEATING UP

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
NEW JACKS?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
BY THE SECOND DAY, HE SEEMED

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
SCARED TOO.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I'M NERVOUS.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Reporter: AND FULL OF REMORSE

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
FOR HIS CRIME.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
HE TOLD US HE WAS GOING TO TRY

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
TO AVOID SEEKING THE PROTECTION

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
OF A GANG.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
IT'S A DECISION EVERY NEW JACK

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
WILL HAVE TO MAKE, WHETHER

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
HE CAN TOUGH IT OUT ON HIS OWN

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
OR HAS TO SEEK PROTECTION.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
THEY TAKE YOUR CLOTHES?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
YOU'RE IN PRISON, MAN.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Reporter: AND COLOR MATTERS.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
THE OFFICERS CAME

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
INTO MY CELL AND TOLD ME THAT

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I SHOULD JUST KEEP TO MYSELF

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T LIKE

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
BLOND-HEADED, BLUE-EYED BOYS,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
AND THEY USUALLY JUST JUMP

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
ON YOU.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
THEY GET SEXUAL MANNERS.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
LIKE WE'RE GONNA GET YOU.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
WE'RE GONNA RAPE YOU.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
WE'RE GONNA SCREW YOU.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
A WHITE BOY GOT IT TOUGH

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
IN PRISON.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THEY GOT IT TOUGH.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
YOU CAN CALL THAT RACISM

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
OR WHATEVER YOU WANT.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
BUT YOU KNOW BLACKS RUN THIS

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000

BLACK.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
BUT BLACK OR WHITE, ANYONE CAN

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
BE A TARGET.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I GOT JUMPED.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
IT WAS ME AGAINST EVERYBODY

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.000

THEY TRY TO GET IN

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
ABOUT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
SO THEY BUY HIM STUFF

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.000

KITCHEN WORKERS PLAY FAVORITES

HIS PROTECTOR SOME OF THAT.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
ONE OFFICER TURNS A BLIND EYE

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
WHILE AN INMATE HANDS SOMETHING

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
A PIZZA DELIVERY MAN

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
UNCONSCIOUS.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
I FEEL LIKE IT WAS A REAL

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
DUMB MISTAKE.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.000

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
WAS IT CRUEL?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
CRUEL BECAUSE I DONE SEEN PEOPLE

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
ANY KID WHO STARTS TO FEEL

HE'D BEEN CONVICTED OF RAPE AND

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
LONGED FOR THE SIMPLE JOY OF

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000

YOUNG MEN WE WATCHED ARRIVE AT

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
THE WESTERN YOUTH INSTITUTION.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
WE DECIDED TO CHECK BACK IN

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AFTER TWO MONTHS TO SEE WHAT HAD

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
HAPPENED TO THEM.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
REMEMBER MIKE LEGGETT, THE KID

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
WHO FIRST TALKED TOUGH BUT THEN

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
SEEMED NERVOUS?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
TWO MONTHS LATER HE WAS STILL

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
TRYING TO GO IT ALONE WITHOUT

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:49.000
PROTECTION.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
IT WASN'T EASY.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
EIGHT GANG MEMBERS ATTACKED HIM

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
IN THE YARD.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.000
THEN TWO OF THEM GRAB MY LEGS

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
AND DROPPED ME ON THE GROUND,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
STARTED KICKING ME.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
THEN SOME OTHER BOYS COME

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
AND JUMP IN.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Reporter: JAMES YOUNG HAD

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
A DIFFERENT KIND OF RUN-IN,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
WITH A C.O.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
AND HAD HIS EYES OPEN WHEN HE

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
WAS SENT TO SEGREGATION.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
HE SAID THE OFFICERS UP THERE

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
USE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE INMATES

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
AS WEAPONS TO GET BACK AT OTHER

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
PRISONERS, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
SUPPOSED TO BE ISOLATED IN

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
SEPARATE CELLS.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
IF YOU PISS

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
A C.O. OFF, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
MYSTERIOUSLY, SOMEBODY GETS OUT

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
OF A ROOM, BUT MYSTERIOUSLY,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
YOUR DOOR POPS AND SO DOES

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
OVER HIS SHOULDER NOW.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000

TO TRY AND CUT ME, WHO'S GOING

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
TO HIT ME OR WHAT.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Reporter: AND REMEMBER

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
THE GAY INMATE MARK HALL,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
OR TASHA?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
HE TOLD US PRISON LIFE WASN'T SO

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
TOUGH.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
BUT ANOTHER INMATE SAID THE

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
TRUTH ABOUT TASHA IS HE WAS USED

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
BY A PROSTITUTE BY OTHERS WHO

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
TOOK A CUT OF THE PAY.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
YOU WOULD SEE HIM GETTING IN

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
THE SHOWER WITH OTHER GUYS.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Reporter: WE CALLED TASHA TO

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
ASK ABOUT THIS.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
HE TOLD US HE DID DO TRICKS, $30

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
EACH TIME, BUT SAID HE KEPT THE

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
MONEY FOR HIMSELF.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
AND WHAT ABOUT OWEN FRANCIS, WHO

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
CRIED ABOUT HIS MOTHER'S ILLNESS

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
WHO HAD BEEN THREATENED

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
ON THE ELEVATOR?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
HE SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
BUT HE SEEMED WITHDRAWN.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I LEARNED THINGS HERE I AIN'T

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000

BEEN TAUNTED WITH THREATS OF

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
RAPE AND INJURY, BUT HE REFUSED

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
PROTECTION, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
OFFERED.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
ONLY PERSON THAT TAKES CARE

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
OF ME IS GOD.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
SURVIVE, KNOWING SOME OF THEIR

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
NEW JACK JAMES YOUNG SAID THEY

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
HE TOLD US THERE WAS A BOY HE

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
AFTER TWO MONTHS, A BOY BEING

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000

I SAID I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
NO, THERE AIN'T NOTHING GOING

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.000

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
IF HE DID TELL A C.O., THEN

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.000
THEY'D BEAT THE HELL OUT OF HIM

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000

WHAT HE WANTED OTHERS TO KNOW --

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO BE.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
BY THE WAY, ONCE THESE KIDS

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
REACH 18, THEY'LL BE TRANSFERRED

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
