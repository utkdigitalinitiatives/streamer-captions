00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.400


2
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.600
I learn in this letterthat Don Peter of Arragon

3
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.470
comes thisnight to Messina.

4
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.730
He is very near by this:

5
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.400
he was not three leaguesoff when I left him.

6
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.430
How many gentlemen haveyou lost in this action?

7
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.700
But few of anysort, and none of name.

8
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.970
A victory is twice itselfwhen the achiever

9
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.470
brings home full numbers.

10
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670
I find here that Don Peterhath bestowed much honour

11
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.100
on a youngFlorentine called Claudio.

12
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.000
Much deserved on his part

13
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.030
and equally rememberedby Don Pedro:

14
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.470
he hath borne himself beyondthe promise of his age,

15
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.630
doing, in the figure of a lamb,

16
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.170
the feats of a lion:

17
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.270
I pray you,

18
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.230
is Signior Mountanto returnedfrom the wars or no?

19
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.370
I know none of that name, lady:

20
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.070
there was none such inthe army of any sort.

21
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.500
What is he that youask for, niece?

22
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.670
My cousin meansSignior Benedick of Padua.

23
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.830
O, he's returned; and aspleasant as ever he was.

24
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.930
I pray you, how many hath hekilled and eaten in these wars?

25
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.470
But how manyhath he killed?

26
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.430
for indeed I promised toeat all of his killing.

27
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300
Faith, niece, you taxSignior Benedick too much;

28
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
but he'll bemeet with you,

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.330
I doubt it not.

30
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.670
He hath done good service,lady, in these wars.

31
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.900
You had musty victual, andhe hath holp to eat it:

32
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.530
he is a very valianttrencherman;

33
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.570
he hath anexcellent stomach.

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.770
And a goodsoldier too, lady.

35
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.830
And a good soldier to a lady:but what is he to a lord?

36
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.900
A lord to a lord,a man to a man;

37
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.970
stuffed with allhonourable virtues.

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.900
It is so, indeed; he is noless than a stuffed man:

39
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.370
but for thestuffing,

40
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.530
-well, we are all mortal.

41
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.470
You must not, sir,mistake my niece.

42
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.130
There is a kind ofmerry war betwixt

43
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.530
Signior Benedick and her:

44
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.200
they never meet but there's askirmish of wit between them.

45
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.570
Alas! he gets nothing by that.

46
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.800
In our last conflict four of hisfive wits went halting off,

47
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.000
and now is the wholeman governed with one:

48
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.530
so that if he have wit enoughto keep himself warm,

49
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.530
let him bear itfor a difference

50
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.930
between himselfand his horse;

51
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.430
for it is all thewealth that he hath left,

52
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.630
to be known areasonable creature.

53
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.130
Who is his companion now?

54
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.030
He hath every montha new sworn brother.

55
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.000
Is't possible?

56
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.570
Very easily possible:

57
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.230
he wears his faith but asthe fashion of his hat;

58
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.630
it ever changes withthe next block.

59
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.170
I see, lady, the gentlemanis not in your books.

60
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.500
No; an he were, Iwould burn my study.

61
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.700
But, I pray you,who is his companion?

62
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.930
Is there no youngsquarer now

63
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.630
that will make a voyagewith him to the devil?

64
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.470
He is most in the company ofthe right noble Claudio.

65
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.030
O Lord, he will hang uponhim like a disease:

66
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.230
he is sooner caughtthan the pestilence,

67
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.030
and the takerruns presently mad.

68
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.770
God help thenoble Claudio!

69
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.900
if he havecaught the Benedick,

70
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.300
it will cost him a thousandpound ere a' be cured.

71
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.370
I will hold friendswith you, lady.

72
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.000
Do, good friend.

73
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.270
You will neverrun mad, niece.

74
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.330
No, not till ahot January.

75
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.000
Don Pedro is approached.

76
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.770
(â™ªmusic)

77
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.630
Good Signior Leonato, you arecome to meet your trouble:

78
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.000
the fashion of the worldis to avoid cost,

79
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.500
and you encounter it.

80
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.670
Never came trouble to my housein the likeness of your grace:

81
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.600
for trouble being gone,comfort should remain;

82
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.870
but when you depart from me,

83
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.200
sorrow abides andhappiness takes his leave.

84
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.100
You embrace yourcharge too willingly.

85
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.470
I think this isyour daughter.

86
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.200
Her mother hathmany times told me so.

87
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.470
Were you in doubt,sir, that you asked her?

88
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.700
Signior Benedick, no;for then were you a child.

89
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.800
You have it full, Benedick:

90
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.070
Truly, the ladyfathers herself.

91
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.730
Be happy, lady; for you arelike an honourable father.

92
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.830
If SigniorLeonato be her father,

93
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.600
she would not have his head onher shoulders for all Messina,

94
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.400
as like him as she is.

95
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.030
I wonder that youwill still be talking,

96
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.500
Signior Benedick:nobody marks you.

97
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.800
What, my dearLady Disdain!

98
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.730
are you yet living?

99
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.330
Is it possibledisdain should die

100
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
while she hath such meet food tofeed it as Signior Benedick?

101
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.230
Courtesy itself mustconvert to disdain,

102
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.530
if you come inher presence.

103
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.500
Then iscourtesy a turncoat.

104
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.070
But it is certain I amloved of all ladies,

105
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.500
only you excepted:

106
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.130
and I would I couldfind in my heart

107
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.270
that I had not a hard heart;for, truly, I love none.

108
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.200
A dear happiness to women:they would else have been

109
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.130
troubled with apernicious suitor.

110
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.700
I thank God andmy cold blood,

111
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.630
I am of your humour for that:

112
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.630
I had rather hear mydog bark at a crow

113
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600
than a man swearhe loves me.

114
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.570
God keep your ladyshipstill in that mind!

115
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.730
so some gentleman orother shall 'scape

116
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.400
a predestinate scratched face.

117
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
Scratching couldnot make it worse,

118
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.670
an 'twere such aface as yours were.

119
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.330
Well, you are arare parrot-teacher.

120
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.270
A bird of my tongue is betterthan a beast of yours.

121
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.130
I would my horse hadthe speed of your tongue,

122
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.030
and so good a continuer.

123
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.900
But keep yourway, i' God's name;

124
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.200
I have done.

125
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.000
You always end with a jade'strick: I know you of old.

126
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.200
That is the sumof all, Leonato.

127
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.100
Signior Claudio andSignior Benedick,

128
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300
my dear friend Leonatohath invited you all.

129
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.670
I tell him we shall stayhere at the least a month;

130
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.000
and he heartily prays someoccasion may detain us longer.

131
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.800
I dare swear heis no hypocrite,

132
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.270
but prays from his heart.

133
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.970
If you swear, my lord,you shall not be forsworn.

134
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.570
Let me bid youwelcome, my lord:

135
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.830
being reconciled to theprince your brother,

136
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.700
I owe you all duty.

137
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.200
I thank you: I amnot of many words,

138
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.600
but I thank you.

139
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.230
Please it yourgrace lead on?

140
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.600
Your hand, Leonato;we will go together.

141
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.100
Benedick, didst thou note thedaughter of Signior Leonato?

142
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.300
I noted her not;but I looked on her.

143
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.270
Is she not amodest young lady?

144
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.270
Do you question me, asan honest man should do,

145
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.500
for my simpletrue judgment;

146
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.370
or would you have mespeak after my custom,

147
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.230
as being a professedtyrant to their sex?

148
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.670
No; I pray theespeak in sober judgment.

149
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.700
Why, i' faith, methinks she'stoo low for a high praise,

150
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.300
too brown for a fair praise andtoo little for a great praise:

151
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.970
only this commendationI can afford her,

152
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.530
that were she otherthan she is,

153
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.030
she were unhandsome; and beingno other but as she is,

154
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.630
I do not like her.

155
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.700
Thou thinkest I am in sport:

156
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.230
I pray thee tell me trulyhow thou likest her.

157
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.670
Would you buy her, thatyou inquire after her?

158
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.030
Can the worldbuy such a jewel?

159
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.200
In mine eye she isthe sweetest lady

160
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.400
that ever I looked on.

161
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.700
I can see yet without spectaclesand I see no such matter:

162
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.930
there's her cousin,

163
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.830
an she were notpossessed with a fury,

164
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.430
exceeds her as much inbeauty as the first of May

165
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.070
doth the last of December.

166
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.470
But I hope you have no intentto turn husband, have you?

167
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.470
I would scarcetrust myself,

168
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.500
though I hadsworn the contrary,

169
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.900
if Hero would be my wife.

170
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.130
Is't come to this?

171
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.500
In faith, hath notthe world one man

172
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.930
but he will wear hiscap with suspicion?

173
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.170
Shall I never see a bachelorof three-score again?

174
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.200
Go to, i' faith;

175
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.970
an thou wilt needs thrustthy neck into a yoke,

176
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.800
wear the print of itand sigh away Sundays.

177
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.700
Look Don Pedro isreturned to seek you.

178
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.270
What secret hathheld you here,

179
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.770
that you followednot to Leonato's?

180
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.600
I would your grace wouldconstrain me to tell.

181
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.700
I charge thee onthy allegiance.

182
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.300
You hear, Count Claudio: Ican be secret as a dumb man;

183
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.500
I would have you think so;

184
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.730
but, on my allegiance,

185
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.470
mark you, on my allegiance.

186
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.870
He is in love.

187
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.700
With who?

188
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.770
now that isyour grace's part.

189
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.800
Mark how shorthis answer is;

190
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.570
-With Hero,Leonato's short daughter.

191
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.230
If this were so,so were it uttered.

192
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.970
Like the old tale, mylord: 'it is not so,

193
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.370
nor 'twas notso, but, indeed,

194
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.100
God forbid it should be so.'

195
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.430
If my passion changenot shortly,

196
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.270
God forbid it shouldbe otherwise.

197
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.730
Amen, if you love her; for thelady is very well worthy.

198
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.370
You speak this tofetch me in, my lord.

199
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.200
By my troth, Ispeak my thought.

200
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.670
And, in faith, mylord, I spoke mine.

201
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.200
And, by my twofaiths and troths,

202
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.530
my lord, I spoke mine.

203
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.370
That I love her, I feel.

204
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.570
That she isworthy, I know.

205
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.070
That I neither feel howshe should be loved

206
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.200
nor know how sheshould be worthy,

207
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.170
is the opinion that firecannot melt out of me:

208
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.900
I will die in it at the stake.

209
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.670
Thou wast ever anobstinate heretic

210
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.270
in the despite of beauty.

211
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.570
And never couldmaintain his part

212
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.170
but in the force of his will.

213
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.830
That a womanconceived me, I thank her;

214
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.130
that she brought me up,

215
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.230
I likewise give hermost humble thanks:

216
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.330
but all women shall pardon me.

217
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.500
Because I will not do themthe wrong to mistrust any,

218
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.330
I will do myself theright to trust none;

219
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.130
and the fine is, for thewhich I may go the finer,

220
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.430
I will live a bachelor.

221
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.700
I shall seethee, ere I die,

222
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.230
look pale with love.

223
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.630
With anger, withsickness, or with hunger,

224
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.300
my lord, not with love:

225
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.000
prove that ever I losemore blood with love

226
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.030
than I will get againwith drinking,

227
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.400
pick out mine eyes witha ballad-maker's pen

228
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.130
and hang me up at thedoor of a brothel-house

229
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.370
for the signof blind Cupid.

230
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.600
Well, if ever thou dostfall from this faith,

231
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.570
thou wilt prove anotable argument.

232
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.830
If I do, hang me in a bottlelike a cat and shoot at me;

233
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.800
and he that hits me, let himbe clapped on the shoulder,

234
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800
and called Adam.

235
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.030
Well, as time shall try:

236
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.530
'In time the savage bulldoth bear the yoke.'

237
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.430
The savage bull may;

238
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.670
but if ever thesensible Benedick bear it,

239
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.470
pluck off the bull's hornsand set them in my forehead:

240
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.000
and let me be vilely painted,

241
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and in such greatletters as they write

242
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.530
'Here is good horse to hire,'let them signify under my sign

243
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.730
'Here you may see Benedickthe married man.'

244
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.670
Well, youtemporize with the hours.

245
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.230
In the meantime,good Signior Benedick,

246
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.800
repair to Leonato's: commendme to him and tell him

247
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.030
I will not fail him at supper;

248
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.530
for indeed he hathmade great preparation.

249
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.900
I have almost matter enoughin me for such an embassage;

250
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.570
and so I commit you--

251
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.600
To the tuition of God: Frommy house, if I had it,

252
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.170
- The sixth of July: Yourloving friend, Benedick.

253
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.870
Mock not, mock not.

254
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.030
ere you flout oldends any further,

255
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.930
examine your conscience:and so I leave you.

256
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.130
My liege, your highnessnow may do me good.

257
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.670
My love is thine toteach: teach it but how,

258
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.170
And thou shalt see howapt it is to learn

259
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.830
Any hard lesson thatmay do thee good.

260
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:28.500
Hath Leonatoany son, my lord?

261
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.500
No child but Hero;she's his only heir.

262
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.570
Dost thouaffect her, Claudio?

263
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.900
O, my lord, When you wentonward on this ended action,

264
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.330
I look'd upon her witha soldier's eye,

265
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.630
That liked, but had arougher task in hand

266
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.070
Than to drive likingto the name of love:

267
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.570
But now I am return'dand that war-thoughts

268
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.870
Have left their placesvacant, in their rooms

269
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.430
Come thronging softand delicate desires,

270
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.530
All prompting me howfair young Hero is,

271
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.500
Saying, I liked herere I went to wars.

272
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.570
Thou wilt be likea lover presently

273
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.130
And tire the hearerwith a book of words.

274
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.370
If thou dost love fairHero, cherish it,

275
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.770
And I will break with herand with her father,

276
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.300
And thou shalt have her.

277
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.530
Was't not to this end

278
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.300
That thou began'st totwist so fine a story?

279
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.670
How sweetly you dominister to love,

280
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.830
That know love'sgrief by his complexion!

281
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.570
But lest my likingmight too sudden seem,

282
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.500
I would have salved itwith a longer treatise.

283
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.070
What need the bridge muchbroader than the flood?

284
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.100
The fairest grantis the necessity.

285
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.570
Look, what will serve is fit:

286
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.170
'tis once, thou lovest, And Iwill fit thee with the remedy.

287
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.300
I know we shall haverevelling to-night:

288
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.300
I will assume thy partin some disguise

289
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.170
And tell fair HeroI am Claudio,

290
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.930
And in her bosom I'llunclasp my heart

291
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.930
And take her hearingprisoner with the force

292
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.570
And strong encounterof my amorous tale:

293
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.430
Then after to herfather will I break;

294
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:12.430
And the conclusionis, she shall be thine.

295
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.130
In practise let usput it presently.

296
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.970
How now, brother!

297
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.970
Where is mycousin?

298
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.330
hath heprovided this music?

299
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.100
He is very busy about it.

300
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.730
But, brother, I cantell you strange news

301
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.700
that you yet dreamt not of.

302
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.870
Are they good?

303
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.370
As the event stamps them:but they have a good cover;

304
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.470
they show well outward.

305
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.670
The prince andCount Claudio,

306
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.430
walking in a thick-pleachedalley in mine orchard,

307
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.230
were thus much overheardby a man of mine:

308
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.700
the prince discoveredto Claudio

309
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.530
that he loved myniece your daughter

310
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.270
and meant to acknowledgeit this night in a dance:

311
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.370
and if he found her accordant,

312
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.230
he meant to take thepresent time by the top

313
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.170
and instantly breakwith you of it.

314
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.770
Hath the fellow anywit that told you this?

315
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.070
A good sharp fellow:I will send for him;

316
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.270
and question him yourself.

317
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.900
No, no; we will hold it as adream till it appear itself:

318
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.000
but I will acquaintmy daughter withal,

319
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.330
that she may be the betterprepared for an answer,

320
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.600
if peradventure this be true.

321
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.770
Go you and tell her of it.

322
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.670
Cousins, you knowwhat you have to do.

323
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.600
O, I cry youmercy, friend;

324
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.330
go you with me, and Iwill use your skill.

325
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.400
Good cousin, have acare this busy time.

326
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.500
What thegood-year, my lord!

327
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.900
why are you thusout of measure sad?

328
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.830
There is no measure inthe occasion that breeds;

329
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.830
therefore thesadness is without limit.

330
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.100
You should hear reason.

331
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.000
And when I have heard it,what blessing brings it?

332
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.670
If not a present remedy, atleast a patient sufferance.

333
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.770
I wonder that thou, being,as thou sayest thou art,

334
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.500
born under Saturn, goest about

335
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.400
to apply a moral medicineto a mortifying mischief.

336
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.170
I cannot hide what I am: Imust be sad when I have cause

337
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.930
and smile at no man's jests,

338
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.530
eat when I have stomach andwait for no man's leisure,

339
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.870
sleep when I am drowsy andtend on no man's business,

340
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.230
laugh when I am merry andclaw no man in his humour.

341
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.200
Yea, but you must not makethe full show of this

342
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.630
till you may do itwithout controlment.

343
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.270
You have of late stoodout against your brother,

344
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.400
and he hath ta'en younewly into his grace;

345
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.730
where it is impossible youshould take true root

346
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.530
but by the fair weatherthat you make yourself:

347
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:53.330
it is needful that you frame theseason for your own harvest.

348
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.700
I had rather be a canker in ahedge than a rose in his grace,

349
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.070
and it better fits my bloodto be disdained of all

350
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.070
than to fashion a carriageto rob love from any:

351
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.930
in this, though I cannot be saidto be a flattering honest man,

352
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.230
it must not be denied but Iam a plain-dealing villain.

353
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:18.230
I am trusted with a muzzle andenfranchised with a clog;

354
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.070
therefore I have decreednot to sing in my cage.

355
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.830
If I had mymouth, I would bite;

356
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:32.730
if I had my liberty, Iwould do my liking:

357
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.700
in the meantime let me be thatI am and seek not to alter me.

358
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.600
Can you make no useof your discontent?

359
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.830
I make all use ofit, for I use it only.

360
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.500
Who comes here?

361
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.270
What news, Borachio?

362
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.830
I came yonder froma great supper:

363
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.200
the prince your brother isroyally entertained by Leonato:

364
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.230
and I can give you intelligenceof an intended marriage.

365
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.930
Will it serve for any modelto build mischief on?

366
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.030
What is he for a fool

367
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.430
that betroths himselfto unquietness?

368
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.230
Marry, it is yourbrother's right hand.

369
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.830
Who?

370
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.500
the mostexquisite Claudio?

371
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.330
Even he.

372
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.230
A proper squire!

373
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.200
And who, and who?

374
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.430
which way looks he?

375
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.700
Marry, on Hero, the daughterand heir of Leonato.

376
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.530
A very forwardMarch-chick!

377
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.670
How came you to this?

378
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.600
Being entertainedfor a perfumer,

379
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.730
as I wassmoking a musty room,

380
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.230
comes me theprince and Claudio,

381
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.930
hand in hand in sad conference:

382
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.070
I whipt me behind the arras;and there heard it agreed upon

383
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.930
that the prince shouldwoo Hero for himself,

384
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:54.300
and having obtained her,give her to Count Claudio.

385
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.930
Come, come, let us thither:

386
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.300
this may prove foodto my displeasure.

387
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.100
That young start-up hath allthe glory of my overthrow:

388
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.270
if I can cross him any way,

389
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.700
I bless myself every way.

390
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.400
You are both sure,and will assist me?

391
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.500
To the death, my lord.

392
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.630
Let us to the great supper:

393
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.870
their cheer is the greaterthat I am subdued.

394
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.500
Would the cookwere of my mind!

395
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.570
Shall we go provewhat's to be done?

396
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:33.530
We'll wait uponyour lordship.

397
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.530
