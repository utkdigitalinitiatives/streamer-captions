00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430


2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.430
I prithee, pretty youth

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.730
let me be better acquainted withthee.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.930
They say you are a melancholyfellow.

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.200
I am so.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.570
I do love it better thanlaughing.

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.870
Those that are in extremity ofeither are abominable fellows

8
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.770
and betray themselves to everymodern censure

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.030
worse than drunkards.

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.170
Why, 'tis good to be sad and saynothing.

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.230
Why then, 'tis good to be apost.

12
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.300
I have neither the scholar'smelancholy,

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.400
which is emulation;

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.400
nor the musician's, which isfantastical;

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
nor the courtier's, which isproud;

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.370
nor the soldier's, which isambitious;

17
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.300
nor the lawyer's, which ispolitic;

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.670
nor the lady's, which is nice;

19
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.470
nor the lover's, which is allthese;

20
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.130
but it is a melancholy of mineown,

21
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.070
compounded of many simples,

22
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.270
extracted from many objects,

23
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.500
and, indeed, the sundrycontemplation of my travels,

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.570
in which my often rumination

25
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.330
wraps me in a most humoroussadness.

26
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.430
A traveller.

27
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.300
By my faith, you have greatreason to be sad.

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.500
I fear you have sold your ownlands

29
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.930
to see other men's.

30
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.070
Then, to have seen much and tohave nothing,

31
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.530
is to have rich eyes and poorhands.

32
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.000
Yes, I have gained myexperience.

33
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.200
And your experience makes yousad.

34
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.570
I'd rather have a fool to makeme merry

35
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.730
than experience to make me sad--

36
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.600
and to travel for it too--

37
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.630
Good day and happiness, dearRosalind.

38
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.130
Nay, then, God by you, and youtalk in blank verse.

39
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.730
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller.

40
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.770
Look you, lisp and wear strangesuits,

41
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.900
disable all the benefits of yourown country,

42
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.500
be out of love with yournativity,

43
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.930
and almost chide God for makingyou

44
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.370
that countenance you are,

45
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.770
or I will scarce think you haveswam in a gondola.

46
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.730
How now, Orlando.

47
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.500
Where have you been all thiswhile?

48
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.970
You, a lover,

49
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.700
and you serve me such anothertrick,

50
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.000
never come in my sight more.

51
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.200
My fair Rosalind,

52
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.370
I come within an hour of mypromise.

53
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.170
Break an hour's promise in love?

54
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.070
He that will divide a minuteinto a thousand parts

55
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.300
and break but a part

56
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.170
of the thousandth part of aminute in the affairs of love,

57
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.400
it may be said of him

58
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.800
that Cupid hath clapped him o'erthe shoulder,

59
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.670
but I'll warrant himheart-whole.

60
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.770
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

61
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.330
Nay, and you be so tardy,

62
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.270
come no more in my sight.

63
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.030
I had as lief be wooed of asnail.

64
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.270
Of a snail?

65
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.500
Ay, of a snail,

66
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.830
for though he comes slowly,

67
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.500
he carries his house on hishead--

68
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900
a better jointure, I think,

69
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.830
than you make a woman.

70
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.070
Besides, he carries his destinywith him.

71
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.330
What's that?

72
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.870
Why, horns, which such as you

73
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.530
are fain to be beholding to yourwives for.

74
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.070
Virtue is no horn maker,

75
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.470
and my Rosalind is virtuous.

76
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.200
And I am your Rosalind.

77
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.400
It pleases him to call you so.

78
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.770
He hath a Rosalind of a betterleer than you.

79
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.300
Come, woo me, woo me,

80
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.770
for now I am in a holiday humorand like enough to consent.

81
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.830
What would you say to me now,

82
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.430
an I were your very, veryRosalind?

83
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.300
I would kiss before I spoke.

84
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.030
Nay, you were better to speakfirst,

85
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.230
and when you were gravelled forlack of matter,

86
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.330
then you might take occasion tokiss.

87
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.670
Very good orators, when they areout, they spit,

88
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.100
and for lovers lacking-- Godwarn us--matter,

89
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.570
the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

90
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.570
How if the kiss be denied?

91
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.270
Then she puts you to entreaty,and there begins new matter.

92
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.570
What, of my suit?

93
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.370
Not out of your apparel, and yetout of your suit.

94
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.170
Am not I your Rosalind?

95
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.930
I take some joy to say you are,

96
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.070
because I would be talking ofher.

97
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.330
Well then, in her person,

98
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.570
I say I will not have you.

99
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.170
Then, in mine own person, I die.

100
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.900
No, faith, die by attorney.

101
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.430
The poor world is almost 6,000years old,

102
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.970
and in all that time,

103
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.070
there was not any man died inhis own person,

104
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.430
videlicet, in a love-cause.

105
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.400
Troilus had his brains dashedout with a Grecian club,

106
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.430
although he did what he could todie before,

107
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.200
and he is one of the verypatterns of love.

108
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.600
Leander, he would have lived formany a fair year,

109
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.900
though Hero had turned nun,

110
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.200
had it not been for a hotmidsummer night,

111
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.170
for, good youth, he went butforth

112
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.530
to wash him in the Hellespont

113
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.430
and there being taken of a crampwas drowned,

114
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.270
and the foolish chronicles ofthat age

115
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.600
did find it "Hero of Sestos."

116
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.470
But these are all lies.

117
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.900
Men have died from time to time,

118
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.400
and worms have eaten them, butnot for love.

119
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.970
I would not have my rightRosalind of this mind,

120
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.630
for, I protest, her frown mightkill me.

121
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.430
By this hand, it will not kill afly.

122
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.670
But come,

123
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.230
now I will be your Rosalind

124
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.670
in a more coming-on disposition,

125
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.330
and ask me what you will.

126
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.870
I will grant it.

127
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.330
Then love me, Rosalind.

128
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.900
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays andSaturdays and all.

129
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.570
And wilt thou have me?

130
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.830
Aye, and 20 such.

131
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.230
What sayest thou?

132
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.370
Are you not good?

133
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.500
I hope so.

134
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.430
Why, can one desire too much ofa good thing?

135
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.670
Come, sister, you must be thepriest and marry us.

136
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.330
Give me your hand, Orlando.

137
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.930
Well, sister, what do you say?

138
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.170
Pray thee, marry us.

139
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.530
Well, I cannot say the words.

140
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.270
You must begin, "Will you,Orlando"--

141
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.770
Go to.

142
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.200
Will you, Orlando, have to wifethis Rosalind?

143
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.430
I will.

144
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.630
Aye, but when?

145
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.300
Why now; as fast as she canmarry us.

146
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.900
Why, then, you must say,

147
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.070
"'I take thee, Rosalind, forwife."

148
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:45.270
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

149
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.000
I might ask you for yourcommission,

150
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.670
but I do take thee, Orlando, formy husband.

151
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.600
Oh.

152
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.100
There's a girl goes before thepriest,

153
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.800
and certainly a woman's thoughtruns before her actions.

154
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800
So do all thoughts.

155
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.570
They are winged.

156
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.470
How long would you have herafter you have possessed her?

157
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.630
Forever and a day.

158
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.730
Say the "day" without the"ever."

159
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.000
No, no,

160
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.800
Orlando, men are April when theywoo,

161
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.370
December when they wed.

162
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.800
Maids are May when they aremaids,

163
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.600
but the sky changes when theyare wives.

164
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.600
I will be more jealous of thee

165
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.130
than a Barbary cock-pigeon overhis hen,

166
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.500
more clamorous than a parrotagainst rain,

167
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.530
more new-fangled than an ape,

168
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.830
more giddy in my desires than amonkey.

169
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.130
I will weep for nothing, likeDiana in the fountain,

170
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.270
and I will do that when you aredisposed to be merry.

171
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.000
I will laugh like a hyena,

172
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.700
and that when you are inclinedto sleep.

173
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.470
But will my Rosalind do so?

174
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.900
By my life, she will do as I do.

175
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.470
O, but she is wise.

176
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.130
Else she would not have the witto do this.

177
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.670
The wiser, the waywarder.

178
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.300
Make the doors upon a woman'swit,

179
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.830
and it will out at the casement.

180
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.130
Shut that, 'twill out throughthe keyhole.

181
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.700
Stop that,

182
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.970
'twill fly with the smoke out ofthe chimney.

183
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.530
For these two hours, Rosalind, Iwill leave thee.

184
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.170
Alas, dear love, I cannot lackthee two hours.

185
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.730
I must attend the duke atdinner.

186
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.670
By two o'clock, I will be withthee again.

187
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.000
Well...

188
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.970
go your ways, go your ways.

189
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.930
I knew what you would prove.

190
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.300
My friends told me as such, andI-I-I thought no less:

191
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.600
'Twas that flattering tongue ofyours won me.

192
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:57.170
Well, 'tis but one cast off, andso, come, death!

193
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.430
Two o'clock is your hour?

194
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.200
Aye, sweet Rosalind.

195
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.600
By my troth, and so God mend me,

196
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.370
and by all pretty oaths that arenot dangerous,

197
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.070
if you break one jot of yourpromise

198
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.830
or come one minute behind yourhour,

199
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.500
I will think you the mostpathetical break-promise,

200
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.070
the most hollow lover,

201
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.400
and the most unworthy of her youthat call Rosalind

202
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.270
that may be chosen out of thegross band of the unfaithful,

203
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.900
and so, beware my censure,

204
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.130
and keep your promise.

205
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.270
With no less religion

206
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.170
than if thou wert indeed myRosalind.

207
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.930
So, adieu.

208
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:39.030
Well, Time is the old justicethat examines all suchoffenders,

209
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.400
and let Time try. Adieu.

210
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.830
You have simply misused our sexin your love-prate.

211
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.430
We must have your doublet andhose

212
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.830
plucked over your head

213
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.530
to show the world what the birdhath done to her own nest.

214
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:15.100
O coz, coz, coz,

215
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.430
my pretty little coz,

216
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.000
if thou didst know

217
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.100
how many fathom deep I am inlove.

218
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.600
But it cannot be sounded.

219
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.430
My affection hath an unknownbottom,

220
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.470
like the bay of Portugal.

221
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.470
Or rather, bottomless,

222
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.370
for as fast as you pouraffection in,

223
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.670
it runs out.

224
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.170
No, that same wicked bastard ofVenus

225
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.330
that was begot of thought,

226
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.270
conceived of spleen, and born ofmadness,

227
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.930
that blind rascally boy

228
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.670
that abuses every one's eyesbecause his own are out,

229
00:10:54.670 --> 00:11:00.770
let him be judge how deep I amin love.

230
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.730
Oh...

231
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.100
I tell thee, Aliena,

232
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.200
I cannot be out of the sight ofOrlando.

233
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.900
I'll go find a shadow and sighuntil he come.

234
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.630
And I'll sleep.

235
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.870
Which is he that killed thedeer?

236
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.970
Sir, it was I.

237
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.800
Let's present him to the duke,like a Roman conqueror,

238
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.070
and it would do well

239
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.970
to set the deer's horns upon hishead

240
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.400
for a branch of victory.

241
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.530
Have you no song, forester, forthis purpose?

242
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:47.630
Yes, sir.

243
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:48.770
Sing it!

244
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.270
'Tis no matter how it be in tune

245
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.970
so it make noise enough.

246
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.030
What shall he have that kill'dthe deer?

247
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.530
His leather skin and horns towear.

248
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.200
Then sing him home.

249
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.830
Take thou no scorn to wear thehorn;

250
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.500
It was a crest ere thou wastborn.

251
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.370
Thy father's father wore it,

252
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.770
and thy father bore it.

253
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.430
The horn, the horn, the lustyhorn

254
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.300
is not a thing to laugh toscorn.

255
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.630
How say you now?

256
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.900
Is it not past two o'clock?

257
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.330
And here much Orlando.

258
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.570
I warrant you,

259
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.770
with pure love and with troubledbrain,

260
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.170
he hath ta'en his bow and arrowsand is gone forth to sleep.

261
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.300
My errand is to you, fair youth;

262
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.970
My gentle Phebe did bid me giveyou this.

263
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.330
I know not the contents, but, asI guess

264
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.770
by the stern brow and waspishaction

265
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.670
that she did use as she waswriting of it,

266
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.230
it bears an angry tenor.

267
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.700
pardon me:

268
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.930
I am but as a guiltlessmessenger.

269
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:59.530
Patience herself would startleat this letter

270
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:00.930
and play the swaggerer.

271
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.770
Bear this, bear all.

272
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.930
She says I am not fair, that Ilack manners.

273
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.400
She calls me proud and that shecould not love me

274
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.500
were man as rare as phoenix.

275
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.170
'Od's my will.

276
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.230
Her love is not the hare that Ido hunt.

277
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.630
Why writes she this to me?

278
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.300
Well, shepherd, well,

279
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.500
this is a letter of your owndevice.

280
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.730
No, I protest, I know not thecontents.

281
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.200
Phebe did write it.

282
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.570
Come, come, you are a fool

283
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.370
and turn'd into the extremity oflove.

284
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.570
I saw her hand.

285
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:36.830
She has a leathern hand,

286
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.630
a freestone-color'd hand.

287
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.170
I verily did think that her oldgloves were on,

288
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.130
but 'twas her hands.

289
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.670
She has a huswife's hand; but'tis no matter.

290
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.930
I say she never did invent thisletter.

291
00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:53.170
this is a man's invention andhis hand.

292
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.370
Sure, it is hers.

293
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.530
Why, 'tis a boisterous and acruel style.

294
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.130
A style for challengers.

295
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.400
Why, she defies me as Turk toChristian.

296
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.700
Will you hear the letter?

297
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.230
So please you, for I never heardit yet,

298
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.030
yet heard too much of Phebe'scruelty.

299
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.470
She Phebes me.

300
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.300
Mark how the tyrant writes.

301
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.700
"Art thou god to shepherdturn'd,

302
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.730
that a maiden's heart hathburn'd?"

303
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.030
Can a woman rail thus?

304
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.870
Call you this railing?

305
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.970
"Why, thy godhead laid apart,

306
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.670
warr'st thou with a woman'sheart?"

307
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.200
Did you ever hear such railing?

308
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.000
"Whiles the eye of man did woome,

309
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.870
"that could do no vengeance tome.

310
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:42.370
"Whiles you chid me, I did love.

311
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.700
"How then might your prayersmove?

312
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.000
"He that brings this love tothee

313
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.730
"little knows this love in me,

314
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.270
"and by him, seal up thy mind

315
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.200
"whether that thy youth and kind

316
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200
"will the faithful offer take ofme

317
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.500
"and all that I can make,

318
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.670
"or else by him, my love deny,

319
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.800
and then I'll study how to die."

320
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.400
Call you this chiding?

321
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.200
Alas, poor shepherd.

322
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.000
Do you pity him?

323
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.500
No, he deserves no pity.

324
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.470
Wilt thou love such a woman?

325
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.430
What, to make of thee aninstrument

326
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.470
and play false strains uponthee?

327
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.500
Not to be endured.

328
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.770
Well, go thy ways to her,

329
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.530
for I see love hath made thee atame snake,

330
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.170
and say this to her.

331
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.700
If she love me, I charge her tolove thee.

332
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.730
If she will not, I will neverhave her

333
00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.930
unless thou entreat for her.

334
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.330
If you be a true lover, hence,

335
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.330
and not a word,

336
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.770
for here comes more company.

337
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.000
Good morrow, fair ones.

338
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.570
Pray you, if you know,

339
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.330
where in the purlieus of thisforest

340
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.730
stands a sheep-cote fenced aboutwith olive trees?

341
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:03.830
West of this place, down in theneighbour bottom.

342
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.370
A rank of osiers by themurmuring stream

343
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.330
left on your right hand bringsyou to the place.

344
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.930
But at this hour the house dothkeep itself.

345
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.230
There is none within.

346
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.430
If that an eye may profit by atongue,

347
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:20.000
then should I know you bydescription.

348
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.370
Such garments and such years--

349
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.830
"The boy is fair, of femalefavor,

350
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.800
"and bestows himself like a ripesister;

351
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.000
the woman low and browner thanher brother."

352
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.630
Are not you the owner of thehouse I did inquire for?

353
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.500
It is no boast, being ask'd, tosay we are.

354
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.100
Orlando doth commend him to youboth,

355
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.370
and to that youth he calls hisRosalind

356
00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.730
he sends this bloody napkin.

357
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:44.900
Are you he?

358
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.030
I am.

359
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.570
What must we understand by this?

360
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.630
Some of my shame.

361
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.430
If you will know of me what manI am

362
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.430
and how and where and why thishandkercher was stain'd.

363
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.270
I pray you, tell it.

364
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.100
When last the young Orlandoparted from you,

365
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.970
he left a promise to returnagain within an hour,

366
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.470
and pacing through the forest,

367
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.830
chewing the food of sweet andbitter fancy,

368
00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.700
lo, what befell.

369
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.130
He threw his eye aside,

370
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.630
and mark what object did presentitself.

371
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.670
Under an oak whose boughs weremoss'd with age

372
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.800
and high top bald with dryantiquity,

373
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.770
A wretched ragged man o'ergrownwith hair

374
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:22.200
lay sleeping on his back.

375
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.330
About his neck,

376
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.170
a green and gilded snake hadwreathed itself

377
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.830
who with her head nimble inthreats

378
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.600
approach'd the opening of hismouth,

379
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.970
but suddenly, seeing Orlando, itunlink'd itself

380
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.630
and with indented glides didslip away into a bush,

381
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.970
under which bush's shade,

382
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.570
a lioness with udders all drawndry lay couching,

383
00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.770
head on ground with catlikewatch,

384
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.070
when that the sleeping manshould stir,

385
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.130
for 'tis the royal dispositionof that beast

386
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.500
to prey on nothing that dothseem as dead.

387
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.600
This seen, Orlando did approachthe man

388
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.130
and found it was his brother,his elder brother.

389
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.270
O, I have heard him speak ofthat same brother,

390
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.230
and he did render him the mostunnatural amongst men.

391
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.570
And well he might so do,

392
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.370
for well I know he wasunnatural.

393
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.830
But to Orlando, did he leave himthere,

394
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.270
food to the suck'd and hungrylioness?

395
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.270
Twice did he turn his back andpurposed so,

396
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.500
but kindness, nobler ever thanrevenge,

397
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.100
and nature, stronger than hisjust occasion,

398
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.900
made him give battle to thelioness,

399
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.430
who quickly fell before him

400
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.800
in which hurtling from miserableslumber,

401
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.500
I awaked.

402
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.770
Are you his brother?

403
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.030
Wast you he rescued?

404
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.330
Was't you that did so oftcontrive to kill him?

405
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.170
'Twas I, but 'tis not I.

406
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.970
I do not shame to tell you whatI was,

407
00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.030
since my conversion so sweetlytastes,

408
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.370
being the thing I am.

409
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.900
But, for the bloody napkin?

410
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.500
By and by.

411
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.970
When from the first and last,betwixt us two,

412
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.600
tears our recountments had mostkindly bathed

413
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.370
as how I came into that desertplace--

414
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.130
in brief, he led me to thegentle duke,

415
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.170
who gave me fresh array andentertainment,

416
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.430
committing me unto my brother'slove,

417
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.630
who led me instantly unto hiscave,

418
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:58.930
there stripp'd himself,

419
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.330
and here, upon his arm,

420
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.170
the lioness had torn some fleshaway,

421
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:03.870
which all this while had bled,

422
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.770
and now he fainted

423
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.870
and cried, in fainting, uponRosalind.

424
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.000
Brief, I recover'd him, bound uphis wound,

425
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.530
and, after some small space,being strong at heart,

426
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.970
he sent me hither, stranger as Iam,

427
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.730
to tell this story

428
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.670
that you might excuse his brokenpromise

429
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.530
and to give this napkin dyed inhis blood

430
00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:25.530
unto that shepherd youth that hein sport doth call his Rosalind.

431
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.270
Why, how now, Ganymede,

432
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.400
sweet Ganymede.

433
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.630
Many will swoon when they dolook on blood.

434
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.330
There is more in it.

435
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.130
Cousin Ganymede.

436
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.300
Look, he recovers.

437
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.070
Oh.

438
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.600
Would I were at home.

439
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.570
We'll lead you thither.

440
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.630
I pray you, will you take him bythe arm?

441
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.100
Be of good cheer.

442
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.100
Wert you a man, you lack a man'sheart.

443
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.430
I do so, I confess it.

444
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:00.870
Ah, ah, ha, ha, sirrah,

445
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.100
a body would think this was wellcounterfeited.

446
00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.600
I pray you, tell your brotherhow well I counterfeited.

447
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.770
Ah!

448
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:09.800
This was not a counterfeit.

449
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.170
There is too great testimony inyour complexion

450
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.030
that it was a passion ofearnest.

451
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:15.770
Counterfeit, I assure you.

452
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.770
Well then, take a good heart andcounterfeit to be a man.

453
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.270
Oh.

454
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.130
So I do,

455
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.130
but, in faith,

456
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.800
I should have been a woman byright.

457
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.270
Come, you look paler and paler.

458
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.970
I pray you, draw homeward.

459
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.400
Good sir, go with us.

460
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.170
Will you go?

461
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.270
