00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670


2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:54.000


3
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.730
In delivering my son from me,

4
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.870
I bury a second husband.

5
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.970
And I in going, madam,

6
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.100
weep o'er my father's death anew:

7
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
but I must attend his majesty's command,

8
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.770
to whom I am now in ward,

9
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.200
evermore in subjection.

10
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.500
You shall find of the king a husband, madam;

11
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.330
you,sir, a father

12
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

13
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.030
He hath abandoned his physicians, madam;

14
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.330
under whose practises

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.470
he hath persecuted time with hope,

16
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830
and finds no other advantage in the process

17
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.630
but only the losing of hope by time.

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.930
This young gentlewoman had a father,

19
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.100
O, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!

20
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730
whose skill was almost as great as his honesty;

21
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.330
had it stretched so far,

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.300
would have made nature immortal,

23
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.770
and death should have play for lack of work.

24
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.970
Would, for the king's sake, he were living!

25
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.100
I think it would be the death

26
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.300
of the king's disease.

27
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.400
How called you the man you speak of, madam?

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.530
He was famous, sir, in his profession,

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.670
and it was his great right to be so:

30
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.570
Gerard de Narbon.

31
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.430
He was excellent indeed, madam:

32
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.000
the king very lately spoke of him

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.170
admiringly and mourningly

34
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.070
he was likely to have lived still,

35
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.330
if knowledge could be set up against mortality.

36
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.230
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.030
A fistula, my lord.

38
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.700
I heard not of it before.

39
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.200
I would it were not notorious.

40
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.500
Was this gentlewoman

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.270
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.330
His sole child, my lord,

43
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.530
and bequeathed to my overlooking.

44
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.200
I have those hopes of her good

45
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.870
that her education promises;

46
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.370
her dispositions she inherits,

47
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.530
in her they are the better

48
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.870
for their simpleness;

49
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.830
she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

50
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.900
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

51
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.

52
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.800
The remembrance of her father

53
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830
never approaches her heart

54
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.030
but the tyranny of her sorrows

55
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.400
takes all livelihood from her cheek.

56
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.830
Go to, Helena, no more; go to

57
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.170
lest it be rather thought

58
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.870
you affect a sorrow than have it.

59
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.970
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

60
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.630
How understand we that?

61
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.570
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,

62
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.330
excessive grief the enemy to the living.

63
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.270
If the living be enemy to the grief,

64
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.630
the excess makes it soon mortal.

65
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.030
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

66
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.230
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father

67
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.870
In manners, as in shape!

68
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.870
thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee,

69
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.370
and thy goodness share with thy birthright!

70
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.270
Love all, trust a few,

71
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.900
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy

72
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.800
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend

73
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.130
Under thy life's key: be cheque'd for silence,

74
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.200
But never tax'd for speech.

75
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.800
What heaven more will,

76
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.900
that thee may furnish and my prayers fall down,

77
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.500
Fall on thy head! Farewell,

78
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.200
'Tis an unseason'd courtier;

79
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.930
good my lord, Advise him.

80
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.230
He cannot want the best

81
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.930
that shall attend his love.

82
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.270
Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

83
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.430
The best wishes that can be forged

84
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.470
in your thoughts be servants to you!

85
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.830
Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress,

86
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.500
and make much of her.

87
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.100
Farewell, pretty lady:

88
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.100
you must hold the credit of your father.

89
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.330
O, were that all! I think not on my father;

90
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.100
And these great tears grace his remembrance more

91
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.570
Than those I shed for him.

92
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.600
What was he like?

93
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.700
I have forgot him:

94
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.800
my imagination carries no favour in't but Bertram's.

95
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.670
I am undone: there is no living, none,

96
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.770
If Bertram be away.

97
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.430
'Twere all one that I should love

98
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.300
a bright particular star

99
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.070
And think to wed it, he is so above me:

100
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.770
In his bright radiance and collateral light

101
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.070
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.

102
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.270
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

103
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.570
The hind that would be mated by the lion

104
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.370
Must die for love.

'Twas pretty, though plague,

109
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.600
to see him every hour;

110
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.700
to sit and draw his arched brows,

111
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.170
his hawking eye, his curls,

112
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.970
In our heart's table;

113
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.570
heart too capable of every line and trick

114
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.930
of his sweet favour:

115
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
But now he's gone,

116
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.270
and my idolatrous fancy

117
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.470
Must sanctify his reliques.

118
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.230
Who comes here?

119
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.730
One that goes with him:

120
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.000
I love him for his sake;

121
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.170
And yet I know him a notorious liar,

122
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.030
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;

123
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.870
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,

124
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.100
That they take place,

125
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.100
when virtue's steely bones look bleak i' the cold wind:

126
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.970
withal, full oft we see

127
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.030
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

128
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.170
Save you, fair queen!

129
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.200
Are you meditating on virginity?

130
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.330
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you:

131
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.670
let me ask you a question.

132
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.530
Man is enemy to virginity;

133
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.670
how may we barricado it against him?

134
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.030
Keep him out.

135
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.330
But he assails;

136
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.130
and our virginity, though valiant,

137
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.100
in the defence yet is weak:

138
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.570
unfold to us some warlike resistance.

139
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.000
There is none: man, sitting down before you,

140
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.530
will undermine you and blow you up.

141
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.700
Bless our poor virginity

142
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.830
from underminers and blowers up!

143
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.330
It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature

144
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.030
to preserve virginity.

145
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.000
Loss of virginity is rational increase

146
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.400
and there was never virgin got

147
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.130
till virginity was first lost.

148
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.800
I will stand for 't a little,

149
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.670
though therefore I die a virgin.

150
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.970
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle,

151
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.130
made of self-love,

152
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.900
which is the most inhibited sin in the canon.

153
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.670
Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't:

154
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.830
out with 't!

155
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.730
within the year it will make itself two,

156
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.000
which is a goodly increase;

157
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.730
and the principal itself not much the worse:

158
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.130
away with 't!

159
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.070
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

160
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.030
Let me see: marry, ill,

161
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.800
to like him that ne'er it likes.

162
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.130
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying;

163
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.230
the longer kept, the less worth:

164
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.700
Virginity, like an old courtier,

165
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.630
wears her cap out of fashion:

166
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.700
richly suited, but unsuitable:

167
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.030
just like the brooch and the tooth-pick,

168
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.200
which wear not now.

169
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200
Your date is better in your pie

170
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.170
and your porridge than in your cheek;

171
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.570
and your virginity, your old virginity,

172
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.370
is like one of our French withered pears,

173
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.470
it looks ill, it eats drily;

174
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.000
marry, 'tis a withered pear;

175
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it was formerly better;

176
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.230
marry, yet 'tis a withered pear:

177
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.170
will you anything with it?

178
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.530
Not my virginity yet

179
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.200
There shall your master have a thousand loves,

180
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.370
A mother and a mistress and a friend,

181
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.630
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,

182
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.570
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,

183
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.030
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;

184
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.930
His humble ambition, proud humility,

185
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.130
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,

186
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.670
His faith, his sweet disaster;

187
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.270
with a world of pretty,

188
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.130
fond, adoptious christendoms,

189
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.870
that blinking Cupid gossips.

190
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.530
Now shall he--

191
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.400
I know not what he shall. God send him well!

192
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.530
The court's a learning place, and he is one--

193
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.700
What one, i' faith?

194
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.070
That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

195
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.400
What's pity?

196
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.230
That wishing well had not a body in't,

197
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.400
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,

198
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.170
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,

199
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.270
Might with effects of them follow our friends,

200
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.330
And show what we alone must think,

201
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.230
which never returns us thanks.

202
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.430
Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

203
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.970
Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee,

204
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.470
I will think of thee at court.

205
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.130
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

206
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.430
Under Mars, I.

207
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.430
I especially think, under Mars.

208
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.200
Why under Mars?

209
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.630
The wars have so kept you under

210
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.400
that you must needs be born under Mars.

211
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.230
When he was predominant.

212
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.030
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

213
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.630
Why think you so?

214
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.630
You go so much backward when you fight.

215
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.500
That's for advantage.

216
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.530
So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;

217
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.870
but the composition

218
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.170
that your valour and fear makes in you

219
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.430
is a virtue of a good wing,

220
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.770
and I like the wear well.

221
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.730
I am so full of businesses,

222
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.700
I cannot answer thee acutely.

223
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.830
When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;

224
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.700
when thou hast none, remember thy friends;

225
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.230
get thee a good husband,

226
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.870
and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

227
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.700
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,

228
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.630
Which we ascribe to heaven:

229
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.770
the fated sky gives us free scope,

230
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.600
only doth backward pull our slow designs

231
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.600
when we ourselves are dull.

232
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.870
What power is it which mounts my love so high,

233
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.600
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?

234
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.770
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings

235
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:04.000
To join like likes and kiss like native things.

236
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.700
Impossible be strange attempts to those

237
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.670
that weigh their pains in sense

238
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:13.200
and do suppose What hath been cannot be:

239
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.500
who ever strove to show her merit,

240
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.300
that did miss her love?

241
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.470
The king's disease--

242
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.200
my project may deceive me,

243
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.400
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

244
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.570
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;

245
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.270
Have fought with equal fortune and continue

246
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.330
A braving war.

247
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.230
So 'tis reported, sir.

248
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.270
Nay, 'tis most credible;

249
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.330
we here received it. A certainty,

250
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.670
vouch'd from our cousin Austria,

251
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.900
With caution that the Florentine will move us

252
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.370
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend

253
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.970
Prejudicates the business

254
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.870
and would seem to have us make denial.

255
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.100
His love and wisdom, approved so to your majesty,

256
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.070
may plead for amplest credence.

257
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.730
He hath arm'd our answer,

258
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:30.270
And Florence is denied before he comes:

259
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.730
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean

260
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.100
to see the Tuscan service,

261
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.030
freely have they leave to stand on either part.

262
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.630
It well may serve A nursery to our gentry,

263
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.330
who are sick for breathing and exploit.

264
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.070
What's he comes here?

265
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.400
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,

266
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.030
Young Bertram.

267
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.530
Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;

268
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.300
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,

269
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.400
Hath well composed thee.

270
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.930
Thy father's moral parts mayst thou inherit too!

271
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.300
Welcome to Paris.

272
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.530
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

273
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.530
It much repairs me to talk of your good father.

274
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.430
In his youth he had the wit

275
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.400
which I can well observe today

276
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.870
in our young lords;

277
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.030
but they may jest till their own scorn

278
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.130
return to them unnoted

279
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.570
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;

280
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.930
who were below him he used as creatures of another place

281
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.800
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,

282
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.230
Making them proud by his humility,

283
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.730
In their poor praise he humbled.

284
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:12.500
Such a man might be a copy to these younger times;

285
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.100
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now

286
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.830
But goers backward.

287
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.230
His good remembrance, sir,

288
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.970
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;

289
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.500
So in approof lives not his epitaph

290
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.970
as in your royal speech.

291
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.830
'Let me not live,' quoth he,

292
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.500
'After my flame lacks oil,

293
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.030
to be the snuff of younger spirits,

294
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:44.370
whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain;

295
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.870
whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments;

296
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:57.330
whose constancies expire before their fashions.'

297
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.270
This he wish'd;

298
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.770
I after him do after him wish too,

299
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.570
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,

300
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.630
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,

301
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.670
To give some labourers room.

302
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.730
You are loved, sir:

303
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.500
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

304
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:34.630
I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,

305
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.870
Since the physician at your father's died?

306
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.770
He was much famed.

307
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.100
Some six months since, my lord.

308
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.400
If he were living, I would try him yet.

309
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.000
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out

310
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.670
With several applications;

311
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.100
nature and sickness debate it at their leisure.

312
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.100
Welcome, count; my sons are no dearer.

313
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.300
Thank your majesty.

314
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.670
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah

315
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.130
the complaints I have heard of you

316
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.470
I do not all believe:

317
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.770
'tis my slowness that I do not;

318
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.630
for I know you lack not folly to commit them,

319
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.230
and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.

320
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.400
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

321
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400
Well, sir.

322
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.200
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor,

323
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.270
though many of the rich are damned:

324
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.900
but, if I may have your ladyship's good will

325
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.370
to go to the world,

326
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.630
Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.

327
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.170
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

328
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.770
I do beg your good will in this case.

329
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.670
In what case?

330
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.470
In Isbel's case and mine own.

331
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.270
Service is no heritage:

332
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.200
and I think I shall never have the blessing of God

333
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.370
till I have issue o' my body;

334
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.500
for they say barnes are blessings.

335
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.000
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

336
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.400
My poor body, madam, requires it:

337
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.830
I am driven on by the flesh;

338
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.170
and he must needs go that the devil drives.

339
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.170
Is this all your worship's reason?

340
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.670
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons

341
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.770
such as they are.

342
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.530
May the world know them?

343
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.300
I have been, madam, a wicked creature,

344
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.500
as you and all flesh and blood are;

345
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.130
and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.

346
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.300
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

347
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.370
I am out o' friends, madam;

348
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.430
and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.

349
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.700
Such friends are thine enemies, sirrah.

350
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.230
Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

351
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.030
May it please you, madam,

352
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.870
that he bid Helen come to you: of her I am to speak.

353
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.030
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman

354
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.700
I would speak with her;

355
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.830
Well, now.

356
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.170
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

357
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.570
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me;

358
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.400
and she herself, without other advantage,

359
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.970
may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds:

360
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.600
there is more owing her than is paid;

361
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.530
and more shall be paid her than she'll demand.

362
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.300
Madam, I was very late more near her

363
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.970
than I think she wished me:

364
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.730
alone she was, and did communicate

365
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.500
to herself her own words

366
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
to her own ears;

367
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.730
she thought, I dare vow for her,

368
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.970
they touched not any stranger sense.

369
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.170
Her matter was, she loved your son:

370
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.000
Fortune, she said, was no goddess,

371
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
that had put such difference

372
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.970
betwixt their two estates;

373
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.930
Love no god, that would not extend his might,

374
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.230
only where qualities were level;

375
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.870
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow

376
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.230
that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in:

377
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.500
which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;

378
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.130
sithence, in the loss that may happen,

379
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.100
it concerns you something to know it.

380
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.330
You have discharged this honestly;

381
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.600
keep it to yourself:

382
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.100
many likelihoods informed me of this before,

383
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.170
which hung so tottering in the balance

384
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.630
that I could neither believe nor misdoubt.

385
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.130
stall this in your bosom;

386
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.430
and I thank you for your honest care:

387
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.100
I will speak with you more anon.

388
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.900
Even so it was with me when I was young:

389
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.470
If ever we are nature's, these are ours;

390
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.770
this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;

391
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.870
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;

392
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.000
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,

393
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.170
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:

394
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.500
By our remembrances of days foregone,

395
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.230
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.

396
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.030
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.

397
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.030
What is your pleasure, madam?

398
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.230
You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.

399
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.300
Mine honourable mistress.

400
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.830
Nay, a mother: Why not a mother?

401
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.600
When I said 'a mother,'

402
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.730
methought you saw a serpent:

403
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.870
what's in 'mother,' that you start at it? I say,

404
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.900
I am your mother;

405
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.600
And put you in the catalogue of those

406
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.800
That were enwombed mine:

407
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.570
'tis often seen adoption strives with nature

408
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.500
and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds:

409
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.970
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,

410
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.130
Yet I express to you a mother's care:

411
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.330
God's mercy, maiden!

412
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:45.200
Does it curd thy blood to say I am thy mother?

413
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.130
Why? that you are my daughter?

414
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.300
That I am not.

415
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.770
I say, I am your mother.

416
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.700
Pardon, madam;

417
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.170
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:

418
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.970
I am from humble, he from honour'd name;

419
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.630
No note upon my parents, his all noble:

420
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.530
My master, my dear lord he is;

421
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.530
and I his servant live, and will his vassal die:

422
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.730
He must not be my brother.

423
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.630
Nor I your mother?

424
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.370
You are my mother, madam; would you were,--

425
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.130
So that my lord your son were not my brother,--

426
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.270
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,

427
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.600
I care no more for than I do for heaven,

428
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.300
So I were not his sister.

429
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.570
Can't no other, but, I your daughter,

430
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.900
he must be my brother?

431
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.970
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:

432
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.630
God shield you mean it not!

433
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:37.170
Daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse.

434
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.630
What, pale again?

435
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.970
My fear hath catch'd your fondness:

436
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.970
now I see the mystery of your loneliness,

437
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.500
and find your salt tears' head:

438
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.130
now to all sense 'tis gross

439
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.730
You love my son; invention is ashamed,

440
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.430
Against the proclamation of thy passion,

441
00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:01.970
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;

442
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.830
But tell me then, 'tis so;

443
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.870
for, look thy cheeks confess it, th' one to th' other;

444
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.870
and thine eyes see it so grossly shown

445
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.000
in thy behaviors

446
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.870
That in their kind they speak it:

447
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.300
only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,

448
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.300
That truth should be suspected.

449
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.770
Speak, is't so?

450
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.270
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;

451
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:31.570
If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,

452
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.230
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,

453
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.670
Tell me truly.

454
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.800
Good madam, pardon me!

455
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.170
Do you love my son?

456
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.530
Your pardon, noble mistress!

457
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.830
Love you my son?

458
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.570
Do not you love him, madam?

459
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.000
Go not about;

460
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.300
my love hath in't a bond,

461
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.730
whereof the world takes note:

462
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.630
come, come, disclose the state of your affection;

463
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.130
for your passions have to the full appeach'd.

464
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.470
Then, I confess,

465
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.730
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,

466
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.270
That before you, and next unto high heaven,

467
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.930
I love your son.

468
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.470
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:

469
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.500
Be not offended;

470
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.430
for it hurts not him that he is loved of me:

471
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.970
I follow him not by any token

472
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.230
of presumptuous suit;

473
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.970
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;

474
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.870
Yet never know how that desert should be.

475
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.300
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;

476
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.430
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve

477
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.430
I still pour in the waters of my love

478
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:47.500
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,

479
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.870
Religious in mine error,

480
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.170
I adore the sun,

481
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.570
that looks upon his worshipper,

482
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.500
but knows of him no more.

483
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.530
My dearest madam,

484
00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.130
Let not your hate encounter with my love

485
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.800
For loving where you do: but if yourself,

486
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.900
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,

487
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.630
Did ever in so true a flame of liking

488
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:18.070
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian

489
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.630
Was both herself and love:

490
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.200
O, then, give pity to her,

491
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.730
whose state is such that cannot choose

492
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.900
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;

493
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.230
That seeks not to find that her search implies,

494
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.570
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

495
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.570
Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--

496
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.270
To go to Paris?

497
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.330
Madam, I had.

498
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.900
Wherefore? tell true.

499
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.870
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.

500
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.330
You know my father left me some prescriptions

501
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.470
Of rare and proved effects,

502
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.770
such as his reading and manifest experience

503
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.730
had collected for general sovereignty;

504
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.300
amongst the rest, there is a remedy,

505
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.430
approved, set down,

506
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.200
To cure the desperate languishings

507
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.530
whereof the king is render'd lost.

508
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.570
This was your motive For Paris, was it? speak.

509
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.170
My lord your son made me to think of this;

510
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.470
Else Paris and the medicine and the king

511
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.530
Had from the conversation of my thoughts

512
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.400
Haply been absent then.

513
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.000
But think you, Helen,

514
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.070
If you should tender your supposed aid,

515
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.630
he would receive it?

516
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.200
he and his physicians are of a mind;

517
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.230
he, that they cannot help him,

518
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.000
They, that they cannot help:

519
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.770
how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin,

520
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.300
when the schools, embowell'd

521
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.630
of their doctrine,

522
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.930
have left off the danger to itself?

523
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:54.930
There's something in't,

524
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.900
more than my father's skill,

525
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.400
which was the greatest of his profession,

526
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.470
that his good receipt

527
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.430
shall for my legacy be sanctified

528
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.700
By the luckiest stars in heaven:

529
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.200
and, would your honour but give me leave

530
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.570
to try success,

531
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.400
I'ld venture the well-lost life

532
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.700
of mine on his grace's cure

533
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.200
By such a day and hour.

534
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.470
Dost thou believe't?

535
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.470
Ay, madam, knowingly.

536
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.930
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,

537
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.730
Means and attendants

538
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.700
and my loving greetings to those of mine in court:

539
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.970
I'll stay at home and pray God's blessing

540
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.870
into thy attempt:

541
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:41.400
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,

542
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.930
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

543
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.930
Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles

544
00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.600
Do not throw from you:

545
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.930
and you, my lords, farewell:

546
00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:00.270
Share the advice betwixt you;

547
00:28:00.270 --> 00:28:03.230
if both gain, all

548
00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.100
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,

549
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.900
And is enough for both.

550
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.970
'Tis our hope, sir, after well enter'd soldiers,

551
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.200
to return and find your grace in health.

552
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.530
No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart

553
00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:18.630
Will not confess he owes the malady

554
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.800
That doth my life besiege.

555
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.230
Farewell, young lords;

556
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.170
Whether I live or die,

557
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.770
be you the sons of worthy Frenchmen:

558
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.770
Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!

559
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:49.670
Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:

560
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:55.130
They say, our French lack language to deny,

561
00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:05.630
If they demand: beware of being captives,

562
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:12.230
Before you serve.

563
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.970
Our hearts receive your warnings.

564
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.700
Farewell. Farwell, my lord.

565
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.970
O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

566
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.530
'Tis not his fault, the spark.

567
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:35.830
O, 'tis brave wars!

568
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.570
Most admirable: I have seen those wars.

569
00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.370
I am commanded here, and kept a coil

570
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.270
with 'Too young' and 'the next year'

571
00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.570
and ''tis too early.'

572
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.100
An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.

573
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.430
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,

574
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.530
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,

575
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.130
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn

576
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:55.500
But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

577
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.030
There's honour in the theft.

578
00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.170
Commit it, count.

579
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.430
I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

580
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:04.200
I grow to you, and our parting

581
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.300
is a tortured body.

582
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.800
Farewell, captain.

583
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.130
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

584
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.030
Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin.

585
00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.670
Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals:

586
00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.830
you shall find in the regiment

587
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.330
of the Spinii one Captain Spurio,

588
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.330
with his cicatrice, an emblem of war,

589
00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:24.000
here on his sinister cheek;

590
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.530
it was this very sword entrenched it:

591
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.630
say to him, I live;

592
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.700
and observe his reports for me.

593
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.430
We shall, noble captain.

594
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.570
Mars dote on you for his novices!

595
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.100
what will ye do?

596
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.830
Stay: the king.

597
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.600
But, my good lord 'tis thus;

598
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.800
Will you be cured of your infirmity?

599
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.370
No.

600
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.270
O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?

601
00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:08.700
Yes, but you will my noble grapes,

602
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.900
an if my royal fox could reach them:

603
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:12.170
I have seen a medicine

604
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.070
that's able to breathe life into a stone,

605
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.600
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary

606
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.470
With spritely fire and motion;

607
00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:21.770
whose simple touch,

608
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.930
Is powerful to araise King Pepin,

609
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.730
Nay, to give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,

610
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.270
And write to her a love-line.

611
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.900
What 'her' is this?

612
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.900
Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,

613
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.300
If you will see her:

614
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.600
now, by my faith and honour,

615
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.600
If seriously I may convey my thoughts

616
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.430
In this my light deliverance,

617
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.430
I have spoke with one that,

618
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.070
in her sex, her years, profession,

619
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.230
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more

620
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.500
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her

621
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.930
For that is her demand, and know her business?

622
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.700
That done, laugh well at me.

623
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.870
Now, good Lafeu,

624
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.500
Bring in the admiration;

625
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.930
that we with thee may spend our wonder too,

626
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.770
or take off thine by wondering how thou took'st it.

627
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:13.630
Nay, I'll fit you, and not be all day neither.

628
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:20.000
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

629
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:29.570
This is his majesty; say your mind to him:

630
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.900
A traitor you do look like;

631
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.700
but such traitors his majesty seldom fears:

632
00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.370
I am Cressid's uncle, that dare leave two together;

633
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.970
Fare you well.

634
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:58.500
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

635
00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.730
Ay, my good lord.

636
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.270
Gerard de Narbon was my father;

637
00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.130
In what he did profess, well found.

638
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.700
I knew him.

639
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.900
The rather will I spare my praises towards him:

640
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.300
Knowing him is enough.

641
00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.030
On's bed of death many receipts he gave me:

642
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.430
chiefly one.

643
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.500
Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,

644
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.970
And of his old experience the oily darling,

645
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.900
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,

646
00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.070
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;

647
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:31.570
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd

648
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.100
With that malignant cause wherein the honour

649
00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.070
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,

650
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:39.130
I come to tender it and my appliance

651
00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:41.030
With all bound humbleness.

652
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.400
We thank you, maiden;

653
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.730
But may not be so credulous of cure,

654
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.000
When our most learned doctors leave us and

655
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.730
The congregated college have concluded

656
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.470
That labouring art can never ransom nature

657
00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:00.130
From her inaidible estate;

658
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.900
I say we must not so stain our judgment,

659
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.130
or corrupt our hope,

660
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:11.130
to prostitute our past-cure malady

661
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.730
To empirics, or to dissever so

662
00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:21.170
Our great self and our credit, to esteem

663
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:27.330
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

664
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.570
My duty then shall pay me for my pains:

665
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.670
I will no more enforce mine office on you.

666
00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.470
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts

667
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:35.400
A modest one, to bear me back a again.

668
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.430
I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:

669
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:44.000
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give

670
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.330
As one near death to those that wish him live:

671
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.570
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,

672
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.930
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

673
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:02.070
What I can do can do no hurt to try,

674
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.300
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.

675
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.000
He that of greatest works is finisher

676
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.270
Oft does them by the weakest minister:

677
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.670
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,

678
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.500
When judges have been babes;

679
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.800
great floods have flown

680
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.600
From simple sources, and great seas have dried

681
00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:19.700
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.

682
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.170
Oft expectation fails and most oft there

683
00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:26.930
Where most it promises, and oft it hits

684
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.470
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

685
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:35.070
I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;

686
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.200
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:

687
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.030
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;

688
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.130
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.

689
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.130
I am not an impostor that proclaim

690
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.530
Myself against the level of mine aim;

691
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.330
But know I think and think I know most sure

692
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:57.330
My art is not past power nor you past cure.

693
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.230
Are thou so confident?

694
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.500
Within what space hopest thou my cure?

695
00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:16.270
The great'st grace lending grace

696
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.970
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring

697
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.830
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,

698
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.370
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp

699
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.570
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,

700
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.630
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass

701
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:38.000
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,

702
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.070
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,

703
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:46.830
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

704
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.770
Upon thy certainty and confidence

705
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.670
What darest thou venture?

706
00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.100
Tax of impudence,

707
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.870
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame

708
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.070
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name

709
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:11.770
Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended

710
00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:15.400
With vilest torture let my life be ended.

711
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.900
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak

712
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:25.470
His powerful sound within an organ weak:

713
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:28.130
And what impossibility would slay

714
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:35.370
In common sense, sense saves another way.

715
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.370
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate

716
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:45.600
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,

717
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:54.730
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all

718
00:37:54.730 --> 00:38:00.400
That happiness and prime can happy call:

719
00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.600
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate

720
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:13.530
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.

721
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:19.930
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,

722
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.300
That ministers thine own death if I die.

723
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.470
If I break time, or flinch in property

724
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.900
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,

725
00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.530
And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;

726
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:38.400
But, if I help, what do you promise me?

727
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.700
Make thy demand.

728
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.470
But will you make it even?

729
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.830
Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

730
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:50.230
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand

731
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.230
What husband in thy power I will command:

732
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:55.600
Exempted be from me the arrogance

733
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.770
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,

734
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.470
My low and humble name to propagate

735
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.670
With any branch or image of thy state;

736
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:08.200
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know

737
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.800
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

738
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:19.330
Here is my hand; the premises observed,

739
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:25.200
Thy will by my performance shall be served:

740
00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.000
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,

741
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.100
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.

742
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.430
More should I question thee, and more I must,

743
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.900
Though more to know could not be more to trust,

744
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:48.970
From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest

745
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:56.970
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.

746
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:12.170
I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.

747
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:15.130
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught:

748
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.170
I know my business is but to the court.

749
00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:20.730
To the court! why, what place make you special,

750
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.130
when you put off that with such contempt?

751
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:24.430
But to the court!

752
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.170
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners,

753
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.400
he may easily put it off at court:

754
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.830
he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap,

755
00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:34.230
kiss his hand and say nothing,

756
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.300
has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap;

757
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.930
and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely,

758
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:41.970
were not for the court; but for me,

759
00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.630
I have an answer will serve all men.

760
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.570
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions.

761
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:53.130
From below your duke to beneath your constable,

762
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.070
Ask me if I am a courtier:

763
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:58.330
it shall do you no harm to learn.

764
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.630
To be young again, if we could:

765
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:02.770
I will be a fool in question,

766
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.730
hoping to be the wiser by your answer.

767
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.800
I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

768
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.930
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off

769
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.500
More, more, a hundred of them.

770
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.070
I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

771
00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.130
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

772
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:23.470
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

773
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:26.830
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

774
00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.000
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

775
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.400
O Lord, sir! spare not me.

776
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.130
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping,

777
00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:36.570
and 'spare not me?' Indeed your 'Spare not me,!'

778
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:39.100
is very sequent to your whipping:

779
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.770
you would answer very well to a whipping,

780
00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.970
if you were but bound to't.

781
00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:46.970
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!'

782
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.900
I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

783
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.100
I play the noble housewife with the time

784
00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.500
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

785
00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.570
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

786
00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.200
An end, sir; to your business.

787
00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.370
Give Helen this, And urge her to a present answer back:

788
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:08.370
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:

789
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.900
This is not much.

790
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.230
Not much commendation to them.

791
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.170
Not much employment for you: you understand me?

792
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:17.170
Most fruitfully:

793
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600
I am there  before my legs.

794
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.130
They say miracles are past;

795
00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.300
and we have our philosophical persons,

796
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.700
to make modern and familiar,

797
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.430
things supernatural and causeless.

798
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.800
Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,

799
00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.100
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge,

800
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.600
when we should submit ourselves

801
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.800
to an unknown fear.

802
00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.470
Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder

803
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:40.300
that hath shot out in our latter times.

804
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.170
And so 'tis.

805
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.600
To be relinquish'd of the artists,--

806
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.370
So I say.

807
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:44.830
Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

808
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.800
Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--

809
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.070
Right; so I say.

810
00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.470
That gave him out incurable,--

811
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.000
Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

812
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.930
Not to be helped,--

813
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.700
Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--

814
00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.600
Uncertain life, and sure death.

815
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.130
Just, you say well; so would I have said.

816
00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.970
I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

817
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:03.130
It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing,

818
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.330
you shall read it in--what do you call there?

819
00:43:06.330 --> 00:43:10.730
A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

820
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:12.800
That's it; I would have said the very same.

821
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.570
Why, your dolphin is not lustier:

822
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:15.530
'fore me, I speak in respect--

823
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.570
Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange,

824
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.170
that is the brief and the tedious of it;

825
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.630
and he's of a most facinerious spirit

826
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.330
that will not acknowledge it to be the--

827
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.430
Very hand of heaven.

828
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.600
Ay, so I say.

829
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.400
In a most weak--

830
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.370
and debile minister, great power,

831
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.200
great transcendence:

832
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.100
which should, indeed,

833
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.500
give us a further use to be made

834
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.770
than alone the recovery of the king, as to be--

835
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.770
generally thankful.

836
00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.330
I would have said it; you say well.

837
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.200
Here comes the king.

838
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.200
Lustig, as the Dutchman says:

839
00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:52.100
I'll like a maid the better,

840
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.030
whilst I have a tooth in my head:

841
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.530
why, he's able to lead her a coranto.

842
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.500
Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?

843
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.470
'Fore God, I think so.

844
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:11.970
Go, call before me all the lords in court.

845

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.630
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;

848
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.400
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense

849
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.930
Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive

850

The confirmation of my promised gift,

851
00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:54.070
Which but attends thy naming.

852
00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.770
Fair maid, send forth thine eye:

853
00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:02.400
this youthful parcel

854
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.500
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,

855
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.730
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice

856
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:12.500
I have to use: thy frank election make;

857
00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:17.170
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

858
00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.400
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress

859
00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:27.270
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

860
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.800
Peruse them well:

861
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.470
Not one of those but had a noble father.

862
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:35.430
Gentlemen, Heaven hath through me

863
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:37.100
restored the king to health.

864
00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.370
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

865
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:48.700
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,

866
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:53.600
That I protest I simply am a maid.

867
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.930
Please it your majesty, I have done already:

868
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.970
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,

869
00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:59.230
'We blush that thou shouldst choose;

870
00:45:59.230 --> 00:46:00.900
but, be refused,

871
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:02.600
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;

872
00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.830
We'll ne'er come there again.'

873
00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:05.430
Make choice; and, see,

874
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.500
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

875
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.800
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,

876
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:16.300
And to imperial Love, that god most high,

877
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.100
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

878
00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.770
And grant it.

879
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:26.730
Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

880
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.470
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,

881
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.600
Before I speak, too threateningly replies:

882
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.800
Love make your fortunes twenty times above

883
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.630
Her that so wishes and her humble love!

884
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:39.230
No better, if you please.

885
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.570
My wish receive,

886
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.500
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

887
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.700
Be not afraid that I your hand should take;

888
00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.200
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:

889
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.270
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed

890
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:57.800
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

891
00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.100
These boys are boys of ice,

892
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.430
they'll none have her:

893
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:01.870
sure, they are bastards to the English;

894
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.370
the French ne'er got 'em.

895
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:05.970
You are too young, too happy, and too good,

896
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.300
To make yourself a son out of my blood.

897
00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.830
Fair one, I think not so.

898
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.470
There's one grape yet;

899
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.100
I am sure thy father drunk wine:

900
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.270
but if thou be'st not an ass,

901
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:16.830
I am a youth of fourteen;

902
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.830
I have known thee already.

903
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:31.100
I dare not say I take you; but I give

904
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:35.630
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,

905
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:41.900
Into your guiding power. This is the man.

906
00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:46.830
Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

907
00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:01.570
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,

908
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.000
In such a business give me leave to use

909
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.270
The help of mine own eyes.

910
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.970
Know'st thou not, Bertram, what she has done for me?

911
00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.130
Yes, my good lord;

912
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.000
but never hope to know why I should marry her.

913
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.370
Thou know'st she has raised me

914
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:15.430
from my sickly bed.

915
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.630
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down

916
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:20.130
Must answer for your raising?

917
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.230
I know her well:

918
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:29.800
She had her breeding at my father's charge.

919
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.130
A poor physician's daughter my wife!

920
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:34.970
Disdain rather corrupt me ever!

921
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.400
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her,

922
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.500
the which I can build up.

923
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.400
Strange is it that our bloods,

924
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.630
In colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,

925
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:46.600
Would quite confound distinction,

926
00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.130
yet stand off in differences so mighty.

927
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:52.030
If she be all that is virtuous,

928
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.700
save what thou dislikest,

929
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.170
A poor physician's daughter,

930
00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.800
thou dislikest of virtue for the name:

931
00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.330
but do not so:

932
00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:05.800
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,

933
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.200
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:

934
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.630
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,

935
00:49:13.630 --> 00:49:16.070
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone

936
00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.900
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:

937
00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.930
The property by what it is should go,

938
00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:27.170
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;

939
00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:30.200
In these to nature she's immediate heir,

940
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.630
And these breed honour:

941
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.370
the mere word's a slave

942
00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:37.670
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave

943
00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.400
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb

944
00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.670
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb

945
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:48.570
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?

946
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.430
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,

947
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:56.800
I can create the rest: virtue and she

948
00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:05.000
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

949
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.770
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

950
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.130
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

951
00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.570
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:

952
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:14.570
Let the rest go.

953
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.230
My honour's at the stake;

954
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.630
which to defeat, I must produce my power.

955
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.200
Here, take her hand,

956
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.370
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;

957
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.400
That dost in vile misprision shackle up

958
00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.170
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,

959
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.370
We, poising us in her defective scale,

960
00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:37.130
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,

961
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.830
It is in us to plant thine honour where

962
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:45.030
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:

963
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:48.770
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:

964
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.500
Believe not thy disdain, but presently

965
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.700
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right

966
00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.070
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;

967
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.330
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever

968
00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.070
Into the staggers and the careless lapse

969
00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:08.170
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate

970
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.670
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,

971
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.430
Without all terms of pity.

972
00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.330
Speak; thine answer.

973
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:28.630
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit

974
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:32.270
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider

975
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.900
What great creation and what dole of honour

976
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.200
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late

977
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.270
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now

978
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.730
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,

979
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:49.470
Is as 'twere born so.

980
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.830
Take her by the hand,

981
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.830
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise

982
00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:56.230
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate

983
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:59.900
A balance more replete.

984
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.800
I take her hand.

985
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.930
Good fortune and the favour of the king

986
00:52:03.930 --> 00:52:07.000
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony

987
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.100
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,

988
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:15.730
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast

989
00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:17.630
Shall more attend upon the coming space,

990
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:23.170
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,

991
00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:29.170
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

992
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.230
Your lord and master did well

993
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.170
to make his recantation.

994
00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:43.730
Recantation! My lord! my master!

995
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.570
Ay; is it not a language I speak?

996
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:47.270
A most harsh one, and not to be understood

997
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:51.100
without bloody succeeding. My master!

998
00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.030
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

999
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:57.330
To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

1000
00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.700
To what is count's man:

1001
00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.700
count's master is of another style.

1002
00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:02.170
You are too old, sir;

1003
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.470
let it satisfy you, you are too old.

1004
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:06.670
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man;

1005
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:10.230
to which title age cannot bring thee.

1006
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.030
What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

1007
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.230
I did think thee, for two ordinaries,

1008
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:17.970
to be a pretty wise fellow;

1009
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:20.570
thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel;

1010
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:24.730
it might pass: yet the scarfs and the

1011
00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:26.530
bannerets about thee

1012
00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:28.230
did manifoldly dissuade me

1013
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.770
from believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen.

1014
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:35.230
I have now found thee; when I lose thee again,

1015
00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:36.400
I care not:

1016
00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.630
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

1017
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.530
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger,

1018
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.130
lest thou hasten thy trial; which if

1019
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:48.100
Lord have mercy on thee for a hen!

1020
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.700
So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well:

1021
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.070
thy casement I need not open,

1022
00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:55.030
for I look through thee.

1023
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:56.570
Give me thy hand.

1024
00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.700
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

1025
00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.670
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

1026
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:03.030
I have not, my lord, deserved it.

1027
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:04.800
Yes, good faith, every dram of it;

1028
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.370
and I will not bate thee a scruple.

1029
00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:09.370
Well, I shall be wiser.

1030
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:13.200
Even as soon as thou canst,

1031
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.800
If ever thou be'st bound in thy scarf and beaten,

1032
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:16.730
thou shalt find what it is

1033
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.400
to be proud of thy bondage.

1034
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.030
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

1035
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.600
I would it were hell-pains for thy sake,

1036
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.570
and my poor doing eternal: for doing I am past:

1037
00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:29.930
as I will by thee,

1038
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:32.930
in what motion age will give me leave.

1039
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.530
Well, thou hast a son

1040
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.030
shall take this disgrace off me;

1041
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:44.500
scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord!

1042
00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:46.230
Well, I must be patient;

1043
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:50.430
there is no fettering of authority.

1044
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.300
I'll beat him, by my life,

1045
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.730
if I can meet him with any convenience,

1046
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.270
an he were double and double a lord.

1047
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:59.330
I'll have no more pity of his age than I would of--

1048
00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:02.230
I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.

1049
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:06.270
Sirrah, your lord and master's married;

1050
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.700
there's news for you: you have a new mistress.

1051
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.930
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship

1052
00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:12.930
to make some reservation of your wrongs:

1053
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.830
he is my good lord: whom I serve above is my master.

1054
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.000
Who? God?

1055
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.800
Ay, sir.

1056
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.870
The devil it is that's thy master.

1057
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.330
Why dost thou garter up thy arms o' this fashion?

1058
00:55:26.330 --> 00:55:31.030
dost make hose of sleeves? do other servants so?

1059
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.530
Thou wert best set thy lower part

1060
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:34.900
where thy nose stands.

1061
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.830
By mine honour, if I were but two hours younger,

1062
00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:39.000
I'ld beat thee:

1063
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.670
methinks, thou art a general offence,

1064
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:41.830
and every man should beat thee:

1065
00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.100
I think thou wast created for men

1066
00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.270
to breathe themselves upon thee.

1067
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:49.170
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

1068
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.400
Go to, you are a vagabond and no true traveller:

1069
00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:56.330
you are more saucy with nobles and honourable personages

1070
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:57.430
than the commission of your birth

1071
00:55:57.430 --> 00:56:01.900
and virtue gives you heraldry.

1072
00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.530
You are not worth another word,

1073
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.530
else I'ld call you knave.

1074
00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:11.870
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

1075
00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:13.870
What's the matter, sweet-heart?

1076
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.730
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,

1077
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.600
I will not bed her.

1078
00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:19.430
What, what, sweet-heart?

1079
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:25.030
O my Parolles, they have married me!

1080
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.570
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

1081
00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:29.430
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits

1082
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:32.570
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

1083
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:34.730
There's letters from my mother:

1084
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:36.600
what the import is, I know not yet.

1085
00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.570
Ay, that would be known.

1086
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:40.970
To the wars, my boy, to the wars!

1087
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:43.030
He wears his honour in a box unseen,

1088
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.430
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,

1089
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:47.900
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,

1090
00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.500
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet

1091
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.500
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions

1092
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.270
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;

1093
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:57.870
Therefore, to the war!

1094
00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:01.370
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,

1095
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:03.230
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,

1096
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:06.200
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king

1097
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.930
That which I durst not speak; his present gift

1098
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.830
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,

1099
00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:14.430
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife

1100
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:17.330
To the dark house and the detested wife.

1101
00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:19.500
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

1102
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.600
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow

1103
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.430
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

1104
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:30.570
Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it.

1105
00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:31.800
'Tis hard:

1106
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.300
A young man married is a man that's marr'd:

1107
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.230
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

1108
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.300
She is not well; but yet she has her health:

1109
00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.970
she's very merry; but yet she is not well:

1110
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:48.000
but thanks be given,

1111
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.030
she's very well and wants nothing

1112
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:53.900
in the world; but yet she is not well.

1113
00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.100
If she be very well, what does she ail,

1114
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.500
that she's not very well?

1115
00:57:57.500 --> 00:57:59.800
Truly, she's very well indeed,

1116
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.670
but for two things.

1117
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:02.970
What two things?

1118
00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:05.030
One, that she's not in heaven,

1119
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.000
whither God send her quickly!

1120
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.400
the other that she's in earth,

1121
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:12.800
from whence God send her quickly!

1122
00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.470
Bless you, my fortunate lady!

1123
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:16.700
I hope, sir, I have your good will

1124
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.470
to have mine own good fortunes.

1125
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:20.130
You had my prayers to lead them on;

1126
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.500
and to keep them on, have them still.

1127
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:27.030
O, my knave, how does my old lady?

1128
00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:29.330
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,

1129
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:30.570
I would she did as you say.

1130
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.030
Why, I say nothing.

1131
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:34.030
Marry, you are the wiser man;

1132
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:37.430
for many a man's tongue shakes out his master's undoing:

1133
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:40.730
to say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing,

1134
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.370
and to have nothing,

1135
00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:44.870
is to be a great part of your title;

1136
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:47.800
which is within a very little of nothing.

1137
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.570
Away! thou'rt a knave.

1138
00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.030
You should have said, sir, before a knave

1139
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:55.670
thou'rt a knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave:

1140
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.100
this had been truth, sir.

1141
00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.970
Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

1142
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:01.630
Did you find me in yourself, sir?

1143
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:03.970
or were you taught to find me?

1144
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:06.070
The search, sir, was profitable;

1145
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:09.070
and much fool may you find in you,

1146
00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:10.730
even to the world's pleasure

1147
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:13.730
and the increase of laughter.

1148
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:25.930
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.

1149
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:29.530
Madam, my lord will go away to-night;

1150
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.100
A very serious business calls on him.

1151
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.100
The great prerogative and rite of love,

1152
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.630
Which, as your due, time claims,

1153
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:36.970
he does acknowledge;

1154
00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:39.700
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;

1155
00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.530
Whose want, and whose delay,

1156
00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.000
is strew'd with sweets,

1157
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.030
Which they distil now in the curbed time,

1158
00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:48.470
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy

1159
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:50.500
And pleasure drown the brim.

1160
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.370
What's his will else?

1161
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:54.230
That you will take your instant leave o' the king

1162
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.800
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,

1163
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.470
Strengthen'd with what apology you think

1164
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.300
May make it probable need.

1165
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.770
What more commands he?

1166
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.400
That, having this obtain'd, you presently

1167
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.700
Attend his further pleasure.

1168
01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.930
In every thing I wait upon his will.

1169
01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.930
I shall report it so.

1170
01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.930
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

1171
01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:16.300
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

1172
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.770
You have it from his own deliverance.

1173
01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.630
And by other warranted testimony.

1174
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:20.830
Then my dial goes not true:

1175
01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.400
I took this lark for a bunting.

1176
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.100
I do assure you, my lord,

1177
01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:26.670
he is very great in knowledge

1178
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:27.970
and accordingly valiant.

1179
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:29.570
I have then sinned against his experience and

1180
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:32.330
transgressed against his valour;

1181
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.730
and my state that way is dangerous,

1182
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.530
since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent.

1183
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:40.570
Here he comes: I pray you, make us friends;

1184
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.070
I will pursue the amity.

1185
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:47.970
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

1186
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:48.970
Sir?

1187
01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:51.600
O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir,

1188
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.900
he's a good workman, a very good tailor.

1189
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:54.700
Is there any unkindness

1190
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.630
between my lord and you, monsieur?

1191
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:58.300
I know not how I have deserved

1192
01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.870
to run into my lord's displeasure.

1193
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:04.000
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

1194
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.030
And shall do so ever,

1195
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.500
though I took him at 's prayers.

1196
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:09.600
Believe this of me,

1197
01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.130
there can be no kernel in this light nut;

1198
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:16.230
the soul of this man is his clothes.

1199
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:20.000
Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence;

1200
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.330
Farewell, monsieur:

1201
01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:25.370
I have spoken better of you

1202
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:27.470
than you have or will to deserve at my hand;

1203
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:30.470
but we must do good against evil.

1204
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:35.270
An idle lord. I swear.

1205
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.530
I think not so.

1206
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.900
Why, do you not know him?

1207
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.870
Yes, I do know him well,

1208
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:43.130
and common speech gives him a worthy pass.

1209
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.100
Is she gone to the king?

1210
01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.130
She is.

1211
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.270
Will she away tonight?

1212
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.970
As you will have her.

1213
01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.030
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,

1214
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:54.230
Given order for our horses; and to-night,

1215
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:56.430
When I should take possession of the bride,

1216
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:59.330
End ere I do begin.

1217
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:02.070
Here comes my clog.

1218
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.700
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,

1219
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.470
Spoke with the king and have procured his leave

1220
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:09.630
For present parting;

1221
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:11.870
only he desires some private speech with you.

1222
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.870
I shall obey his will.

1223
01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:19.200
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,

1224
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.130
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does

1225
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.570
The ministration and required office

1226
01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:27.170
On my particular. Prepared I was not

1227
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:28.970
For such a business; therefore am I found

1228
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:32.300
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you

1229
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.800
That presently you take our way for home;

1230
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:36.930
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,

1231
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.600
For my respects are better than they seem

1232
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.230
And my appointments have in them a need

1233
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.300
Greater than shows itself at the first view

1234
01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.300
To you that know them not.

1235
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.100
This to my mother:

1236
01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:51.370
'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so

1237
01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:52.670
I leave you to your wisdom.

1238
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:53.930
Sir, I can nothing say,

1239
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:56.330
But that I am your most obedient servant.

1240
01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:57.300
Come, come, no more of that.

1241
01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.230
And ever shall

1242
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:59.870
With true observance seek to eke out that

1243
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:02.330
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd

1244
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:03.970
To equal my great fortune.

1245
01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.930
Let that go:

1246
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:09.330
My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

1247
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.930
Pray, sir, your pardon.

1248
01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:13.830
Well, what would you say?

1249
01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:15.330
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,

1250
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:18.370
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;

1251
01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:19.870
But, like a timorous thief,

1252
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:21.570
most fain would steal

1253
01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:24.570
What law does vouch mine own.

1254
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:26.900
What would you have?

1255
01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:35.030
Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.

1256
01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:36.870
I would not tell you what I would, my lord:

1257
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:40.300
Faith yes;

1258
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.830
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

1259
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.500
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

1260
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.400
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

1261
01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:11.930
Go thou toward home; where I will never come

1262
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:17.570
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.

1263
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:22.770
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file

1264
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:25.230
Make me but like my thoughts

1265
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:29.100
and I shall prove a lover of thy drum,

1266
01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.270
hater of love

1267
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.170
I have sent you a daughter-in-law:

1268
01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:44.400
she hath recovered the king, and undone me.

1269
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.630
I have wedded her, not bedded her;

1270
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.470
and sworn to make the 'not' eternal.

1271
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.970
You shall hear I am run away:

1272
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:57.170
know it before the report come.

1273
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.170
If there be breadth enough in the world,

1274
01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:01.400
I will hold a long distance.

1275
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.400
My duty to you. Your unfortunate son, Bertram.

1276
01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:11.230
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.

1277
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:14.170
To fly the favours of so good a king;

1278
01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:15.970
To pluck his indignation on thy head

1279
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:18.530
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous

1280
01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:20.730
For the contempt of empire.

1281
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:23.030
O madam, yonder is heavy news within

1282
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:25.970
between two soldiers and my young lady!

1283
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:27.100
What is the matter?

1284
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.730
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some comfort;

1285
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:31.730
your son will not be killed

1286
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:33.430
so soon as I thought he would.

1287
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:34.670
Why should he be killed?

1288
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:38.230
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:

1289
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.200
the danger is in standing to't;

1290
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.770
that's the loss of men,

1291
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:43.770
though it be the getting of children.

1292
01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.300
Here they come will tell you more:

1293
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:57.930
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

1294
01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.430
Do not say so.

1295
01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:07.300
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,

1296
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.230
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,

1297
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:13.430
That the first face of neither, on the start,

1298
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:15.830
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

1299
01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:18.470
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:

1300
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.600
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,

1301
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.930
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,

1302
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.170
Thither we bend again.

1303
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:26.770
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

1304
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:33.270
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger

1305
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:36.030
which never shall come off,

1306
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:37.770
and show me a child begotten

1307
01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:41.100
of thy body that I am father to,

1308
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.000
then call me husband:

1309
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.670
but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'

1310
01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:53.700
This is a dreadful sentence.

1311
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:54.900
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

1312
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:55.970
Ay, madam;

1313
01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.530
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pains.

1314
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:01.730
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;

1315
01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:03.970
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,

1316
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:08.100
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;

1317
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:10.430
But I do wash his name out of my blood,

1318
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.830
And thou art all my child.

1319
01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:13.900
Towards Florence is he?

1320
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.130
Ay, madam.

1321
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:16.130
And to be a soldier?

1322
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:18.370
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,

1323
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:19.900
The duke will lay upon him all the honour

1324
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:22.430
That good convenience claims.

1325
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:23.500
Return you thither?

1326
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.170
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

1327
01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:29.170
Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.

1328
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.500
'Tis bitter.

1329
01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:31.670
Find you that there?

1330
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:32.630
Ay, madam.

1331
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:34.400
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply,

1332
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.200
which his heart was not consenting to.

1333
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.200
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!

1334
01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:43.630
There's nothing here that is too good for him

1335
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:46.830
But only she; and she deserves a lord

1336
01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.930
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon

1337
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:52.770
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

1338
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:54.130
A servant only, and a gentleman

1339
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.130
Which I have sometime known.

1340
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:58.870
Parolles, was it not?

1341
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.430
Ay, my good lady, he.

1342
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:05.030
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.

1343
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:07.270
My son corrupts a well-derived nature

1344
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.200
With his inducement.

1345
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.170
Indeed, good lady,

1346
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:10.830
The fellow has a deal of that too much,

1347
01:08:10.830 --> 01:08:13.370
Which holds him much to have.

1348
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:15.500
You're welcome, gentlemen.

1349
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:18.900
I will entreat you, when you see my son,

1350
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:21.170
To tell him that his sword can never win

1351
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:23.970
The honour that he loses:

1352
01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:26.230
more I'll entreat you written to bear along.

1353
01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:27.670
We serve you, madam

1354
01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:39.370
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'

1355
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.030
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!

1356
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.870
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;

1357
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:53.070
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I

1358
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:56.230
That chase thee from thy country and expose

1359
01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:59.330
Those tender limbs of thine to the event

1360
01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:02.530
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I

1361
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:05.730
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou

1362
01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:08.970
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark

1363
01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:10.630
Of smoky muskets?

1364
01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:19.400
O you leaden messengers,

1365
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:23.070
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,

1366
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:27.400
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,

1367
01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.900
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.

1368
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.430
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;

1369
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:36.200
Whoever charges on his forward breast,

1370
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.530
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;

1371
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:42.400
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause

1372
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.870
His death was so effected: better 'twere

1373
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.670
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd

1374
01:09:47.670 --> 01:09:50.630
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere

1375
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:52.970
That all the miseries which nature owes

1376
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:54.970
Were mine at once.

1377
01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:10.600
No, come thou home, Rousillon,

1378
01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:14.800
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,

1379
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:22.070
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;

1380
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:23.970
My being here it is that holds thee hence:

1381
01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:31.800
Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although

1382
01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.330
The air of paradise did fan the house

1383
01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:38.330
And angels officed all: I will be gone,

1384
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:41.030
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,

1385
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:42.700
To consolate thine ear.

1386
01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:50.100
Come, night; end, day!

1387
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:59.200
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

1388
01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.830
Alas! and would you take the letter from her?

1389
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:07.800
Might you not know she would do as she has done,

1390
01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.300
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

1391
01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:16.030
I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:

1392
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.630
Ambitious love hath so in me offended,

1393
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:21.800
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,

1394
01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.500
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.

1395
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:29.230
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war

1396
01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:33.000
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:

1397
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.570
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far

1398
01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:40.030
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:

1399
01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:43.000
He is too good and fair for death and me:

1400
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.470
Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

1401
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:51.930
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!

1402
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:54.100
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,

1403
01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.430
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,

1404
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:59.300
I could have well diverted her intents,

1405
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.900
Which thus she hath prevented.

1406
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.370
Pardon me, madam:

1407
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:04.170
If I had given you this at over-night,

1408
01:12:04.170 --> 01:12:07.370
She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,

1409
01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:09.870
Pursuit would be but vain.

1410
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.430
What angel shall

1411
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:17.600
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,

1412
01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.870
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear

1413
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:23.630
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath

1414
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:28.570
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,

1415
01:12:28.570 --> 01:12:31.100
To this unworthy husband of his wife;

1416
01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.670
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth

1417
01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:37.930
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.

1418
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.670
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.

1419
01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:44.900
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:

1420
01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:47.530
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,

1421
01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:51.870
He will return; and hope I may that she,

1422
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:55.100
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,

1423
01:12:55.100 --> 01:13:00.470
Led hither by pure love: which of them both

1424
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:04.400
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense

1425
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:08.300
To make distinction: provide this messenger:

1426
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:16.600
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;

1427
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:21.600
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

1428
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.770
They say the French count has done most honourable service.

1429
01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.870
It is reported that he has taken their greatest commander;

1430
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:44.300
and that with his own hand he slew the duke's brother.

1431
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.000
Well, Diana, take heed of this French earl:

1432
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.970
the honour of a maid is her name;

1433
01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.970
and no legacy is so rich as honesty.

1434
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:54.730
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited

1435
01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.670
by a gentleman his companion.

1436
01:13:56.670 --> 01:14:00.900
I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles:

1437
01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:03.170
a filthy officer he is in those suggestions

1438
01:14:03.170 --> 01:14:05.030
for the young earl.

1439
01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:07.900
Beware of them, Diana; their promises,

1440
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.470
enticements, oaths, tokens,

1441
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:12.430
and all these engines of lust,

1442
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:14.870
are not the things they go under:

1443
01:14:16.230 --> 01:14:18.830
many a maid hath been seduced by them;

1444
01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.070
and the misery is,

1445
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:24.870
example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood,

1446
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:27.900
cannot for all that dissuade succession,

1447
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.030
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them.

1448
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.900
I hope I need not to advise you further;

1449
01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.070
but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,

1450
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:42.370
though there were no further danger known

1451
01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.600
but the modesty which is so lost.

1452
01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.830
You shall not need to fear me.

1453
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:49.200
I hope so.

1454
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.570
Look, here comes a pilgrim:

1455
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:54.900
God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

1456
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.130
To Saint Jaques le Grand.

1457
01:14:56.130 --> 01:14:58.870
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

1458
01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.230
At the Saint Francis here

1459
01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.900
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,

1460
01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.270
But till the troops come by,

1461
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.470
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;

1462
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:08.930
The rather, for I think I know your hostess

1463
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:10.700
As ample as myself.

1464
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.670
Is it yourself?

1465
01:15:12.670 --> 01:15:15.030
If you shall please so, pilgrim.

1466
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:17.970
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

1467
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.500
You came, I think, from France?

1468
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:38.030
I did so.

1469
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.930
Here you shall see a countryman of yours

1470
01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:41.970
That has done worthy service.

1471
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:42.900
His name, I pray you.

1472
01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:46.970
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

1473
01:15:46.970 --> 01:15:49.230
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:

1474
01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:50.500
His face I know not.

1475
01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.500
Whatsome'er he is,

1476
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.430
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,

1477
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.230
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him

1478
01:15:56.230 --> 01:15:58.830
Against his liking: think you it is so?

1479
01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:02.270
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

1480
01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:04.970
There is a gentleman that serves the count

1481
01:16:04.970 --> 01:16:06.930
Reports but coarsely of her.

1482
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:07.870
What's his name?

1483
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:09.170
Monsieur Parolles.

1484
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:12.700
O, I believe with him,

1485
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.430
In argument of praise, or to the worth

1486
01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.170
Of the great count himself, she is too mean

1487
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:19.130
To have her name repeated: all her deserving

1488
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:21.000
Is a reserved honesty, and that

1489
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.900
I have not heard examined.

1490
01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.770
Alas, poor lady!

1491
01:16:26.770 --> 01:16:28.470
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife

1492
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.870
of a detesting lord.

1493
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:33.530
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,

1494
01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:36.870
Her heart weighs sadly:

1495
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:39.430
this young maid might do her a shrewd turn,

1496
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:41.100
if she so chose.

1497
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:43.400
How do you mean?

1498
01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.170
May be the amorous count solicits her

1499
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:48.830
In the unlawful purpose.

1500
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:52.530
He does indeed;

1501
01:16:52.530 --> 01:16:54.930
And brokes with all that can in such a suit

1502
01:16:54.930 --> 01:16:57.170
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:

1503
01:16:57.170 --> 01:17:00.770
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard

1504
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:02.300
In honestest defence.

1505
01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.730
The gods forbid else!

1506
01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:08.930
So, now they come:

1507
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:20.370
That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;

1508
01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:24.730
That, Escalus.

1509
01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:26.100
Which is the Frenchman?

1510
01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.030
He; That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.

1511
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:32.400
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester

1512
01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.400
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

1513
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.870
I like him well.

1514
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:38.530
'Tis pity he is not honest:

1515
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:41.730
yond's that same knave

1516
01:17:41.730 --> 01:17:44.470
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,

1517
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:46.330
I would Poison that vile rascal.

1518
01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:47.170
Which is he?

1519
01:17:47.170 --> 01:17:51.170
That jack-an-apes with scarfs:

1520
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:52.530
why is he melancholy?

1521
01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:54.170
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

1522
01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.700
Lose our drum! well.

1523
01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:59.830
He's shrewdly vexed at something:

1524
01:17:59.830 --> 01:18:01.730
look, he has spied us.

1525
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:04.530
Marry, hang you!

1526
01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:08.370
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

1527
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:20.930
The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you

1528
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.000
Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents

1529
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.300
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,

1530
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.300
Already at my house.

1531
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.000
I humbly thank you:

1532
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.100
Please it this matron and this gentle maid

1533
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:33.500
To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking

1534
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.730
Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,

1535
01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:39.170
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin

1536
01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.470
Worthy the note.

1537
01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:43.700
We'll take your offer kindly.

1538
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:49.170
Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way.

1539
01:18:49.170 --> 01:18:50.870
If your lordship find him not a hilding,

1540
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:52.900
hold me no more in your respect.

1541
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:55.300
On my life, my lord, a bubble.

1542
01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.670
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

1543
01:18:57.670 --> 01:19:00.400
Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,

1544
01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:03.270
without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman,

1545
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:05.130
he's a most notable coward,

1546
01:19:05.130 --> 01:19:07.070
an infinite and endless liar,

1547
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:08.570
an hourly promise-breaker,

1548
01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:10.230
the owner of no one good quality

1549
01:19:10.230 --> 01:19:12.170
worthy your lordship's entertainment.

1550
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:13.600
It were fit you knew him;

1551
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.000
lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not,

1552
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.870
he might at some great and trusty business

1553
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:22.030
in a main danger fail you.

1554
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:24.970
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

1555
01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:28.770
None better than to let him fetch off his drum,

1556
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:31.200
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.

1557
01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:34.200
I, with a troop of Florentines,

1558
01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.800
will suddenly surprise him;

1559
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.230
such I will have, whom I am sure

1560
01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:39.270
he knows not from the enemy:

1561
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.100
we will bind and hoodwink him

1562
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.970
so, that he shall suppose no other but that

1563
01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:45.530
he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries,

1564
01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:48.530
when we bring him to our own tents.

1565
01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.830
Be but your lordship present at his examination:

1566
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.330
if he do not, for the promise of his life

1567
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.270
and in the highest compulsion of base fear,

1568
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:56.600
offer to betray you

1569
01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.800
and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you,

1570
01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.770
and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath,

1571
01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:03.770
never trust my judgment in any thing.

1572
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:07.100
O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;

1573
01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:09.530
he says he has a stratagem for't:

1574
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:12.000
when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't,

1575
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.100
and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore

1576
01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.100
will be melted,

1577
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.970
if you give him not John Drum's entertainment,

1578
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:20.470
your inclining cannot be removed.

1579
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:21.400
Here he comes.

1580
01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.700
O, for the love of laughter,

1581
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.500
hinder not the honour of his design:

1582
01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:26.030
let him fetch off his drum in any hand.

1583
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:47.630
How now, monsieur!

1584
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:50.330
this drum sticks sorely in your disposition.

1585
01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:54.230
A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

1586
01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:58.500
'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!

1587
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.070
There was excellent command,

1588
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:02.470
to charge in with our horse upon our own wings,

1589
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:04.430
and to rend our own soldiers!

1590
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:07.600
That was not to be blamed in the command of the service:

1591
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.130
it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself

1592
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:12.430
could not have prevented, if he had been there to command.

1593
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:15.870
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success:

1594
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:18.900
some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum;

1595
01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:21.230
but it is not to be recovered.

1596
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:22.470
It might have been recovered.

1597
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:24.830
It might; but it is not now.

1598
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:26.900
It is to be recovered:

1599
01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:29.300
but that the merit of service is seldom attributed

1600
01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:30.600
to the true and exact performer,

1601
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.770
I would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.'

1602
01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:39.470
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur:

1603
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:41.170
if you think your mystery in stratagem

1604
01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:43.200
can bring this instrument of honour again

1605
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:45.030
into his native quarter,

1606
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:48.030
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on;

1607
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:52.630
I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit:

1608
01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:56.900
if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it

1609
01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.270
and extend to you what further becomes his greatness,

1610
01:21:59.270 --> 01:22:01.670
even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness.

1611
01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:06.500
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

1612
01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:09.630
But you must not now slumber in it.

1613
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:11.500
I'll about it this evening:

1614
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.600
and I will presently pen down my dilemmas,

1615
01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.300
encourage myself in my certainty,

1616
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.070
put myself into my mortal preparation;

1617
01:22:17.070 --> 01:22:19.570
and by midnight look to hear further from me.

1618
01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.700
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

1619
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.800
I know not what the success will be, my lord;

1620
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.000
but the attempt I vow.

1621
01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:30.900
I know thou'rt valiant;

1622
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:33.330
and, to the possibility of thy soldiership,

1623
01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:34.300
will subscribe for thee.

1624
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.530
Farewell.

1625
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:39.070
I love not many words.

1626
01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.530
No more than a fish loves water.

1627
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:48.930
Is not this a strange fellow, my lord,

1628
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:51.730
that so confidently seems to undertake this business,

1629
01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:54.530
which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do

1630
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:56.400
and dares better be damned than to do't?

1631
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.570
You do not know him, my lord, as we do:

1632
01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:00.170
certain it is that he will steal himself

1633
01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:01.470
into a man's favour

1634
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:04.370
and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries;

1635
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:07.000
but when you find him out, you have him ever after.

1636
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.900
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all

1637
01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:11.200
of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

1638
01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.830
None in the world; but return with an invention

1639
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:18.100
and clap upon you two or three probable lies:

1640
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:19.700
but we have almost embossed him;

1641
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:20.970
you shall see his fall to-night;

1642
01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:23.430
for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

1643
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:25.070
We'll make you some sport with the fox

1644
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:26.370
ere we case him.

1645
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:28.800
He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:

1646
01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.700
when his disguise and he is parted,

1647
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:33.370
you tell me what a sprat you shall find him;

1648
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:35.230
which you shall see this very night.

1649
01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:39.530
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

1650
01:23:40.570 --> 01:23:42.070
Your brother he shall go along with me.

1651
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:44.230
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

1652
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:54.070
Now will I lead you to the house,

1653
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.400
and show you The lass I spoke of.

1654
01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.030
But you say she's honest.

1655
01:23:58.030 --> 01:24:02.270
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once

1656
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:06.370
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,

1657
01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:08.700
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,

1658
01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:11.370
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;

1659
01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:12.770
And this is all I have done.

1660
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:23.330
She's a fair creature:

1661
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:24.830
Will you go see her?

1662
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:26.570
With all my heart, my lord.

1663
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:29.700
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,

1664
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:31.730
I know not how I shall assure you further,

1665
01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:33.630
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

1666
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:39.130
Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,

1667
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:41.900
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;

1668
01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.400
And would not put my reputation now

1669
01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.530
In any staining act.

1670
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:47.030
Nor would I wish you.

1671
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:50.070
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,

1672
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:52.000
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken

1673
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.100
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,

1674
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:57.170
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,

1675
01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:58.830
Err in bestowing it.

1676
01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:00.630
I should believe you:

1677
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.770
For you have show'd me that which well approves

1678
01:25:02.770 --> 01:25:05.800
You're great in fortune.

1679
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:11.270
Take this purse of gold,

1680
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:14.200
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,

1681
01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.230
Which I will over-pay and pay again

1682
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:17.230
when I have found it.

1683
01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:23.230
The count he wooes your daughter,

1684
01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:25.970
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,

1685
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:28.030
Resolved to carry her:

1686
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:30.530
let her in fine consent,

1687
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:33.530
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.

1688
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:36.170
Now his important blood will nought deny

1689
01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:40.170
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,

1690
01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:42.000
That downward hath succeeded in his house

1691
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.370
From son to son, some four or five descents

1692
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:47.600
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds

1693
01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.570
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,

1694
01:25:51.570 --> 01:25:54.670
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,

1695
01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:57.330
Howe'er repented after.

1696
01:25:57.330 --> 01:25:58.230
Now I see

1697
01:25:58.230 --> 01:25:59.900
The bottom of your purpose.

1698
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:03.000
You see it lawful, then: it is no more,

1699
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.400
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,

1700
01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:09.770
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;

1701
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:13.970
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,

1702
01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:17.300
Herself most chastely absent:

1703
01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:24.830
after this,

1704
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:28.500
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns

1705
01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.900
To what is passed already.

1706
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.200
I have yielded:

1707
01:26:41.970 --> 01:26:43.970
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,

1708
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:47.130
That time and place with this deceit so lawful

1709
01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:51.470
May prove coherent. Every night he comes

1710
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:54.230
With musics of all sorts and songs composed

1711
01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:57.200
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us

1712
01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.230
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists

1713
01:26:59.230 --> 01:27:01.400
As if his life lay on't.

1714
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:02.630
Why then to-night

1715
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:06.070
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,

1716
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:09.230
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed

1717
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:13.200
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,

1718
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.200
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:

1719
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:22.970
But let's about it.

1720
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.200
When you sally upon him,

1721
01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.370
speak what terrible language you will:

1722
01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.230
though you understand it not yourselves, no matter;

1723
01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:35.700
for we must not seem to understand him,

1724
01:27:35.700 --> 01:27:37.770
unless some one among us

1725
01:27:37.770 --> 01:27:39.630
whom we must produce for an interpreter.

1726
01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:42.530
Good captain, let me be the interpreter.

1727
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:44.200
Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?

1728
01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.830
No, sir, I warrant you.

1729
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:49.830
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?

1730
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:54.130
E'en such as you speak to me.

1731
01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:55.730
He must think us some band of strangers

1732
01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:57.500
i' the adversary's entertainment.

1733
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.670
Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages;

1734
01:28:00.670 --> 01:28:03.630
therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy,

1735
01:28:03.630 --> 01:28:05.330
not to know what we speak one to another;

1736
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:09.200
that we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose:

1737
01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:20.570
choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough.

1738
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:24.470
As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic.

1739
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:26.470
But couch, ho!

1740
01:28:33.030 --> 01:28:34.300
here he comes,

1741
01:28:34.930 --> 01:28:37.100
to beguile two hours in a sleep,

1742
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:39.630
and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

1743
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:08.430
Ten o'clock: within these three hours

1744
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:10.670
'twill be time enough to go home.

1745
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:16.730
What shall I say I have done?

1746
01:29:16.730 --> 01:29:19.170
It must be a very plausive invention that carries it:

1747
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.730
they begin to smoke me;

1748
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:24.770
and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door.

1749
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:27.300
I find my tongue is too foolhardy;

1750
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.300
but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it

1751
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.730
not daring the reports of my tongue.

1752
01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:32.670
This is the first truth

1753
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:33.930
that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of.

1754
01:29:33.930 --> 01:29:36.370
What the devil should move me to undertake

1755
01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:37.970
the recovery of this drum,

1756
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:39.930
being not ignorant of the impossibility,

1757
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:42.930
and knowing I had no such purpose?

1758
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:46.170
Is it possible he should know what he is,

1759
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.270
and be that he is?

1760
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:49.930
I would I had any drum of the enemy's:

1761
01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:51.870
I would swear I recovered it.

1762
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:53.370
You shall hear one anon.

1763
01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:56.730
(drummng sounds)

1764
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:58.500
A drum now of the enemy's,--

1765
01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:02.000
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.

1766
01:30:10.770 --> 01:30:12.370
Boskos thromuldo boskos.

1767
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:15.200
I know you are the Muskos' regiment:

1768
01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.430
And I shall lose my life for want of language;

1769
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:19.470
If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,

1770
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:21.370
Italian, or French, let him speak to me;

1771
01:30:21.370 --> 01:30:23.730
I'll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

1772
01:30:23.730 --> 01:30:26.500
Boskos vauvado:

1773
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:29.100
I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue.

1774
01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:32.870
Kerely bonto,

1775
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:34.730
Manka revania dulche.

1776
01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:38.200
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

1777
01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.070
The general is content to spare thee yet;

1778
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:42.000
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on

1779
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.100
To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform

1780
01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.900
Something to save thy life.

1781
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:47.970
O, let me live!

1782
01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:51.000
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,

1783
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.370
Their force, their purposes; nay,

1784
01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:55.900
I'll speak that which you will wonder at.

1785
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:01.170
They told me that your name was Fontibell.

1786
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:05.130
No, my good lord, Diana.

1787
01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.300
Titled goddess;

1788
01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:10.830
And worth it, with addition!

1789
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:15.930
But, fair soul,

1790
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:19.030
In your fine frame hath love no quality?

1791
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:23.270
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,

1792
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:26.330
You are no maiden, but a monument:

1793
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:27.200
When you are dead,

1794
01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.730
you should be such a one as you are now,

1795
01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:33.930
for you are cold and stem;

1796
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:36.300
And now you should be as your mother was

1797
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.470
When your sweet self was got.

1798
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:39.730
She then was honest.

1799
01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:40.800
So should you be.

1800
01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.000
No:

1801
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.570
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,

1802
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:46.500
As you owe to your wife.

1803
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.670
No more o' that;

1804
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:57.170
I prithee, do not strive against my vows:

1805
01:31:57.170 --> 01:31:58.600
I was compell'd to her;

1806
01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:05.630
but I love thee by love's own sweet constraint,

1807
01:32:05.630 --> 01:32:08.730
and will for ever do thee all rights of service.

1808
01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:13.400
Ay, so you serve us till we serve you;

1809
01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:14.700
but when you have our roses,

1810
01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:17.300
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves

1811
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.070
And mock us with our bareness.

1812
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.370
How have I sworn!

1813
01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:22.500
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,

1814
01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:26.600
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.

1815
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.600
What is not holy, that we swear not by,

1816
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.470
But take the High'st to witness:

1817
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:34.100
then, pray you, tell me,

1818
01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.730
If I should swear by God's great attributes,

1819
01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:40.030
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,

1820
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:45.270
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,

1821
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:47.430
To swear by him whom I protest to love,

1822
01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:52.300
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths

1823
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:58.300
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,

1824
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:06.000
At least in my opinion.

1825
01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:12.430
Change it, change it;

1826
01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:20.530
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;

1827
01:33:20.530 --> 01:33:22.200
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts

1828
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.200
that you do charge men with.

1829
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:28.670
Stand no more off,

1830
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:32.300
But give thyself unto my sick desires,

1831
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:38.070
Who then recover: say thou art mine,

1832
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:42.900
and ever my love as it begins shall so persever.

1833
01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:50.470
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre

1834
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:53.470
That we'll forsake ourselves.

1835
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:06.100
Give me that ring.

1836
01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:15.130
I'll lend it thee, my dear;

1837
01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:18.230
but have no power to give it from me.

1838
01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:19.370
Will you not, my lord?

1839
01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.900
It is an honour 'longing to our house,

1840
01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:26.170
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;

1841
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:27.900
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world

1842
01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:29.030
In me to lose.

1843
01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:32.300
Mine honour's such a ring:

1844
01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:34.470
My chastity's the jewel of our house,

1845
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:36.630
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;

1846
01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:38.600
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world

1847
01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.170
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom

1848
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:46.070
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,

1849
01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.570
Against your vain assault.

1850
01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.270
Here, take my ring:

1851
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:13.770
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,

1852
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.300
And I'll be bid by thee.

1853
01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:26.470
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:

1854
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:28.870
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.

1855
01:35:30.370 --> 01:35:33.430
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,

1856
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:35.370
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,

1857
01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:38.670
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:

1858
01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:40.970
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them

1859
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:43.000
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:

1860
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:47.770
And on your finger in the night

1861
01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:51.670
I'll put a nother ring, that what in time proceeds

1862
01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:55.100
May token to the future our past deeds.

1863
01:35:57.100 --> 01:36:00.330
Adieu, till then; then, fail not.

1864
01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:03.470
You have won a wife of me,

1865
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:05.330
though there my hope be done.

1866
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:09.430
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

1867
01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:22.470
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!

1868
01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:25.870
You may so in the end.

1869
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:33.700
My mother told me just how he would woo,

1870
01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:37.470
As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men

1871
01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:39.330
Have the like oaths:

1872
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:44.130
he had sworn to marry me when his wife's dead;

1873
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:49.070
Therefore I'll lie with him when I am buried.

1874
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:57.130
Since Frenchmen are so braid,

1875
01:36:57.130 --> 01:37:02.500
Marry that will, I live and die a maid:

1876
01:37:06.970 --> 01:37:09.930
Only in this disguise I think't no sin

1877
01:37:09.930 --> 01:37:13.000
To cozen him that would unjustly win.

1878
01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.400
You have not given him his mother's letter?

1879
01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.530
I have delivered it an hour since:

1880
01:37:22.530 --> 01:37:24.700
there is something in't that stings his nature;

1881
01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.430
for on the reading it he changed almost into another man.

1882
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:29.730
He has much worthy blame laid upon him

1883
01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:32.730
for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.

1884
01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:34.500
Especially he hath incurred

1885
01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.330
the everlasting displeasure of the king,

1886
01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:39.300
who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him.

1887
01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:43.100
I will tell you a thing,

1888
01:37:43.100 --> 01:37:45.200
but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.

1889
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:48.800
When you have spoken it, 'tis dead,

1890
01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.130
and I am the grave of it.

1891
01:37:51.130 --> 01:37:53.670
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence,

1892
01:37:53.670 --> 01:37:55.000
of a most chaste renown;

1893
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.570
and this night he fleshes his will

1894
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.170
in the spoil of her honour:

1895
01:37:58.170 --> 01:37:59.800
he hath given her his monumental ring,

1896
01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.400
and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.

1897
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:07.270
Now, God delay our rebellion!

1898
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:10.700
as we are ourselves, what things are we!

1899
01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.630
Merely our own traitors.

1900
01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:14.600
And as in the common course of all treasons,

1901
01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.400
we still see them reveal themselves,

1902
01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.070
till they attain to their abhorred ends,

1903
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:20.700
so he that in this action contrives

1904
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.170
against his own nobility,

1905
01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:24.400
in his proper stream o'erflows himself.

1906
01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:26.970
Is it not meant damnable in us,

1907
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:30.830
to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents?

1908
01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:34.900
We shall not then have his company to-night?

1909
01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:38.570
Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.

1910
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:40.100
That approaches apace;

1911
01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.670
I would gladly have him see his company anatomized,

1912
01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:48.970
that he might take a measure of his own judgments,

1913
01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:51.470
wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.

1914
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:53.430
We will not meddle with him till he come;

1915
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:56.170
for his presence must be the whip of the other.

1916
01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:59.670
In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?

1917
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:01.570
I hear there is an overture of peace.

1918
01:39:01.570 --> 01:39:05.430
Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

1919
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:09.770
What will Count Rousillon do then?

1920
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:12.000
will he travel higher, or return again into France?

1921
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.370
I perceive, by this demand,

1922
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:15.830
you are not altogether of his council.

1923
01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.030
Let it be forbid, sir;

1924
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:19.870
so should I be a great deal of his act.

1925
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:23.900
Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house:

1926
01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.370
her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;

1927
01:39:27.370 --> 01:39:28.400
which holy undertaking

1928
01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.800
with most austere sanctimony she accomplished;

1929
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.070
and, there residing the tenderness of her nature

1930
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:36.130
became as a prey to her grief;

1931
01:39:36.130 --> 01:39:39.370
in fine, made a groan of her last breath,

1932
01:39:39.370 --> 01:39:42.500
and now she sings in heaven.

1933
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.630
How is this justified?

1934
01:39:43.630 --> 01:39:45.300
The stronger part of it by her own letters,

1935
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.400
which makes her story true,

1936
01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:49.700
even to the point of her death: her death itself,

1937
01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:51.570
which could not be her office to say is come,

1938
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:54.130
was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place.

1939
01:39:54.130 --> 01:39:55.600
Hath the count all this intelligence?

1940
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.430
Ay, and the particular confirmations,

1941
01:39:57.430 --> 01:40:01.400
point from point, so to the full arming of the verity.

1942
01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:04.670
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.

1943
01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:08.700
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!

1944
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.070
And how mightily some other times

1945
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:12.100
we drown our gain in tears!

1946
01:40:12.830 --> 01:40:16.400
The great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him

1947
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.130
shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.

1948
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:24.530
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn,

1949
01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:27.700
good and ill together:

1950
01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:28.800
our virtues would be proud,

1951
01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.930
if our faults whipped them not;

1952
01:40:31.930 --> 01:40:33.300
and our crimes would despair,

1953
01:40:33.300 --> 01:40:35.500
if they were not cherished by our virtues.

1954
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:45.430
How now my lord ! it's not after midnight?

1955
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:47.730
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses,

1956
01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:50.130
a month's length a-piece,

1957
01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:51.400
I have congied with the duke,

1958
01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:54.000
done my adieu with his nearest;

1959
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.070
buried a wife, mourned for her;

1960
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:58.770
writ to my lady mother I am returning;

1961
01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:00.970
entertained my convoy;

1962
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.470
and between these main parcels of dispatch

1963
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:05.600
effected many nicer needs;

1964
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:09.130
the last was the greatest,

1965
01:41:10.170 --> 01:41:11.770
but that I have not ended yet.

1966
01:41:11.770 --> 01:41:13.670
If the business be of any difficulty,

1967
01:41:13.670 --> 01:41:15.370
and this morning your departure hence,

1968
01:41:15.370 --> 01:41:17.430
it requires haste of your lordship.

1969
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:19.000
I mean, the business is not ended,

1970
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.770
as fearing to hear of it hereafter.

1971
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.270
But shall we have this dialogue

1972
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:27.230
between the fool and the soldier?

1973
01:41:27.230 --> 01:41:29.170
Come, bring forth this counterfeit module,

1974
01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:31.600
he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

1975
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.200
Bring him forth:

1976
01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:36.330
has sat i' the stocks all night, poor gallant knave.

1977
01:41:36.330 --> 01:41:37.830
No matter: his heels have deserved it,

1978
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:40.100
in usurping his spurs so long.

1979
01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:41.270
How does he carry himself?

1980
01:41:41.270 --> 01:41:42.530
I have told your lordship already,

1981
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:44.730
the stocks carry him.

1982
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:49.800
But to answer you as you would be understood;

1983
01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:52.800
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk:

1984
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.930
he hath confessed himself to Morgan,

1985
01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:57.030
whom he supposes to be a friar,

1986
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:58.430
from the time of his remembrance

1987
01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:02.330
to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks:

1988
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:04.530
and what think you he hath confessed?

1989
01:42:04.530 --> 01:42:06.430
Nothing of me, has a'?

1990
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:07.670
His confession is taken,

1991
01:42:07.670 --> 01:42:09.430
and it shall be read to his face:

1992
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:11.600
if your lordship be in't, as I believe you are,

1993
01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.070
you must have the patience to hear it.

1994
01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.100
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me:

1995
01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.900
hush, hush!

1996
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:21.400
Hoodman comes!

1997
01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:25.370
Portotartarosa

1998
01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:27.930
He calls for the tortures:

1999
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:28.970
what will you say without 'em?

2000
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:32.700
I will confess what I know without constraint:

2001
01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:35.270
if ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

2002
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:38.500
Bosko chimurcho.

2003
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.870
Boblibindo chicurmurco.

2004
01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:46.070
You are a merciful general.

2005
01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:48.000
Our general bids you answer

2006
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.830
to what I shall ask you out of a note.

2007
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.030
And truly, as I hope to live.

2008
01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:55.900
First demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.'

2009
01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:57.330
What say you to that?

2010
01:42:57.330 --> 01:43:00.970
Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable:

2011
01:43:00.970 --> 01:43:02.170
the troops are all scattered,

2012
01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:03.600
and the commanders very poor rogues,

2013
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.230
upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to live.

2014
01:43:06.230 --> 01:43:07.430
Shall I set down your answer so?

2015
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:09.600
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't,

2016
01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.270
how and which way you will.

2017
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:15.670
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

2018
01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:18.630
You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur Parolles,

2019
01:43:18.630 --> 01:43:21.500
the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,

2020
01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:23.570
that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf,

2021
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:25.400
and the practise in the chape of his dagger.

2022
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.730
I will never trust a man again

2023
01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:28.130
for keeping his sword clean.

2024
01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:29.670
nor believe he can have every thing in him

2025
01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:31.630
by wearing his apparel neatly.

2026
01:43:31.630 --> 01:43:33.500
Well, that's set down.

2027
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.030
Five or six thousand horse, I said

2028
01:43:36.030 --> 01:43:38.400
I will say true,or thereabouts,

2029
01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.200
set down, for I'll speak truth.

2030
01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.000
He's very near the truth in this.

2031
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.400
But I con him no thanks for't,

2032
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.730
in the nature he delivers it.

2033
01:43:44.730 --> 01:43:47.070
'Demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.'

2034
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:47.900
What say you to that?

2035
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:49.130
By my troth, sir,

2036
01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:51.130
if I were to live this present hour, I will tell true.

2037
01:43:51.130 --> 01:43:54.370
Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;

2038
01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:57.700
Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many;

2039
01:43:57.700 --> 01:43:59.500
Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii,

2040
01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.630
two hundred and fifty each;

2041
01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:02.100
mine own company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii,

2042
01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:04.200
two hundred and fifty each: so that the muster-file,

2043
01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.600
rotten and sound, upon my life,

2044
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.130
amounts not to fifteen thousand poll;

2045
01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:11.100
half of the which dare not shake snow

2046
01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:12.070
from off their cassocks,

2047
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:13.930
lest they shake themselves to pieces.

2048
01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:15.930
What shall be done to him?

2049
01:44:15.930 --> 01:44:18.900
Nothing, but let him have thanks.

2050
01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:23.630
Bollybingo agranoche

2051
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:25.570
Demand of him my condition,

2052
01:44:25.570 --> 01:44:30.630
and what credit I have with the duke.

2053
01:44:30.630 --> 01:44:32.430
Well, that's set down.

2054
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:33.370
'You shall demand of him,

2055
01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:35.970
whether one Captain Dumain be i' the camp,

2056
01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:38.630
a Frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke;

2057
01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:42.070
what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars;

2058
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:43.970
or whether he thinks it were not possible,

2059
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:46.130
with well-weighing sums of gold,

2060
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:48.400
to corrupt him to revolt.'

2061
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.800
What say you to this? what do you know of it?

2062
01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.930
I beseech you,

2063
01:44:51.930 --> 01:44:53.830
let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories:

2064
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:55.170
demand them singly.

2065
01:44:56.500 --> 01:45:00.470
Do you know this Captain Dumain?

2066
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:03.730
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,

2067
01:45:03.730 --> 01:45:04.670
from whence he was whipped

2068
01:45:04.670 --> 01:45:06.670
for getting the shrieve's fool with child,

2069
01:45:06.670 --> 01:45:09.200
a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay.

2070
01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.200
Nay, stay! Hold your hands, by your leave,

2071
01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:14.070
Though I know his brains

2072
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:16.430
are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

2073
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:20.100
Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?

2074
01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:24.600
Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

2075
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:28.130
Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon.

2076
01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:30.270
What is his reputation with the duke?

2077
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:35.500
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine;

2078
01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.130
and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band:

2079
01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:40.100
I think I have his letter in my pocket.

2080
01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.270
Marry, we'll search.

2081
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:43.230
In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,

2082
01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:44.270
or it is upon a file

2083
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:46.300
with the duke's other letters in my tent.

2084
01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:49.830
Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?

2085
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:53.130
I do not know if it be it or no.

2086
01:45:53.130 --> 01:45:54.600
Our interpreter does it well.

2087
01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.370
Excellently.

2088
01:45:56.370 --> 01:46:00.530
'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--

2089
01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:02.200
That is not the duke's letter, sir;

2090
01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.430
that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence,

2091
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:05.570
one Diana,

2092
01:46:05.570 --> 01:46:07.800
to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon,

2093
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.530
a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish:

2094
01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:11.930
I pray you, sir, put it up again.

2095
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:13.500
Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.

2096
01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.630
My meaning in't,

2097
01:46:14.630 --> 01:46:16.100
I protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid;

2098
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:17.070
for I knew the young count

2099
01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.700
to be a dangerous and lascivious boy,

2100
01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:19.870
who is a whale to virginity

2101
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:22.300
and devours up all the fry it finds.

2102
01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:24.530
Damnable both-sides rogue!

2103
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:29.000
'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;

2104
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:32.230
After he scores, he never pays the score:

2105
01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:37.600
Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;

2106
01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:41.030
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;

2107
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:44.670
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,

2108
01:46:44.670 --> 01:46:50.130
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:

2109
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:52.530
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,

2110
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:55.500
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.

2111
01:46:55.500 --> 01:47:02.870
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, Parolles.'

2112
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:04.030
He shall be whipped through the army

2113
01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:06.530
with this rhyme in's forehead.

2114
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:13.530
This is your devoted friend, sir,

2115
01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:16.770
the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier.

2116
01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:19.570
I could endure any thing before but a cat,

2117
01:47:19.570 --> 01:47:21.630
and now he's a cat to me.

2118
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:23.000
I perceive, sir, by the general's looks,

2119
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.030
we shall be fain to hang you.

2120
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:29.770
My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to die;

2121
01:47:29.770 --> 01:47:31.600
but that, my offences being many,

2122
01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:34.230
I would repent out the remainder of nature:

2123
01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:36.470
let me live, sir, in a dungeon,

2124
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:37.900
i' the stocks, or any where,

2125
01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.870
so I may live.

2126
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:44.470
We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;

2127
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:48.870
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain:

2128
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:52.230
what is his honesty?

2129
01:47:52.230 --> 01:47:55.330
he will lie, sir, with such volubility,

2130
01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.770
that you would think truth were a fool:

2131
01:47:57.770 --> 01:48:00.470
What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?

2132
01:48:00.470 --> 01:48:01.400
Why does be ask him of me?

2133
01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:02.870
What's he?

2134
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:05.200
E'en a crow o' the same nest;

2135
01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:07.470
he excels his brother for a coward,

2136
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:10.800
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:

2137
01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:14.470
If your life be saved,

2138
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:17.370
will you undertake to betray the Florentine?

2139
01:48:17.370 --> 01:48:21.370
Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.

2140
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:27.100
I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.

2141
01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:34.930
I'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums!

2142
01:48:34.930 --> 01:48:36.770
Only to seem to deserve well,

2143
01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:37.930
and to beguile the supposition

2144
01:48:37.930 --> 01:48:39.230
of that lascivious young boy

2145
01:48:39.230 --> 01:48:42.330
the count, have I run into this danger.

2146
01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:44.070
Yet who would have suspected an ambush

2147
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:46.100
where I was taken?

2148
01:48:50.630 --> 01:48:54.470
There is no remedy, sir, but you must die:

2149
01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:57.070
the general says, you that have so traitorously

2150
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:59.270
discovered the secrets of your army and made such

2151
01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:02.700
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held,

2152
01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:06.330
can serve the world for no honest use;

2153
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:08.600
therefore you must die.

2154
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:40.730
Come, headsman, off with his head.

2155
01:49:55.870 --> 01:50:01.730
O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!

2156
01:50:01.730 --> 01:50:06.570
That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.

2157
01:50:06.570 --> 01:50:10.470
look about you: know you any here?

2158
01:50:14.070 --> 01:50:15.630
Good morrow, noble captain.

2159
01:50:19.330 --> 01:50:21.470
God bless you, Captain Parolles.

2160
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:24.330
God save you, noble captain.

2161
01:50:24.330 --> 01:50:28.000
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?

2162
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.100
I am for France.

2163
01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:31.830
Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet

2164
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:35.430
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?

2165
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:39.900
an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:

2166
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:40.970
but fare you well.

2167
01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:52.970
You are undone, captain, all but your scarf;

2168
01:50:52.970 --> 01:50:54.630
that has a knot on't yet

2169
01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:57.600
Who cannot be crushed with a plot?

2170
01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:58.770
If you could find out a country

2171
01:50:58.770 --> 01:51:01.970
where but women were that had received so much shame,

2172
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:04.870
you might begin an impudent nation.

2173
01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:09.200
Fare ye well, sir; I am for France too:

2174
01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:11.030
we shall speak of you there.

2175
01:51:21.670 --> 01:51:25.870
Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,

2176
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:34.600
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;

2177
01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.770
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft

2178
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:40.700
As captain shall: simply the thing I am

2179
01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:44.200
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,

2180
01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.270
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass

2181
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:49.930
that every braggart shall be found an ass.

2182
01:51:49.930 --> 01:51:53.800
Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live

2183
01:51:53.800 --> 01:52:00.870
Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!

2184
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:07.270
There's place and means for every man alive.

2185
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:08.730
I'll after them.

2186
01:52:09.930 --> 01:52:12.500
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,

2187
01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:14.070
One of the greatest in the Christian world

2188
01:52:14.070 --> 01:52:17.200
Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,

2189
01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:20.230
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:

2190
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:23.700
Time was, I did him a desired office,

2191
01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.870
Dear almost as his life

2192
01:52:28.970 --> 01:52:31.900
You must know I am supposed dead:

2193
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:35.130
the army breaking,

2194
01:52:35.130 --> 01:52:37.800
My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,

2195
01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.500
And by the leave of my good lord the king,

2196
01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.770
We'll be before our welcome.

2197
01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:42.670
Gentle madam,

2198
01:52:42.670 --> 01:52:44.300
You never had a servant to whose trust

2199
01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.170
Your business was more welcome.

2200
01:52:46.170 --> 01:52:47.200
Nor you, mistress,

2201
01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:48.970
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour

2202
01:52:48.970 --> 01:52:52.100
To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven

2203
01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:54.800
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,

2204
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:57.100
As it hath fated her to be my motive

2205
01:52:57.100 --> 01:53:02.070
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!

2206
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:05.500
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,

2207
01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:10.130
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,

2208
01:53:10.130 --> 01:53:12.400
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer

2209
01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.830
Something in my behalf.

2210
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:15.030
Let death and honesty

2211
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:17.900
Go with your impositions, I am yours

2212
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:20.530
Upon your will to suffer.

2213
01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:23.300
Yet, I pray you:

2214
01:53:25.700 --> 01:53:30.000
But with the word the time will bring on summer,

2215
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.330
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,

2216
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:38.300
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;

2217
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.930
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:

2218
01:53:57.830 --> 01:54:04.830
All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;

2219
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:09.430
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

2220
01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:15.130
No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta

2221
01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:17.870
fellow there, whose villanous saffron

2222
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:19.730
would have made all the unbaked and doughy youth

2223
01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:22.500
of a nation in his colour:

2224
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:25.030
your daughter-in-law had been alive at this hour,

2225
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:26.570
and your son here at home,

2226
01:54:26.570 --> 01:54:28.000
more advanced by the king

2227
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.030
than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

2228
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.230
I would I had not known him;

2229
01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:35.300
it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman

2230
01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:38.170
that ever nature had praise for creating.

2231
01:54:38.170 --> 01:54:40.900
If she had partaken of my flesh,

2232
01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:42.670
and cost me the dearest groans of a mother,

2233
01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:46.000
I could not have owed her a more rooted love.

2234
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.600
'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady:

2235
01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.100
we may pick a thousand salads

2236
01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.830
ere we light on such another herb.

2237
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:56.130
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the salad,

2238
01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:57.700
or rather, the herb of grace.

2239
01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:00.470
They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.

2240
01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:02.100
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir;

2241
01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.770
I have not much skill in grass.

2242
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:06.300
Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?

2243
01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:08.170
A fool, sir, at a woman's service,

2244
01:55:08.170 --> 01:55:09.970
and a knave at a man's.

2245
01:55:09.970 --> 01:55:11.070
Your distinction?

2246
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:14.100
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.

2247
01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:17.330
So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

2248
01:55:17.330 --> 01:55:20.670
And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.

2249
01:55:20.670 --> 01:55:23.700
I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.

2250
01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:24.700
At your service.

2251
01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:26.270
No, no, no.

2252
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:28.930
Why, sir, if I cannot serve you,

2253
01:55:28.930 --> 01:55:32.570
I can serve as great a prince as you are.

2254
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:34.530
What prince is that?

2255
01:55:34.530 --> 01:55:36.530
The black prince, sir; alias,

2256
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:42.570
the prince of darkness; alias, the devil.

2257
01:55:42.570 --> 01:55:46.600
Hold thee, there's my purse:

2258
01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.300
I give thee not this to suggest thee

2259
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.630
from thy master thou talkest of;

2260
01:55:50.630 --> 01:55:52.670
serve him still.

2261
01:55:52.670 --> 01:55:54.830
I am a woodland fellow, sir,

2262
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:58.100
that always loved a great fire;

2263
01:55:58.100 --> 01:56:01.630
and the master I speak of ever keeps a good fire.

2264
01:56:01.630 --> 01:56:05.100
But, sure, he is the prince of the world;

2265
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:08.570
let his nobility remain in's court.

2266
01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:11.500
I am for the house with the narrow gate,

2267
01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:15.170
which I take to be.too little for pomp to enter:

2268
01:56:15.170 --> 01:56:18.930
some that humble themselves may;

2269
01:56:18.930 --> 01:56:22.200
but the many will be too chill and tender,

2270
01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:24.770
and they'll be for the flowery way

2271
01:56:24.770 --> 01:56:29.330
that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.

2272
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:38.770
A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

2273
01:56:38.770 --> 01:56:40.770
So he is.

2274
01:56:40.770 --> 01:56:44.200
My late lord that's gone made himself much sport out of him:

2275
01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:46.130
by his authority he remains here,

2276
01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:49.270
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness;

2277
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:51.730
and, indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.

2278
01:56:51.730 --> 01:56:54.830
I like him well; 'tis not amiss.

2279
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:58.030
And I was about to tell you,

2280
01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:02.030
since I heard of the good lady's death

2281
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:05.130
and that my lord your son was upon his return home,

2282
01:57:05.130 --> 01:57:10.230
I moved his majesty to speak in the behalf of my daughter;

2283
01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:15.230
which, in the minority of them both, his majesty,

2284
01:57:15.230 --> 01:57:19.870
out of a self-gracious remembrance, did first propose:

2285
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:21.770
his highness hath promised me to do it:

2286
01:57:21.770 --> 01:57:24.430
and, to stop up the displeasure

2287
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:27.170
he hath conceived against your son,

2288
01:57:27.170 --> 01:57:29.900
there is no fitter matter.

2289
01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:33.300
How does your ladyship like it?

2290
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:35.370
With very much content

2291
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:37.900
and I wish it happily effected.

2292
01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:40.170
His highness will be here tomorrow

2293
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:42.830
of as able body as when he numbered thirty:

2294
01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:46.630
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I die.

2295
01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:48.730
I have letters that my son will be here this evening

2296
01:57:48.730 --> 01:57:53.370
and I shall beseech your lordship to remain me till they meet together.

2297
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:56.670
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted.

2298
01:57:56.670 --> 01:57:59.270
You need but plead your honourable privilege.

2299
01:57:59.270 --> 01:58:01.130
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter;

2300
01:58:01.130 --> 01:58:03.800
but I thank my God it holds yet.

2301
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:07.730
O madam, yonder's my lord your son

2302
01:58:07.730 --> 01:58:09.200
Let us go see your son, I pray you:

2303
01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.870
I long to talk with the young noble soldier.

2304
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:17.530
What's your will?

2305
01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:20.970
That it will please you

2306
01:58:20.970 --> 01:58:23.430
To give this poor petition to the king,

2307
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:25.070
And aid me with that store of power

2308
01:58:25.070 --> 01:58:26.830
you have to come into his presence.

2309
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:28.970
The king's not here.

2310
01:58:28.970 --> 01:58:30.400
Not here, sir!

2311
01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:32.470
Not, indeed:

2312
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:35.630
He hence removed last night and with more haste

2313
01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:38.030
Than is his use.

2314
01:58:38.030 --> 01:58:41.300
Lord, how we lose our pains!

2315
01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:43.700
But this exceeding posting day and night

2316
01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:45.630
must wear your spirits low

2317
01:58:45.630 --> 01:58:46.870
We can't help it

2318
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:48.170
All's well that ends well, yet,

2319
01:58:48.170 --> 01:58:51.800
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.

2320
01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:56.630
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

2321
01:58:56.630 --> 01:58:58.870
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;

2322
01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:00.430
Whither I am going.

2323
01:59:00.430 --> 01:59:02.100
I do beseech you, sir,

2324
01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.330
Since you are like to see the king before me,

2325
01:59:04.330 --> 01:59:06.500
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,

2326
01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:08.700
Which I presume shall render you no blame

2327
01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:11.700
But rather make you thank your pains for it.

2328
01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:13.470
I will come after you with what good speed

2329
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:16.300
Our means will make us means.

2330
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.970
This I'll do for you.

2331
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.170
Good Monsieur Lavache,

2332
01:59:20.170 --> 01:59:22.500
give my Lord Lafeu this letter:

2333
01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.870
I have ere now, sir, been better known to you,

2334
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:28.430
when I have held familiarity with fresher clothes;

2335
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:30.500
but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's mood,

2336
01:59:30.500 --> 01:59:33.300
and smell somewhat strong of her strong displeasure.

2337
01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:36.030
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish,

2338
01:59:36.030 --> 01:59:38.600
if it smell so strongly as thou speakest of:

2339
01:59:38.600 --> 01:59:41.070
Prithee, allow the wind.

2340
01:59:41.070 --> 01:59:42.800
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir;

2341
01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.500
I spake but by a metaphor.

2342
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:46.800
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink,

2343
01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:50.000
I will stop my nose; or against any man's metaphor.

2344
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:51.370
Prithee, get thee further.

2345
01:59:51.370 --> 01:59:53.100
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

2346
01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:58.000
Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's close-stool

2347
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.730
to give to a nobleman! Look, here he comes himself.

2348
02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:07.870
Here is a purr of fortune's, sir,

2349
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:11.530
that has fallen into the unclean fishpond of her displeasure,

2350
02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:14.030
and, as he says, is muddied withal:

2351
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:18.670
I do pity his distress and leave him to your lordship.

2352
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:23.330
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched.

2353
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:25.130
And what would you have me to do?

2354
02:00:25.130 --> 02:00:28.200
'Tis too late to pare her nails now.

2355
02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.870
Wherein have you played the knave with fortune,

2356
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:30.930
that she should scratch you,

2357
02:00:30.930 --> 02:00:32.700
who of herself is a good lady

2358
02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:36.700
and would not have knaves thrive long under her?

2359
02:00:39.370 --> 02:00:42.830
There's a quart d'ecu for you:

2360
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:44.600
let the justices make you and fortune friends:

2361
02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:46.100
I am for other business.

2362
02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:49.230
I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.

2363
02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:52.830
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;

2364
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:54.400
save your word.

2365
02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.470
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

2366
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:10.570
give me your hand. How does your drum?

2367
02:01:10.570 --> 02:01:14.470
O my good lord, you were the first that found me!

2368
02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:16.770
Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.

2369
02:01:16.770 --> 02:01:19.070
It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,

2370
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:20.470
for you did bring me out.

2371
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:21.900
Out upon thee, knave!

2372
02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:23.200
dost thou put upon me at once both the office

2373
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.370
of God and the devil?

2374
02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:26.470
One brings thee in grace and the other brings thee out.

2375
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:28.400
(trumpet sounds)

2376
02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.430
The king's coming; I know by his trumpets.

2377
02:01:32.430 --> 02:01:36.400
Sirrah, inquire further after me;

2378
02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:39.370
I had talk of you last night:

2379
02:01:39.370 --> 02:01:44.530
though you are a fool and a knave, you shall eat; go to

2380
02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:46.530
I praise God for you.

2381
02:01:57.600 --> 02:01:59.570
We lost a jewel of her;

2382
02:01:59.570 --> 02:02:02.270
and our esteem was made much poorer by it:

2383
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:04.370
but your son, mad in folly, lack'd the sense

2384
02:02:04.370 --> 02:02:06.370
to know her estimation home.

2385
02:02:06.370 --> 02:02:07.900
'Tis past, my liege;

2386
02:02:07.900 --> 02:02:09.900
And I beseech your majesty to make it

2387
02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:13.070
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;

2388
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:16.200
When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,

2389
02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.930
O'erbears it and burns on.

2390
02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:18.770
My honour'd lady,

2391
02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:21.470
I have forgiven and forgotten all;

2392
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:23.330
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,

2393
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:25.200
And watch'd the time to shoot.

2394
02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.730
This I must say,

2395
02:02:26.730 --> 02:02:30.030
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord

2396
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:32.530
Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady

2397
02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:35.330
Offence of mighty note; but to himself

2398
02:02:35.330 --> 02:02:37.200
The greatest wrong of all.

2399
02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.400
He lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey

2400
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:44.000
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,

2401
02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:48.370
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve

2402
02:02:48.370 --> 02:02:49.670
Humbly call'd mistress.

2403
02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:50.770
Praising what is lost

2404
02:02:50.770 --> 02:02:52.470
Makes the remembrance dear.

2405
02:02:52.470 --> 02:02:53.970
Well, call him hither;

2406
02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:54.970
We are reconciled,

2407
02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:57.230
and the first view shall kill all repetition:

2408
02:02:57.230 --> 02:02:58.800
let him not ask our pardon;

2409
02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:00.730
The nature of his great offence is dead,

2410
02:03:00.730 --> 02:03:02.070
And deeper than oblivion

2411
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:05.200
we do bury the incensing relics of it:

2412
02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:07.900
let him approach, a stranger, no offender;

2413
02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:10.830
and inform him so 'tis our will he should.

2414
02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:13.100
I shall, my liege.

2415
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:19.330
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke

2416
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:23.200
All that he is hath reference to your highness.

2417
02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:25.100
Then shall we have a match.

2418
02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:26.200
I have letters sent me

2419
02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.600
That set him high in fame.

2420
02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:30.100
He looks well on't.

2421
02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:35.370
I am not a day of season,

2422
02:03:35.370 --> 02:03:37.600
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail

2423
02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:40.370
In me at once: but to the brightest beams

2424
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:45.300
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;

2425
02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:47.500
The time is fair again.

2426
02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:49.170
My high-repented blames,

2427
02:03:49.170 --> 02:03:51.430
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

2428
02:03:51.430 --> 02:03:53.300
All is whole;

2429
02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:55.230
Not one word more of the consumed time.

2430
02:03:55.230 --> 02:03:57.370
Let's take the instant by the forward top;

2431
02:03:57.370 --> 02:04:00.900
For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees

2432
02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:03.900
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time

2433
02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:06.870
Steals ere we can effect them.

2434
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:10.500
You remember the daughter of this lord?

2435
02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:12.170
Admiringly, my liege,

2436
02:04:12.170 --> 02:04:14.900
At first I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart

2437
02:04:14.900 --> 02:04:18.400
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue

2438
02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.930
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,

2439
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:23.870
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,

2440
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:26.230
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;

2441
02:04:26.230 --> 02:04:29.900
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;

2442
02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:31.800
Extended or contracted all proportions

2443
02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:35.900
To a most hideous object: thence it came

2444
02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:38.700
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,

2445
02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:42.500
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye

2446
02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:45.170
The dust that did offend it.

2447
02:04:45.170 --> 02:04:47.300
Well excused:

2448
02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:50.200
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,

2449
02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.200
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust

2450
02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:57.670
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,

2451
02:04:57.670 --> 02:05:01.570
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.

2452
02:05:01.570 --> 02:05:06.270
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.

2453
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:09.430
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:

2454
02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:12.230
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay

2455
02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:16.070
To see our widower's second marriage-day.

2456
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:19.230
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!

2457
02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:22.570
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

2458
02:05:22.570 --> 02:05:24.800
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name

2459
02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:27.770
Must be digested, give a favour from you

2460
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:30.500
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,

2461
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:33.130
That she may quickly come.

2462
02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:41.770
By my old beard,

2463
02:05:41.770 --> 02:05:45.930
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,

2464
02:05:45.930 --> 02:05:48.630
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,

2465
02:05:48.630 --> 02:05:50.930
The last that e'er I took her at court,

2466
02:05:50.930 --> 02:05:52.730
I saw upon her finger.

2467
02:05:52.730 --> 02:05:53.630
Hers it was not.

2468
02:05:53.630 --> 02:05:55.830
Let me see it; for mine eye,

2469
02:05:55.830 --> 02:06:00.170
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.

2470
02:06:00.170 --> 02:06:04.170
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,

2471
02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:05.700
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood

2472
02:06:05.700 --> 02:06:07.170
Necessitied to help,

2473
02:06:07.170 --> 02:06:10.670
that by this token I would relieve her.

2474
02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:12.000
Had you that craft, to reave her

2475
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Of what should stead her most?

2476
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.700
My gracious sovereign,

2477
02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.300
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,

2478
02:06:17.300 --> 02:06:18.730
The ring was never hers.

2479
02:06:18.730 --> 02:06:19.700
Son, on my life,

2480
02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:22.330
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it

2481
02:06:22.330 --> 02:06:23.770
At her life's rate.

2482
02:06:23.770 --> 02:06:26.030
I am sure I saw her wear it.

2483
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:30.570
You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it

2484
02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:34.030
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,

2485
02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:35.830
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name

2486
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:38.500
Of her that threw it: noble she was,

2487
02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:39.930
and thought I stood engaged:

2488
02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:43.170
but when I had subscribed to mine own fortune

2489
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:44.900
and inform'd her fully I could not answer

2490
02:06:44.900 --> 02:06:46.270
in that course of honour

2491
02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:48.000
As she had made the overture, she ceased

2492
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:49.470
In heavy satisfaction

2493
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:51.030
and would never receive the ring again.

2494
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:52.070
Plutus himself,

2495
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:54.030
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,

2496
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:56.100
Hath not in nature's mystery more science

2497
02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:58.470
Than I have in this ring:

2498
02:06:58.470 --> 02:07:01.170
'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,

2499
02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:02.500
Confess 'twas hers,

2500
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:05.800
and by what rough enforcement you got it from her:

2501
02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:07.270
she call'd the saints to surety

2502
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:08.900
That she would never put it from her finger,

2503
02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:11.930
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,

2504
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:13.800
Where you have never come,

2505
02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.470
or sent it us upon her great disaster.

2506
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:18.130
She never saw it.

2507
02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:21.100
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;

2508
02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:23.600
And makest conjectural fears to come into me

2509
02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:26.070
Which I would fain shut out.

2510
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:27.470
If it should prove

2511
02:07:27.470 --> 02:07:31.930
That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--

2512
02:07:31.930 --> 02:07:33.630
And yet I know not:

2513
02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:35.530
thou didst hate her deadly,

2514
02:07:35.530 --> 02:07:37.230
And she is dead;

2515
02:07:37.230 --> 02:07:39.030
which nothing, but to close her eyes myself,

2516
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:40.430
could win me to believe,

2517
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:45.430
More than to see this ring. Take him away.

2518
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:52.470
We'll sift this matter further.

2519
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:59.030
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

2520
02:07:59.030 --> 02:08:01.130
Gracious sovereign,

2521
02:08:01.130 --> 02:08:03.400
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:

2522
02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:05.770
Here's a petition from a Florentine,

2523
02:08:05.770 --> 02:08:07.770
Who hath for four or five removes come short

2524
02:08:07.770 --> 02:08:09.200
To tender it herself.

2525
02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:10.630
I undertook it,

2526
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:13.230
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech

2527
02:08:13.230 --> 02:08:14.570
Of the poor suppliant,

2528
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:17.030
who by this I know is here attending:

2529
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:18.930
her business looks in her

2530
02:08:18.930 --> 02:08:21.830
With an importing visage; and she told me,

2531
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:24.900
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern

2532
02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:27.930
Your highness with herself.

2533
02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:30.270
Upon his many protestations to marry me

2534
02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:33.000
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it,

2535
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.300
he won me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower:

2536
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:39.070
his vows are forfeited to me,

2537
02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:41.270
and my honour's paid to him.

2538
02:08:42.630 --> 02:08:44.730
He stole from Florence, taking no leave,

2539
02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:47.230
and I follow him to his country for justice:

2540
02:08:47.230 --> 02:08:50.130
grant it me, O king! in you it best lies;

2541
02:08:50.130 --> 02:08:54.700
otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.

2542
02:08:57.130 --> 02:09:00.570
Diana Capilet.

2543
02:09:00.570 --> 02:09:02.600
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair,

2544
02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:04.070
and toll for this: I'll none of him.

2545
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:05.570
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,

2546
02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:07.730
To bring forth this discovery.

2547
02:09:07.730 --> 02:09:08.730
Seek these suitors:

2548
02:09:08.730 --> 02:09:11.830
Go speedily and bring again the count.

2549
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:13.700
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,

2550
02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:16.230
Was foully snatch'd.

2551
02:09:16.230 --> 02:09:19.100
Now, justice on the doers!

2552
02:09:19.100 --> 02:09:22.830
I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,

2553
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:25.600
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,

2554
02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:28.530
Yet you desire to marry.

2555
02:09:30.170 --> 02:09:31.370
What woman's that?

2556
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:33.930
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,

2557
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:36.230
Derived from the ancient Capilet:

2558
02:09:36.230 --> 02:09:38.370
My suit, as I do understand, you know,

2559
02:09:38.370 --> 02:09:41.100
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

2560
02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:45.500
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour

2561
02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:48.200
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,

2562
02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:50.730
And both shall cease, without your remedy.

2563
02:09:50.730 --> 02:09:53.900
Count; do you know these women?

2564
02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:56.670
My lord, I neither can nor will deny

2565
02:09:56.670 --> 02:09:59.030
But that I know them: do they charge me further?

2566
02:09:59.030 --> 02:10:01.870
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

2567
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:03.870
She's none of mine, my lord.

2568
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:04.900
If you shall marry,

2569
02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:08.500
You give away this hand, and that is mine;

2570
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:11.270
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;

2571
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:13.930
You give away myself, which is known mine;

2572
02:10:13.930 --> 02:10:15.970
For I by vow am so embodied yours,

2573
02:10:15.970 --> 02:10:18.600
That she which marries you must marry me,

2574
02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:21.200
Either both or none.

2575
02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:23.300
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter;

2576
02:10:23.300 --> 02:10:24.600
you are no husband for her.

2577
02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:27.030
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature

2578
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:29.600
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with:

2579
02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.200
let your highness lay a more noble thought

2580
02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.170
upon mine honour

2581
02:10:32.170 --> 02:10:33.730
Than for to think that I would sink it here.

2582
02:10:33.730 --> 02:10:35.330
Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend

2583
02:10:35.330 --> 02:10:37.170
Till your deeds gain them:

2584
02:10:37.170 --> 02:10:39.570
fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies.

2585
02:10:39.570 --> 02:10:40.500
Good my lord,

2586
02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:41.930
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think

2587
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:45.100
He had not my virginity.

2588
02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:47.030
What say'st thou to her?

2589
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:49.170
She's impudent, my lord,

2590
02:10:49.170 --> 02:10:51.230
And was a common gamester to the camp.

2591
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:53.600
He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,

2592
02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.500
He might have bought me at a common price:

2593
02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:58.130
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,

2594
02:10:58.130 --> 02:11:00.570
Whose high respect and rich validity

2595
02:11:00.570 --> 02:11:02.230
Did lack a parallel;

2596
02:11:02.230 --> 02:11:05.770
yet for all that, he gave it to a commoner o' the camp,

2597
02:11:05.770 --> 02:11:07.900
If I be one.

2598
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:11.830
He blushes, and 'tis it

2599
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.100
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,

2600
02:11:14.100 --> 02:11:16.300
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,

2601
02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:18.600
Hath it been owed and worn.

2602
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:23.430
This is his wife; that ring's a thousand proofs.

2603
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:25.030
Methought you said you saw one here in court

2604
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:26.000
could witness it.

2605
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.030
I did, my lord,

2606
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:29.070
but loath am to produce so bad an instrument:

2607
02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:30.630
his name's Parolles.

2608
02:11:30.630 --> 02:11:33.000
I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

2609
02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:34.570
Find him, and bring him hither.

2610
02:11:34.570 --> 02:11:35.900
What of him?

2611
02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:38.630
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,

2612
02:11:38.630 --> 02:11:41.570
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;

2613
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:44.030
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.

2614
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:46.030
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,

2615
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:47.070
That will speak any thing?

2616
02:11:47.070 --> 02:11:49.900
She hath that ring of yours.

2617
02:11:49.900 --> 02:11:54.470
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,

2618
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:57.370
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:

2619
02:11:57.370 --> 02:12:00.200
She knew her distance and did angle for me,

2620
02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:02.730
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,

2621
02:12:02.730 --> 02:12:04.400
As all impediments in fancy's course

2622
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:07.630
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,

2623
02:12:07.630 --> 02:12:10.500
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,

2624
02:12:10.500 --> 02:12:15.170
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;

2625
02:12:15.170 --> 02:12:16.970
And I had that which any inferior might

2626
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:19.500
At market-price have bought.

2627
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.470
I must be patient:

2628
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:24.030
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,

2629
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:27.670
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;

2630
02:12:27.670 --> 02:12:30.600
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;

2631
02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:32.700
Send for your ring, I will return it home,

2632
02:12:32.700 --> 02:12:34.500
And give me mine again.

2633
02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:35.570
I have it not.

2634
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:37.730
What ring was yours, I pray you?

2635
02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:41.670
Sir, much like the same upon your finger.

2636
02:12:41.670 --> 02:12:44.030
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

2637
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:46.070
And this was it I gave him, being abed.

2638
02:12:46.070 --> 02:12:47.370
The story then goes false,

2639
02:12:47.370 --> 02:12:48.900
you threw it him out of a casement.

2640
02:12:48.900 --> 02:12:49.970
I have spoke the truth.

2641
02:12:49.970 --> 02:12:52.100
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

2642
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:58.000
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.

2643
02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.630
Is this the man you speak of?

2644
02:12:59.630 --> 02:13:01.070
Ay, my lord.

2645
02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:03.100
Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,

2646
02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:05.170
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,

2647
02:13:05.170 --> 02:13:07.930
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,

2648
02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:12.400
By him and by this woman here what know you?

2649
02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:14.170
So please your majesty, my master hath been an

2650
02:13:14.170 --> 02:13:16.870
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,

2651
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:18.030
which gentlemen have.

2652
02:13:18.030 --> 02:13:22.870
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

2653
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:25.000
Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

2654
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:26.130
How, I pray you?

2655
02:13:26.130 --> 02:13:28.130
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

2656
02:13:28.130 --> 02:13:29.200
How is that?

2657
02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:31.300
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

2658
02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:33.730
As thou art a knave, and no knave.

2659
02:13:33.730 --> 02:13:35.770
What an equivocal companion is this!

2660
02:13:35.770 --> 02:13:38.100
I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

2661
02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:42.000
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

2662
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.800
Do you know he promised me marriage?

2663
02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:46.630
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

2664
02:13:46.630 --> 02:13:49.800
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

2665
02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:51.730
Yes, so please your majesty.

2666
02:13:51.730 --> 02:13:53.300
I did go between them, as I said; but more than that,

2667
02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.100
he loved her:

2668
02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:56.000
for indeed he was mad for her,

2669
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.800
and talked of Satan an of Limbo

2670
02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:59.730
and of Furies and I know not what:

2671
02:13:59.730 --> 02:14:01.570
yet I was in that credit with them at that time

2672
02:14:01.570 --> 02:14:03.370
that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,

2673
02:14:03.370 --> 02:14:04.900
as promising her marriage,

2674
02:14:04.900 --> 02:14:07.700
and things which would derive me ill will to speak of;

2675
02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:09.700
therefore I will not speak what I know.

2676
02:14:09.700 --> 02:14:11.700
Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say

2677
02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:13.400
they are married:

2678
02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:14.800
but thou art too fine in thy evidence;

2679
02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:17.230
therefore stand aside.

2680
02:14:17.230 --> 02:14:19.700
This ring, you say, was yours?

2681
02:14:19.700 --> 02:14:20.670
Ay, my good lord.

2682
02:14:20.670 --> 02:14:22.670
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

2683
02:14:22.670 --> 02:14:25.400
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

2684
02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.630
Who lent it you?

2685
02:14:26.630 --> 02:14:28.230
It was not lent me neither.

2686
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:29.030
Where did you find it, then?

2687
02:14:29.030 --> 02:14:30.170
I found it not.

2688
02:14:30.170 --> 02:14:31.530
If it were yours by none of all these ways,

2689
02:14:31.530 --> 02:14:32.730
How could you give it him?

2690
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:34.100
I never gave it him.

2691
02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:35.570
This woman's an easy glove, my lord;

2692
02:14:35.570 --> 02:14:37.830
she goes off and on at pleasure.

2693
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:42.800
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

2694
02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:45.270
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

2695
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:47.000
Take her away; I do not like her now;

2696
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:48.330
To prison with her: and away with him.

2697
02:14:48.330 --> 02:14:50.200
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,

2698
02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:51.770
within this hour, thou diest.

2699
02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:53.000
I'll never tell you.

2700
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:53.730
Take her away.

2701
02:14:53.730 --> 02:14:54.830
I'll put in bail, my liege.

2702
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:56.700
I think thee now some common customer.

2703
02:14:56.700 --> 02:15:00.130
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

2704
02:15:00.130 --> 02:15:02.070
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

2705
02:15:02.070 --> 02:15:05.930
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:

2706
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:09.570
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;

2707
02:15:09.570 --> 02:15:15.100
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.

2708
02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:18.030
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;

2709
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:22.370
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

2710
02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:25.730
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

2711
02:15:25.730 --> 02:15:28.830
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

2712
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:30.730
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,

2713
02:15:30.730 --> 02:15:33.470
And he shall surety me.

2714
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:35.030
But for this lord, who hath abused me,

2715
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:37.200
as he knows himself,

2716
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:43.400
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:

2717
02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:47.270
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;

2718
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:55.270
And at that time he got his wife with child:

2719
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:59.930
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:

2720
02:15:59.930 --> 02:16:06.000
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:

2721
02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:11.900
And now behold the meaning.

2722
02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.230
Is there no exorcist

2723
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:54.200
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?

2724
02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:56.530
Is't real that I see?

2725
02:16:56.530 --> 02:16:58.270
No, my good lord;

2726
02:16:58.270 --> 02:17:00.870
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,

2727
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:03.630
The name and not the thing.

2728
02:17:03.630 --> 02:17:12.370
Both, both. O, pardon!

2729
02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:22.970
O my good lord, when I was like this maid,

2730
02:17:22.970 --> 02:17:24.800
I found you wondrous kind.

2731
02:17:32.830 --> 02:17:34.300
There is your ring,

2732
02:17:36.370 --> 02:17:41.070
and, look you, here's your letter; this it says:

2733
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:43.930
'When from my finger you can get this ring

2734
02:17:43.930 --> 02:17:52.930
And are by me with child,' etc. This is done:

2735
02:17:54.400 --> 02:17:58.570
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

2736
02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:04.030
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,

2737
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:10.000
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

2738
02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:23.200
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,

2739
02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:28.070
Deadly divorce step between me and you!

2740
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:31.230
O my dear mother, do I see you living?

2741
02:18:32.930 --> 02:18:36.970
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

2742
02:18:37.630 --> 02:18:40.830
Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher:

2743
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:49.000
so, I thank thee: wait on me home,

2744
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.300
I'll make sport with thee:

2745
02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:56.200
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

2746
02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:00.170
Let us from point to point this story know,

2747
02:19:00.170 --> 02:19:05.070
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

2748
02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:12.500
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,

2749
02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:16.330
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;

2750
02:19:16.330 --> 02:19:19.170
For I can guess that by thy honest aid

2751
02:19:19.170 --> 02:19:24.300
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.

2752
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:29.300
Of that and all the progress, more or less,

2753
02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:32.730
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:

2754
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:58.600
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,

2755
02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:06.270
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

2756
02:21:38.530 --> 02:21:41.530
