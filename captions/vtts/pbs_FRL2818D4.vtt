00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.730
>> NARRATOR: Tonight on

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.660
<i>Frontline,</i> an exclusive

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.360
investigation.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.700
In the chaotic days after

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.760
Hurricane Katrina...

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.930
>> People were shot and killed

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.230
by the New Orleans Police

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.230
Department.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.630
>> NARRATOR: ...eleven civilians

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.530
were shot by New Orleans police

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.560
officers...

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.660
>> Looting and other lawlessness

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.900
will not be tolerated.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.730
>> NARRATOR: ...as rumors

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.660
circulated about a declaration

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.760
of martial law.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.730
>> I've already called for

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.700
martial law in the city of New

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.830
Orleans.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.330
>> I heard rumors that martial

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.600
law was in place, and then I

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.460
heard rumors that no, it was

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.500
not.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.730
>> I never declared martial law.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.830
>> NARRATOR: Did the police

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.030
believe they could suspend their

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.330
own rules?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.860
>> Does he expect us to rank and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.460
file, go through the streets,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.730
you know, shooting looters?

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.030
>> NARRATOR: New evidence shows

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.530
that an order was given

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.330
authorizing officers to shoot

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600
looters.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.700
>> One of the most troubled

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.130
police departments in the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.500
history of North America.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.560
The NOPD reverts back to what

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.560
the existing culture has always

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.730
been.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.930
>> That's the guy?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.230
>> That's the one that beat me.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.130
>> NARRATOR: Tonight, the story

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.600
of one of those killings.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.060
>> What happened here wound up

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.500
setting this chain of events in

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.660
motion that has turned the New

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.700
Orleans Police Department upside

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.760
down.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.800
>> NARRATOR: And questions about

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.900
a cover up.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.930
>> Bodies don't just burn up

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.560
like that.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.400
>> The way it was destroyed was

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.400
telling a story.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400
This was a premeditated

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.700
homicide.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.900
>> NARRATOR: ProPublica reporter

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.160
A.C. Thompson, the<i> Times-</i>

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.630
<i>Picayune,</i> and<i> Frontline</i>

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.060
investigate: "Law and Disorder

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:32.100
in New Orleans."

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.730
>> NARRATOR: These are the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.260
pictures we all remember.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.500
The storm of a century.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.360
The flooding that submerged a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.930
city.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.900
The dispossessed.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.330
And the chaos.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.160
>> Hey!

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.460
Stop!

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.800
Drop here!

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.300
>> Is it running right now?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.560
>> Yeah, it's running.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.700
>> NARRATOR: But there were some

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.900
images that few people saw.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.260
This video was taken by this

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.060
man, Istvan Balogh, a former law

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.900
enforcement officer who had come

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.660
from out of state to assist

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.230
after the storm.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.900
>> I mean, can you believe this?

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.000
This is, uh, the ninth of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.830
September.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.030
>> We were on a routine foot

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.460
patrol.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.230
I'm looking down towards the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.660
riverbank.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.860
Just to see if I see anything

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.000
unusual.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.560
And I observed a white vehicle.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.230
We found this completely burnt

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.230
out vehicle.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.460
I yelled up to my partner, I go,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.360
"You won't believe what's in

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.000
here.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.300
There's a dead body.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.230
There's a... looks like a femur

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.830
right here.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.000
I observed the skull.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.100
And from here you can... there's

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.760
a skull.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.000
I observed what looked like a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.700
bullet wound.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.760
Looks like it was shot from the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.900
side.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.460
There's no question in my mind.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.730
This is a pre-meditated

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.230
homicide.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.030
Absolutely amazing.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.900
This body is disintegrated.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.960
I mean, that was a hot fire.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.800
This is the whole body right

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.930
here.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.930
The magnitude of the way it was

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.130
destroyed.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.260
It was telling a story-- I don't

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.360
want no one ever to find out

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.230
what I did.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.760
>> NARRATOR: It was two years

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.230
after Balogh's discovery when a

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.300
reporter first came across the

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.260
story of the burnt remains.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.230
ProPublica's A.C. Thompson, then

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.860
a freelance crime reporter, had

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.460
come to New Orleans to

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.100
investigate suspicious deaths in

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.830
the wake of Katrina.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.530
With the support of the Nation

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.930
Institute, he'd sued to see the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.100
public records.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.700
>> I'd gotten a hold of over 800

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.600
autopsies of people who had died

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.960
in the days after the storm.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.230
Most Katrina victims had

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.860
drowned, but one autopsy report

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.230
described a badly burned body.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.230
And there was something else

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.230
that I found odd: there was no

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.760
cause of death.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.100
The line where homicide or

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.230
accident could have been written

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.130
was blank.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.660
The other information the

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:16.930
autopsy told me was that the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.230
remains belonged to a 31 year-

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.000
old-man named Henry Glover.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.230
I found out that Glover had

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.230
lived in the Algiers

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.660
neighborhood of New Orleans on

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.930
the west bank of the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.630
Mississippi.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.500
He had stayed in the city

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.930
through Katrina along with his

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.730
mother, brother and sister.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.230
The last time his sister saw

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.960
Henry was September 2, four days

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.560
after the storm.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.460
>> September 2, we was at home.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.060
My brother and another friend

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.830
said that they was going out to

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.530
get some help and, you know, get

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.360
some water and some food and

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.500
stuff.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.260
And... and he never made it

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.830
back.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.360
>> Henry had come here to this

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.530
strip mall with his friend,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.230
Bernard.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:03.700
His brother, Edward, was nearby

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.630
at his own home that morning.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.760
>> I was home feeding my family

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.230
and I can hear somebody

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.130
hollering from a distance.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.230
My nickname is Dirty Red.

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.060
"Dirty, Dirty.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.660
Somebody shot your brother."

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.700
I said, "Hold up.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.930
Hold up.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.330
You sure it's Henry?"

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.830
He said, "Yeah."

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.100
So he run... I run out the house

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.230
to where he was at.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.930
>> Both Edward and Patrice ran

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.130
to find Henry here about 50

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.100
yards down the street from the

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.030
strip mall; he was bleeding from

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:39.800
the chest.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.500
>> I saw my brother laying down

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.760
there and he was on his stomach.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.230
I said, "Brother, hold on.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.960
I'll get you some help."

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960
>> That's when Edward flagged

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.460
down a passing car.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.330
The stranger slowed, then

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.930
stopped.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.000
His name is Will Tanner.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.500
>> Henry Glover was in the

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.460
middle of the street and his

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.000
brother Edward was standing over

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
him and he's talking about how

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.230
he needed medical attention for

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.760
his brother.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.130
So I got out the car, touched

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.260
his neck and see he still had a

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.460
pulse.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.860
>> Tanner reaching down feeling

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.730
saying, "He have a pulse, he

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.060
have a pulse."

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.230
So I grabbed him and we fell

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.600
back into the car like this.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.100
>> My mission is to get him to

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.900
the hospital or somebody who can

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.130
help him.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.100
>> But Will Tanner thought the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.100
hospital was too far.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.860
He didn't think Glover would

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.300
make it.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.430
Instead, Tanner drove a mile to

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.230
Habans Elementary School.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:39.500
>> I knew at Habans School, they

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.700
have medical attention.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.460
Police was camped out there.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.030
>> In the days after Katrina,

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.700
the NOPD SWAT team had turned

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.560
this school into an armed

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.230
encampment.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.760
>> Can I have everybody's

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.560
attention?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.560
I'm going to go ahead and do the

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.000
mission briefing for the night.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.230
>> These scenes were filmed for

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.130
a<i> Frontline</i> program called "The

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.460
Storm."

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.560
>> For tonight, our mission is

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.760
to proactively patrol the Fourth

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
district.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.800
>> It's here that members of

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.030
this unit would gather for their

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.000
daily orders, often assigned to

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.460
go on looter patrol.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.630
>> Our purpose for this patrol

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.100
tonight is going to be to deter

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.100
crime and looting patrol, all

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.300
right.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.630
Anything out of the ordinary, go

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.030
ahead and challenge it.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.400
>> When we got there, I thought

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.600
that they was going to help us.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.800
But the first thing they did was

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.000
put us in handcuffs.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.300
And I'm like, "Why?

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.830
We're coming for help."

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.960
So I made the statement because

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.160
you all... I said, "You all not

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.760
helping my brother."

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.900
Whoever killed him, I'm gonna

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.930
kill them," out of anger, you

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.130
know, for my brother.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:42.060
I'm seeing my brother in that,

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:46.030
you know, that way.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.130
So that's what I said and that's

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.560
when the beating came.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.700
Man, they beat me, they beat me.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.800
I ain't never been beat like

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.400
that in my life.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.760
When he first hit me, I faked

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.130
like I was knocked out.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.500
So he said, "Get up.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.200
Get up, you piece of shit."

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.830
So he grabbed me right here and

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.100
he... his fingers almost

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.600
touched.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.700
I liked to blacked out and he

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.430
let me go just in time.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.630
>> They hit me.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.200
Kicked me in the ribs twice.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.400
Hit me with an M-16 rifle upside

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.630
my face.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.700
And Henry Glover is still in the

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.930
car bleeding.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.700
And no one didn't check on him

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.430
at all.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.130
That was the cruelest thing a

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.600
person can do to a man-- let him

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.460
bleed to death in the car like

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.300
that.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.760
And show no, you know, no

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.330
reaction to try to help him.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:32.600
>> They let him sit in that car

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.300
too long.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.760
The last time I saw my brother

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.100
is when they took me out of that

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.200
car and put them handcuffs

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.300
behind me.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.960
That's the last time I saw him.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.330
>> Edward says he and Will

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.300
Tanner were still in handcuffs

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.200
when one of the police officers

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.430
drove off in Tanner's car.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.600
With Henry Glover still in the

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.600
backseat.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.230
It's been five years since Henry

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:58.800
Glover died.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.900
Edward is still haunted by the

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.300
experience.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.960
>> I tried to figure it out.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.860
I used to come out here and just

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.360
sit and try to redo the whole

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.960
thing, and I just can't... I

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.230
just can't figure it out.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.430
I really can't.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.460
>> I wasn't gonna do this, but

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.930
since we... that's the guy?

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.400
>> That's the one that beat me.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.630
>> You sure?

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.600
>> I'm positive.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.800
He beat me good.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.860
I mean, I grew up in the

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.960
neighborhood project, I mean,

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.760
fighting three, four times a

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.830
day.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.330
But I never got beat how this

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.760
man beat me with my hands behind

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.230
my back, kicking me in my face,

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.100
spitting in my face whenever he

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.300
felt like it.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.430
>> It's been five years.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:40.960
You're sure this is the dude?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.900
>> I'm positive.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.830
I'll put my life on the line

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.230
that's the one beat me.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.760
I would never forget his face.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.730
>> NARRATOR: The officer Edward

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.260
King fingered was Lieutenant

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.160
Dwayne Scheuermann, then second

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.060
in command of the NOPD SWAT

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.600
team.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.260
Within the ranks of the police

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.300
department, Scheuermann's status

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.330
was almost legendary-- a cop's

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.760
cop; courageous and fearless.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.330
That was certainly the

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.930
reputation he had earned in the

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.860
first days after Katrina.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.130
Lt. Scheuermann was interviewed

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.700
by<i> Frontline</i> at Habans School.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.230
>> When the storm hit early

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.400
Monday morning, we actually

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.600
watched it from the arena.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.760
We're watching the pieces of the

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.860
dome's roof come off.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.060
And we started getting reports

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.530
that there were already both

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:24.860
police officers and citizens in

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.030
trouble as far as high water is

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:27.600
concerned.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.300
>> NARRATOR: At that time,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.560
Scheuermann was considered a

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.630
hero for his part in rescuing

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.100
stranded flood victims.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.130
>> Myself and my brother took

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.630
our personal fishing boats.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.560
There was people in their

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.360
attics.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.030
They had punched the windows out

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:41.230
of the attic.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.830
And they were screaming to us to

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.860
come get them.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.600
>> He was relentless.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.230
Look at his face, his eyes, you

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.900
see the sheer determination but

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.830
you can also see the fatigue.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.030
Police officers in the first

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.260
week, they were basically

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.500
working 24/7.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.460
Just being in a constant sense

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.660
of survival.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.960
It took a toll, it took a toll.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:10.760
It was rough.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.230
>> NARRATOR: Hurricane Katrina

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.360
had hit the New Orleans Police

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.900
Department hard.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.100
>> Katrina hit on August 29,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.360
sometime mid-day on August 30,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.460
we lost complete communications.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.900
>> NARRATOR: Warren Riley was

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.900
second in command of the NOPD at

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.300
the time of the storm.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.900
>> We were unprepared.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.700
The city was covered by water.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.560
We had no power, no lights.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.100
Our radio system went down, our

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.900
backup system failed.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.230
And we lost complete command and

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.230
control of the police

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.000
department.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.100
>> We were dealing with a police

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.400
force that was completely

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.900
inundated with lack of

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.460
resources.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.230
And it was clear that we were

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.260
having some civil societal

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.700
breakdown.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.000
>> Tension mixed with temptation

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.830
on Tuesday as those trapped in a

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.760
city of rising water took

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.860
survival into their own hands.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.230
>> NARRATOR: Quickly news

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.130
reports were saturated with a

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.000
lasting image of Katrina-- the

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.960
looter.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.360
>> Looting in New Orleans.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.530
Shots have been fired.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.630
>> Downtown New Orleans became a

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.330
looter's free-for-all.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.260
>> They represent a frightening

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.660
breakdown of law and order.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.930
>> NARRATOR: But early media

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.660
reports were exaggerated.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.900
>> There was chaos on Canal

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.600
Street for a period of time.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.300
That was a fact.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.260
But rumors were all over the

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.730
place.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.860
>> With gangs of men armed with

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.560
stolen weapons roaming the

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.500
streets and firing at police.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.100
There may be shoot-outs soon

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.060
enough.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.900
>> NARRATOR: Stories now known

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.600
to be untrue were told by the

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.330
highest-ranking NOPD officers.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:43.330
>> The sniper started shooting

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.460
at my SWAT team off of fire

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.300
trucks.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.130
Then they started shooting at me

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.230
in the helicopter.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.900
>> NARRATOR: And then repeated

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.230
across the news.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.130
>> How do you explain snipers

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.660
firing on a medevac helicopters

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.600
trying to get the sick to

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.900
safety?

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.160
>> Rumors were running amok.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.900
And I shouldn't have, basically,

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.260
given it any credibility by

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.230
repeating what was told to me.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.130
If I had to do it all over

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.400
again, I wouldn't.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.700
>> We had a very tenuous

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.060
situation all throughout the

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.000
city.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.030
And from that came rumors and

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.460
innuendo that unfortunately some

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.930
officials repeated as fact.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.230
>> You getting ready to see

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.960
something that I'm not sure

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.500
you're ready to see.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.000
There are people standing out

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.960
there.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.530
Have been in that frickin'

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.060
Superdome for five days.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.960
Watching dead bodies; watching

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.700
hooligans killing people; raping

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:35.760
people.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:36.760
>> There's not one iota of

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.660
evidence to show that anyone was

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:42.700
killed or raped in the Dome.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.900
But you have to realize we were

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.130
hearing these rumors and we were

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.230
believing these things as well,

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.760
initially.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.060
>> NARRATOR: On August 30,

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.460
Deputy Chief Riley met with

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.500
Mayor Nagin and passed on

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.660
another unconfirmed report.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.260
>> I heard an officer request on

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.200
the radio, he said, "I need more

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:57.960
ammo.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.760
We need more ammo."

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.530
Imagine.

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.430
That's what you hear in the

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.030
movies, that's what you see in a

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:07.230
war movie.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.800
You don't hear that in urban

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.560
policing where you're out of

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.500
ammo.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.060
>> That's when the Mayor says

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.230
let's stop search and rescue and

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.030
bring our force back to

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.660
controlling the streets.

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.000
Let's stop the looting; let's

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.430
stop the lawlessness and let's

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.660
put our police officers on the

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:25.860
streets.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.960
Riley says, "We will do that."

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.030
And the Mayor said, "Let's stop

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:33.960
this crap now."

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.000
>> I remember, we were down by

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.860
Harrah's Casino.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.330
And Deputy Chief Riley walked up

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.600
in a pair of blue jeans, his

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.900
uniform shirt and a ball cap,

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.260
and really just starting giving

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.400
a pep speech, you know, kind of

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.930
a morale-booster, saying that we

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.600
were not going to allow the

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.060
looters to take the city, we

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.300
were going to more or less

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:55.630
protect the borders of it and

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.900
march through downtown and take

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.760
the city back.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.630
>> Did you ever say, "It's time,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.500
we got to take our city back?"

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.230
>> I may have said we need to

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.760
take control of the city, that

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.360
may have happened.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.300
>> And do you think you ever,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:12.230
did you ever say anything like

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.960
"Looters, it's time to, you

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.600
know, it's time to do things

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.330
like shoot to kill?"

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.130
>> No...

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:16.660
>> Or...

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.500
>> You're mixing me up with

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.230
someone else.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.430
I didn't say anything like that.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.430
>> Who said that?

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.530
>> I didn't say that.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:22.230
I heard rumors that someone else

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.060
said that.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.230
But I certainly didn't say that,

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:26.400
no.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.600
>> It was a very broad order.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.060
What exactly did he mean, you

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.860
know?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.260
Does he expect us to rank and

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.960
file, go through the streets,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.860
you know, shooting looters or

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.130
how do you take back a city?

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.560
>> Just sending out a general

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.130
order, general statement about

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.460
take back the city with no

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.830
specific guidelines is an

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.460
invitation to disaster.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.230
>> NARRATOR: Sam Walker is a

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.360
professor of criminal justice

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.760
and an expert on the legal

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.660
standards for when police can

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.160
use their guns.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.060
>> The standards on deadly force

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.600
are fairly clear.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.960
An officer can use deadly force

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.600
where there is a threat to

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.530
someone's life, or that this

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.960
person is armed and fleeing and

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.230
likely to commit another armed

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.430
offense.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.760
That's a very narrow range.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.400
>> NARRATOR: But in post-Katrina

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.460
New Orleans, nothing was clear.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:24.900
Could stealing food, water or a

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.460
TV now mean a death sentence?

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.230
>> A shoot to kill order, to

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.830
shoot looters, would violate the

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.800
long-established standards on

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.700
use of deadly force.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.230
>> NARRATOR: Orders to the NOPD

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.600
rank and file became even more

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
uncertain when Mayor Nagin

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.230
called for martial law.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.100
It was the day after the storm

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.630
and he had just been told by his

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.130
chief of police that a police

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.100
officer had been shot in the

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.760
head.

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.530
This story, we now know, was

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.660
true.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.230
>> Our police, at that point,

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.230
were completely focused on

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.060
search and rescue.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.760
And here they were being shot

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.530
at.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.900
And it made the Mayor furious.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.160
And that's when he said, we need

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.400
to declare martial law.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.000
>> The city they nicknamed the

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.860
Big Easy, still a disaster zone,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.560
under martial law.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.700
>> Tonight, in a rare move.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.860
Practically unheard of in the

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.630
United States-- martial law

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:23.830
declared.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.660
>> Would you request martial

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.200
law?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.630
>> I've already called for

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.560
martial law in the city of New

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.060
Orleans.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.030
>> NARRATOR: In fact, martial

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.030
law was never declared in New

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.560
Orleans.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.360
>> NARRATOR: Ray Nagin declined

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.300
to be interviewed for this

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.160
program, but his deputy chief of

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.360
police, Warren Riley, said there

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.400
was confusion.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.930
>> I heard rumors that martial

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.030
law was in place, and then I

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.060
heard rumors that, no, it was

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.730
not given.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.360
>> I never declared martial law.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.300
I know that it's not legal to do

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.230
that.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.300
But what we were doing was

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.400
strengthening the appearance of

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.860
a lawful environment.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.560
That's when I called in members

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.330
of the Guard who knew policing,

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:09.930
and I asked them to come in and

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.660
to show force.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.660
We needed to make a very

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:16.730
dramatic statement, to calm the

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.730
media down and to calm the

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.700
citizenry down.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.560
There are hundreds of law

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.000
enforcement officers being

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.200
deployed into New Orleans today

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.330
to restore order.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.760
Looting and other lawlessness

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.960
will not be tolerated.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.060
I wanted it to be strong and I

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.060
wanted it to be clear.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.660
These troops know how to shoot

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.200
and kill and they are more than

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.800
willing to do so, if necessary,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.900
and I expect they will.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.730
>> NARRATOR: The mixture of

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.930
rumors and official orders had

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:49.530
an impact at police stations

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.160
around the city.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.660
Five current and former ranking

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.660
officers have told<i> Frontline,</i>

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.460
<i>ProPublica,</i> and the<i> Times-</i>

00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.630
<i>Picayune,</i> on condition of

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.360
anonymity, that they believed

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.760
they had been given authority to

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.130
shoot looters.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.400
They said they did not pass the

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.630
order on.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.600
However at one station, a police

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.030
officer's home videotape

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.860
captured first district Captain

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.360
James Scott telling officers

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.630
quote, "We have authority, by

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:26.930
martial law, to shoot looters."

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.400
Captain Scott initially told us

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.600
he didn't recall the incident

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.360
and declined to comment.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.560
Scott has since hired an

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.060
attorney who told<i> Frontline</i>

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.700
that the rest of the tape puts

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.960
the statement in context, but he

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.960
refused to show it to us.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.560
Had the rules on the use of

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.500
deadly force changed?

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.060
Other officers said orders

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.700
spread from cop to cop.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.560
"Do what you gotta do.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.200
Anything goes.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:11.900
Take the city back."

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.860
>> As I was reporting on Henry

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.430
Glover, I found evidence of

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:16.800
other troubling incidents

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.730
involving the police in the days

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.460
after the storm.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.500
The first of them happened here

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.800
on this overpass on September 1.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:27.830
Just like the Glover story, this

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.360
one involved the SWAT team that

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.760
was camped out at Habans School.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.360
Captain Jeff Winn and his

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.800
lieutenant, Dwayne Scheuermann,

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.900
were told that someone had

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.130
hijacked a water truck.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.360
The story they heard was that

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.730
thieves were robbing, raping and

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.960
killing people.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.330
Winn and Scheuermann rolled out

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.430
through the flooded streets.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:50.860
And near the Superdome, they

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.530
spotted three water trucks.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:54.460
They said a man near one of the

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.660
trucks had a gun.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.830
Both officers took aim.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.060
These pictures show Dwayne

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.230
Scheuermann at the scene.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:10.660
(<i> gunshots</i> )

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.860
They hit the man in the torso--

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.130
but he survived.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.930
His name was Keenon McCann.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.700
And when the cops apprehended

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.500
him there was no gun to be

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.100
found.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.560
The police theorized he might

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.800
have thrown it away-- off the

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.660
overpass.

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.760
Keenon McCann was lucky that

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.030
day.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:33.800
He survived getting shot.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.130
He's since died, but his brother

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.000
and sister-in-law were with him

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.530
on the bridge.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:39.830
They say he didn't have a gun.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.830
That he was stranded there with

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.700
his family.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.960
What do you think happened?

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.400
>> What I think happened, that I

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.700
think they just came out there

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.300
and got the wrong people, or the

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:50.230
wrong person.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.330
Mistakenly shot Keenon for

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.760
nothing.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.430
That's what happened.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:56.600
If he had a gun, why did they

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.230
bring him in Baton Rouge to the

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.230
hospital?

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.430
Brought him there,

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.560
un-handcuffed, he stayed there

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.560
for a minute, and then they cut

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.230
him loose, and let him go free.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:13.400
The system don't work like that.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.860
>> NARRATOR: The local

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.230
prosecutor never brought any

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.760
charges against Keenon McCann.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.930
McCann was the first of at least

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:23.130
10 questionable shootings of

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.330
civilians by police in the week

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.660
after Katrina.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.760
>> They beat me, they beat me.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.430
I ain't never got beat like that

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.530
in my life.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.760
>> NARRATOR: It was the very

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.600
next day that Edward and Will

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.800
Tanner say they were beaten by

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.630
police as Henry Glover bled in

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.030
the back seat of Tanner's car.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.030
>> And what was he wearing at

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.030
the time?

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.830
>> He had the tactical pants.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:44.500
>> Like the dark army kind of

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.730
uniform?

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.360
>> The blue, like a bluish

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.530
black.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.660
>> NARRATOR: Back across the

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.730
river that night, there was

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:53.730
another shooting-- this one at

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:54.530
the New Orleans Convention

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.330
Center.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.430
Danny Brumfield was shot in the

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.230
back by an NOPD officer.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.500
The next day, a 41-year-old

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.030
drifter named Matthew McDonald

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.800
was killed by the police at this

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.930
intersection near the French

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:11.460
Quarter-- also by a single

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.960
gunshot to the back.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.130
And finally, there was the

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.660
incident at Danziger Bridge,

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.030
which has become the most well

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.460
known of the shootings by police

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.230
after Katrina.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:24.530
At the time, the Danziger

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.900
incident seemed to be a victory

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.330
for the police in their fight

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:32.230
against lawlessness.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.930
It was September 4, when word

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.560
went out over the radio that

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.560
officers were under fire near

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.400
the bridge.

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.760
>> The radio just came alive

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.760
with people screaming, gunshots

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.860
in the background.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.960
(<i> gunshots</i> )

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.660
>> We could hear a running gun

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:47.500
battle.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.230
We could hear officers calling

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.260
for assistance.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:49.860
We could hear officers saying

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.000
perpetrator down.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.800
(<i> gunshots</i> )

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.000
>> It sounded like World War

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.230
Three was going on.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.930
>> NARRATOR: By the time gunfire

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.460
stopped, six people had been

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:08.260
shot by the police.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.300
>> The general consensus was

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.060
good guys, one, bad guys, zero.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.430
>> When we found situations

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.560
where the police actually won,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.000
you did a little cha-ching

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.300
because finally they didn't get

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.400
us.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:23.130
We got them.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.130
If indeed people had been

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.530
shooting at police officers,

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.460
then so be it if our police

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.560
officers shot them to stop them.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.530
Of course, that was not the case

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:36.960
we now know.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.730
>> It would take years for the

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.100
truth to be revealed about what

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.360
actually happened on Danziger

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.230
Bridge.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.800
But in 2008, I was still on the

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800
hunt for what had happened to

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.530
Henry Glover.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.800
His brother Edward had last seen

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.900
him bleeding in the back seat of

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.800
Will Tanner's car.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.660
The car was then driven off by a

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.560
police officer and was followed

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.660
by another vehicle allegedly

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.560
driven by Dwayne Scheuermann.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.930
Tanner's car ended up here, just

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.730
a mile away, on the levee.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.330
>> Take a video of me next to

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.030
it.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.500
>> One week later, Istvan, the

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.760
guy with video camera, found the

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.400
burned car and remains.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.730
>> I'm looking back towards that

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.000
transformer.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.400
It was about this distance.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400
>> At the time, he says no one

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.260
seemed to care.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.360
Now you were talking to law

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.000
enforcement folks on a regular

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.830
basis.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.000
Did you bring this up with them?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.630
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.830
Told, you know, the federal

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.530
authorities, told the military,

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.630
told NOPD, told the state

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.760
police.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.230
Everybody knew that there was a

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.060
body down there, but there

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:46.230
wasn't no concern.

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.900
>> The remains stayed on the

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.960
levee another week before

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.730
finally being taken to the

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.100
coroner.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.700
>> What we got was a body bag

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.030
full of bones.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:58.530
>> Frank Minyard is the coroner

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.230
for New Orleans.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.900
>> Cause of death, we don't

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.230
know.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.330
I would guess it would be fire.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.030
But you know, what happened?

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.660
Was he shot?

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.960
Was he hit on the head?

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.960
Did he shoot himself?

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.260
Did he catch himself on fire?

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.030
All of those kind of things, we

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.430
can't say.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.460
There's nothing on the body bag

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.030
that identifies where it came

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.760
from.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.230
There's no tags saying how it

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:29.800
got there.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.330
We never knew the body... that

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.530
those bones came out of a car.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:35.760
>> But forensic pathologist

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.760
Kevin Whaley remembers it

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.260
differently.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.730
Whaley came down from New York

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.900
to help with autopsies after

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.460
Katrina.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.800
He examined Glover's remains.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.230
>> We took the shoulder girdle

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.630
out.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:48.730
>> He says Minyard's own people

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.060
told him where the remains had

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.660
come from.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.700
>> I was told it was found in a

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.660
burnt out car, and this set of

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.060
remains was in it.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.230
And for a forensic pathologist,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.530
I mean, that should be enough.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:00.630
If all you have is a burnt out

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.700
car and remains with this degree

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.630
of disruption and charring,

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.760
that's suspicious.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.360
Typically, the car fires we see,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.300
all the organs are fine, almost

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.530
pristine.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:12.630
You can do a full autopsy just

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.730
like you would anybody else.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:16.930
This state of all that being

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:17.860
gone-- well, that's just really

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.300
out of the ordinary.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.160
That's like Roswell, New Mexico,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160
out of the ordinary kind of

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.730
stuff there.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.430
>> There's a dead body...

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.600
>> Whaley had never seen the

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.530
video of Glover's remains until

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.300
I showed him.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.100
It gave him new reason for

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.460
suspicion.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.830
>> I mean, there's definitely a

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.600
skull here.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.130
Most of the neck is there at the

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.560
base of the skull.

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.830
>> By the time the remains had

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.860
gotten to him, Glover's skull

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:42.030
was gone.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:42.960
>> There's most of a skull

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.800
there.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.130
>> We don't know why the skull

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.330
went missing, but it's possible

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.430
that somebody got rid of the

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:52.730
skull to make it harder to

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.130
identify this guy.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.230
>> Sure, or if there's injuries

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.260
in the skull that you didn't

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.230
want someone to see.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.400
I mean, there's... there'd be a

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.530
whole lot of reasons.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.100
Or it could just have been

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.060
misplaced, but that would be...

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.300
that in and of itself is sort of

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.330
suspicious.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.060
You don't just misplace a skull.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.060
And from here, you... there's a

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.300
skull...

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.060
>> All that together is just

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:12.800
highly suspicious for foul play,

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.560
for a homicide.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.400
>> But coroner Frank Minyard

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.430
never classified the death.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.330
He left that line on Glover's

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.830
autopsy blank.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:25.860
>> A forensic pathologist named

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:27.460
Kevin Whaley from Virginia...

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.600
>> Minyard spoke to<i> Frontline</i>

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.930
reporter Lowell Bergman.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:30.960
>> He said, "My first reaction

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.300
was that it was a homicide.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.400
When I heard he was found in a

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.060
burned-out car, I thought that

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.300
was a classic homicide scenario.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.200
You kill someone and burn the

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:39.960
body to get rid of the

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.160
evidence."

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.200
And I think he said he found

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.200
metal fragments when they

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.730
X-rayed the bags.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.760
>> They did have... one of the

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.960
bones did have some metal

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.430
fragments, which you... which

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.730
you will find when a body is

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.660
burned in a car.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.300
You will find some metal

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.560
fragments, correct.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.430
I really can't talk anymore

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.060
about this because it's a case

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.000
that's active now.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.560
And as far as anything else that

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560
we might have or bring up, we

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.430
have to save that for the proper

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.930
time.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.830
So you understand, I cannot

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.800
comment on what he just said.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.930
>> At the time, in 2005,

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.730
Minyard's blank line meant case

00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:25.260
closed.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.960
The NOPD told me they never did

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.630
their own investigation into the

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.660
remains, and knew nothing else

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.800
about Henry Glover.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.260
But in my own investigation, I

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:37.900
got a break-- a source came to

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.500
me with information about what

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.700
had happened to Henry Glover.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:45.600
And the source had photographs.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.230
The pictures show the whole

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.360
crime scene, and clearly show

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.930
the skull that never made it to

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.500
the coroner.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.860
And my source told me something

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.630
else-- the photos were taken by

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:02.460
the NOPD, by officers at the

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.500
Fourth District station.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.060
It turns out that the spot on

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.960
the levee where the car and

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.060
Henry's body had been torched is

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.330
barely a block away from that

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.560
station.

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.430
Henry's mother Edna didn't know

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.630
that the burnt car was still

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:17.830
just a block away when she came

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:18.930
to this station trying to get

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:23.260
police attention.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.330
It was two and a half months

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.800
after the car had been burned.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.360
Edna Glover still didn't know

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.230
exactly what had happened to her

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.030
son, but she told the police an

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.830
alarming story-- how her son had

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.060
been shot; how her other son,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.430
Edward, had taken Henry to a

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.300
police compound at Habans School

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.630
for help, and instead had been

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.260
beaten by police; and how police

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:45.130
officers had taken the vehicle

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.330
with her son in it.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.530
The police recorded her story as

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.830
a missing persons report and

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.160
filed it away.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.000
>> They told my mother that they

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
were going to get back with her.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.860
They were going to come out to

00:31:58.860 --> 00:31:59.860
her house and talk to her, but

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.760
no one did.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.100
No one called us back.

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.930
We didn't get any answers.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.630
>> Father, we come now, Lord,

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.130
asking you that you would keep

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.500
this sister, this mother, Lord.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.800
>> It would be another eight

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.360
months before Henry's remains

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.000
were finally identified through

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.830
DNA evidence and returned to the

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.660
family for burial.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.500
>> There's one has not come

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.260
home, nor is he above ground.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:26.900
>> I didn't know that they burnt

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.530
him.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.000
My mother told me this, like, a

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.760
day before the funeral.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.300
So I'm thinking I'm going to

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:42.530
kiss him and say good-bye.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.760
>> Thank you, Lord and Master,

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.730
for bringing that situation to

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.930
an end.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.700
Amen.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:58.660
Amen.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.060
>> NARRATOR: For the next year,

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.230
the trail on Henry Glover went

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.860
cold.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:07.100
In the fall of 2009,<i> Frontline</i>

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.800
and<i> ProPublica teamed up with</i>

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.760
the New Orleans<i> Times-Picayune</i>

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.960
to expand the investigation.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.830
Two crime reporters there had

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.760
been breaking stories about the

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.730
Danziger Bridge shootings, which

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.000
had attracted the attention of

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.260
federal investigators.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:24.000
Four people wounded, two dead--

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.630
was it a justified shooting?

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:27.730
>> Officers say there was an

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:28.460
exchange of gunfire on the

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.260
bridge.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.630
The surviving people say that

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.660
they never fired any guns or had

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.860
any guns.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.660
>> NARRATOR: Publicly, the men

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.830
under investigation had the full

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.830
support of their fellow

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.860
officers.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.230
>> A lot of police officers

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.960
think that these aren't fair

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.330
investigations.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.500
If they did something that, in

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.800
retrospect, seems inappropriate,

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.960
they were just trying to deal

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.830
with... with the hand they'd

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.400
been dealt.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.800
>> NARRATOR: Danziger was the

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.200
big story.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.430
But the<i> Times-Picayunereporters</i>

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.300
had also been looking into the

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.730
Glover case.

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.000
They had a simple question: Who

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.700
shot Henry Glover?

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.500
>> There was all these different

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.030
stories running around, and when

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.000
I talked to Henry Glover's

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.660
former girlfriend-- who had

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.900
Henry Glover, Jr., who is now

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.330
13-- she heard a story about

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:18.230
another family member shooting

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.860
him.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.800
I mean, these were all crazy

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.030
allegations.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.560
>> I had my own theory about

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.460
what had happened that day at

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.260
the strip mall.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.460
I thought maybe a storeowner had

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.230
shot him to protect his

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.100
property.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.600
But really, there was only one

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.630
person who could tell me what

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.760
happened, Henry's friend Bernard

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.130
Calloway, who was with Henry

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.060
that day at the mall.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.930
Bernard would never agree to go

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:47.230
on camera, but early in 2010, he

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.560
finally talked to me by phone.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.960
What Bernard said was Henry was

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.030
stealing something.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.800
Henry was picking up goods that

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.400
had been stolen from this

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.300
shopping center, and they were

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.560
in a piece of luggage right

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.460
here.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.730
And that a relative wanted him

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.730
to pick up these stolen goods

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:06.600
that were, like, candles and

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.900
pots and pans.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:10.960
And Bernard and Henry came up

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.100
here in a white pickup truck,

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.330
and they parked it right here.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.400
They get out to pick up this

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.500
stolen stuff and Bernard says,

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:27.460
"I hear 'Leave now' and a shot."

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.060
He couldn't see the person's

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.930
face, but he decided that it was

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:31.830
a police officer that had done

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.700
the shooting.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.100
By the guy's actions, the shot,

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.630
the "Leave now," and his voice,

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:38.630
he thought it was a police

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.730
officer.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.360
He said, "I knew it was a cop.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.030
It was right near the police

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.500
station."

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.660
It turned out that Bernard was

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.560
right about the police station.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.430
Up here on the second floor of

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.630
the mall-- what's now a tattoo

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.530
parlor and hair salon-- was, in

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:55.760
fact, a police substation at the

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.900
time of Katrina.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.760
You can still see the faded

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.900
police decals.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.900
The NOPD denied any reports of a

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.960
police shooting that day.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.030
But my colleagues at the<i> Times-</i>

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:09.660
<i>Picayune</i> found that wasn't

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:10.960
true.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.130
The evidence?

00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.260
A police report of the incident

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.700
that had been buried for more

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.060
than four years.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.260
It said there had been a

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.460
shooting that day, and it

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.460
involved a 42-year-old rookie

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:27.360
cop named David Warren.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.900
On September 2, 2005-- the day

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.860
Henry Glover was shot-- Warren

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.730
was on duty at the strip mall

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.530
police substation.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:36.700
The report gave his version of

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.030
events.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.000
He said in the police report, he

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.100
came out of this office because

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:44.860
he heard a ruckus.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:45.900
He heard a truck being driven

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.730
really kind of fast and

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.300
erratically.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.960
He thought these men in the

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.860
truck were menacing him.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.800
He was scared for his life, so

00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:01.500
he opened fire.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.600
My sense would be that Officer

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.830
Warren is coming over here, he's

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.300
coming this a way, looking down

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.030
and firing.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.230
He says he doesn't know if he

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.900
hit anybody, he doesn't know if

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:13.500
anybody was injured.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.530
It's a short distance.

00:37:15.530 --> 00:37:16.660
If you are from here to there, I

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.330
think it would be hard not to

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.460
know whether you hit the person

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.660
or not.

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.260
It's pretty clean line of sight

00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:26.660
right down there.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:28.100
Henry had been shot, Bernard

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.360
told me, right next to the

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.060
truck.

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:31.730
And where you think the truck

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:33.460
was?

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.360
>> No, the truck was... excuse

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.630
me, the truck was over here.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.230
The truck was... the truck was

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.030
here.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.560
>> Edward's memory of what he

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.430
saw that day made Warren's

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.300
account even more confounding.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:44.960
>> The truck was here.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:45.760
>> The truck was right here?

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.100
>> The truck was here, parked

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.060
this way.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:50.760
>> So the truck was right here.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.700
>> The truck was parked here,

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.030
this way.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.230
>> So, if the truck is parked

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.600
right here, and the guy is up

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.530
there, you're probably going to

00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.230
see if you shot someone who's

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.330
standing right here.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:01.160
>> You could.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:01.830
>> See, I thought he was further

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.600
out that way.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.930
>> No, he was here.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.200
>> After Henry Glover was shot,

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.460
he stumbled about 50 yards down

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.300
the street.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.700
That's where Will Tanner picked

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.330
him up, and then raced to Habans

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:18.730
Elementary School where Tanner

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.730
thought they would give Glover

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.830
medical attention.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:22.630
I mean, when you picked him up,

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.300
did you think he had a chance of

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:24.300
living?

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.500
>> Yeah, he had a chance.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.730
He still was talking.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:27.300
And, you know, he still was

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.960
breathing.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.930
So I thought maybe I'll get him

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.100
some medical attention, he might

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.960
be able to, you know, point the

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.930
person out who shot him.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.030
These guys, boys in blue, are

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:38.700
supposed to help out, you know.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.660
All a sudden, I seen a different

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.930
boys in blue.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:43.900
>> So, if you'd known he'd been

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.660
shot by a police officer, you

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:45.500
wouldn't have brought him here,

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.760
probably.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.960
>> No, I wouldn't have brought

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.460
him here, because I knew if I'd

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.030
brought him here, I wouldn't

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:52.300
stand a snowball's chance if I

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.230
knew he got shot by a cop.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.430
>> The men say they were

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.400
handcuffed and beaten until

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.130
finally a female officer

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.730
intervened.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.130
>> A lady come out.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:03.900
She recognized Tanner.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.730
She said, "I know him.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:05.660
I know him.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.200
What did he do?"

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.760
He said, one of the guys said,

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.360
"Oh, those niggers over there

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.100
are looting."

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.900
I said, "Looting?"

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.100
>> They thought that we was

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:15.760
looters and everything like

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.300
that.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:20.300
When they searched my car, they

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.200
didn't find nothing new or

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.360
nothing like that.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.600
But they was curious.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:25.700
>> NARRATOR: What do the police

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.630
at the elementary school say

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:30.430
happened there that day?

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.630
Because of the federal

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:32.730
investigation, they wouldn't

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.600
speak to us for this program.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.760
The only account is this

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.630
unfinished police report that

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.600
<i>Times-Picayune</i> reporter Laura

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.960
Maggi uncovered.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.060
In it, police officers say that,

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.360
when the car drove into the

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.300
school, it was being driven

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.660
erratically and being chased by

00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.030
police cars.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:51.700
It says the man in the backseat

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.660
was already dead, and that the

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.460
other men refused to cooperate

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.030
with police.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.630
They say they handcuffed the

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.730
men, but say nothing of any

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:04.730
beating.

00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:06.130
The account says nothing about

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.760
burning the car or the body, but

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.700
it does say they drove the car

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.400
to the levee behind the Fourth

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.230
District police station.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:16.100
They say they were securing the

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.230
body until it could be brought

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.830
to a makeshift morgue for an

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.130
autopsy.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.660
>> The question is, if they

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.400
indeed did want to secure the

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.560
body that why they didn't

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.460
subsequently come back and write

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.330
a report and say, "Hey, we have

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.660
this shot person and maybe this

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:34.460
person's a... a crime victim.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.130
We should find something out

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:39.130
about that."

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.000
>> NARRATOR: It turns out that

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.630
the author of the unfinished

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.300
Glover report had also signed

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.430
off on the police account of the

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:48.030
incident at Danziger Bridge, a

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:49.730
report that federal prosecutors

00:40:49.730 --> 00:41:00.330
now say was largely fabricated.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.600
>> Today, six New Orleans police

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.960
officers...

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.830
>> NARRATOR: In July, six NOPD

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.030
officers were indicted in the

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.060
Danziger Bridge case.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.460
>> ...resulting from the federal

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.930
criminal investigations...

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:12.260
>> NARRATOR: In its

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.730
investigation, the FBI

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:14.560
reconstructed what the police at

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.460
the scene say happened that day.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.930
The incident began when a group

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.560
of NOPD officers commandeered a

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.060
Budget rental truck to respond

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:25.930
to a distress call on the

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.830
bridge.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.000
They say they heard on the radio

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.100
that officers were under fire.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.360
One officer says he fired

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.860
warning shots out of the truck's

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.700
window.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.930
Almost immediately, the other

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.030
officers poured out of the

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:46.960
truck, guns firing.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.600
But federal prosecutors now say

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.600
there's no evidence the police

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.060
were under threat.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.000
In fact, the police were firing

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.160
on unarmed civilians, Katrina

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.560
survivors searching for food and

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.900
medicine.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:03.500
NOPD officers killed two people

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.900
and wounded four that day.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.530
Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.060
mentally disabled man, was shot

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.930
in the back, and then repeatedly

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:17.600
kicked as he was dying.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.360
Jose Holmes was 19 at the time.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.630
He doesn't know how many times

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.860
he was shot.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.460
>> I just felt pain rush to my

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.730
arm.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.030
Horrible.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:33.000
Like World War II or something.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.230
And then, it was for a long

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.000
time, I thought it wasn't going

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.460
to stop.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.060
I thought it was the end so, I

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:41.900
just... I didn't know what to

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.860
think.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.800
>> NARRATOR: Jose was lucky to

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.630
survive.

00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:46.730
His 17-year-old friend, James

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:52.260
Brisette, died next to him.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.860
Despite the brutality, police

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.230
defenders say it was a confusing

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.500
time in post-Katrina New

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.000
Orleans.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.300
>> People want to look at what

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.830
an officer did based on normal

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.860
times.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.230
Believe me, you know, during the

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:08.360
Katrina days, we weren't living

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.130
in the real world; we were

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.000
living in a holocaust.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.360
We were living in a situation

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.460
that no other police department

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.700
ever had to endure.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.660
>> We do have to understand what

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.230
happened here, and we have to

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.300
understand the pressures that

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.400
were on this department.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.730
We have to understand the chaos

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:25.930
that existed internally and

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:26.930
externally, and we have to

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:27.860
understand all the conditions

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.060
that led up to this.

Madison, who was among those on

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:38.830
the bridge that day.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.700
times of crisis, that's when

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:43.960
your training's supposed to kick

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.760
in, that's when this stuff is

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.960
supposed to be so ingrained in

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:47.960
you that you don't even have to

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.430
think about it, because that's

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:51.630
your default.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.400
So you have to ask why do some

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.160
people have that default and act

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.400
appropriately and conduct

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.260
themselves professionally, even

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:00.700
without, you know, all the

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:06.360
apparatus around them, and why

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.400
did some lose their bearings?

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.560
And then, that raises the

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.600
question-- well, were they

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.600
losing their bearings, or had

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.730
this been their default all

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:13.060
along?

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.430
>> FBI agents had kept a close

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:15.430
eye on Fifth District officer

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:16.700
Len Davis.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.900
>> NARRATOR: The history of

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.100
scandal in the New Orleans

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.030
Police Department goes back many

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.360
decades before Katrina.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.500
>> They'd hoped to have snared

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.560
as many as 25 bad cops.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.230
They netted nine suspects.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.860
>> NARRATOR: A noxious

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:27.630
combination of corruption and

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.060
brutality that peaked in the

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.030
1990s.

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:32.130
>> We had police officers doing

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.560
bank robberies.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.330
We had police officers involved

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:38.000
in arson, rape, kidnapping.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.460
We used to say that people in

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:40.260
New Orleans were more afraid of

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.330
the police than they were the

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:43.360
criminals, and it was hard to

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.700
tell the difference.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.700
>> I know police officers that

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:50.300
killed people.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.060
I know police officers that

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.500
robbed people, ripped off drug

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:53.430
dealers.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.700
I mean, it goes on and on.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.830
>> NARRATOR: Mike Thames was an

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:57.030
NOPD officer in the '80s and

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.160
'90s before being arrested

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.460
himself for bank robbery.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.760
>> A couple of times, I was

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.930
investigated.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.760
But 99% of the time, I was

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.230
told... they'll warn you, like,

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.030
"Hey, Mike, you're being watched

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.400
for this," or "Hey, Mike,

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400
they're going to call you in for

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.230
this, so get your story

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.060
straight."

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.400
>> NARRATOR: The culture of

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.730
lawlessness ran so deep that

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.030
historic divisions of race

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:21.060
seemed forgotten.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.430
It wasn't black or white; it was

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.260
blue.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.460
>> Some black officers look at

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:26.330
themselves more as blue than

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:27.660
black.

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.660
You adopt the culture of a

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.230
police officer as opposed to

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:32.260
"I'm a black cop" or "I'm a

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.260
white cop."

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:36.560
"No, I'm just a cop."

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:38.630
>> NARRATOR: But in 1994, New

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.800
Orleans got a new police chief,

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.330
Richard Pennington, brought in

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:42.760
from Washington, D.C., with new

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.230
ideas.

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.900
>> Most citizens are afraid.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.530
That's why they don't call us.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.860
Because they feel if they call

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:49.630
us, we're not going to do

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:50.830
anything to protect them.

00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:51.860
>> Pennington comes in as an

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.300
outsider.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.160
Fired police officers,

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:59.900
instituted integrity checks.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:00.760
He just professionalized the

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.830
police department.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.960
He brings it into the 20th

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.730
century.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:04.730
>> NARRATOR: The Pennington era

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:06.100
didn't last.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.530
In 2002, Pennington ran for

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.230
mayor, without support of the

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.400
police, and lost to Ray Nagin.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.730
>> Nagin gets in office and he

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.800
chooses to appoint a good street

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.560
cop, Eddie Compass, as chief of

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.360
police.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.260
>> Chief Pennington did an

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.560
outstanding job as it relates to

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.500
getting the police department in

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:25.830
the right direction.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:26.600
I tried to continue that in

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.000
vein.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.430
>> And so the... the discipline,

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:30.660
the Internal Affairs reviews,

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.760
that kind of stuff that Chief

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.660
Pennington set up...

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.000
>> We kept those things in

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.760
place.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.230
>> NARRATOR: But under Compass,

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.230
investigations of complaints

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.560
against officers dropped

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.030
dramatically.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.460
>> The threat of officers losing

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.600
their jobs leaves with

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.230
Pennington.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.130
The NOPD reverts back to what it

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.560
knows.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.630
It reverts back to what's

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.730
comfortable, what's convenient,

00:46:53.730 --> 00:46:55.400
and to what the existing culture

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.500
has always been.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.530
>> Almost immediately, you saw,

00:46:58.530 --> 00:46:59.700
discipline stopped,

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.360
accountability stopped.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.000
By the time we came to Katrina,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.560
this department was, I would

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.730
say, in as bad a shape as we had

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:12.600
been in 1994.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.430
And that storm stripped bare any

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.830
pretense that there was any

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:20.130
structure, any accountability,

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.360
any of the... the skeleton that

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.960
you would expect of an

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.230
organization like a police

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.500
department.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.860
It all vanished.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.960
"The courts are gone, the jails

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.660
are gone.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.730
It's up to us.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:38.960
And we're going to, 'Do what we

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:46.260
have to do and move on'."

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.500
>> NARRATOR: According to

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.700
officers who have pled guilty in

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:49.700
the Danziger Bridge case, a

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.460
cover-up of the killings began

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.100
almost immediately.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.730
>> A lieutenant told the

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:55.660
officers involved in the

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.230
shooting to get their stories

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:57.530
straight.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:01.060
There were secret meetings held.

00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.930
One man is accused of getting a

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:05.400
gun from his house and filing it

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.930
into the court record as being a

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.930
gun that was used by civilians

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:12.500
on the bridge that day.

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.460
>> NARRATOR: A court document

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.730
called a Bill of Information

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.300
says the planted gun was

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.800
referred to by the detective as

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.900
a "ham sandwich."

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.630
>> Every cop that I knew carried

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.760
a ham sandwich.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.800
A ham sandwich is a... a clean

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.930
gun that they would take and put

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:31.560
it in like an old pair of jeans

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.500
or britches or whatever you want

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:33.930
to call it.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:34.730
And they'd let it sit there and

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:36.560
get some lint on it.

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.530
Then after they let it sit in

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:38.530
there, then you put it in a

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.460
plastic bag.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.060
I carried mine with me wherever

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.430
I went.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:43.100
Some people don't carry it with

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.660
them.

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:45.500
>> So you'd have it under the

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.100
seat of your car or something?

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.100
>> No, I had a briefcase.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:48.300
I carried it in my briefcase.

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.960
>> So you carried around a gun

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.300
to plant on suspects?

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.400
>> Yeah, of course.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.530
>> Some former officers we've

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.530
talked to have said, "Hey, this

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.830
was an underground culture."

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.160
They would carry around

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.330
something they called a "ham

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:02.460
sandwich," and they would plant

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.160
that "ham sandwich" at the scene

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:05.730
of officer-involved shootings.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:06.330
Did you ever hear anything about

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.430
that?

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.030
>> Nope.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.430
That's not on my radar.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:12.530
Nothing about that.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.400
Like I said, that investigation

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:14.060
was done under Chief Riley's

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.530
watch.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.600
>> I mean, over time... I mean,

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.300
this was handed down.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.760
>> As I'm telling you, I mean,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:21.460
you know, I don't really recall

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:22.100
ever having those type of

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.300
conversations.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.600
I'm telling you straight up.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.300
>> When was the first time you

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.060
ever heard the term "ham

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.500
sandwich?"

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.930
>> In that Bill of Information.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.300
>> You never heard of a "ham

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.730
sandwich" before then?

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:36.930
>> Never heard.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:37.800
Within NOPD, you have several

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.760
different cultures as well.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:40.600
And that was a culture I was not

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.300
a part of.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:51.360
I had never heard that before.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.400
>> A short while ago, a federal

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.230
grand jury returned an 11-count

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.560
indictment charging five

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.230
individuals...

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:00.260
>> NARRATOR: Federal indictments

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.130
in the Henry Glover case were

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:02.660
handed up in June.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:03.930
>> ... former NOPD officers,

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:04.760
three current NOPD officers

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.400
with...

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.760
>> NARRATOR: It had been over

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.460
two years since reporter A.C.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.230
Thompson came across the story

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.360
of Henry Glover's burnt body.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.630
At the end of 2008, he published

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:20.130
the first of many articles.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:21.560
>> Your article that identified

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.860
the shooting death and the

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.130
burning of Henry Glover acted

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.100
as... as an incredible catalyst

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.230
and a lead for us in our

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.560
investigation.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.500
The shooting and killing Henry

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:32.960
Glover...

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.130
>> NARRATOR: Five police

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.500
officers were charged with 11

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.260
federal civil rights violations,

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.530
each count telling a piece of

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:40.000
the story about Henry Glover's

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.700
demise.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.630
Federal prosecutors say Officer

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:47.360
David Warren used an assault

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.800
rifle to shoot and kill Henry

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.260
Glover.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.130
he charge is murder.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:56.360
Warren refused to comment.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.160
Prosecutors charged Dwayne

00:50:58.160 --> 00:50:59.560
Scheuermann and another officer

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.330
with using unreasonable force in

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:02.260
the beating of Edward King and

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:06.060
Will Tanner.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.730
Scheuermann, who refused to

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.100
comment on the Glover incident,

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.660
is also charged with setting

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.960
fire to Will Tanner's car with

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.300
Henry Glover's body in the back

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.900
seat.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.100
And just as in Danziger, the

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.960
indictments allege a cover-up.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.330
>> In two instances, we've seen

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:26.430
at least indicators of a cover-

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.130
up.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:29.660
How far that goes, I honestly

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.400
don't know.

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:33.560
>> NARRATOR: The indictments

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.760
charge two officers from the

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.630
Fourth District station.

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:38.900
They say the men knew that

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.360
Warren had shot Glover;

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.560
they knew Glover had been taken

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.800
to the Habans School;

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.400
they knew Glover's body had been

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.430
burned on the levee.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.760
Prosecutors said the police knew

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.230
all of this from the beginning;

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.560
they just conspired to keep it

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:58.160
hidden.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.700
>> How did you feel when,

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.300
finally, somebody from law

00:52:01.300 --> 00:52:02.830
enforcement came to you and

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:03.600
said, "We want to know what

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.700
happened that day?"

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:08.430
>> Ooh, man, that day, this lady

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:12.500
come knocking on the door, I

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.230
said, "Oh, Lord done answered my

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.800
prayer."

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.230
I said, "He done answered my

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.030
prayers."

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:21.460
And I said, "Thank you, Lord."

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.600
And like I told her, I said I

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.500
never thought they had people

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.330
out there who will go after

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.230
them.

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:28.260
But she told me she's going

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.460
to... she said, "I promise you,

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:36.630
you're going to get justice."

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:37.430
That's wrong what they did to my

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:38.430
brother.

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:40.300
That's wrong.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:42.860
My mind is messed up.

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.430
Every time I pass by that

00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:46.460
school, I get flashbacks.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.230
Sometimes, I dream about it.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:50.130
I was thinking, after a while,

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.560
it'd go away.

00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.600
It's not going away.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:56.860
I used to scare my wife waking

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:57.860
up on the side of her in deep

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:01.230
sweats.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:03.760
I forgive that police officer.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.400
I forgive him with all my heart,

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.830
because if I don't, God ain't

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:08.860
going to forgive me when I do

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:10.900
something wrong.

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.230
I forgive him.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.300
I forgive him.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:14.900
And I'm trying to deal with this

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.530
every day.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.660
It's hard, man.

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.960
Feel like something just is

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.560
gone, that I had in my heart is

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.400
gone.

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.660
I ain't going to get it.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:26.830
I can't see him no more, can't

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:27.960
do the things we normally do,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.560
you know.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.800
I miss my brother.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:51.230
I miss him.
