00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:34.930


2
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.530
I come no more to make you laugh:

3
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830
things now, that bear a weighty

4
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.730
and a serious brow,

5
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.230
Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,

6
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.800
Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,

7
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.770
We now present.

8
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.900
Those that can pity, here may,

9
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.170
if they think it well, let fall a tear;

10
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.630
The subject will deserve it.

11
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.100
Such as give their money out of hope

12
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830
they may believe,

13
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.470
May here find truth too. Those that come to see

14
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.800
Only a show or two, and so agree the play may pass,

15
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.830
if they be still and willing,

16
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.070
I'll undertake may see away

17
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.900
their shilling richly in two short hours.

18
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.700
Only they that come to hear a merry bawdy play,

19
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.370
A noise of targets,

20
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.370
or to see a fellow

21
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.870
in a long motley coat guarded with yellow,

22
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630
Will be deceived;

23
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.430
for, gentle hearers, know,

24
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.700
To rank our chosen truth with such a show

25
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000
As fool and fight is,

26
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.430
beside forfeiting our own brains,

27
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.800
and the opinion that we bring,

28
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.200
to make that only true we now intend,

29
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000
will leave us never an understanding friend.

30
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.900
Therefore, for goodness' sake,

31
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.530
and as you are known the first

32
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.430
and happiest hearers of the town,

33
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.970
Be sad, as we would make ye:

34
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.300
think ye see the very persons of our noble story

35
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.500
As they were living;

36
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.730
think you see them great,

37
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.370
And follow'd with the general throng

38
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.870
and sweat of thousand friends; then in a moment,

39
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.470
see how soon this mightiness meets misery:

40
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.400
And, if you can be merry then, I'll say

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

42
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.100
Good morrow, and well met.

43
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.400
How have ye done since last we saw in France?

44
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.470
I thank your grace,

45
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.730
Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer

46
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.930
of what I saw there.

47
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.770
An untimely ague stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber

48
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.500
when those suns of glory, those two lights of men,

49
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.730
Met in the vale of Andren.

50
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.100
'Twixt Guynes and Arde:

51
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.570
I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;

52
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.800
Beheld them, when they lighted,

53
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.470
how they clung in their embracement,

54
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.930
as they grew together;

55
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.630
Which had they, what four throned ones

56
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.900
could have weigh'd such a compounded one?

57
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.370
All the whole time I was my chamber's prisoner.

58
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.470
Then you lost the view of earthly glory:

59
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.200
men might say,

60
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.100
Till this time pomp was single,

61
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.300
but now married to one above itself.

62
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.700
Each following day became the next day's master,

63
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.370
till the last made former wonders its.

64
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.870
To-day the French,

65
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.630
All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,

66
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.930
Shone down the English; and, to-morrow,

67
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.230
they made Britain India:

68
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.800
every man that stood show'd like a mine.

69
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.430
Their dwarfish pages were as cherubins, all guilt:

70
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.830
The two kings, equal in lustre,

71
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.200
were now best, now worst,

72
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.430
As presence did present them; him in eye,

73
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.900
Still him in praise: and, being present both

74
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.600
'Twas said they saw but one;

75
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.200
and no discerner durst wag his tongue in censure.

76
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.430
When these suns-- for so they phrase 'em--

77
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.330
by their heralds challenged the noble spirits to arms,

78
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.130
they did perform beyond thought's compass

79
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.800
O, you go far.

80
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.370
As I belong to worship and affect in honour honesty,

81
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.300
the tract of every thing

82
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.170
would by a good discourser lose some life,

83
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.500
Which action's self was tongue to.

84
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.230
All was royal;

85
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.900
to the disposing of it nought rebell'd.

86
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.930
Order gave each thing view;

87
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.830
the office did distinctly his full function.

88
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.730
Who did guide,

89
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.270
I mean, who set the body and the limbs

90
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.170
Of this great sport together, as you guess?

91
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.230
One, certes, that promises no element

92
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.630
in such a business.

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.430
I pray you, who, my lord?

94
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.000
All this was order'd by the good discretion

95
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.670
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

96
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.530
The devil speed him!

97
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.030
no man's pie is freed from his ambitious finger.

98
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.000
What had he to do in these fierce vanities?

99
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.630
I wonder that such a keech can with his very bulk

100
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.530
Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun

101
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.500
and keep it from the earth.

102
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.600
Surely, sir,

103
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.300
There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;

104
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.330
For, being not propp'd by ancestry,

105
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.500
whose grace chalks successors their way,

106
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.400
nor call'd upon for high feats done to the crown;

107
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.800
neither allied for eminent assistants;

108
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.870
but, spider-like,

109
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.130
Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,

110
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.570
The force of his own merit makes his way

111
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.100
A gift that heaven gives for him,

112
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.870
which buys a place next to the king.

113
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.970
I cannot tell what heaven hath given him,

114
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.670
--let some graver eye pierce into that;

115
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.530
but I can see his pride peep through each part of him:

116
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.400
whence has he that, if not from hell?

117
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.630
the devil is a niggard,

118
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.170
Or has given all before,

119
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.200
and he begins a new hell in himself.

120
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200
Why the devil,

121
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.400
Upon this French going out, took he upon him,

122
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.630
Without the privity o' the king,

123
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.770
to appoint who should attend on him?

124
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.600
He makes up the file of all the gentry;

125
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.730
for the most part such to whom

126
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.300
as great a charge as little honour

127
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.400
He meant to lay upon:

128
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.470
I do know Kinsmen of mine, three at the least,

129
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.500
that have by this so sickened their estates,

130
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.600
that never they shall abound as formerly.

131
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.230
O, many have broke their backs

132
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.570
with laying manors on 'em

133
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.400
For this great journey.

134
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.230
Grievingly I think, the peace between the French and us

135
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.430
not values the cost that did conclude it.

136
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.600
Every man, after the hideous storm that follow'd,

137
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.300
was a thing inspired; and, not consulting,

138
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.930
broke into a general prophecy;

139
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.900
That this tempest,

140
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.470
Dashing the garment of this peace,

141
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.270
aboded the sudden breach on't.

142
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.270
Which is budded out;

143
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.930
For France hath flaw'd the league,

144
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.870
and hath attach'd our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.

145
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.700
Is it therefore the ambassador is silenced?

146
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.600
Marry, is't.

147
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.230
A proper title of a peace;

148
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.070
and purchased at a superfluous rate!

149
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.300
Why, all this business our reverend cardinal carried.

150
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.370
Like it your grace,

151
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.130
The state takes notice of the private difference

152
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.770
Betwixt you and the cardinal.

153
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.570
I advise you-- And take it from a heart

154
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.870
that wishes towards you honour and plenteous safety

155
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.470
--that you read the cardinal's malice

156
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.300
and his potency together; to consider further

157
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.670
that what his high hatred would effect

158
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.170
wants not a minister in his power.

159
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.000
You know his nature, that he's revengeful,

160
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.400
and I know his sword hath a sharp edge:

161
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.570
it's long and, 't may be said, it reaches far,

162
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.330
and where 'twill not extend, thither he darts it.

163
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.070
Bosom up my counsel, you'll find it wholesome.

164
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.170
Lo, where comes that rock that I advise your shunning.

165
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.430
The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?

166
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.100
Where's his examination?

167
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.870
Here, so please you.

168
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.070
Is he in person ready?

169
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.900
Ay, please your grace.

170
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.430
Well, we shall then know more;

171
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.830
and Buckingham shall lessen this big look.

172
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.300
This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd,

173
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.730
and I have not the power to muzzle him;

174
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.330
therefore best not wake him in his slumber.

175
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.870
A beggar's book outworths a noble's blood.

176
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.770
What, are you chafed?

177
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.200
Ask God for temperance;

178
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.400
that's the appliance only which your disease requires.

179
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.270
I read in's looks matter against me;

180
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.500
and his eye reviled me, as his abject object:

181
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.670
at this instant he bores me with some trick:

182
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.100
he's gone to the king; I'll follow and outstare him.

183
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.000
Stay, my lord,

184
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.070
And let your reason with your choler question

185
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.500
What 'tis you go about:

186
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.170
to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first:

187
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.830
anger is like a full-hot horse,

188
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.870
who being allow'd his way,

189
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.370
Self-mettle tires him.

190
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.970
Not a man in England can advise me like you:

191
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.900
be to yourself as you would to your friend.

192
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.830
I'll to the king; and from a mouth of honour

193
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.400
quite cry down this Ipswich fellow's insolence;

194
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.600
or proclaim there's difference in no persons.

195
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.730
Be advised;

196
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.000
Heat not a furnace for your foe

197
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.570
so hot that it do singe yourself:

198
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.500
we may outrun, by violent swiftness,

199
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.600
that which we run at,

200
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.500
And lose by over-running.

201
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.800
Be advised: I say again,

202
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.630
there is no English soul more stronger

203
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.330
to direct you than yourself,

204
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.000
If with the sap of reason you would quench,

205
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.770
Or but allay, the fire of passion.

206
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.930
Sir, I am thankful to you;

207
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.770
and I'll go along by your prescription:

208
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.600
but this top-proud fellow,

209
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.530
whom from the flow of gall I name not

210
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.030
but from sincere motions, by intelligence,

211
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.500
And proofs as clear as founts in July

212
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.470
when we see each grain of gravel,

213
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.670
I do know to be corrupt and treasonous.

214
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.700
Say not 'treasonous.'

215
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.100
To the king I'll say't;

216
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.830
and make my vouch as strong as shore of rock.

217
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.200
Attend. This holy fox, or wolf, or both,

218
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.970
--for he is equal ravenous as he is subtle,

219
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.900
and as prone to mischief as able to perform't;

220
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.970
his mind and place infecting one another,

221
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.300
yea, reciprocally--

222
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.270
Only to show his pomp

223
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.070
as well in France as here at home,

224
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.230
suggests the king our master

225
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.900
to this last costly treaty,

226
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.870
the interview, that swallow'd so much treasure,

227
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.570
and like a glass did break i' the rinsing.

228
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.500
Faith, and so it did.

229
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Pray, give me favour, sir.

230
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.630
This cunning cardinal

231
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.130
The articles o' the combination drew

232
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.270
as himself pleased;

233
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.400
and they were ratified as he cried 'Thus let be':

234
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.170
to as much end as give a crutch to the dead:

235
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.700
Now this follows,-- which, as I take it,

236
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.400
is a kind of puppy to the old dam, treason,

237
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.330
--Charles the emperor,

238
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.170
under pretence to see the queen his aunt--

239
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.330
For 'twas indeed his colour,

240
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.900
but he came to whisper Wolsey,

241
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.300
--here makes visitation:

242
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.430
His fears were,

243
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.730
that the interview betwixt England and France might,

244
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.030
through their amity, breed him some prejudice;

245
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.570
for from this league peep'd harms that menaced him:

246
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.330
he privily deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--

247
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.400
Which I do well;

248
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
for I am sure the emperor paid ere he promised;

249
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.900
whereby his suit was granted ere it was ask'd;

250
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.430
but when the way was made, and paved with gold,

251
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.970
the emperor thus desired,

252
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.900
that he would please to alter the king's course,

253
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.900
And break the foresaid peace.

254
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.330
Let the king know,

255
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.470
As soon he shall by me,

256
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.600
that thus the cardinal does buy and sell his honour

257
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.600
as he pleases, and for his own advantage.

258
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.870
I am sorry to hear this of him;

259
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.670
and could wish he were something mistaken in't.

260
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.870
No, not a syllable:

261
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.170
I do pronounce him in that very shape

262
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.170
he shall appear in proof.

263
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.930
Your office, sergeant; execute it.

264
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.530
Sir, my lord the Duke of Buckingham,

265
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.570
and Earl of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton,

266
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.630
I arrest thee of high treason,

267
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.200
in the name of our most sovereign king.

268
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.800
Lo, you, my lord,

269
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.300
The net has fall'n upon me!

270
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.030
I shall perish under device and practise.

271
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.600
I am sorry to see you ta'en from liberty,

272
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.330
to look on the business present:

273
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.370
'tis his highness' pleasure

274
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.200
You shall to the Tower.

275
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.130
It will help me nothing to plead mine innocence;

276
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.470
for that dye is on me

277
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.470
which makes my whitest part black.

278
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.100
The will of heaven be done in this and all things!

279
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.200
I obey.

280
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.200
O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!

281
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.370
Nay, he must bear you company.

282
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.130
The king is pleased you shall to the Tower,

283
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.570
till you know how he determines further.

284
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.270
As the duke said, the will of heaven be done,

285
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.770
and the king's pleasure by me obey'd!

286
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.430
Here is a warrant from the king

287
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.600
to attach Lord Montacute;

288
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.270
and the bodies of the duke's confessor,

289
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.170
John de la Car,

290
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.170
One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--

291
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.630
So, so; These are the limbs o' the plot:

292
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.800
no more, I hope.

293
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.770
A monk o' the Chartreux.

294
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.730
O, Nicholas Hopkins?

295
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.330
He.

296
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.500
My surveyor is false;

297
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.100
the o'er-great cardinal hath show'd him gold;

298
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.970
my life is spann'd already:

299
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.600
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,

300
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.330
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,

301
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.100
by darkening my clear sun.

302
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.030
My lord, farewell.

303
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.700
My life itself, and the best heart of it,

304
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.630
Thanks you for this great care:

305
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.900
I stood i' the level of a full-charged confederacy,

306
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.200
and give thanks to you that choked it.

307
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.870
Let be call'd before us that gentleman of Buckingham's;

308
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.700
in person I'll hear him his confessions justify;

309
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.230
And point by point the treasons

310
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.330
of his master he shall again relate.

311
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.570
'Room for the Queen!'

312
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.600
Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.

313
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.330
Arise, and take place by us:

314
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.930
half your suit never name to us;

315
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.970
you have half our power: the other moiety,

316
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.600
ere you ask, is given;

317
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.530
Repeat your will and take it.

318
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.330
Thank your majesty.

319
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.530
That you would love yourself,

320
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.030
and in that love not unconsider'd

321
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.830
leave your honour,

322
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.570
nor the dignity of your office,

323
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.970
is the point of my petition.

324
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.670
Lady mine, proceed.

325
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.430
I am solicited, not by a few,

326
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.700
And those of true condition,

327
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.330
that your subjects are in great grievance:

328
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.230
there have been commissions sent down among 'em,

329
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.700
which hath flaw'd the heart of all their loyalties:

330
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.430
wherein, although, my good lord cardinal,

331
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.970
they vent reproaches most bitterly on you,

332
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.630
as putter on of these exactions,

333
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.930
yet the king our master

334
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.400
-- whose honour heaven shield from soil!

335
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.600
--even he escapes not language unmannerly,

336
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.300
yea, such which breaks the sides of loyalty,

337
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.900
and almost appears in loud rebellion.

338
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.570
Not almost appears,

339
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.370
It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,

340
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.800
The clothiers all,

341
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.200
not able to maintain the many to them longing,

342
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.500
have put off the spinsters,

343
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.730
carders, fullers, weavers, who,

344
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.170
Unfit for other life,

345
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.770
compell'd by hunger and lack of other means,

346
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.830
in desperate manner daring the event to the teeth,

347
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.270
are all in uproar, and danger serves among then!

348
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.700
Taxation! Wherein? and what taxation?

349
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.630
My lord cardinal,

350
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.100
You that are blamed for it alike with us,

351
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.670
know you of this taxation?

352
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.400
Please you, sir,

353
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.600
I know but of a single part,

354
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.570
in aught pertains to the state;

355
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.000
and front but in that file

356
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.130
where others tell steps with me.

357
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.330
No, my lord, You know no more than others;

358
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.370
but you frame things that are known alike;

359
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.230
which are not wholesome

360
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.570
to those which would not know them,

361
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.800
and yet must perforce be their acquaintance.

362
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.600
These exactions, whereof my sovereign would have note,

363
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.330
they are most pestilent to the bearing;

364
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.300
and, to bear 'em, the back is sacrifice to the load.

365
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.070
They say they are devised by you;

366
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.800
or else you suffer too hard an exclamation.

367
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.870
Still exaction! The nature of it?

368
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.700
in what kind, let's know, Is this exaction?

369
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.700
I am much too venturous in tempting of your patience;

370
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.170
but am bolden'd under your promised pardon.

371
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.130
The subjects' grief comes through commissions,

372
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.030
which compel from each the sixth part of his substance,

373
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.470
to be levied without delay;

374
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.070
and the pretence for this is named,

375
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.030
your wars in France:

376
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.370
this makes bold mouths:

377
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.170
tongues spit their duties out,

378
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.770
and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them;

379
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.770
their curses now live where their prayers did:

380
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.600
and it's come to pass,

381
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.470
this tractable obedience is a slave

382
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.070
to each incensed will.

383
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.900
I would your highness

384
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.030
would give it quick consideration,

385
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.470
for there is no primer business.

386
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.030
By my life, this is against our pleasure.

387
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.870
And for me, I have no further gone in this

388
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.200
than by a single voice;

389
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.600
and that not pass'd me

390
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.300
but by learned approbation of the judges.

391
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.570
If I am Traduced by ignorant tongues,

392
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.700
which neither know my faculties nor person,

393
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.300
yet will be the chronicles of my doing,

394
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.530
let me say 'tis but the fate of place,

395
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.200
and the rough brake that virtue must go through.

396
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.300
We must not stint our necessary actions,

397
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.030
in the fear to cope malicious censurers;

398
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.800
which ever, as ravenous fishes,

399
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.000
do a vessel follow that is new-trimm'd,

400
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.800
but benefit no further than vainly longing.

401
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.600
What we oft do best, by sick interpreters,

402
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.470
once weak ones, is Not ours,

403
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:12.970
or not allow'd;

404
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.830
what worst, as oft, hitting a grosser quality,

405
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.830
is cried up for our best act.

406
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.930
If we shall stand still,

407
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.170
In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,

408
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.570
We should take root here where we sit,

409
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.800
or sit state-statues only.

410
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.930
Things done well, and with a care,

411
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.770
exempt themselves from fear;

412
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.030
Things done without example,

413
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.770
in their issue are to be fear'd.

414
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.230
Have you a precedent of this commission?

415
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.370
I believe, not any.

416
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.770
We must not rend our subjects from our laws,

417
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.200
And stick them in our will.

418
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.900
Sixth part of each? A trembling contribution!

419
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.930
Why, we take from every tree lop, bark,

420
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.330
and part o' the timber;

421
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.630
And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,

422
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.270
The air will drink the sap.

423
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.630
To every county where this is question'd

424
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.900
send our letters, with free pardon

425
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.300
to each man that has denied the force

426
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300
of this commission:

427
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.330
pray, look to't; I put it to your care.

428
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.770
A word with you.

429
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.470
Let there be letters writ to every shire,

430
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.230
Of the king's grace and pardon.

431
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.700
The grieved commons hardly conceive of me;

432
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.100
let it be noised that through our intercession

433
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.500
this revokement and pardon comes:

434
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.870
I shall anon advise you further in the proceeding.

435
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.630
I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham

436
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.630
is run in your displeasure.

437
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.630
It grieves many:

438
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.670
The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;

439
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.130
To nature none more bound;

440
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.800
his training such, that he may furnish

441
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.070
and instruct great teachers,

442
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.900
And never seek for aid out of himself.

443
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.030
Yet see, when these so noble benefits

444
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.530
shall prove not well disposed,

445
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.800
the mind growing once corrupt,

446
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.170
They turn to vicious forms,

447
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.170
ten times more ugly than ever they were fair.

448
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.770
This man so complete,

449
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.430
who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders,

450
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.470
and when we, almost with ravish'd listening,

451
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.630
could not find his hour of speech a minute;

452
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.970
he, my lady, hath into monstrous habits

453
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.500
put the graces that once were his,

454
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.170
and is become as black as if besmear'd in hell.

455
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.530
Sit by us; you shall hear--

456
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.430
This was his gentleman in trust--

457
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.200
of him things to strike honour sad.

458
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.230
Bid him recount the fore-recited practises;

459
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.430
whereof we cannot feel too little, hear too much.

460
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.870
Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate

461
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.600
what you, most like a careful subject,

462
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.600
have collected out of the Duke of Buckingham.

463
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.100
Speak freely.

464
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.830
First, it was usual with him,

465
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.500
every day it would infect his speech,

466
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.700
that if the king should without issue die,

467
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.370
he'll carry it so to make the sceptre his:

468
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.470
these very words I've heard him utter

469
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.670
to his son-in-law, Lord Abergavenny;

470
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.800
to whom by oath he menaced revenge upon the cardinal.

471
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.000
Please your highness,

472
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.130
note this dangerous conception in this point.

473
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.930
Not friended by by his wish,

474
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.470
to your high person his will is most malignant;

475
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.930
and it stretches beyond you, to your friends.

476
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.670
My learn'd lord cardinal, deliver all with charity.

477
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.700
Speak on:

478
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.600
How grounded he his title to the crown,

479
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.400
upon our fail?

480
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.430
to this point hast thou heard him

481
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.400
at any time speak aught?

482
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.300
He was brought to this

483
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.030
by a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton.

484
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.300
What was that Henton?

485
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.670
Sir, a Chartreux friar, His confessor,

486
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.370
who fed him every minute with words of sovereignty.

487
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.800
How know'st thou this?

488
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.230
Not long before your highness sped to France,

489
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.070
The duke being at the Rose,

490
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.230
within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney,

491
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.230
did of me demand what was the speech

492
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.300
among the Londoners concerning the French journey:

493
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.330
I replied, men fear'd the French

494
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.300
would prove perfidious to the king's danger.

495
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.370
Presently the duke said, 'twas the fear, indeed;

496
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.600
and that he doubted 'twould prove

497
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.030
the verity of certain words

498
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.600
Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,

499
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.000
'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit

500
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.900
John de la Car, my chaplain,

501
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.170
a choice hour to hear from him a matter of some moment:

502
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.500
Whom after under the confession's seal

503
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.930
He solemnly had sworn,

504
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.830
that what he spoke my chaplain to no creature living,

505
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.600
but to me, should utter,

506
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.330
with demure confidence this pausingly ensued:

507
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.600
neither the king nor's heirs,

508
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.430
Tell you the duke, shall prosper:

509
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.730
bid him strive to gain the love o' the commonalty:

510
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.930
the duke shall govern England.'

511
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.300
If I know you well,

512
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.630
You were the duke's surveyor,

513
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.330
and lost your office on the complaint o' the tenants:

514
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.270
take good heed you

515
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.970
charge not in your spleen a noble person

516
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.870
And spoil your nobler soul:

517
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.870
I say, take heed; Yes, heartily beseech you.

518
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.200
Let him on.

519
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.530
Go forward.

520
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.600
On my soul, I'll speak but truth.

521
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.900
I told my lord the duke,

522
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.870
by the devil's illusions the monk might be deceived;

523
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.100
and that 'twas dangerous for him

524
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.830
to ruminate on this so far,

525
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.930
until it forged him some design,

526
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.870
which, being believed,

527
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.470
It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,

528
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.270
It can do me no damage;'

529
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.630
adding further,

530
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.270
That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,

531
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.570
The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads

532
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.970
should have gone off.

533
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.130
Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!

534
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.300
There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?

535
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.470
I can, my liege.

536
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.430
Proceed.

537
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.470
Being at Greenwich,

538
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.100
after your highness had reproved the duke

539
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.430
about Sir William Blomer,--

540
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.600
I remember of such a time: being my sworn servant,

541
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.200
The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?

542
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.970
'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,

543
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.170
As, to the Tower, I thought,

544
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.330
I would have play'd the part my father meant to act

545
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.070
upon the usurper Richard;

546
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.030
who, being at Salisbury,

547
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.700
made suit to come in's presence;

548
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.230
which if granted, as he made semblance of his duty,

549
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.300
would have put his knife to him.'

550
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.230
A giant traitor!

551
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.530
Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,

552
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.000
and this man out of prison?

553
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.800
God mend all!

554
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.870
There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?

555
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.530
After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'

556
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.200
He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,

557
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.370
Another spread on's breast,

558
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.870
mounting his eyes he did discharge a horrible oath;

559
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.570
whose tenor was,--were he evil used,

560
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.930
he would outgo his father

561
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.370
by as much as a performance

562
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.500
Does an irresolute purpose.

563
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.230
There's his period,

564
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.800
To sheathe his knife in us.

565
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.670
He is attach'd;

566
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.100
Call him to present trial:

567
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.030
if he may find mercy in the law, 'tis his:

568
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.070
if none, let him not seek 't of us:

569
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.930
by day and night,

570
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.530
He's traitor to the height.

571
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.430
Is't possible the spells of France

572
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.200
should juggle men into such strange mysteries?

573
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.230
New customs, though they be never so ridiculous,

574
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.900
Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.

575
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.230
Death! my lord, their clothes are after

576
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.670
such a pagan cut too,

577
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.470
That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.

578
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.330
How now! What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?

579
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.430
Faith, my lord, I hear of none,

580
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.800
but the new proclamation that's clapp'd

581
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.970
upon the court-gate.

582
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.300
What is't for?

583
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.200
The reformation of our travell'd gallants,

584
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.530
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.

585
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.170
I'm glad 'tis there:

586
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.200
now I would pray our monsieurs

587
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.570
to think an English courtier may be wise,

588
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.500
And never see the Louvre.

589
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.430
They must either, for so run the conditions,

590
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.800
leave those remnants of fool and feather

591
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.830
that they got in France,

592
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.130
Or pack to their old playfellows:

593
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.570
there, I take it, they may, 'cum privilegio,'

594
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.430
wear away the lag end of their lewdness

595
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.270
and be laugh'd at.

596
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.870
'Tis time to give 'em physic,

597
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.200
their diseases are grown so catching.

598
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.430
What a loss our ladies will have of these trim vanities!

599
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.030
Ay, marry, There will be woe indeed, lords:

600
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.370
the sly whoresons have got a speeding trick

601
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.400
to lay down ladies;

602
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.500
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.

603
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.230
The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,

604
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.400
For, sure, there's no converting of 'em:

605
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.330
now an honest country lord, as I am,

606
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.570
beaten a long time out of play,

607
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.430
may bring his plainsong and have an hour of hearing;

608
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.500
and, by'r lady, held current music too.

609
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.670
Well said, Lord Sands;

610
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.200
Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.

611
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.400
No, my lord; Nor shall not, while I have a stump.

612
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.900
Sir Thomas, whither were you a-going?

613
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.070
To the cardinal's: Your lordship is a guest too.

614
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.900
O, 'tis true: This night he makes a supper,

615
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.830
and a great one, to many lords and ladies;

616
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.730
there will be the beauty of this kingdom,

617
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.800
I'll assure you.

618
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.400
That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,

619
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.800
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;

620
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.570
his dews fall every where.

621
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.170
No doubt he's noble;

622
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.630
He had a black mouth that said other of him.

623
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.500
He may, my lord; has wherewithal:

624
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.730
in him sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:

625
00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.600
Men of his way should be most liberal;

626
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.970
They are set here for examples.

627
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.300
True, they are so: But few now give so great ones.

628
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.570
My barge stays; Your lordship shall along.

629
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.600
Come, good Sir Thomas, We shall be late else;

630
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.400
which I would not be, for I was sent for,

631
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.100
with Sir Henry Guildford this night to be comptrollers.

632
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.570
I am your lordship's.

633
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.600
Ladies, a general welcome from his grace salutes ye all;

634
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:30.100
this night he dedicates to fair content and you:

635
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.870
none here, he hopes,

636
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.000
In all this noble bevy,

637
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.130
has brought with her one care abroad;

638
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.130
he would have all as merry as, first,

639
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.470
good company, good wine, good welcome,

640
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.500
can make good people.

641
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.800
O, my lord, you're tardy:

642
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.770
The very thought of this fair company

643
00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.670
clapp'd wings to me.

644
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.070
You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.

645
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.930
Sir Thomas Lovell,

646
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.170
had the cardinal but half my lay thoughts in him,

647
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.170
some of these should find a running banquet

648
00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.400
ere they rested,

649
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.870
I think would better please 'em:

650
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.670
by my life, they are a sweet society of fair ones.

651
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.330
O, that your lordship were but now confessor

652
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.900
to one or two of these!

653
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.870
I would I were they should find easy penance.

654
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.870
Faith, how easy?

655
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.700
As easy as a down-bed would afford it.

656
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.130
Sweet ladies, will it please you sit?

657
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.530
Sir Harry, Place you that side;

658
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.700
I'll take the charge of this:

659
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.530
His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;

660
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:30.030
Two women placed together makes cold weather:

661
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.730
My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;

662
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.870
Pray, sit between these ladies.

663
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.430
By my faith, I thank your lordship.

664
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.630
By your leave, sweet ladies:

665
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.500
If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;

666
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.030
I had it from my father.

667
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.800
Was he mad, sir?

668
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.330
O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:

669
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.100
But he would bite none; just as I do now,

670
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.330
He would kiss you twenty with a breath.

671
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.800
You're welcome, my fair guests:

672
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.300
that noble lady, or gentleman,

673
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.870
that is not freely merry, is not my friend: this,

674
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.600
to confirm my welcome; and to you all, good health.

675
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.030
Your grace is noble:

676
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.270
Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,

677
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.570
And save me so much talking.

678
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.570
My Lord Sands,

679
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.570
I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.

680
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.700
Ladies, you are not merry:

681
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.270
gentlemen, whose fault is this?

682
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.530
The red wine first must rise

683
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.570
in their fair cheeks, my lord;

684
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.000
then we shall have 'em talk us to silence.

685
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.530
You are a merry gamester, my Lord Sands.

686
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.730
Yes, if I make my play.

687
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.670
Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,

688
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.000
For 'tis to such a thing,--

689
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.600
You cannot show me.

690
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.300
I told your grace they would talk anon.

691
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.300
(boom)

692
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300
What's that?

693
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.600
Look out there, some of ye.

694
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.330
What warlike voice, and to what end is this?

695
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.370
Nay, ladies, fear not;

696
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.870
by all the laws of war you're privileged.

697
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.870
How now! what is't?

698
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.770
A noble troop of strangers;

699
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.970
For so they seem:

700
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.900
they've left their barge and landed;

701
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.330
And hither make,

702
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.930
as great ambassadors from foreign princes.

703
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.770
Good lord chamberlain, Go, give 'em welcome;

704
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.830
you can speak the French tongue;

705
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.130
And, pray, receive 'em nobly,

706
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.500
and conduct 'em into our presence,

707
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500
where this heaven of beauty

708
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.800
shall shine at full upon them.

709
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800
Some attend him.

710
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.900
You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.

711
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.570
A good digestion to you all:

712
00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:47.030
and once more I shower

713
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.800
a welcome on ye; welcome all.

714
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.600
A noble company! what are their pleasures?

715
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.000
Because they speak no English,

716
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.370
thus they pray'd to tell your grace,

717
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.700
that, having heard by fame

718
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.930
of this so noble and so fair assembly

719
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.530
This night to meet here,

720
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.830
they could do no less

721
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.230
out of the great respect they bear to beauty,

722
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.430
But leave their flocks; and,

723
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.970
under your fair conduct,

724
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.100
Crave leave to view these ladies

725
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.370
and entreat an hour of revels with 'em.

726
00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.470
Say, lord chamberlain,

727
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.170
they have done my poor house grace;

728
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.500
for which I pay 'em a thousand thanks,

729
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.430
and pray 'em take their pleasures.

730
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.500
The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,

731
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.770
till now I never knew thee!

732
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.900
My lord!

733
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.200
Your grace?

734
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.670
Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:

735
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:45.730
There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,

736
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.500
More worthy this place than myself; to whom,

737
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.270
If I but knew him, with my love and duty

738
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.370
I would surrender it.

739
00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.130
I will, my lord.

740
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.800
What say they?

741
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.500
Such a one, they all confess,

742
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.870
There is indeed;

743
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.230
which they would have your grace find out,

744
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.230
and he will take it.

745
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.970
Let me see, then.

746
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.700
By all your good leaves, gentlemen;

747
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.130
here I'll make my royal choice.

748
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.870
Ye have found him, cardinal:

749
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.630
You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:

750
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.570
You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,

751
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.530
I should judge now unhappily.

752
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.100
I am glad your grace is grown so pleasant.

753
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.830
My lord chamberlain, Prithee, come hither:

754
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.300
what fair lady's that?

755
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.370
An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter,

756
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.000
the Viscount Rochford,

757
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.300
one of her highness' women.

758
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.700
By heaven, she is a dainty one.

759
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:01.070
Sweetheart, I were unmannerly, to take you out,

760
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.770
And not to kiss you.

761
00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.770
A health, gentlemen! Let it go round.

762
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.670
Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready

763
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.770
I' the privy chamber?

764
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.300
Yes, my lord.

765
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.330
Your grace, I fear, with dancing is a little heated.

766
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.970
I fear, too much.

767
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.270
There's fresher air, my lord, in the next chamber.

768
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.230
Lead in your ladies, every one:

769
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.800
sweet partner, I must not yet forsake you:

770
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.470
let's be merry: Good my lord cardinal,

771
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.730
I have half a dozen healths

772
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.470
To drink to these fair ladies,

773
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.230
and a measure to lead 'em once again;

774
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.430
and then let's dream who's best in favour.

775
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.200
Let the music knock it.

776
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:59.030
(music plays)

777
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.070
Whither away so fast?

778
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.500
O, God save ye!

779
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.570
Even to the hall, to hear what shall become

780
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.070
of the great Duke of Buckingham.

781
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.730
I'll save you that labour, sir. All's now done,

782
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.870
but the ceremony of bringing back the prisoner.

783
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.330
Were you there?

784
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.770
Yes, indeed, was I.

785
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.470
Pray, speak what has happen'd.

786
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.430
You may guess quickly what.

787
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.230
Is he found guilty?

788
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:25.030
Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.

789
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.870
I am sorry for't.

790
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.630
So are a number more.

791
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.070
But, pray, how pass'd it?

792
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.570
I'll tell you in a little.

793
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.800
The great duke came to the bar;

794
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.100
where to his accusations

795
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.870
He pleaded still not guilty

796
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.570
and alleged many sharp reasons to defeat the law.

797
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.470
The king's attorney on the contrary

798
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.830
Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions

799
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.070
Of divers witnesses;

800
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.700
which the duke desired to have brought

801
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.900
viva voce to his face:

802
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.870
At which appear'd against him his surveyor;

803
00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.830
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,

804
00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.270
Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,

805
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.730
Hopkins, that made this mischief.

806
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.000
That was he that fed him with his prophecies?

807
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.430
The same.

808
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.170
All these accused him strongly;

809
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.800
which he fain would have flung from him,

810
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.930
but, indeed, he could not:

811
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.870
And so his peers, upon this evidence,

812
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.870
Have found him guilty of high treason.

813
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.800
Much he spoke, and learnedly, for life;

814
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.570
but all was either pitied in him or forgotten.

815
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.230
After all this, how did he bear himself?

816
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.530
When he was brought again to the bar,

817
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.030
to hear his knell rung out, his judgment,

818
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.170
he was stirr'd with such an agony,

819
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.770
he sweat extremely,

820
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.430
And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:

821
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:47.470
But he fell to himself again,

822
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.730
and sweetly in all the rest

823
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.800
show'd a most noble patience.

824
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.770
I do not think he fears death.

825
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.670
Sure, he does not:

826
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.670
He never was so womanish;

827
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.900
the cause he may a little grieve at.

828
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.030
Certainly the cardinal is the end of this.

829
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.770
'Tis likely, By all conjectures:

830
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.300
first, Kildare's attainder,

831
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.400
Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,

832
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.500
Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,

833
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.970
Lest he should help his father.

834
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.100
That trick of state was a deep envious one.

835
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.130
At his return no doubt he will requite it.

836
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:23.030
This is noted, and generally, whoever the king favours,

837
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.500
The cardinal instantly will find employment,

838
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.170
And far enough from court too.

839
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.830
All the commons hate him perniciously,

840
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.930
and, o' my conscience, wish him ten fathom deep:

841
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:38.200
this duke as much they love and dote on;

842
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.230
call him bounteous Buckingham,

843
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.730
The mirror of all courtesy;--

844
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.070
Stay there, sir,

845
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.900
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.

846
00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.430
All good people,

847
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.900
You that thus far have come to pity me,

848
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.730
Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.

849
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.500
I have this day received a traitor's judgment,

850
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:17.230
And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,

851
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.230
And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,

852
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.830
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!

853
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.600
The law I bear no malice for my death;

854
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.470
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:

855
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.830
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:

856
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.770
Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:

857
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.670
Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,

858
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.800
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;

859
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.970
For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.

860
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.870
For further life in this world I ne'er hope,

861
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.530
Nor will I sue,

862
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.330
although the king have mercies

863
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.370
more than I dare make faults.

864
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.100
You few that loved me,

865
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.330
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,

866
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.100
His noble friends and fellows,

867
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.370
whom to leave is only bitter to him, only dying,

868
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.530
Go with me, like good angels, to my end;

869
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.470
And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,

870
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.300
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,

871
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.200
And lift my soul to heaven.

872
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.300
Lead on, o' God's name.

873
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.030
I do beseech your grace, for charity,

874
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.300
If ever any malice in your heart were hid against me,

875
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.270
now to forgive me frankly.

876
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.370
Sir Thomas Lovell,

877
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.770
I as free forgive you as I would be forgiven:

878
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.400
I forgive all;

879
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.900
There cannot be those numberless offences

880
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.130
'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:

881
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.430
no black envy shall mark my grave.

882
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.670
Commend me to his grace;

883
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.800
And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him

884
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.270
you met him half in heaven:

885
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.370
my vows and prayers yet are the king's;

886
00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.830
and, till my soul forsake,

887
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.100
shall cry for blessings on him:

888
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.100
may he live longer

889
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.070
than I have time to tell his years!

890
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.400
Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!

891
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.770
And when old time shall lead him to his end,

892
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.970
Goodness and he fill up one monument!

893
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.070
To the water side I must conduct your grace;

894
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.330
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,

895
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.030
Who undertakes you to your end.

896
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.430
Prepare there, the duke is coming:

897
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.170
see the barge be ready;

898
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.300
And fit it with such furniture

899
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.000
as suits the greatness of his person.

900
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.500
Nay, Sir Nicholas, Let it alone;

901
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.470
my state now will but mock me.

902
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.530
When I came hither,

903
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.270
I was lord high constable and Duke of Buckingham;

904
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.470
now, poor Edward Bohun:

905
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.370
Yet I am richer than my base accusers,

906
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.100
That never knew what truth meant:

907
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.100
I now seal it; And with that blood

908
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.500
will make 'em one day groan for't.

909
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.630
My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,

910
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.170
Who first raised head against usurping Richard,

911
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.930
Flying for succor to his servant Banister,

912
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.270
Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,

913
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.270
And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!

914
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.570
Henry the Seventh succeeding,

915
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.270
truly pitying my father's loss,

916
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.870
like a most royal prince, restored me to my honours,

917
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.830
and, out of ruins, made my name once more noble.

918
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.500
Now his son, Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name

919
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.130
and all that made me happy

920
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.400
at one stroke has taken for ever from the world.

921
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.200
I had my trial, and, must needs say, a noble one;

922
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.330
which makes me, a little happier

923
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.970
than my wretched father:

924
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.370
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes:

925
00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.800
both gell by our servants, by those men we loved most;

926
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.670
A most unnatural and faithless service!

927
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.470
Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,

928
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.100
This from a dying man receive as certain:

929
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.600
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels

930
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.300
Be sure you be not loose;

931
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.570
for those you make friends and give your hearts to,

932
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.170
when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes,

933
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.900
fall away like water from ye,

934
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:54.630
never found again but where they mean to sink ye.

935
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.430
All good people, Pray for me!

936
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.030
I must now forsake ye:

937
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.700
the last hour of my long weary life

938
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.630
is come upon me. Farewell:

939
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.300
And when you would say something that is sad,

940
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:25.900
Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

941
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.030
O, this is full of pity!

942
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.230
Sir, it calls, I fear,

943
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.130
too many curses on their beads that were the authors.

944
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.770
If the duke be guiltless,

945
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.370
'Tis full of woe:

946
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.900
yet I can give you inkling of an ensuing evil,

947
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.170
if it fall,

948
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.600
Greater than this.

949
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.130
Good angels keep it from us!

950
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.970
What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?

951
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.070
This secret is so weighty,

952
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.470
'twill require a strong faith to conceal it.

953
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.670
Let me have it; I do not talk much.

954
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.230
I am confident, You shall, sir:

955
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.500
did you not of late days hear

956
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.030
A buzzing of a separation

957
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.570
Between the king and Katharine?

958
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.030
Yes, but it held not:

959
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.370
For when the king once heard it, out of anger

960
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.100
He sent command to the lord mayor straight

961
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.300
To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues

962
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.430
That durst disperse it.

963
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.170
But that slander, sir,

964
00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.670
Is found a truth now: for it grows again

965
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.470
Fresher than e'er it was;

966
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.130
and held for certain

967
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.300
The king will venture at it.

968
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.000
Either the cardinal,

969
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.800
Or some about him near,

970
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.600
have, out of malice to the good queen,

971
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.500
possess'd him with a scruple

972
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.530
That will undo her: to confirm this too,

973
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.170
Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;

974
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.900
As all think, for this business.

975
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.430
'Tis the cardinal;

976
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.500
And merely to revenge him on the emperor

977
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.670
For not bestowing on him, at his asking,

978
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.730
The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.

979
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.230
I think you have hit the mark:

980
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.630
but is't not cruel

981
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.070
That she should feel the smart of this?

982
00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:48.000
The cardinal will have his will, and she must fall.

983
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.970
'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for,

984
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.170
with all the care I had,

985
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.970
I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnished.

986
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.130
They were young and handsome,

987
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.270
and of the best breed in the north.

988
00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.300
When they were ready to set out for London,

989
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.030
a man of my lord cardinal's,

990
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:08.130
by commission and main power, took 'em from me;

991
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.300
with this reason: His master would be served

992
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.870
before a subject, if not before the king;

993
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:19.370
which stopped our mouths, sir.'

994
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:26.300
I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:

995
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.670
He will have all, I think.

996
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.830
Well met, my lord chamberlain.

997
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.070
Good day to both your graces.

998
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.700
How is the king employ'd?

999
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.300
I left him private,

1000
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.870
Full of sad thoughts and troubles.

1001
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.570
What's the cause?

1002
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.500
It seems the marriage with his brother's wife

1003
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.030
Has crept too near his conscience.

1004
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.970
No, his conscience

1005
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.200
Has crept too near another lady.

1006
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.270
'Tis so:

1007
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.630
This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:

1008
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.700
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,

1009
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.400
Turns what he list.

1010
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.500
The king will know him one day.

1011
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.370
Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.

1012
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.100
How holily he works in all his business!

1013
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.830
And with what zeal! for,

1014
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:03.000
now he has crack'd the league

1015
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,

1016
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.600
He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters

1017
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.230
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,

1018
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:11.630
Fears, and despairs;

1019
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.030
and all these for his marriage:

1020
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.670
And out of all these to restore the king,

1021
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.800
He counsels a divorce; a loss of her

1022
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.730
That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years

1023
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.600
About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;

1024
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.500
Of her that loves him with that excellence

1025
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.230
That angels love good men with; even of her

1026
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.370
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,

1027
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:36.100
Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?

1028
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.430
Heaven keep me from such counsel! '

1029
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.630
Tis most true these news are every where;

1030
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:41.770
every tongue speaks 'em,

1031
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.770
And every true heart weeps for't:

1032
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:45.270
all that dare

1033
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.130
Look into these affairs see this main end,

1034
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.930
The French king's sister.

1035
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.200
Heaven will one day open the king's eyes,

1036
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.200
that so long have slept upon this bold bad man.

1037
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.200
And free us from his slavery.

1038
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.170
We had need pray,

1039
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.900
And heartily, for our deliverance;

1040
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.270
Or this imperious man will work us all

1041
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.500
From princes into pages: all men's honours

1042
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.500
Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd

1043
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.930
Into what pitch he please.

1044
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:09.930
For me, my lords,

1045
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.430
I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:

1046
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.030
As I am made without him, so I'll stand,

1047
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.470
If the king please; his curses and his blessings

1048
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.330
Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.

1049
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.370
I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him

1050
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:29.330
To him that made him proud, the pope.

1051
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:30.500
Let's in;

1052
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.030
And with some other business put the king

1053
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.330
From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:

1054
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.900
My lord, you'll bear us company?

1055
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.830
Excuse me;

1056
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.370
The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,

1057
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:43.730
You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:

1058
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.500
Health to your lordships.

1059
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.800
Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.

1060
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.400
How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.

1061
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.570
Who's there, ha?

1062
00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.200
Pray God he be not angry.

1063
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:26.300
Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves

1064
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.870
Into my private meditations?

1065
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:30.570
Who am I? ha?

1066
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.230
A gracious king that pardons all offences

1067
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.500
Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way

1068
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.300
Is business of estate; in which we come

1069
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.570
To know your royal pleasure.

1070
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:41.570
Ye are too bold:

1071
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.200
Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:

1072
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.000
Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?

1073
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:56.500
Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,

1074
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.000
The quiet of my wounded conscience;

1075
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.530
Thou art a cure fit for a king.

1076
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.300
You're welcome,

1077
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.770
Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:

1078
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.170
Use us and it.

1079
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.500
My good lord, have great care

1080
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.670
I be not found a talker.

1081
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:10.200
Sir, you cannot.

1082
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.830
I would your grace would give us but an hour

1083
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.270
Of private conference.

1084
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.870
We are busy; go.

1085
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.030
This priest has no pride in him?

1086
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.530
Not to speak of:

1087
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.900
I would not be so sick though for his place:

1088
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.500
But this cannot continue.

1089
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.370
If it do,

1090
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.230
I'll venture one have-at-him.

1091
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.530
I another.

1092
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.200
Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom

1093
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.030
Above all princes, in committing freely

1094
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.200
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:

1095
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.500
Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?

1096
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.800
The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,

1097
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.930
Must now confess, if they have any goodness,

1098
00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.430
The trial just and noble. All the clerks,

1099
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:45.670
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms

1100
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.700
Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,

1101
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.070
Invited by your noble self, hath sent

1102
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.830
One general tongue unto us, this good man,

1103
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.070
This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;

1104
00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.270
Whom once more I present unto your highness.

1105
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.170
And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,

1106
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.100
And thank the holy conclave for their loves:

1107
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.200
They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.

1108
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.530
Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,

1109
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.630
You are so noble. To your highness' hand

1110
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.930
I tender my commission; by whose virtue,

1111
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.070
The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord

1112
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.900
Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant

1113
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.430
In the unpartial judging of this business.

1114
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.700
Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted

1115
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.270
Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?

1116
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:26.930
I know your majesty has always loved her

1117
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:29.000
So dear in heart, not to deny her that

1118
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.800
A woman of less place might ask by law:

1119
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.670
Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.

1120
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.170
Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour

1121
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:40.770
To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,

1122
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.270
Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:

1123
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.270
I find him a fit fellow.

1124
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.030
Give me your hand much joy

1125
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:56.400
and favour to you; You are the king's now.

1126
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.470
But to be commanded

1127
00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.900
For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.

1128
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.870
Come hither, Gardiner.

1129
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.500
My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace

1130
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.430
In this man's place before him?

1131
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:17.530
Yes, he was.

1132
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:19.000
Was he not held a learned man?

1133
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.270
Yes, surely.

1134
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.170
Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then

1135
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.500
Even of yourself, lord cardinal.

1136
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.600
How! of me?

1137
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.400
They will not stick to say you envied him,

1138
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.730
And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,

1139
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.500
Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,

1140
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.430
That he ran mad and died.

1141
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.870
Heaven's peace be with him!

1142
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.500
That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers

1143
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.470
There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;

1144
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.630
For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,

1145
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.270
If I command him, follows my appointment:

1146
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:52.530
I will have none so near else.

1147
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.270
Learn this, brother,

1148
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.670
We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.

1149
00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.230
Deliver this with modesty to the queen.

1150
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.230
The most convenient place that I can think of

1151
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.100
For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;

1152
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.730
There ye shall meet about this weighty business.

1153
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.870
My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,

1154
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.970
Would it not grieve an able man to leave

1155
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:19.800
So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!

1156
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.800
O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.

1157
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:35.230
Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:

1158
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:37.670
His highness having lived so long with her,

1159
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:38.930
and she so good a lady

1160
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:40.300
that no tongue could ever pronounce

1161
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.330
dishonour of her;

1162
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.070
by my life, she never knew harm-doing:

1163
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.770
O, now, after so many courses

1164
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:49.400
of the sun enthroned,

1165
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.730
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which

1166
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.570
To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than

1167
00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:01.630
'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,

1168
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.530
To give her the avaunt!

1169
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.830
It is a pity would move a monster.

1170
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.470
Hearts of most hard temper

1171
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.330
Melt and lament for her.

1172
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:10.230
O, God's will!

1173
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.170
much better she ne'er had known pomp:

1174
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.870
though't be temporal,

1175
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.370
Yet, if that quarrel, fortune,

1176
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:17.330
do divorce it from the bearer,

1177
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:18.700
'tis a sufferance panging

1178
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.700
As soul and body's severing.

1179
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.670
Alas, poor lady!

1180
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:25.170
She's a stranger now again.

1181
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:26.030
So much the more

1182
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:28.200
Must pity drop upon her.

1183
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.870
Verily, I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,

1184
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.070
And range with humble livers in content,

1185
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.500
Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,

1186
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.800
And wear a golden sorrow.

1187
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.700
Our content is our best having.

1188
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:39.900
By my troth and maidenhead,

1189
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.700
I would not be a queen.

1190
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.300
Beshrew me, I would,

1191
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.970
And venture maidenhead for't;

1192
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.200
and so would you,

1193
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.500
For all this spice of your hypocrisy:

1194
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.100
You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,

1195
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.500
Have too a woman's heart;

1196
00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:01.030
which ever yet affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;

1197
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:05.430
Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,

1198
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:08.330
Saving your mincing,

1199
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:11.430
the capacity of your soft cheveril conscience

1200
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.500
would receive,

1201
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.170
If you might please to stretch it.

1202
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:16.570
Nay, good troth.

1203
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:20.830
Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?

1204
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:24.200
No, not for all the riches under heaven.

1205
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.730
'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,

1206
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.270
Old as I am, to queen it:

1207
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.670
but, I pray you,

1208
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.230
What think you of a duchess?

1209
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.970
have you limbs to bear that load of title?

1210
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.230
No, in truth.

1211
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.670
Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;

1212
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:45.730
I would not be a young count in your way,

1213
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.130
For more than blushing comes to:

1214
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:51.470
if your back cannot vouchsafe this burthen,

1215
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:54.000
'tis too weak ever to get a boy.

1216
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.100
How you do talk!

1217
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.800
I swear again, I would not be a queen

1218
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.770
For all the world.

1219
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.700
In faith, for little England

1220
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.030
You'ld venture an emballing:

1221
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:05.730
I myself would for Carnarvonshire,

1222
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.170
although there long'd no more

1223
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:08.830
to the crown but that.

1224
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.970
Lo, who comes here?

1225
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:16.130
Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know

1226
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.100
The secret of your conference?

1227
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.230
My good lord,

1228
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:23.030
Not your demand; it values not your asking:

1229
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:25.930
Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.

1230
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:26.970
It was a gentle business,

1231
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.000
and becoming the action of good women:

1232
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.370
there is hope all will be well.

1233
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:33.930
Now, I pray God, amen!

1234
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:35.870
You bear a gentle mind,

1235
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:39.730
and heavenly blessings follow such creatures.

1236
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:40.670
That you may, fair lady,

1237
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:42.600
Perceive I speak sincerely,

1238
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.570
and high note's ta'en of your many virtues,

1239
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:48.330
the king's majesty commends his good opinion

1240
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:49.930
of you to you,

1241
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:51.470
and does purpose honour to you

1242
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:55.370
no less flowing than Marchioness of Pembroke:

1243
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:58.130
to which title a thousand pound a year,

1244
00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:02.200
annual support, out of his grace he adds.

1245
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:04.670
I do not know

1246
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:08.230
What kind of my obedience I should tender;

1247
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.970
More than my all is nothing:

1248
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.770
nor my prayers are not words duly hallow'd,

1249
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:16.470
nor my wishes more worth than empty vanities;

1250
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:24.700
yet prayers and wishes are all I can return.

1251
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:27.630
Beseech your lordship,

1252
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:30.800
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,

1253
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.000
As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;

1254
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.530
Whose health and royalty I pray for.

1255
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:38.200
Lady, I shall not fail to approve

1256
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.770
the fair conceit the king hath of you.

1257
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.230
I have perused her well;

1258
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:47.330
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled

1259
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:49.330
That they have caught the king:

1260
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.470
and who knows yet

1261
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.200
But from this lady may proceed a gem

1262
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.700
To lighten all this isle?

1263
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.970
I'll to the king, and say I spoke with you.

1264
01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:02.970
My honour'd lord.

1265
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:11.370
Why, this it is; see, see!

1266
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:14.500
I have been begging sixteen years in court,

1267
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.330
Am yet a courtier beggarly,

1268
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:20.570
and you, O fate!

1269
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.430
A very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon

1270
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.630
This compell'd fortune!

1271
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:26.900
--have your mouth fill'd up

1272
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.100
Before you open it.

1273
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.500
This is strange to me.

1274
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.400
How tastes it? is it bitter?

1275
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.970
forty pence, no.

1276
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:38.130
There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,

1277
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:39.430
That would not be a queen,

1278
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.130
that would she not,

1279
01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:44.600
For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?

1280
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.100
Come, you are pleasant.

1281
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.900
With your theme,

1282
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.200
I could O'ermount the lark.

1283
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.770
The Marchioness of Pembroke!

1284
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:54.570
A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!

1285
01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:57.100
No other obligation!

1286
01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.870
By my life, that promises moe thousands:

1287
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:04.370
honour's train is longer than his foreskirt.

1288
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.100
By this time I know

1289
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.200
your back will bear a duchess:

1290
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.300
say, are you not stronger than you were?

1291
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.030
Good lady, Make yourself mirth

1292
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.570
with your particular fancy,

1293
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:18.830
And leave me out on't.

1294
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:21.770
Would I had no being,

1295
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.730
If this salute my blood a jot:

1296
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.970
it faints me to think what follows.

1297
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.800
The queen is comfortless,

1298
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.370
and we forgetful in our long absence:

1299
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.070
pray, do not deliver

1300
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.600
what here you've heard to her.

1301
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.730
What do you think me?

1302
01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.570
Whilst our commission from Rome is read,

1303
01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.170
Let silence be commanded.

1304
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.070
What's the need?

1305
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.930
It hath already publicly been read,

1306
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:26.600
And on all sides the authority allow'd;

1307
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.630
You may, then, spare that time.

1308
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.930
Say, Henry King of England, come into the court.

1309
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.970
Henry King of England, come into the court.

1310
01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.100
Here.

1311
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:41.630
Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.

1312
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:45.600
Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.

1313
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:23.930
Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;

1314
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.530
And to bestow your pity on me:

1315
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:29.630
for I am a most poor woman,

1316
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.000
and a stranger,

1317
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.270
Born out of your dominions;

1318
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.970
having here no judge indifferent,

1319
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.300
nor no more assurance

1320
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.170
Of equal friendship and proceeding.

1321
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.230
Alas, sir, in what have I offended you?

1322
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.570
what cause hath my behavior

1323
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:56.070
given to your displeasure,

1324
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.100
That thus you should proceed to put me off,

1325
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.970
And take your good grace from me?

1326
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.430
Heaven witness,

1327
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.570
I have been to you a true and humble wife,

1328
01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:14.430
At all times to your will conformable;

1329
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.870
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,

1330
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.000
Yea, subject to your countenance,

1331
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.130
glad or sorry as I saw it inclined:

1332
01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:27.600
when was the hour

1333
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.770
I ever contradicted your desire,

1334
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:32.800
Or made it not mine too?

1335
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:34.800
Or which of your friends

1336
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.170
Have I not strove to love,

1337
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.770
although I knew he were mine enemy?

1338
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.800
what friend of mine

1339
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.730
That had to him derived your anger,

1340
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.170
did I continue in my liking?

1341
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.930
nay, gave notice he was from thence discharged.

1342
01:04:56.370 --> 01:05:00.900
Sir, consider that I have been your wife,

1343
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.170
in this obedience,

1344
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:07.100
Upward of twenty years,

1345
01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.230
and have been blest with many children by you:

1346
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.370
if, in the course and process of this time,

1347
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:19.500
you can report, and prove it too,

1348
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.070
against mine honour aught,

1349
01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:26.370
My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,

1350
01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:31.130
Against your sacred person, in God's name,

1351
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.030
Turn me away;

1352
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:34.600
and let the foul'st contempt

1353
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.730
Shut door upon me,

1354
01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:39.370
and so give me up to the sharp'st kind of justice.

1355
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.370
Please you sir,

1356
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:45.570
The king, your father,

1357
01:05:45.570 --> 01:05:47.830
was reputed for a prince most prudent,

1358
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:52.730
of an excellent and unmatch'd wit and judgment:

1359
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:56.900
Ferdinand, My father, king of Spain,

1360
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.770
was reckon'd one the wisest prince

1361
01:05:58.770 --> 01:06:00.570
that there had reign'd by many

1362
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.530
A year before:

1363
01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:05.970
it is not to be question'd

1364
01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:08.270
That they had gather'd a wise council to them

1365
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:12.230
Of every realm, that did debate this business,

1366
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:15.170
Who deem'd our marriage lawful:

1367
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:22.900
wherefore I humbly beseech you, sir,

1368
01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.630
to spare me, till I may be

1369
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:29.200
by my friends in Spain advised;

1370
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:33.430
whose counsel I will implore:

1371
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:37.230
if not, i' the name of God,

1372
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:39.100
Your pleasure be fulfill'd!

1373
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:45.270
You have here, lady,

1374
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:48.470
And of your choice, these reverend fathers;

1375
01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:50.600
men of singular integrity and learning,

1376
01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.900
Yea, the elect o' the land,

1377
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.300
who are assembled to plead your cause:

1378
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.600
it shall be therefore bootless

1379
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.000
That longer you desire the court;

1380
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.400
as well for your own quiet,

1381
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.930
as to rectify what is unsettled in the king.

1382
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:08.830
His grace hath spoken well and justly:

1383
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.770
therefore, madam,

1384
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:11.500
It's fit this royal session do proceed;

1385
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.730
And that, without delay,

1386
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.470
their arguments be now produced and heard.

1387
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.270
Lord cardinal, to you I speak.

1388
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:23.870
Your pleasure, madam?

1389
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:28.570
Sir,I am about to weep;

1390
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.970
but, thinking that we are a queen,

1391
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:35.070
or long have dream'd so,

1392
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.100
certain the daughter of a king,

1393
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.470
my drops of tears I'll turn to sparks of fire.

1394
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.170
Be patient yet.

1395
01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.500
I will, when you are humble;

1396
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.730
nay, before, or God will punish me.

1397
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:50.530
I do believe,

1398
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:52.130
Induced by potent circumstances,

1399
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:53.830
that you are mine enemy,

1400
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:54.870
and make my challenge

1401
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.900
You shall not be my judge:

1402
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.500
for it is you have blown this coal

1403
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.370
betwixt my lord and me;

1404
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:02.930
Which God's dew quench!

1405
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.670
Therefore I say again,

1406
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.700
I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul

1407
01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.530
Refuse you for my judge;

1408
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.470
whom, yet once more,

1409
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.870
I hold my most malicious foe,

1410
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:19.230
and think not at all a friend to truth.

1411
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:20.100
I do profess

1412
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.730
You speak not like yourself;

1413
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:24.370
who ever yet have stood to charity,

1414
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.500
and display'd the effects of wisdom

1415
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.900
and disposition gentle,

1416
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.100
o'ertopping woman's power.

1417
01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.500
Madam, you do me wrong:

1418
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.970
I have no spleen against you;

1419
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.730
nor injustice for you or any:

1420
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:38.930
how far I have proceeded,

1421
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:41.400
Or how far further shall,

1422
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.000
is warranted by a commission from the consistory,

1423
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.800
Yea, the whole consistory of Rome.

1424
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:50.670
You charge me that I have blown this coal:

1425
01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:51.630
I do deny it:

1426
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:53.330
The king is present:

1427
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.830
if it be known to him that I gainsay my deed,

1428
01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:56.970
how may he wound,

1429
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.200
And worthily, my falsehood!

1430
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.100
yea, as much as you have done my truth.

1431
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.170
If he know that I am free of your report,

1432
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:07.770
he knows I am not of your wrong.

1433
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.770
Therefore in him it lies to cure me:

1434
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:11.870
and the cure is,

1435
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.170
to remove these thoughts from you:

1436
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:16.370
the which before his highness shall speak in,

1437
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.030
I do beseech you, gracious madam,

1438
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:22.970
to unthink your speaking and to say so no more.

1439
01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.100
My lord,

1440
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.700
my lord, I am a simple woman,

1441
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.770
much too weak to oppose your cunning.

1442
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.600
You're meek and humble-mouth'd;

1443
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.030
You sign your place and calling,

1444
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.970
in full seeming,

1445
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:39.030
With meekness and humility;

1446
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:41.770
but your heart is cramm'd with arrogancy,

1447
01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.430
spleen, and pride.

1448
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.630
You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,

1449
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:49.170
Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted

1450
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:52.100
Where powers are your retainers, and your words,

1451
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.170
Domestics to you, serve your will as't please

1452
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.670
Yourself pronounce their office.

1453
01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:00.400
I must warn you, You tender more your person's honour

1454
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.300
than your high profession spiritual:

1455
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:07.800
that again I do refuse you for my judge;

1456
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.400
and here, Before you all,

1457
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.770
appeal unto the pope,

1458
01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:16.000
To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,

1459
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.500
And to be judged by him.

1460
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.230
The queen is obstinate,

1461
01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:25.230
Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it,

1462
01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.930
and disdainful to be tried by't: '

1463
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:28.170
tis not well.

1464
01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.630
She's going away.

1465
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:34.000
Call her again.

1466
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.330
Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.

1467
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:39.900
Madam, you are call'd back.

1468
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.030
What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:

1469
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.070
When you are call'd, return.

1470
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:45.100
Now, the Lord help,

1471
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.430
They vex me past my patience!

1472
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.170
Pray you, pass on:

1473
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.070
I will not tarry; no,

1474
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.100
nor ever more upon this business

1475
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.370
my appearance make in any of their courts.

1476
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:03.770
Go thy ways, Kate:

1477
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:06.870
That man i' the world

1478
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.870
who shall report he has a better wife,

1479
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.600
let him in nought be trusted,

1480
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.100
For speaking false in that:

1481
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:18.100
thou art, alone, if thy rare qualities,

1482
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.670
sweet gentleness,

1483
01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:22.700
Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,

1484
01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.700
Obeying in commanding, and thy parts

1485
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.200
Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,

1486
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:37.330
The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;

1487
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.570
And, like her true nobility,

1488
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:41.170
she has carried herself towards me.

1489
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:46.800
Most gracious sir,

1490
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.000
In humblest manner I require your highness,

1491
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.500
That it shall please you to declare,

1492
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.730
in hearing of all these ears,

1493
01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.700
--for where I am robb'd and bound,

1494
01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.000
There must I be unloosed,

1495
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.170
although not there at once and fully satisfied,

1496
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:00.630
--whether ever I did broach

1497
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.870
this business to your highness;

1498
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.730
or laid any scruple in your way,

1499
01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.700
which might induce you to the question on't?

1500
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.070
or ever have to you,

1501
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.630
but with thanks to God

1502
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:10.470
for such a royal lady,

1503
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:12.570
spake one the least word

1504
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:13.700
that might be to the prejudice

1505
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:14.630
of her present state,

1506
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.430
Or touch of her good person?

1507
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:18.130
My lord cardinal, I do excuse you;

1508
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:20.470
yea, upon mine honour, I free you from't.

1509
01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:22.170
You are not to be taught

1510
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.330
That you have many enemies,

1511
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:24.430
that know not why they are so,

1512
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:25.870
but, like to village-curs,

1513
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:27.370
Bark when their fellows do:

1514
01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:29.230
by some of these the queen is put in anger.

1515
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:31.370
You're excused:

1516
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:35.630
But will you be more justified?

1517
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:37.530
You ever have wish'd the sleeping of this business;

1518
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.930
never desired it to be stirr'd;

1519
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:40.770
but oft have hinder'd, oft,

1520
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:43.870
The passages made toward it:

1521
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:44.830
on my honour,

1522
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:46.570
I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,

1523
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.230
And thus far clear him.

1524
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:55.000
Now, what moved me to't,

1525
01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.300
I will be bold with time and your attention:

1526
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.570
Then mark the inducement.

1527
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.800
Thus it came; give heed to't:

1528
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.570
My conscience first received a tenderness,

1529
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:13.930
Scruple, and prick,

1530
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:15.130
on certain speeches utter'd

1531
01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:16.600
by the Bishop of Bayonne,

1532
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.970
then French ambassador;

1533
01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:20.700
Who had been hither sent on the debating

1534
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.830
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans

1535
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:27.430
and our daughter Mary:

1536
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.300
i' the progress of this business,

1537
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.500
Ere a determinate resolution,

1538
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:38.100
he, I mean the bishop, did require a respite;

1539
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.770
Wherein he might the king his lord advertise

1540
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:46.400
Whether our daughter were legitimate,

1541
01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.200
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,

1542
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.200
Sometimes our brother's wife.

1543
01:13:55.730 --> 01:14:00.930
This respite shook the bosom of my conscience,

1544
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:04.000
enter'd me, Yea, with a splitting power,

1545
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.600
and made to tremble the region of my breast;

1546
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.670
which forced such way,

1547
01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:10.200
That many mazed considerings did throng

1548
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.770
And press'd in with this caution.

1549
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:14.300
First, methought I stood not

1550
01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.700
in the smile of heaven;

1551
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.200
who had commanded nature, that my lady's womb,

1552
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.170
If it conceived a male child by me,

1553
01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.900
should do no more offices of life to't

1554
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.170
than the grave does to the dead;

1555
01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:30.700
for her male issue or died where they were made,

1556
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.230
or shortly after this world had air'd them:

1557
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.770
hence I took a thought,

1558
01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:40.930
This was a judgment on me;

1559
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.130
that my kingdom,

1560
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:47.270
Well worthy the best heir o' the world,

1561
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:51.270
should not be gladded in't by me:

1562
01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:54.730
then follows, that I weigh'd the danger

1563
01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:59.470
which my realms stood in by this my issue's fail;

1564
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:04.330
and that gave to me many a groaning throe.

1565
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:11.330
Thus hulling in the wild sea of my conscience,

1566
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:13.630
I did steer toward this remedy,

1567
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:16.100
whereupon we are now present here together:

1568
01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.630
that's to say, I meant to rectify my conscience,

1569
01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:21.030
--which I then did feel full sick,

1570
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:22.130
and yet not well,--

1571
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.070
By all the reverend fathers of the land

1572
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:26.070
And doctors learn'd:

1573
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.070
first I began in private

1574
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:31.170
With you, my Lord of Lincoln;

1575
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:33.470
you remember how under my oppression I did reek,

1576
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:34.670
When I first moved you.

1577
01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:36.530
Very well, my liege.

1578
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.030
I have spoke long:

1579
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.200
be pleased yourself to say

1580
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.700
How far you satisfied me.

1581
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.970
So please your highness,

1582
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.530
The question did at first so stagger me,

1583
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:46.530
Bearing a state of mighty moment in't

1584
01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.300
And consequence of dread,

1585
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.200
that I committed the daring'st counsel

1586
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.930
which I had to doubt;

1587
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:53.130
And did entreat your highness

1588
01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:56.430
to this course which you are running here.

1589
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.700
I then moved you,

1590
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.630
My Lord of Canterbury;

1591
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:04.400
and got your leave to make this present summons:

1592
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.470
unsolicited I left no reverend person

1593
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.300
in this court;

1594
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.930
But by particular consent

1595
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.770
proceeded under your hands and seals:

1596
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:16.170
therefore, go on:

1597
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.570
For no dislike i' the world

1598
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:20.070
against the person of the good queen,

1599
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:24.530
but the sharp thorny points of my alleged reasons,

1600
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.500
drive this forward:

1601
01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:31.900
Prove but our marriage lawful,

1602
01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.200
by my life and kingly dignity,

1603
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.170
we are contented

1604
01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.930
To wear our mortal state to come with her,

1605
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:40.430
Katharine our queen,

1606
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:41.870
before the primest creature

1607
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:43.700
That's paragon'd o' the world.

1608
01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:08.230
So please your highness,

1609
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:09.670
The queen being absent,

1610
01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:11.870
'tis a needful fitness that we adjourn this court

1611
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:14.030
till further day:

1612
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.870
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion

1613
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:17.930
Made to the queen, to call back her appeal

1614
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:20.170
She intends unto his holiness.

1615
01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.800
I may perceive these cardinals trifle with me:

1616
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.470
I abhor this dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.

1617
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:38.670
My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,

1618
01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:39.730
Prithee, return:

1619
01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:40.770
with thy approach, I know,

1620
01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:42.500
My comfort comes along.

1621
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.330
Break up the court:

1622
01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:48.570
I say, set on.

1623
01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.300
Take thy lute, wench:

1624
01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.330
my soul grows sad with troubles;

1625
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:20.400
Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst:

1626
01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:22.730
leave working.

1627
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:32.730
♪ Orpheus with his lute made trees,

To his music plants and flowers

Even the billows of the sea,

Hung their heads, and then lay by.

In sweet music is such art,

How now!

1640

An't please your grace,

1641
01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:53.400
the two great cardinals wait in the presence.

1642
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.470
Would they speak with me?

1643
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:58.600
They will'd me say so, madam.

1644
01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.770
Pray their graces to come near.

a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?

Now I think on't,

1649
01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:12.900
They should be good men;

1650
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:16.300
their affairs as righteous:

1651
01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.700
But all hoods make not monks.

1652
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.770
Peace to your highness!

I would be all, against the worst may happen.

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:37.830
What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?

1656
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:39.000
May it please you noble madam,

1657
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.670
to withdraw into your private chamber,

1658
01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:42.970

There's nothing I have done yet,

1661
01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.430
o' my conscience, deserves a corner:

1662
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:49.830
would all other women could speak this

1663
01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:53.070
with as free a soul as I do!

1664
01:20:53.070 --> 01:20:53.930
My lords, I care not,

1665
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:56.470
so much I am happy above a number,

1666
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:58.700
if my actions were tried by every tongue,

1667
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:00.200
every eye saw 'em,

1668
01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.170
Envy and base opinion set against 'em,

1669
01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:05.430
I know my life so even.

1670
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:06.600
If your business seek me out,

1671

and that way I am wife in,

1672
01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:12.000
Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.

regina serenissima,--

1675
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:20.970
O, good my lord, no Latin;

1676
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:22.930
I am not such a truant since my coming,

1677
01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:25.500
As not to know the language I have lived in:

1678
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.500
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,

1679
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.870
suspicious;

1680
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:32.900
Pray, speak in English:

1681
01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.370
here are some will thank you, if you speak truth,

1682
01:21:35.370 --> 01:21:39.000
for their poor mistress' sake;

1683
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.100
lord cardinal,

1684
01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:42.030
The willing'st sin I ever yet committed

1685
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.330
May be absolved in English.

1686
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:45.770
Noble lady,

1687
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:48.170
I am sorry my integrity should breed,

1688
01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:50.900
And service to his majesty and you,

1689
01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:55.770
So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.

1690
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:58.070
We come not by the way of accusation,

1691
01:21:58.070 --> 01:22:01.470
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,

1692
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:03.200
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,

1693
01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.930
You have too much, good lady;

1694
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:08.800
but to know how you stand minded

1695
01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.930
in the weighty difference

1696
01:22:09.930 --> 01:22:12.730
Between the king and you; and to deliver,

1697
01:22:12.730 --> 01:22:13.930
Like free and honest men,

1698
01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:17.700
our just opinions and comforts to your cause.

1699
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.700
Most honour'd madam,

1700
01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:21.930
My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,

1701
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:24.570
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,

1702
01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:27.000
Forgetting, like a good man your late censure

1703
01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.570
Both of his truth and him, which was too far,

1704
01:22:30.570 --> 01:22:33.030
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,

1705
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:34.570
His service and his counsel.

1706
01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:38.730
My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;

1707
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:43.500
Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!

1708
01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.170
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,

1709
01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:50.170
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,

1710
01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:53.500
More near my life, I fear,

1711
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.430
with my weak wit,

1712
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.100
And to such men of gravity and learning,

1713
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.800
In truth, I know not.

1714
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.370
I was set at work among my maids:

1715
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:00.730
full little, God knows,

1716
01:23:00.730 --> 01:23:04.470
looking either for such men or such business.

1717
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:07.800
For her sake that I have been,

1718
01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:11.730
for I feel the last fit of my greatness,

1719
01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:12.700
good your graces,

1720
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:15.930
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:

1721
01:23:15.930 --> 01:23:20.670
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

1722
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:23.400
Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:

1723
01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.200
Your hopes and friends are infinite.

1724
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.330
In England

1725
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:31.630
But little for my profit:

1726
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:32.630
can you think, lords,

1727
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:35.670
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?

1728
01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:38.570
Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,

1729
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:42.130
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,

1730
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:44.900
And live a subject?

1731
01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:49.330
Nay, forsooth, my friends,

1732
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:51.230
They that must weigh out my afflictions,

1733
01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:54.930
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:

1734
01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:57.270
They are, as all my other comforts,

1735
01:23:57.270 --> 01:24:01.370
far hence In mine own country, lords.

1736
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.330
I would your grace

1737
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:05.170
Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

1738
01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.500
How, sir?

1739
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.600
Put your main cause into the king's protection;

1740
01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.270
He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much

1741
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:14.600
Both for your honour better and your cause;

1742
01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.970
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,

1743
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:18.600
You'll part away disgraced.

1744
01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.200
He tells you rightly.

1745
01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.530
Ye tell me what ye wish for both,

1746
01:24:23.530 --> 01:24:25.770
my ruin:

1747
01:24:25.770 --> 01:24:31.470
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!

1748
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:32.570
Heaven is above all yet;

1749
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:34.730
there sits a judge that no king can corrupt.

1750
01:24:34.730 --> 01:24:36.070
Your rage mistakes us.

1751
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.830
The more shame for ye:

1752
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:38.830
holy men I thought ye,

1753
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.870
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;

1754
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:44.530
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:

1755
01:24:44.530 --> 01:24:47.100
Mend 'em, for shame, my lords.

1756
01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.700
Is this your comfort?

1757
01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.600
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,

1758
01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.800
A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?

1759
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.700
I will not wish ye half my miseries;

1760
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.900
I have more charity:

1761
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.270
but say, I warn'd ye;

1762
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:02.630
Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed,

1763
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.830
lest at once the burthen of my sorrows

1764
01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:06.600
fall upon ye.

1765
01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.030
Madam, this is a mere distraction;

1766
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:10.100
You turn the good we offer into envy.

1767
01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.130
Ye turn me into nothing:

1768
01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:16.630
out upon ye and all such false professors!

1769
01:25:16.630 --> 01:25:17.430
would you have me

1770
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:19.600
If you have any justice, any pity;

1771
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.930
If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits

1772
01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:29.470
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?

1773
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:32.500
Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,

1774
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.230
His love, too long ago!

1775
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:38.900
I am old, my lords,

1776
01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.800
And all the fellowship I hold now with him

1777
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.730
Is only my obedience.

1778
01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:47.570
What can happen to me above this wretchedness?

1779
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:51.270
all your studies make me a curse like this.

1780
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:52.530
Your fears are worse.

1781
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:55.800
Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,

1782
01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.570
Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?

1783
01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:01.730
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,

1784
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:04.000
Never yet branded with suspicion?

1785
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.030
Have I with all my full affections

1786
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:07.730
Still met the king?

1787
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.100
loved him next heaven? obey'd him?

1788
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.630
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?

1789
01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:14.870
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?

1790
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.670
And am I thus rewarded?

1791
01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:20.070
'tis not well, lords.

1792
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:22.170
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,

1793
01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:25.770
One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;

1794
01:26:25.770 --> 01:26:27.800
And to that woman, when she has done most,

1795
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.270
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.

1796
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:33.530
Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

1797
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:38.930
My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,

1798
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:41.070
To give up willingly that noble title

1799
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:43.900
Your master wed me to:

1800
01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:47.030
nothing but death shall e'er divorce my dignities.

1801
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:48.030
Pray, hear me.

1802
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.900
Would I had never trod this English earth,

1803
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.570
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!

1804
01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:59.200
Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.

1805
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:04.500
What will become of me now, wretched lady!

1806
01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:09.870
I am the most unhappy woman living.

1807
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:14.430
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!

1808
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:19.300
Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom,

1809
01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:24.000
where no pity, no friend, no hope;

1810
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.170
no kindred weep for me;

1811
01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:30.000
Almost no grave allow'd me:

1812
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.730
like the lily, that once was mistress of the field

1813
01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:35.630
and flourish'd,

1814
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:38.300
I'll hang my head and perish.

1815
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:46.070
If your grace could but be brought to know

1816
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:48.170
our ends are honest,

1817
01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:51.100
You'ld feel more comfort:

1818
01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.400
why should we, good lady,

1819
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.070
Upon what cause, wrong you?

1820
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:56.200
alas, our places,

1821
01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.770
The way of our profession is against it:

1822
01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:03.600
We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.

1823
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.430
For goodness' sake, consider what you do;

1824
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:08.400
How you may hurt yourself,

1825
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.870
ay, utterly grow from the king's acquaintance,

1826
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:12.830
by this carriage.

1827
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.100
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,

1828
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.800
So much they love it;

1829
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.230
but to stubborn spirits they swell, and grow

1830
01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:22.500
as terrible as storms.

1831
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.530
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,

1832
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:28.400
A soul as even as a calm:

1833
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.030
pray, think us those we profess,

1834
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:34.930
peace-makers, friends, and servants.

1835
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:38.070
Madam, you'll find it so.

1836
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:39.230
You wrong your virtues

1837
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.400
With these weak women's fears:

1838
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.030
a noble spirit, as yours was put into you,

1839
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:47.530
ever casts such doubts, as false coin, from it.

1840
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:49.600
The king loves you;

1841
01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.230
Beware you lose it not: for us,

1842
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:54.400
if you please to trust us in your business,

1843
01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.300
we are ready to use our utmost studies

1844
01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.500
in your service.

1845
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.170
Do what ye will, my lords:

1846
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.070
and, pray, forgive me,

1847
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:06.800
If I have used myself unmannerly;

1848
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.230
You know I am a woman,

1849
01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:13.500
lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons.

1850
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:17.030
Pray, do my service to his majesty:

1851
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:20.000
He has my heart yet;

1852
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.400
and shall have my prayers while I shall have my life.

1853
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.670
Come, reverend fathers,

1854
01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:28.500
Bestow your counsels on me:

1855
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.400
she now begs, that little thought,

1856
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.970
when she set footing here,

1857
01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:36.300
She should have bought her dignities so dear.

1858
01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:48.170
If you will now unite in your complaints,

1859
01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:49.530
And force them with a constancy,

1860
01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.070
the cardinal cannot stand under them:

1861
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:53.800
if you omit the offer of this time,

1862
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800
I cannot promise

1863
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.400
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,

1864
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.600
With these you bear already.

1865
01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.970
I am joyful to meet the least occasion

1866
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:59.900
that may give me

1867
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.070
Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,

1868
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:02.170
To be revenged on him.

1869
01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:04.370
Which of the peers have uncontemn'd gone by him,

1870
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:06.930
or at least strangely neglected?

1871
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:08.600
when did he regard the stamp of nobleness

1872
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.970
in any person out of himself?

1873
01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:12.170
My lords, you speak your pleasures:

1874
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.900
What he deserves of you and me I know;

1875
01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.100
What we can do to him,

1876
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.370
though now the time gives way to us, I much fear.

1877
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:21.500
If you cannot bar his access to the king,

1878
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.930
never attempt any thing on him;

1879
01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:24.800
for he hath a witchcraft

1880
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.830
Over the king in's tongue.

1881
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:28.630
O, fear him not;

1882
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:30.500
His spell in that is out:

1883
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.070
the king hath found matter against him

1884
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:34.930
that for ever mars the honey of his language.

1885
01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.530
No, he's settled,

1886
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:38.100
Not to come off, in his displeasure.

1887
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.870
Sir, I should be glad to hear such news as this

1888
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:40.930
Once every hour.

1889
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:43.170
Believe it, this is true:

1890
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:45.100
In the divorce his contrary proceedings

1891
01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.370
Are all unfolded

1892
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:49.370
wherein he appears as I would wish mine enemy.

1893
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:50.730
How came his practises to light?

1894
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.200
Most strangely.

1895
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.300
O, how, how?

1896
01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.470
The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,

1897
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.600
And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,

1898
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.830
How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness

1899
01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:02.100
To stay the judgment o' the divorce;

1900
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.000
for if it did take place, 'I do,' quoth he,

1901
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.630
'perceive my king is tangled in affection

1902
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:09.770
to a creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'

1903
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:10.700
Has the king this?

1904
01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:11.570
Believe it.

1905
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:12.530
Will this work?

1906
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:14.030
The king in this perceives him,

1907
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:16.430
how he coasts and hedges his own way.

1908
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:18.400
But in this point all his tricks founder,

1909
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.600
and he brings his physic

1910
01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.630
After his patient's death:

1911
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.330
the king already hath married the fair lady.

1912
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:25.430
Would he had!

1913
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:26.800
May you be happy in your wish, my lord

1914
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.830
For, I profess, you have it.

1915
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:31.370
Now, all my joy trace the conjunction!

1916
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:32.400
My amen to't!

1917
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.770
All men's!

1918
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:35.570
There's order given for her coronation:

1919
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:37.270
Marry, this is yet but young,

1920
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:39.230
and may be left to some ears unrecounted.

1921
01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:40.230
But, will the king

1922
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:42.270
Digest this letter of the cardinal's?

1923
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.430
The Lord forbid!

1924
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:44.330
Marry, amen!

1925
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:46.800
No, no; there be moe wasps

1926
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.270
that buzz about his nose

1927
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:51.100
Will make this sting the sooner.

1928
01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:55.700
Cardinal Campeius is stol'n away to Rome;

1929
01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.330
hath ta'en no leave;

1930
01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:59.130
Has left the cause o' the king unhandled;

1931
01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:02.330
and is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,

1932
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:05.530
To second all his plot.

1933
01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:08.600
I do assure you the king cried Ha! at this.

1934
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.670
Now, God incense him,

1935
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:12.300
And let him cry Ha! louder!

1936
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:15.670
But, my lord, when returns Cranmer?

1937
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:17.300
He is return'd in his opinions;

1938
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.330
which have satisfied the king for his divorce,

1939
01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:21.100
Together with all famous colleges

1940
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.100
Almost in Christendom:

1941
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.070
shortly, I believe,

1942
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:25.500
His second marriage shall be publish'd,

1943
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.430
and her coronation.

1944
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:29.730
Katharine no more shall be call'd queen,

1945
01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:33.470
but princess dowager and widow to Prince Arthur.

1946
01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:35.700
This same Cranmer's

1947
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.570
A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain

1948
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:40.070
In the king's business.

1949
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.900
The packet, Cromwell. Gave't you the king?

1950
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.000
To his own hand, in's bedchamber.

1951
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.970
Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?

1952
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:48.870
Presently he did unseal them:

1953
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:50.230
and the first he view'd,

1954
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:52.200
He did it with a serious mind;

1955
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.400
a heed was in his countenance.

1956
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.700
You he bade attend him here this morning.

1957
01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.430
Is he ready to come abroad?

1958
01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:00.970
I think, by this he is.

1959
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:02.270
Leave me awhile.

1960
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:08.070
It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,

1961
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:11.570
The French king's sister: he shall marry her.

1962
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:16.200
Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:

1963
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:19.970
There's more in't than fair visage.

1964
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:25.330
Bullen! No, we'll no Bullens.

1965
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:27.600
Speedily I wish to hear from Rome.

1966
01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:32.930
The Marchioness of Pembroke!

1967
01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:38.830
He's discontented.

1968
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:39.800
May be, he hears the king

1969
01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.270
does whet his anger to him.

1970
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:43.730
Sharp enough, Lord, for thy justice!

1971
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:46.070
The late queen's gentlewoman,

1972
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:47.330
a knight's daughter,

1973
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:50.100
To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!

1974
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.470
This candle burns not clear:

1975
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:56.400
'tis I must snuff it;

1976
01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.070
Then out it goes.

1977
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:01.470
What though I know her virtuous and well deserving?

1978
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:04.100
yet I know her for a spleeny Lutheran;

1979
01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.330
and not wholesome to our cause,

1980
01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:07.870
that she should lie i' the bosom of our

1981
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:10.370
hard-ruled king.

1982
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.530
Again, there is sprung up an heretic,

1983
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:18.970
an arch one, Cranmer;

1984
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:22.470
one hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,

1985
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:24.200
And is his oracle.

1986
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:26.170
He is vex'd at something.

1987
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:27.970
I would 'twere something that would fret the string,

1988
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:30.370
The master-cord on's heart!

1989
01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:31.670
The king, the king!

1990
01:34:31.670 --> 01:34:33.770
What piles of wealth hath he accumulated

1991
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:35.170
To his own portion!

1992
01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:36.500
and what expense by the hour

1993
01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.130
seems to flow from him!

1994
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:39.070
How, i' the name of thrift,

1995
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:40.800
Does he rake this together!

1996
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.070
Now, my lords, saw you the cardinal?

1997
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:46.170
My lord, we have stood here observing him:

1998
01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:48.470
some strange commotion is in his brain:

1999
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:49.830
he bites his lip, and starts;

2000
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:51.870
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,

2001
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:53.570
Then lays his finger on his temple,

2002
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:55.430
straight springs out into fast gait;

2003
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:56.930
then stops again,

2004
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.600
Strikes his breast hard,

2005
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.370
and anon he casts his eye against the moon:

2006
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:04.130
in most strange postures we have seen him set himself.

2007
01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:04.930
It may well be;

2008
01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:07.230
There is a mutiny in's mind.

2009
01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:09.770
This morning papers of state he sent me to peruse,

2010
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.070
As I required:

2011
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:12.430
and wot you what I found there,

2012
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:14.430
on my conscience, put unwittingly?

2013
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:16.330
Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;

2014
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:18.400
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,

2015
01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.930
Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household;

2016
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:22.770
which I find at such proud rate,

2017
01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:25.170
that it out-speaks possession of a subject.

2018
01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:26.130
It's heaven's will:

2019
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:27.800
Some spirit put this paper in the packet,

2020
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.470
To bless your eye withal.

2021
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:30.770
If we did think his contemplation

2022
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:31.600
were above the earth,

2023
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.570
And fix'd on spiritual object,

2024
01:35:33.570 --> 01:35:36.730
he should still dwell in his musings:

2025
01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:39.730
but I am afraid his thinkings are below the moon,

2026
01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:42.030
not worth his serious considering.

2027
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:56.730
Heaven forgive me!

2028
01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:58.730
Ever God bless your highness!

2029
01:35:58.730 --> 01:35:59.470
Good my lord,

2030
01:35:59.470 --> 01:36:00.770
You are full of heavenly stuff,

2031
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:02.330
and bear the inventory of your best graces

2032
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:03.300
in your mind;

2033
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.130
the which you were now running o'er:

2034
01:36:05.130 --> 01:36:06.030
you have scarce time

2035
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:08.000
To steal from spiritual leisure

2036
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.530
a brief span to keep your earthly audit:

2037
01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:13.470
sure, in that I deem you an ill husband,

2038
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:15.900
and am glad to have you therein my companion.

2039
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.100
Sir,For holy offices I have a time;

2040
01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.770
a time to think upon the part of business

2041
01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:21.170
which I bear i' the state;

2042
01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:24.370
and nature does require her times of preservation,

2043
01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:26.430
which perforce I, her frail son,

2044
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:27.770
amongst my brethren mortal,

2045
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:29.500
Must give my tendence to.

2046
01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500
You have said well.

2047
01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.600
And ever may your highness yoke together,

2048
01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:34.930
As I will lend you cause,

2049
01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:37.230
my doing well with my well saying!

2050
01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:38.630
'Tis well said again;

2051
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:41.770
And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:

2052
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:45.700
And yet words are no deeds.

2053
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.630
My father loved you:

2054
01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:50.930
His said he did;

2055
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.670
and with his deed did crown his word upon you.

2056
01:36:54.670 --> 01:36:55.970
Since I had my office,

2057
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:58.270
I have kept you next my heart;

2058
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:59.500
have not alone employ'd you

2059
01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.630
where high profits might come home,

2060
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.730
But pared my present havings,

2061
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:06.630
to bestow my bounties upon you.

2062
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:09.570
Have I not made you, the prime man of the state?

2063
01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.870
I pray you, tell me,

2064
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:13.230
If what I now pronounce you have found true:

2065
01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:14.870
And, if you may confess it, say withal,

2066
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.770
If you are bound to us or no.

2067
01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:19.270
What say you?

2068
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:22.370
My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,

2069
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:24.470
Shower'd on me daily, have been more

2070
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:27.400
than could my studied purposes requite;

2071
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.030
which went beyond all man's endeavours:

2072
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:31.830
my endeavours have ever come too short

2073
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:33.070
of my desires,

2074
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:35.070
Yet filed with my abilities:

2075
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:37.630
mine own ends have been mine

2076
01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:39.130
so that evermore they pointed

2077
01:37:39.130 --> 01:37:41.270
To the good of your most sacred person

2078
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:42.970
and the profit of the state.

2079
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.530
For your great graces heap'd upon me,

2080
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:48.570
poor undeserver, I can nothing

2081
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:50.300
render but allegiant thanks,

2082
01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.900
My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,

2083
01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:56.100
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,

2084
01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:00.270
Till death, that winter, kill it.

2085
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:01.730
Fairly answer'd;

2086
01:38:01.730 --> 01:38:03.800
A loyal and obedient subject

2087
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.100
is therein illustrated:

2088
01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:09.430
the honour of it does pay the act of it;

2089
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:10.900
as, i' the contrary,

2090
01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:14.000
The foulness is the punishment.

2091
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.130
I presume that,

2092
01:38:17.130 --> 01:38:19.330
as my hand has open'd bounty to you,

2093
01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:20.500
My heart dropp'd love,

2094
01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.930
my power rain'd honour,

2095
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:24.130
more on you than any;

2096
01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:25.370
so your hand and heart,

2097
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:28.170
Your brain, and every function of your power,

2098
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:31.700
Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,

2099
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.670
As 'twere in love's particular,

2100
01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:36.430
be more to me, your friend, than any.

2101
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:38.730
I do profess

2102
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:40.170
That for your highness' good I ever labour'd

2103
01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:42.330
More than mine own;

2104
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:43.630
that am, have, and will be

2105
01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.030
Though all the world should crack

2106
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:46.000
their duty to you,

2107
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And throw it from their soul;

2108
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.100
though perils did abound,

2109
01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:50.400
as thick as thought could make 'em,

2110
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.970
and appear in forms more horrid,

2111
01:38:51.970 --> 01:38:57.130
yet my duty, as doth a rock against the chiding flood,

2112
01:38:57.130 --> 01:38:59.800
Should the approach of this wild river break,

2113
01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.430
And stand unshaken yours.

2114
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:04.330
'Tis nobly spoken:

2115
01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:07.230
Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,

2116
01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:09.700
For you have seen him open't.

2117
01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.770
Read o'er this; and after, this:

2118
01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:15.830
and then to breakfast

2119
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:18.570
with what appetite you have.

2120
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.830
What should this mean?

2121
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.330
What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?

2122
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.200
He parted frowning from me,

2123
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.200
as if ruin leap'd from his eyes:

2124
01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.570
so looks the chafed lion upon the daring huntsman

2125
01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:45.930
that has gall'd him;

2126
01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:48.170
Then makes him nothing.

2127
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:52.470
I must read this paper;

2128
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:54.400
I fear, the story of his anger.

2129
01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:03.230
'Tis so; This paper has undone me:

2130
01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.670
'tis the account of all that world of wealth

2131
01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:07.900
I have drawn together for mine own ends;

2132
01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:10.100
indeed, to gain the popedom,

2133
01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.330
And fee my friends in Rome.

2134
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.630
O negligence!

2135
01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:17.470
Fit for a fool to fall by:

2136
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:20.270
what cross devil made me put this main secret

2137
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:21.700
in the packet I sent the king?

2138
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.830
Is there no way to cure this?

2139
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:26.470
No new device to beat this from his brains?

2140
01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:30.370
I know 'twill stir him strongly;

2141
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:36.070
yet I know a way, if it take right, in spite of fortune

2142
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:37.330
Will bring me off again.

2143
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:41.670
What's this? 'To the Pope!'

2144
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:57.470
The letter, as I live,

2145
01:40:57.470 --> 01:41:01.700
with all the business I writ to's holiness.

2146
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:08.430
Nay then, farewell!

2147
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.630
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;

2148
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:18.430
And, from that full meridian of my glory,

2149
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.000
I haste now to my setting:

2150
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.500
I shall fall like a bright exhalation

2151
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.830
in the evening,

2152
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:40.230
And no man see me more.

2153
01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.630
Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal:

2154
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.670
who commands you to render up the great seal

2155
01:41:57.670 --> 01:41:59.770
presently into our hands;

2156
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:01.970
and to confine yourself to Asher House,

2157
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:03.370
my Lord of Winchester's,

2158
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:06.000
Till you hear further from his highness.

2159
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.200
Stay:

2160
01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.630
Where's your commission, lords?

2161
01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.400
words cannot carry authority so weighty.

2162
01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:19.730
Who dare cross 'em,

2163
01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:22.900
Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?

2164
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:26.570
Till I find more than will or words to do it,

2165
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:30.130
I mean your malice, know, officious lords,

2166
01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.770
I dare and must deny it.

2167
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.270
Now I feel of what coarse metal ye are moulded,

2168
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:40.100
envy:

2169
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:41.930
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,

2170
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:43.730
As if it fed ye!

2171
01:42:43.730 --> 01:42:45.230
and how sleek and wanton

2172
01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:48.200
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!

2173
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:52.670
Follow your envious courses, men of malice;

2174
01:42:52.670 --> 01:42:54.670
You have Christian warrant for 'em,

2175
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:55.730
and, no doubt, in time

2176
01:42:55.730 --> 01:42:58.100
will find their fit rewards.

2177
01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.230
That seal, you ask with such a violence,

2178
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:03.930
the king, mine and your master,

2179
01:43:03.930 --> 01:43:05.870
with his own hand gave me;

2180
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:09.070
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,

2181
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:13.000
During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,

2182
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.900
Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?

2183
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:19.430
The king, that gave it.

2184
01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.130
It must be himself, then.

2185
01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.400
Thou art a proud traitor, priest.

2186
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.970
Proud lord, thou liest:

2187
01:43:26.970 --> 01:43:28.070
Within these forty hours

2188
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:29.300
Surrey durst better

2189
01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.330
Have burnt that tongue than said so.

2190
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:34.470
Thy ambition, thou scarlet sin,

2191
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:36.730
robb'd this bewailing land of noble Buckingham,

2192
01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:38.530
my father-in-law:

2193
01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:39.700
The heads of all thy brother cardinals,

2194
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.370
With thee and all thy best parts bound together,

2195
01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:43.000
Weigh'd not a hair of his.

2196
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.630
Plague of your policy!

2197
01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:46.800
You sent me deputy for Ireland;

2198
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.370
Far from his succor, from the king,

2199
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:49.400
from all that might have mercy

2200
01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.830
on the fault thou gavest him;

2201
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.570
Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,

2202
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:54.230
Absolved him with an axe.

2203
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.070
This, and all else this talking lord

2204
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:57.370
can lay upon my credit,

2205
01:43:57.370 --> 01:43:59.000
I answer is most false.

2206
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.300
The duke by law found his deserts:

2207
01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.300
how innocent I was

2208
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.270
From any private malice in his end,

2209
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:07.270
His noble jury and foul cause can witness.

2210
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:08.870
If I loved many words, lord,

2211
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:09.770
I should tell you

2212
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:11.930
You have as little honesty as honour,

2213
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:13.230
Your long coat, priest, protects you;

2214
01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:14.300
thou shouldst feel my sword

2215
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.330
i' the life-blood of thee else.

2216
01:44:16.330 --> 01:44:17.200
My lords,

2217
01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.330
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?

2218
01:44:18.330 --> 01:44:19.370
And from this fellow?

2219
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:20.530
if we live thus tamely,

2220
01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:22.230
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,

2221
01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:24.600
Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,

2222
01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.730
And dare us with his cap like larks.

2223
01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:29.100
All goodness is poison to thy stomach.

2224
01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:30.300
Yes, that goodness of gleaning

2225
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.300
all the land's wealth into one

2226
01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.170
Into your own hands,

2227
01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:33.430
cardinal, by extortion;

2228
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:34.730
The goodness of your intercepted packets

2229
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:37.300
You writ to the pope against the king:

2230
01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.070
your goodness, since you provoke me,

2231
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:41.470
shall be most notorious.

2232
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:43.800
My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,

2233
01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.370
As you respect the common good,

2234
01:44:45.370 --> 01:44:47.300
the state of our despised nobility,

2235
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.830
our issues, who, if he live,

2236
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:51.370
will scarce be gentlemen,

2237
01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:53.430
Produce the grand sum of his sins,

2238
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:56.000
the articles collected from his life.

2239
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.400
I'll startle you worse than the scaring bell,

2240
01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.730
when the brown wench lay kissing in your arms,

2241
01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:02.230
lord cardinal.

2242
01:45:02.230 --> 01:45:04.170
How much, methinks, I could despise this man,

2243
01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:06.770
But that I am bound in charity against it!

2244
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.730
Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:

2245
01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:12.630
But, thus much, they are foul ones.

2246
01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.400
So much fairer and spotless

2247
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.170
shall mine innocence arise,

2248
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:19.870
When the king knows my truth.

2249
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:20.970
This cannot save you:

2250
01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:21.830
I thank my memory,

2251
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:23.430
I yet remember some of these articles;

2252
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:24.700
and out they shall.

2253
01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:26.670
Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,

2254
01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:28.330
You'll show a little honesty.

2255
01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:29.100
Speak on, sir;

2256
01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.370
I dare your worst objections:

2257
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:31.230
if I blush,

2258
01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:33.100
It is to see a nobleman want manners.

2259
01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.330
I had rather want those than my head.

2260
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:36.430
Have at you!

2261
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:38.900
First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,

2262
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.430
You wrought to be a legate;

2263
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:42.270
by which power you maim'd the jurisdiction

2264
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:43.830
of all bishops.

2265
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:45.430
Then, that in all you writ to Rome,

2266
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:48.430
or else to foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'

2267
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:50.600
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king

2268
01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.270
To be your servant.

2269
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:53.900
Then that, without the knowledge

2270
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.400
Either of king or council,

2271
01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.030
when you went ambassador to the emperor,

2272
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:59.030
you made bold to carry into Flanders

2273
01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:00.400
the great seal.

2274
01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:01.870
Item, you sent a large commission

2275
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:03.770
To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,

2276
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:05.930
Without the king's will or the state's allowance,

2277
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:08.300
A league between his highness and Ferrara.

2278
01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:09.470
That, out of mere ambition,

2279
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:11.300
you have caused your holy hat

2280
01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.200
to be stamp'd on the king's coin.

2281
01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.030
Then that you have sent innumerable substance

2282
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:17.370
By what means got, I leave to your own conscience

2283
01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:19.270
To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways

2284
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:20.300
You have for dignities;

2285
01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.970
to the mere undoing of all the kingdom.

2286
01:46:23.130 --> 01:46:24.130
Many more there are;

2287
01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:26.070
Which, since they are of you, and odious,

2288
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:28.300
I will not taint my mouth with.

2289
01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.870
O my lord, Press not a falling man too far! '

2290
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:32.370
tis virtue:

2291
01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:34.300
His faults lie open to the laws;

2292
01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.500
let them, not you, correct him.

2293
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:40.930
My heart weeps to see him so little of his great self.

2294
01:46:40.930 --> 01:46:42.370
I forgive him.

2295
01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:45.170
Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,

2296
01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:47.230
Because all those things you have done of late,

2297
01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:49.470
By your power legatine, within this kingdom,

2298
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:52.200
Fall into the compass of a praemunire,

2299
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.800
That therefore such a writ be sued against you;

2300
01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.130
To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,

2301
01:46:58.130 --> 01:47:00.700
Chattels, and whatsoever,

2302
01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:04.130
and to be out of the king's protection.

2303
01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:06.200
This is my charge.

2304
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.200
And so we'll leave you to your meditations

2305
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:10.570
How to live better.

2306
01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:11.570
For your stubborn answer

2307
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:13.170
About the giving back the great seal to us,

2308
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:14.700
The king shall know it,

2309
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.930
and, no doubt, shall thank you.

2310
01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:21.770
So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.

2311
01:47:27.770 --> 01:47:31.500
So farewell to the little good you bear me.

2312
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:44.170
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!

2313
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:49.730
This is the state of man:

2314
01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:54.500
to-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes;

2315
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.430
to-morrow blossoms,

2316
01:47:57.430 --> 01:48:00.270
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;

2317
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:06.470
The third day comes a frost,

2318
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:09.070
a killing frost,

2319
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:11.170
And, when he thinks, good easy man,

2320
01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:14.600
full surely his greatness is a-ripening,

2321
01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:20.970
nips his root, and then he falls, as I do.

2322
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.870
I have ventured, like little wanton boys

2323
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:29.270
that swim on bladders,

2324
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:32.730
This many summers in a sea of glory,

2325
01:48:32.730 --> 01:48:35.430
But far beyond my depth:

2326
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:41.070
my high-blown pride at length broke under me

2327
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:42.900
and now has left me,

2328
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.700
Weary and old with service,

2329
01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:48.430
to the mercy of a rude stream,

2330
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:52.370
that must for ever hide me.

2331
01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.730
Vain pomp and glory of this world,

2332
01:49:00.730 --> 01:49:02.470
I hate ye:

2333
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:07.730
I feel my heart new open'd.

2334
01:49:07.730 --> 01:49:10.300
O, how wretched is that poor man

2335
01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:12.570
that hangs on princes' favours!

2336
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:16.630
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,

2337
01:49:16.630 --> 01:49:19.730
That sweet aspect of princes,

2338
01:49:19.730 --> 01:49:22.800
and their ruin,

2339
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.970
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:

2340
01:49:27.970 --> 01:49:32.970
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,

2341
01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:35.030
Never to hope again.

2342
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:57.170
Why, how now, Cromwell!

2343
01:49:58.370 --> 01:50:00.000
I have no power to speak, sir.

2344
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:04.830
What, amazed at my misfortunes?

2345
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:08.100
can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline?

2346
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:11.370
Nay, an you weep, I am fall'n indeed.

2347
01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:14.770
How does your grace?

2348
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:17.100
Why, well;

2349
01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:20.930
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.

2350
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:22.930
I know myself now;

2351
01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:25.070
and I feel within me a peace

2352
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:27.700
above all earthly dignities,

2353
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:32.630
A still and quiet conscience.

2354
01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:34.500
The king has cured me,

2355
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.630
I humbly thank his grace;

2356
01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:37.900
and from these shoulders,

2357
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.800
These ruin'd pillars, out of pity,

2358
01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.130
taken a load would sink a navy,

2359
01:50:43.130 --> 01:50:45.500
too much honour:

2360
01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:48.130
O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell,

2361
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:49.500
'tis a burthen too heavy

2362
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.470
for a man that hopes for heaven!

2363
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:55.530
I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.

2364
01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:59.930
I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,

2365
01:50:59.930 --> 01:51:02.730
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,

2366
01:51:02.730 --> 01:51:05.270
To endure more miseries and greater far

2367
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:08.870
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.

2368
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.800
What news abroad?

2369
01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:16.970
The heaviest and the worst

2370
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.900
Is your displeasure with the king.

2371
01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.330
God bless him!

2372
01:51:22.730 --> 01:51:25.830
The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen

2373
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:28.400
Lord chancellor in your place.

2374
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:32.870
That's somewhat sudden:

2375
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:35.870
But he's a learned man.

2376
01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:40.130
May he continue long in his highness' favour,

2377
01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:43.600
and do justice for truth's sake and his conscience;

2378
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.670
that his bones,

2379
01:51:44.670 --> 01:51:47.800
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,

2380
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.000
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em!

2381
01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:55.570
What more?

2382
01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.000
That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,

2383
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.770
Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.

2384
01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:04.370
That's news indeed.

2385
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:07.500
Last, that the Lady Anne,

2386
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.730
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,

2387
01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:13.030
This day was view'd in open as his queen,

2388
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:14.470
Going to chapel;

2389
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:15.770
and the voice is now

2390
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:17.900
Only about her coronation.

2391
01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:20.330
There was the weight that pull'd me down.

2392
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:24.130
O Cromwell, The king has gone beyond me:

2393
01:52:24.130 --> 01:52:27.770
all my glories in that one woman

2394
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:29.400
I have lost for ever:

2395
01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:34.070
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,

2396
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:36.930
Or gild again the noble troops that waited

2397
01:52:36.930 --> 01:52:38.630
Upon my smiles.

2398
01:52:43.230 --> 01:52:45.030
Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;

2399
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:47.430
I am a poor fall'n man,

2400
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:50.300
unworthy now to be thy lord and master:

2401
01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:51.870
seek the king;

2402
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:54.730
That sun, I pray, may never set!

2403
01:52:54.730 --> 01:52:56.900
I have told him what and how true thou art:

2404
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.030
he will advance thee;

2405
01:52:58.030 --> 01:52:59.900
Some little memory of me will stir him

2406
01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:01.870
I know his noble nature

2407
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:04.630
not to let thy hopeful service perish too:

2408
01:53:04.630 --> 01:53:06.470
good Cromwell, Neglect him not;

2409
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:07.730
make use now,

2410
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:10.000
and provide for thine own future safety.

2411
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.670
O my lord, must I, then, leave you?

2412
01:53:12.670 --> 01:53:15.200
must I needs forego so good, so noble

2413
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.630
and so true a master?

2414
01:53:17.630 --> 01:53:20.030
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,

2415
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:24.230
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.

2416
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:27.770
The king shall have my service:

2417
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:29.600
but my prayers for ever

2418
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.770
and for ever shall be yours.

2419
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:36.770
Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear

2420
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:38.300
In all my miseries;

2421
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.170
but thou hast forced me,

2422
01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:44.600
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.

2423
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:49.570
Let's dry our eyes:

2424
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:52.930
and thus far hear me, Cromwell;

2425
01:53:52.930 --> 01:53:55.530
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,

2426
01:53:55.530 --> 01:53:57.630
And sleep in dull cold marble,

2427
01:53:57.630 --> 01:54:01.500
where no mention of me more must be heard of,

2428
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:05.700
say, I taught thee,

2429
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:12.600
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,

2430
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.200
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,

2431
01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.830
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;

2432
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:24.300
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.

2433
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:30.270
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.

2434
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:34.700
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:

2435
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:38.070
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,

2436
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:40.700
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?

2437
01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:45.230
Love thyself last:

2438
01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:48.630
cherish those hearts that hate thee;

2439
01:54:48.630 --> 01:54:52.630
Corruption wins not more than honesty.

2440
01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.730
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,

2441
01:54:56.730 --> 01:54:59.700
To silence envious tongues.

2442
01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:03.170
Be just, and fear not:

2443
01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:08.430
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,

2444
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:15.300
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,

2445
01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.900
O Cromwell, thou fall'st a blessed martyr!

2446
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:35.730
Serve the king; And, prithee, lead me in:

2447
01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:38.400
There take an inventory of all I have,

2448
01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.670
To the last penny; 'tis the king's:

2449
01:55:41.670 --> 01:55:46.530
my robe, and my integrity to heaven,

2450
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:48.700
is all I dare now call mine own.

2451
01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:03.800
O Cromwell, Cromwell!

2452
01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.300
Had I but served my God with half the zeal

2453
01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:10.000
I served my king,

2454
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.300
he would not in mine age

2455
01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:14.000
Have left me naked to mine enemies.

2456
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Good sir, have patience.

2457
01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:22.470
So I have. Farewell

2458
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:27.470
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

2459
01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:43.900
You're well met once again.

2460
01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:44.730
So are you.

2461
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:45.900
You come to take your stand here,

2462
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.170
and behold The Lady Anne

2463
01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:48.330
pass from her coronation?

2464
01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:49.400
'Tis all my business.

2465
01:56:50.230 --> 01:56:51.670
At our last encounter,

2466
01:56:51.670 --> 01:56:54.570
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.

2467
01:56:55.570 --> 01:56:58.170
'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;

2468
01:56:58.170 --> 01:56:59.430
This, general joy.

2469
01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:01.730
'Tis well: the citizens, I am sure,

2470
01:57:01.730 --> 01:57:04.370
have shown at full their royal minds

2471
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:07.800
As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward

2472
01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.270
In celebration of this day with shows,

2473
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:12.330
Pageants and sights of honour.

2474
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:13.270
Never greater,

2475
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:15.700
Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.

2476
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:20.330
May I be bold to ask at what that contains,

2477
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:22.000
That paper in your hand?

2478
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.130
Yes; 'tis the list

2479
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:25.070
Of those that claim their offices this day

2480
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:27.030
By custom of the coronation.

2481
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:28.670
The Duke of Suffolk is the first,

2482
01:57:28.670 --> 01:57:30.370
and claims to be high-steward;

2483
01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:31.930
next, the Duke of Norfolk,

2484
01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:33.500
He to be earl marshal:

2485
01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:34.570
you may read the rest.

2486
01:57:34.570 --> 01:57:35.770
I thank you, sir:

2487
01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:37.600
had I not known those customs,

2488
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.530
I should have been beholding to your paper.

2489
01:57:40.530 --> 01:57:43.530
But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,

2490
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:46.070
The princess dowager? how goes her business?

2491
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:48.400
That I can tell you too.

2492
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.230
The Archbishop of Canterbury,

2493
01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:52.570
accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers

2494
01:57:52.570 --> 01:57:53.500
of his order,

2495
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.230
Held a late court at Dunstable,

2496
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:57.700
six miles off from Ampthill where the princess lay;

2497
01:57:57.700 --> 01:57:59.470
to which she was often cited by them,

2498
01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:00.670
but appear'd not:

2499
01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:04.200
And, to be short, for not appearance

2500
01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.770
and the king's late scruple,

2501
01:58:05.770 --> 01:58:08.030
by the main assent of all these learned men

2502
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:09.330
she was divorced,

2503
01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:12.600
And the late marriage made of none effect

2504
01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:14.700
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,

2505
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.270
Where she remains now sick.

2506
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:18.870
Alas, good lady!

2507
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:21.170
(trumpets sound)

2508
01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:22.070
The trumpets sound!

2509
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:24.570
Stand close, the queen is coming!

2510
01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:57.200
A royal train, believe me. These I know:

2511
01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.830
Who's that that bears the sceptre?

2512
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:01.370
Marquess Dorset:

2513
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:04.400
And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.

2514
01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.530
A bold brave gentleman.

2515
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:08.670
That should be the Duke of Suffolk?

2516
01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:10.730
'Tis the same: high-steward.

2517
01:59:10.730 --> 01:59:12.370
And that my Lord of Norfolk?

2518
01:59:12.370 --> 01:59:14.000
Yes;

2519
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.170
Heaven bless thee!

2520
01:59:26.170 --> 01:59:29.730
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.

2521
01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:34.100
Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;

2522
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:36.830
Our king has all the Indies in his arms,

2523
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:41.030
And more and richer, when he strains that lady:

2524
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:43.870
I cannot blame his conscience.

2525
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:46.930
They that bear the cloth of honour over her,

2526
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:48.770
are four barons of the Cinque-ports.

2527
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:53.370
Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.

2528
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:56.370
I take it, she that carries up the train

2529
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:59.470
Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.

2530
01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:03.400
It is; and all the rest are countesses.

2531
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:08.470
Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;

2532
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:11.070
And sometimes falling ones.

2533
02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.000
No more of that.

2534
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:46.900
How does your grace?

2535
02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:51.830
O Griffith, sick to death!

2536
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:55.070
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,

2537
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:57.870
Willing to leave their burthen.

2538
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:59.270
Reach a chair:

2539
02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:14.800
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.

2540
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:18.700
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith,

2541
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.670
as thou led'st me,

2542
02:01:20.670 --> 02:01:22.230
That the great child of honour,

2543
02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:24.870
Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?

2544
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:28.570
Yes, madam; but I think your grace,

2545
02:01:28.570 --> 02:01:32.230
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.

2546
02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:36.500
Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:

2547
02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:38.970
If well, he stepp'd before me,

2548
02:01:38.970 --> 02:01:42.130
happily for my example.

2549
02:01:42.130 --> 02:01:45.030
Well, the voice goes, madam:

2550
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:46.930
For after the stout Earl Northumberland

2551
02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:48.500
Arrested him at York,

2552
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.900
and brought him forward,

2553
02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:53.230
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,

2554
02:01:53.230 --> 02:01:56.770
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill

2555
02:01:56.770 --> 02:01:58.970
He could not sit his mule.

2556
02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:01.230
Alas, poor man!

2557
02:02:01.230 --> 02:02:05.230
At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,

2558
02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:06.800
Lodged in the abbey;

2559
02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:07.930
where the reverend abbot,

2560
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:09.300
With all his covent,

2561
02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:12.000
honourably received him;

2562
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.200
and, three nights after this,

2563
02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.000
About the hour of eight,

2564
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.870
which he himself Foretold should be his last,

2565
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:22.670
He gave his honours to the world again,

2566
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:25.170
His blessed part to heaven,

2567
02:02:25.170 --> 02:02:27.330
and slept in peace.

2568
02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:31.930
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!

2569
02:02:33.570 --> 02:02:34.530
Yet thus far, Griffith,

2570
02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:36.000
give me leave to speak him,

2571
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.600
And yet with charity.

2572
02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.500
He was a man of an unbounded stomach,

2573
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:45.030
ever ranking himself with princes;

2574
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:47.130
one that, by suggestion,

2575
02:02:47.130 --> 02:02:51.030
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;

2576
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.600
His own opinion was his law:

2577
02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.830
i' the presence he would say untruths;

2578
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:59.530
and be ever double both in his words and meaning:

2579
02:02:59.530 --> 02:03:02.700
he was never, but where he meant to ruin,

2580
02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:05.600
pitiful: his promises were,

2581
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.100
as he then was, mighty;

2582
02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:14.500
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:

2583
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:16.470
Noble madam,

2584
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:19.400
Men's evil manners live in brass;

2585
02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.600
their virtues we write in water.

2586
02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.170
May it please your highness

2587
02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:26.530
To hear me speak his good now?

2588
02:03:26.530 --> 02:03:27.500
Yes, good Griffith;

2589
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.200
I were malicious else.

2590
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.000
This cardinal,

2591
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.270
Though from an humble stock,

2592
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:35.300
undoubtedly was fashion'd to much honour

2593
02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:37.070
from his cradle.

2594
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:40.570
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;

2595
02:03:40.570 --> 02:03:44.830
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:

2596
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:48.200
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;

2597
02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.400
But to those men that sought him

2598
02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:52.370
sweet as summer.

2599
02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:55.670
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;

2600
02:03:55.670 --> 02:03:59.900
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,

2601
02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:03.630
And found the blessedness of being little:

2602
02:04:03.630 --> 02:04:06.670
And, to add greater honours to his age

2603
02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:11.670
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

2604
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:15.570
After my death I wish no other herald,

2605
02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:17.530
No other speaker of my living actions,

2606
02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:20.500
To keep mine honour from corruption,

2607
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.500
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.

2608
02:04:24.170 --> 02:04:26.700
Whom I most hated living,

2609
02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:27.630
thou hast made me,

2610
02:04:27.630 --> 02:04:29.670
With thy religious truth and modesty,

2611
02:04:29.670 --> 02:04:33.070
Now in his ashes honour:

2612
02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:35.000
peace be with him!

2613
02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:42.670
Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:

2614
02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:47.900
I have not long to trouble thee.

2615
02:04:50.170 --> 02:04:52.300
Good Griffith, cause the musicians

2616
02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:53.530
play me that sad note

2617
02:04:53.530 --> 02:04:58.500
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating

2618
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:05.270
On that celestial harmony I go to.

2619
02:05:09.930 --> 02:05:11.400
She is asleep:

2620
02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:14.570
good wench, let's sit down quiet,

2621
02:05:14.570 --> 02:05:18.430
For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.

2622
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:14.500
Spirits of peace, where are ye?

2623
02:06:15.970 --> 02:06:17.700
are ye all gone,

2624
02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:21.200
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?

2625
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:25.070
Madam, we are here.

2626
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:27.230
It is not you I call for:

2627
02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:29.070
Saw ye none enter since I slept?

2628
02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:30.630
None, madam.

2629
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:35.000
No? Saw you not, even now,

2630
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.830
a blessed troop invite me to a banquet;

2631
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:38.770
whose bright faces

2632
02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:43.230
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?

2633
02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:46.200
They promised me eternal happiness;

2634
02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.870
And brought me garlands, Griffith,

2635
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:51.970
which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear:

2636
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:59.000
I shall, assuredly.

2637
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.370
I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams

2638
02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:04.130
Possess your fancy.

2639
02:07:09.130 --> 02:07:10.870
Bid the music leave,

2640
02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.500
They are harsh and heavy to me.

2641
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:27.730
Do you note

2642
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:30.030
How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?

2643
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:33.000
How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,

2644
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.900
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!

2645
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:42.730
She is going, wench: pray, pray.

2646
02:07:44.070 --> 02:07:45.700
Heaven comfort her!

2647
02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.500
An't like your grace,

2648
02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.970
You are a saucy fellow:

2649
02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:53.100
Deserve we no more reverence?

2650
02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:54.670
You are to blame,

2651
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:56.900
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,

2652
02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:00.570
To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.

2653
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:06.200
I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;

2654
02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.770
My haste made me unmannerly.

2655
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:10.000
There is staying a gentleman,

2656
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.570
sent from the king, to see you.

2657
02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:16.830
Admit him entrance, Griffith:

2658
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:19.700
but this fellow let me ne'er see again.

2659
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:37.670
If my sight fail not,

2660
02:08:37.670 --> 02:08:38.770
You should be lord ambassador

2661
02:08:38.770 --> 02:08:42.000
from the emperor, my royal nephew,

2662
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and your name Capucius.

2663
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:49.330
Madam, the same; your servant.

2664
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.470
O, my lord,

2665
02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:55.530
The times and titles now

2666
02:08:55.530 --> 02:08:57.530
are alter'd strangely with me

2667
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:59.770
since first you knew me.

2668
02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:00.700
But, I pray you,

2669
02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:02.970
What is your pleasure with me?

2670
02:09:02.970 --> 02:09:04.200
Noble lady,

2671
02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.230
First mine own service to your grace;

2672
02:09:07.230 --> 02:09:08.830
the next, the king's request

2673
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:10.300
that I would visit you;

2674
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:12.630
Who grieves much for your weakness,

2675
02:09:12.630 --> 02:09:15.530
and by me sends you his princely commendations,

2676
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:17.930
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

2677
02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:21.230
O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;

2678
02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:27.400
'Tis like a pardon after execution:

2679
02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:30.900
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;

2680
02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:36.470
But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.

2681
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:38.000
How does his highness?

2682
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.070
Madam, in good health.

2683
02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:45.900
So may he ever do! and ever flourish,

2684
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:49.500
When I shal l dwell with worms,

2685
02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:54.770
and my poor name banish'd the kingdom!

2686
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:57.500
Patience, is that letter, I caused you write

2687
02:09:57.500 --> 02:09:58.630
yet sent away?

2688
02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:00.000
No, madam.

2689
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.070
Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver

2690
02:10:03.070 --> 02:10:05.270
This to my lord the king.

2691
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:06.370
Most willing, madam.

2692
02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:09.130
In which I have commended to his goodness

2693
02:10:09.130 --> 02:10:11.030
The model of our chaste loves,

2694
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:13.170
his young daughter;

2695
02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:14.530
The dews of heaven fall thick

2696
02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:16.630
in blessings on her!

2697
02:10:16.630 --> 02:10:20.730
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding

2698
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:25.570
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,

2699
02:10:25.570 --> 02:10:28.630
I hope she will deserve well,

2700
02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:32.500
and a little to love her for her mother's sake,

2701
02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:38.200
that loved him, heaven knows how dearly.

2702
02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:43.330
My next poor petition is,

2703
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:45.670
that his noble grace would have some pity

2704
02:10:45.670 --> 02:10:47.600
Upon my wretched women,

2705
02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:51.600
that so long have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:

2706
02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:54.570
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,

2707
02:10:54.570 --> 02:10:58.370
And now I should not lie,

2708
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.730
but will deserve for virtue

2709
02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:02.600
and true beauty of the soul,

2710
02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.230
For honesty and decent carriage,

2711
02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:06.730
A right good husband,

2712
02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:09.200
let him be a noble

2713
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:13.830
and, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.

2714
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:17.230
The last is, for my men;

2715
02:11:17.230 --> 02:11:20.600
they are the poorest,

2716
02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.700
But poverty could never draw 'em from me;

2717
02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:27.870
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,

2718
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:30.830
And something over to remember me by:

2719
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:33.900
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life

2720
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:39.700
And able means, we had not parted thus.

2721
02:11:42.730 --> 02:11:46.470
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,

2722
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:50.130
By that you love the dearest in this world,

2723
02:11:50.130 --> 02:11:53.330
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,

2724
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:56.270
Stand these poor people's friend,

2725
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:59.270
and urge the king to do me this last right.

2726
02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:01.300
By heaven, I will,

2727
02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:03.970
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

2728
02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:11.200
I thank you, honest lord.

2729
02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:17.100
Remember me in all humility unto his highness:

2730
02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:22.170
Say his long trouble

2731
02:12:22.170 --> 02:12:24.700
now is passing out of this world;

2732
02:12:27.370 --> 02:12:30.930
tell him, in death I bless'd him,

2733
02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:36.200
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim.

2734
02:12:38.370 --> 02:12:40.200
Farewell, my lord.

2735
02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:50.430
Griffith, farewell.

2736
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:54.500
Nay, Patience,

2737
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:57.500
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;

2738
02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.500
Call in more women.

2739
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:02.070
When I am dead, good wench,

2740
02:13:02.070 --> 02:13:04.300
Let me be used with honour:

2741
02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:07.100
strew me over with maiden flowers,

2742
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:10.370
that all the world may know I was a chaste wife

2743
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:12.730
to my grave:

2744
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:17.870
embalm me, then lay me forth:

2745
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:19.930
although unqueen'd,

2746
02:13:19.930 --> 02:13:26.300
yet like a queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.

2747
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:30.630
I can no more.

2748
02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:21.570
It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?

2749
02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:23.070
It hath struck.

2750
02:14:24.130 --> 02:14:25.930
These should be hours for necessities,

2751
02:14:25.930 --> 02:14:28.170
Not for delights;

2752
02:14:28.170 --> 02:14:31.900
times to repair our nature with comforting repose,

2753
02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:34.930
and not for us to waste these times.

2754
02:14:36.230 --> 02:14:37.670
Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!

2755
02:14:37.670 --> 02:14:39.630
Whither so late?

2756
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:41.330
Came you from the king, my lord

2757
02:14:41.330 --> 02:14:43.600
I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero

2758
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.400
With the Duke of Suffolk.

2759
02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.070
I must to him too, before he go to bed.

2760
02:14:47.070 --> 02:14:48.070
I'll take my leave.

2761
02:14:48.070 --> 02:14:50.230
Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell.

2762
02:14:50.230 --> 02:14:52.270
What's the matter? It seems you are in haste:

2763
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:55.270
an if there be no great offence belongs to't,

2764
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:59.170
give your friend some touch of your late business:

2765
02:14:59.170 --> 02:15:01.830
affairs, that walk, as they say spirits do,

2766
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:05.470
at midnight, have in them a wilder nature

2767
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:09.430
than the business that seeks dispatch by day.

2768
02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:11.600
My lord, I love you;

2769
02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.370
And durst commend a secret to your ear

2770
02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:15.400
Much weightier than this work.

2771
02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:17.600
The queen's in labour,

2772
02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:19.770
They say, in great extremity;

2773
02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:21.970
and fear'd she'll with the labour end.

2774
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:25.900
The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily,

2775
02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:29.470
that it may find good time, and live:

2776
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:31.970
but for the stock, Sir Thomas,

2777
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:34.500
I wish it grubb'd up now.

2778
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:38.630
Methinks I could cry the amen; and yet

2779
02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.070
my conscience says she's a good creature,

2780
02:15:41.070 --> 02:15:42.070
and, sweet lady,

2781
02:15:42.070 --> 02:15:43.630
does deserve our better wishes.

2782
02:15:43.630 --> 02:15:44.870
But, sir, sir,

2783
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:46.330
Hear me, Sir Thomas:

2784
02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:48.330
you're a gentleman of mine own way;

2785
02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:50.630
I know you wise, religious;

2786
02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:52.700
And, let me tell you,

2787
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:55.370
it will ne'er be well,

2788
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:57.970
'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,

2789
02:15:57.970 --> 02:16:01.330
Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,

2790
02:16:01.330 --> 02:16:03.530
Sleep in their graves.

2791
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:05.030
Now, sir, you speak of two

2792
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:07.630
the most remark'd i' the kingdom.

2793
02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:09.870
As for Cromwell, beside that of the jewel house,

2794
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:11.370
is made master o' the rolls,

2795
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:13.030
and the king's secretary; further, sir,

2796
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:15.530
Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,

2797
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:17.670
With which the time will load him.

2798
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:21.800
The archbishop is the king's hand and tongue;

2799
02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:23.800
and who dare speak one syllable against him?

2800
02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:26.530
Yes, yes, Sir Thomas;

2801
02:16:26.530 --> 02:16:27.830
There are that dare;

2802
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:31.230
and I myself have ventured to speak my mind of him:

2803
02:16:31.230 --> 02:16:36.930
and indeed this day, Sir, I may tell it you,

2804
02:16:36.930 --> 02:16:41.070
I think I have incensed the lords o' the council,

2805
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:44.370
that he is, For so I know he is, they know he is,

2806
02:16:44.370 --> 02:16:45.970
A most arch heretic,

2807
02:16:45.970 --> 02:16:48.530
a pestilence that does infect the land:

2808
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:51.070
with which they moved have broken with the king;

2809
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:53.630
who hath so far given ear to our complaint,

2810
02:16:53.630 --> 02:16:56.100
of his great grace and princely care

2811
02:16:56.100 --> 02:16:57.770
foreseeing those fell mischiefs

2812
02:16:57.770 --> 02:17:00.070
Our reasons laid before him,

2813
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:02.370
hath commanded to-morrow morning

2814
02:17:02.370 --> 02:17:05.300
to the council-board he be convented.

2815
02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:08.030
He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,

2816
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:09.600
And we must root him out.

2817
02:17:11.370 --> 02:17:14.270
From your affairs I hinder you too long:

2818
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.230
good night, Sir Thomas.

2819
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:19.770
Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.

2820
02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:29.670
Charles, I will play no more tonight;

2821
02:17:29.670 --> 02:17:32.800
My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.

2822
02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:35.000
Sir, I did never win of you before.

2823
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.730
But little, Charles; nor shall not,

2824
02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:38.770
when my fancy's on my play.

2825
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:42.370
Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?

2826
02:17:42.370 --> 02:17:43.800
I could not personally deliver to her

2827
02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:44.700
What you commanded me,

2828
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:47.030
but by her woman I sent your message;

2829
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:49.030
who return'd her thanks in the great'st humbleness,

2830
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:52.600
and desired your highness most heartily to pray for her.

2831
02:17:54.630 --> 02:17:55.870
What say'st thou, ha?

2832
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:58.600
To pray for her? what, is she crying out?

2833
02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.430
So said her woman

2834
02:18:00.430 --> 02:18:01.270
and that her sufferance made

2835
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:03.200
Almost each pang a death.

2836
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.870
Alas, good lady!

2837
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:07.730
God safely quit her of her burthen,

2838
02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:09.030
and with gentle travail,

2839
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:11.900
to the gladding of your highness with an heir!

2840
02:18:12.830 --> 02:18:13.830
'Tis midnight, Charles;

2841
02:18:13.830 --> 02:18:15.570
Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers

2842
02:18:15.570 --> 02:18:18.200
remember the estate of my poor queen.

2843
02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:19.930
Leave me alone;

2844
02:18:19.930 --> 02:18:21.500
For I must think of that which company

2845
02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:23.400
Would not be friendly to.

2846
02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.800
I wish your highness a quiet night;

2847
02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.670
and my good mistress will remember in my prayers.

2848
02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:30.470
Charles, good night.

2849
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:40.530
Well, sir, what follows?

2850
02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:42.200
Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,

2851
02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:43.170
As you commanded me.

2852
02:18:43.170 --> 02:18:44.930
Ha! Canterbury?

2853
02:18:44.930 --> 02:18:47.230
Ay, my good lord.

2854
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:49.100
'Tis true: where is he, Guilford?

2855
02:18:49.100 --> 02:18:51.000
He attends your highness' pleasure.

2856
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.300
Bring him to us. Avoid the gallery.

2857
02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:02.570
Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!

2858
02:19:12.100 --> 02:19:13.870
How now, my lord! you desire to know

2859
02:19:13.870 --> 02:19:16.430
Wherefore I sent for you.

2860
02:19:16.430 --> 02:19:19.700
It is my duty to attend your highness' pleasure.

2861
02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:20.630
Pray you, arise,

2862
02:19:20.630 --> 02:19:22.600
My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.

2863
02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:25.030
Come, you and I must walk a turn together;

2864
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:26.600
I have news to tell you:

2865
02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.600
come, come, give me your hand.

2866
02:19:31.630 --> 02:19:34.300
Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,

2867
02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:37.630
And am right sorry to repeat what follows

2868
02:19:37.630 --> 02:19:39.570
I have, and most unwillingly,

2869
02:19:39.570 --> 02:19:43.070
of late heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,

2870
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:45.100
Grievous complaints of you;

2871
02:19:46.770 --> 02:19:48.170
which, being consider'd,

2872
02:19:48.170 --> 02:19:49.430
Have moved us and our council,

2873
02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:52.430
that you shall this morning come before us;

2874
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.400
where, I know,

2875
02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.300
You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,

2876
02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:58.230
But that, till further trial in those charges

2877
02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:00.300
Which will require your answer,

2878
02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:01.970
you must take your patience to you,

2879
02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:06.030
and be well contented to make your house our Tower:

2880
02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:08.200
you a brother of us,

2881
02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:09.730
It fits we thus proceed,

2882
02:20:09.730 --> 02:20:12.230
or else no witness would come against you.

2883
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.770
I humbly thank your highness;

2884
02:20:16.470 --> 02:20:18.700
And am right glad to catch this good occasion

2885
02:20:18.700 --> 02:20:19.930
Most throughly to be winnow'd,

2886
02:20:19.930 --> 02:20:23.570
where my chaff and corn shall fly asunder:

2887
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:24.630
for, I know,

2888
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:26.870
there's none stands under more calumnious tongues

2889
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:29.370
Than I myself, poor man.

2890
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:32.600
Stand up, good Canterbury:

2891
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:33.470
Thy truth and thy integrity

2892
02:20:33.470 --> 02:20:35.730
is rooted in us, thy friend:

2893
02:20:35.730 --> 02:20:37.570
give me thy hand, stand up:

2894
02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.800
Prithee, let's walk.

2895
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:44.730
Now, by my holidame. What manner of man are you?

2896
02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:46.870
My lord, I look'd you would have

2897
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:47.970
given me your petition,

2898
02:20:47.970 --> 02:20:49.230
that I should have ta'en some pains

2899
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:51.830
to bring together yourself and your accusers;

2900
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:52.600
and to have heard you,

2901
02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:54.770
Without indurance, further.

2902
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:57.070
Most dread liege,

2903
02:20:57.070 --> 02:21:00.630
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:

2904
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:03.030
If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,

2905
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:04.730
Will triumph o'er my person;

2906
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:08.900
which I weigh not, being of those virtues vacant.

2907
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:11.730
I fear nothing what can be said against me.

2908
02:21:11.730 --> 02:21:14.930
Know you not how your state stands i' the world,

2909
02:21:14.930 --> 02:21:17.730
with the whole world?

2910
02:21:20.130 --> 02:21:23.300
Your enemies are many, and not small;

2911
02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:26.370
their practises must bear the same proportion;

2912
02:21:26.370 --> 02:21:28.970
and not ever the justice and the truth o' the question

2913
02:21:28.970 --> 02:21:32.570
carries the due o' the verdict with it:

2914
02:21:32.570 --> 02:21:34.230
at what ease might corrupt minds

2915
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:36.500
procure knaves as corrupt

2916
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.630
To swear against you? such things have been done.

2917
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:42.670
You are potently opposed;

2918
02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:45.070
and with a malice of as great size.

2919
02:21:47.470 --> 02:21:49.100
Ween you of better luck,

2920
02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.530
I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,

2921
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:52.830
Whose minister you are,

2922
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:56.230
whiles here he lived upon this naughty earth?

2923
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:57.330
Go to, go to;

2924
02:21:57.330 --> 02:21:59.070
You take a precipice for no leap of danger,

2925
02:21:59.070 --> 02:22:01.470
And woo your own destruction.

2926
02:22:02.970 --> 02:22:06.530
God and your majesty protect mine innocence,

2927
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:08.730
or I fall into the trap is laid for me!

2928
02:22:10.530 --> 02:22:11.670
Be of good cheer;

2929
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:13.530
They shall no more prevail than we give way to.

2930
02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.400
Keep comfort to you;

2931
02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.570
and this morning see you do appear before them:

2932
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:19.200
if they shall chance, in charging you with matters,

2933
02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:20.470
to commit you,

2934
02:22:20.470 --> 02:22:23.000
The best persuasions to the contrary fail not to use,

2935
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:23.830
and with what vehemency

2936
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:26.370
the occasion shall instruct you:

2937
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:30.400
if entreaties will render you no remedy,

2938
02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:32.530
this ring deliver them,

2939
02:22:32.530 --> 02:22:34.630
and your appeal to us there make before them.

2940
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:41.800
Look, the good man weeps!

2941
02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:44.730
He's honest, on mine honour.

2942
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:45.630
God's blest mother!

2943
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:47.030
I swear he is true--hearted;

2944
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:49.700
and a soul none better in my kingdom.

2945
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:53.230
Get you gone, and do as I have bid you.

2946
02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:06.630
He has strangled his language in his tears.

2947
02:23:08.170 --> 02:23:10.200
Come back: what mean you?

2948
02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:11.400
I'll not come back;

2949
02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:15.070
the tidings that I bring will make my boldness manners.

2950
02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:17.730
Now, good angels fly o'er thy royal head,

2951
02:23:17.730 --> 02:23:20.870
and shade thy person under their blessed wings!

2952
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:22.430
Now, by thy looks I guess thy message.

2953
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:23.970
Is the queen deliver'd?

2954
02:23:23.970 --> 02:23:25.370
Say, ay; and of a boy.

2955
02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:28.900
Ay, ay, my liege; and of a lovely boy:

2956
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:34.470
the God of heaven both now and ever bless her!

2957
02:23:34.470 --> 02:23:38.400
'tis a girl, promises boys hereafter.

2958
02:23:39.370 --> 02:23:43.630
Sir, your queen desires your visitation,

2959
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:46.600
and to be acquainted with this stranger

2960
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:50.500
'tis as like you as cherry is to cherry.

2961
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:53.500
Lovell!

2962
02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:54.500
Sir?

2963
02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:56.100
Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.

2964
02:23:58.130 --> 02:24:02.870
An hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.

2965
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:05.570
An ordinary groom is for such payment.

2966
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:08.000
I will have more, or scold it out of him.

2967
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.530
Said I for this, the girl was like to him?

2968
02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:12.370
I will have more, or else unsay't;

2969
02:24:12.370 --> 02:24:15.300
and now, while it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.

2970
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:20.330
I hope I am not too late;

2971
02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:21.170
and yet the gentleman,

2972
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:22.030
that was sent to me from the council,

2973
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:23.830
pray'd me to make great haste.

2974
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:28.730
All fast? what means this?

2975
02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:30.170
Ho! Who waits there?

2976
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:35.530
Sure, you know me?

2977
02:24:35.530 --> 02:24:39.430
Yes, my lord; But yet I cannot help you.

2978
02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:40.600
Why?

2979
02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:43.600
Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.

2980
02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:47.230
So.

2981
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:50.870
This is a piece of malice.

2982
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:53.330
I am glad I came this way so happily:

2983
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:55.630
the king shall understand it presently.

2984
02:25:00.770 --> 02:25:03.530
'Tis Butts, the king's physician:

2985
02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:04.470
as he pass'd along,

2986
02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:05.930
How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!

2987
02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:08.000
Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace!

2988
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:11.300
For certain, this is of purpose

2989
02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:14.970
laid by some that hate me God turn their hearts!

2990
02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:16.930
I never sought their malice

2991
02:25:16.930 --> 02:25:18.600
To quench mine honour:

2992
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:21.500
they would shame to make me wait else at door,

2993
02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:22.570
a fellow-counsellor,

2994
02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:24.830
'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys.

2995
02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:29.130
But their pleasures must be fulfill'd,

2996
02:25:30.470 --> 02:25:32.770
and I attend with patience.

2997
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:37.300
I'll show your grace the strangest sight

2998
02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:38.230
What's that, Butts?

2999
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:39.570
I think your highness saw this many a day.

3000
02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:40.600
Body o' me, where is it?

3001
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.700
There, my lord:

3002
02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.870
The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;

3003
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:46.070
Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,

3004
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:48.000
Pages, and footboys.

3005
02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:51.900
Ha! 'tis he, indeed:

3006
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:56.230
Is this the honour they do one another?

3007
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:59.300
'Tis well there's one above 'em yet.

3008
02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:00.330
I had thought they had parted

3009
02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:01.430
so much honesty among 'em

3010
02:26:01.430 --> 02:26:02.430
At least, good manners,

3011
02:26:02.430 --> 02:26:04.070
as not thus to suffer a man of his place,

3012
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:05.170
and so near our favour,

3013
02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:08.430
To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,

3014
02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:12.030
And at the door too, like a post with packets.

3015
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:19.100
By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:

3016
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:25.100
Speak to the business, master-secretary:

3017
02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.530
Why are we met in council?

3018
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:28.870
Please your honours,

3019
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:31.430
The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.

3020
02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:33.170
Has he had knowledge of it?

3021
02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:34.000
Yes.

3022
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.430
Who waits there?

3023
02:26:35.430 --> 02:26:36.570
Without, my noble lords?

3024
02:26:36.570 --> 02:26:37.270
Yes.

3025
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:38.700
My lord archbishop;

3026
02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:41.070
And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.

3027
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:42.970
Let him come in.

3028
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:48.170
Your grace may enter now.

3029
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:03.400
My good lord archbishop,

3030
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.500
I'm very sorry to sit here at this present,

3031
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:09.570
and behold that chair stand empty:

3032
02:27:09.570 --> 02:27:11.830
but we all are men,

3033
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:13.670
In our own natures frail,

3034
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:18.830
and capable of our flesh; few are angels:

3035
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:22.000
out of which frailty and want of wisdom,

3036
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.630
you, that best should teach us,

3037
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:26.430
Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,

3038
02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:28.700
Toward the king first, then his laws,

3039
02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:31.770
in filling the whole realm, by your teaching

3040
02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:33.230
and your chaplains,

3041
02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:36.430
For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,

3042
02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:39.570
Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,

3043
02:27:39.570 --> 02:27:43.130
And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.

3044
02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:44.400
Which reformation

3045
02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:47.530
must be sudden too, my noble lords;

3046
02:27:47.530 --> 02:27:49.370
for those that tame wild horses

3047
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:52.800
Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,

3048
02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:55.800
But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,

3049
02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:56.900
Till they obey the manage.

3050
02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:58.230
If we suffer,

3051
02:27:58.230 --> 02:28:00.970
Out of our easiness and childish pity

3052
02:28:00.970 --> 02:28:05.230
To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,

3053
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.800
Farewell all physic:

3054
02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:09.370
and what follows then?

3055
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:11.170
Commotions, uproars,

3056
02:28:11.170 --> 02:28:14.330
with a general taint of the whole state:

3057
02:28:14.330 --> 02:28:16.300
as, of late days, our neighbours,

3058
02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:17.930
The upper Germany, can dearly witness,

3059
02:28:17.930 --> 02:28:21.370
Yet freshly pitied in our memories.

3060
02:28:23.130 --> 02:28:25.130
My good lords,

3061
02:28:26.830 --> 02:28:28.370
hitherto, in all the progress

3062
02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:30.030
Both of my life and office,

3063
02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:31.170
I have labour'd,

3064
02:28:31.170 --> 02:28:33.530
And with no little study,

3065
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:35.300
that my teaching and the strong course

3066
02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:37.830
of my authority might go one way,

3067
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:42.330
and safely; and the end was ever, to do well:

3068
02:28:45.070 --> 02:28:47.130
nor is there living,

3069
02:28:47.130 --> 02:28:50.070
I speak it with a single heart, my lords,

3070
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:53.330
A man that more detests, more stirs against,

3071
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:55.370
Both in his private conscience and his place,

3072
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:59.200
Defacers of a public peace, than I do.

3073
02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.330
Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart

3074
02:29:01.330 --> 02:29:03.000
With less allegiance in it!

3075
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:10.730
Men that make envy and crooked malice nourishment

3076
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:12.730
Dare bite the best.

3077
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:17.670
I do beseech your lordships,

3078
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:19.030
That, in this case of justice,

3079
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:21.100
my accusers, be what they will,

3080
02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:23.130
may stand forth face to face,

3081
02:29:23.130 --> 02:29:25.330
And freely urge against me.

3082
02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:27.170
Nay, my lord, that cannot be:

3083
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:28.270
you are a counsellor,

3084
02:29:28.270 --> 02:29:31.200
And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.

3085
02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:35.300
My lord, because we have business of more moment,

3086
02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.830
We will be short with you.

3087
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:39.970
'Tis his highness' pleasure,

3088
02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:44.000
And our consent, for better trial of you,

3089
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.800
From hence you be committed to the Tower;

3090
02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.730
Where, being but a private man again,

3091
02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:51.800
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,

3092
02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:53.870
More than, I fear, you are provided for.

3093
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:56.670
Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;

3094
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:57.970
You are always my good friend;

3095
02:29:57.970 --> 02:29:59.030
if your will pass,

3096
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:01.600
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,

3097
02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:03.200
You are so merciful:

3098
02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:06.100
I see your end;

3099
02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:08.200
'Tis my undoing:

3100
02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.730
love and meekness, lord,

3101
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:12.900
Become a churchman better than ambition:

3102
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:15.300
Win straying souls with modesty again,

3103
02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.830
Cast none away.

3104
02:30:18.970 --> 02:30:20.000
That I shall clear myself,

3105
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.070
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,

3106
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:23.100
I make as little doubt,

3107
02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:25.700
as you do conscience indoing daily wrongs.

3108
02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:28.730
I could say more,

3109
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:32.800
But reverence to your calling makes me modest.

3110
02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:37.000
My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,

3111
02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.400
That's the plain truth:

3112
02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.070
your painted gloss discovers,

3113
02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:44.200
To men that understand you, words and weakness.

3114
02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:46.200
My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,

3115
02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:48.670
By your good favour, too sharp;

3116
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:50.630
men so noble, however faulty,

3117
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:51.830
yet should find respect

3118
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:53.300
For what they have been:

3119
02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:56.170
'tis a cruelty to load a falling man.

3120
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:58.570
Good master secretary,

3121
02:30:58.570 --> 02:31:00.730
I cry your honour mercy;

3122
02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:02.930
you may, worst of all this table, say so.

3123
02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:03.730
Why, my lord?

3124
02:31:03.730 --> 02:31:05.230
Do not I know you for a favourer

3125
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:06.830
Of this new sect?

3126
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:08.230
ye are not sound.

3127
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.930
Not sound?

3128
02:31:08.930 --> 02:31:10.100
Not sound, I say.

3129
02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:11.970
Would you were half so honest!

3130
02:31:11.970 --> 02:31:15.030
Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

3131
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:17.030
I shall remember this bold language.

3132
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:19.630
Do. Remember your bold life too.

3133
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:21.600
This is too much;

3134
02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:23.430
Forbear, for shame, my lords.

3135
02:31:23.430 --> 02:31:25.430
I have done.

3136
02:31:25.430 --> 02:31:26.500
And I.

3137
02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:29.130
Then thus for you, my lord:

3138
02:31:29.130 --> 02:31:32.470
it stands agreed, I take it, by all voices,

3139
02:31:32.470 --> 02:31:35.270
that forthwith you be convey'd to the Tower

3140
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:36.400
a prisoner;

3141
02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:39.030
There to remain till the king's further pleasure

3142
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:41.230
Be known unto us:

3143
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:43.200
are you all agreed, lords?

3144
02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.830
We are.

3145
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:46.600
Is there no other way of mercy,

3146
02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:48.600
But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?

3147
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:49.970
What other would you expect?

3148
02:31:49.970 --> 02:31:52.700
you are strangely troublesome.

3149
02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:55.300
Let some o' the guard be ready there.

3150
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.770
For me? Must I go like a traitor thither?

3151
02:31:59.770 --> 02:32:03.170
Receive him, and see him safe i' the Tower.

3152
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:05.270
Stay,

3153
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:09.930
good my lords, I have a little yet to say.

3154
02:32:09.930 --> 02:32:13.170
Look there, my lords;

3155
02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:14.330
By virtue of that ring,

3156
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:16.370
I take my cause out of the gripes of cruel men,

3157
02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:18.430
and give it to a most noble judge,

3158
02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:22.130
the king my master.

3159
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:23.730
This is the king's ring.

3160
02:32:23.730 --> 02:32:25.000
'Tis no counterfeit.

3161
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.100
'Tis the right ring,

3162
02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:28.330
by heaven: I told ye all,

3163
02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:31.100
When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,

3164
02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:32.700
'Twould fall upon ourselves.

3165
02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:33.400
Do you think, my lords,

3166
02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:34.400
The king will suffer

3167
02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.270
but the little finger of this man to be vex'd?

3168
02:32:36.270 --> 02:32:37.800
'Tis now too certain:

3169
02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:40.630
How much more is his life in value with him?

3170
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:42.470
Would I were fairly out on't!

3171
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:44.630
My mind gave me, in seeking tales

3172
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:46.170
and informations against this man,

3173
02:32:46.170 --> 02:32:48.070
whose honesty the devil and his disciples

3174
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:49.570
only envy at,

3175
02:32:49.570 --> 02:32:51.530
Ye blew the fire that burns ye:

3176
02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:53.330
now have at ye!

3177
02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:00.400
Dread sovereign,

3178
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.100
how much are we bound to heaven

3179
02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:06.430
In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;

3180
02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:09.530
Not only good and wise, but most religious:

3181
02:33:09.530 --> 02:33:12.230
One that, in all obedience, makes the church

3182
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:14.130
The chief aim of his honour;

3183
02:33:14.130 --> 02:33:15.870
and, to strengthen that holy duty,

3184
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:19.130
out of dear respect, his royal self in judgment

3185
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:21.230
comes to hear the cause

3186
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:23.730
betwixt her and this great offender.

3187
02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:25.430
You were ever good at sudden commendations,

3188
02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:27.030
Bishop of Winchester.

3189
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:29.970
But know,

3190
02:33:29.970 --> 02:33:31.830
I come not to hear such flattery now,

3191
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:33.630
and in my presence;

3192
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:36.230
They are too thin and bare to hide offences.

3193
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:41.570
To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,

3194
02:33:41.570 --> 02:33:44.430
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;

3195
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:49.070
But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for,

3196
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:53.770
I'm sure thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.

3197
02:33:54.770 --> 02:33:56.230
Good man, sit down.

3198
02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.600
Now let me see the proudest he, that dares most,

3199
02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:04.570
but wag his finger at thee:

3200
02:34:04.570 --> 02:34:05.500
By all that's holy,

3201
02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:06.600
he had better starve

3202
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.400
Than but once think this place becomes thee not.

3203
02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:10.600
May it please your grace,

3204
02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:12.470
No, sir, it does not please me.

3205
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:15.400
I had thought I had had men

3206
02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.500
of some understanding and wisdom of my council;

3207
02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:19.970
but I find none.

3208
02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:24.570
Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,

3209
02:34:24.570 --> 02:34:28.430
This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--

3210
02:34:28.430 --> 02:34:30.070
This honest man,

3211
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:32.930
wait like a lousy footboy At chamberdoor?

3212
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:35.800
and one as great as you are?

3213
02:34:38.930 --> 02:34:40.970
Why, what a shame was this!

3214
02:34:40.970 --> 02:34:44.170
Did my commission bid ye so far forget yourselves?

3215
02:34:45.030 --> 02:34:47.170
I gave ye power as he was a counsellor to try him,

3216
02:34:47.170 --> 02:34:48.370
Not as a groom:

3217
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:50.200
there's some of ye, I see,

3218
02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.930
More out of malice than integrity,

3219
02:34:51.930 --> 02:34:54.600
Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;

3220
02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:57.730
Which ye shall never have while I live.

3221
02:34:57.730 --> 02:34:59.730
Thus far, my most dread sovereign,

3222
02:34:59.730 --> 02:35:03.500
may it like your grace to let my tongue excuse all.

3223
02:35:04.270 --> 02:35:06.800
What was purposed concerning his imprisonment,

3224
02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:09.730
was rather, if there be faith in men,

3225
02:35:09.730 --> 02:35:13.170
meant for his trial, and fair purgation to the world,

3226
02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:15.330
than malice, I'm sure, in me.

3227
02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:20.800
Well, well, my lords, respect him;

3228
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:24.470
Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.

3229
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:29.800
I will say thus much for him,

3230
02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:32.100
if a prince may be beholding to a subject,

3231
02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:35.100
I am, for his love and service, so to him.

3232
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:38.270
Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:

3233
02:35:38.270 --> 02:35:40.500
Be friends, for shame, my lords!

3234
02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:48.630
My Lord of Canterbury,

3235
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:50.700
I have a suit which you must not deny me;

3236
02:35:50.700 --> 02:35:51.930
That is, a fair young maid

3237
02:35:51.930 --> 02:35:53.530
that yet wants baptism,

3238
02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:55.500
You must be godfather, and answer for her.

3239
02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:57.630
The greatest monarch now alive may glory

3240
02:35:57.630 --> 02:35:59.370
In such an honour:

3241
02:35:59.370 --> 02:36:00.370
how may I deserve it

3242
02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:01.830
That am a poor and humble subject to you?

3243
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:04.330
Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons:

3244
02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:05.930
you shall have two noble partners with you;

3245
02:36:05.930 --> 02:36:09.600
the old Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset:

3246
02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:11.270
will these please you?

3247
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:14.170
Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,

3248
02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:16.130
Embrace and love this man.

3249
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:20.100
With a true heart

3250
02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:21.730
And brother-love I do it.

3251
02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:25.300
And let heaven witness,

3252
02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:27.530
how dear I hold this confirmation.

3253
02:36:30.970 --> 02:36:35.370
Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:

3254
02:36:35.370 --> 02:36:36.300
The common voice, I see,

3255
02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.800
is verified of thee, which says thus,

3256
02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:41.130
'Do my Lord of Canterbury a shrewd turn,

3257
02:36:41.130 --> 02:36:43.270
and he is your friend for ever.'

3258
02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:45.800
Come, lords, we trifle time away;

3259
02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:48.570
I long to have this young one made a Christian.

3260
02:36:48.570 --> 02:36:53.100
As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;

3261
02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:57.600
So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.

3262
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:45.430
Heaven, from thy endless goodness,

3263
02:37:45.430 --> 02:37:48.070
send prosperous life, long, and ever happy,

3264
02:37:48.070 --> 02:37:50.670
to the high and mighty princess of England,

3265
02:37:50.670 --> 02:37:52.030
Elizabeth!

3266
02:38:01.930 --> 02:38:04.370
And to your royal grace, and the good queen,

3267
02:38:04.370 --> 02:38:06.430
My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:

3268
02:38:06.430 --> 02:38:09.970
All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,

3269
02:38:09.970 --> 02:38:13.030
Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,

3270
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:15.100
May hourly fall upon ye!

3271
02:38:15.100 --> 02:38:17.270
Thank you, good lord archbishop:

3272
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:18.330
What is her name?

3273
02:38:18.330 --> 02:38:19.370
Elizabeth.

3274
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:20.670
Stand up, lord.

3275
02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:25.470
With this kiss take my blessing:

3276
02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.800
God protect thee! Into whose hand I give thy life.

3277
02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:30.900
Amen.

3278
02:38:33.330 --> 02:38:35.570
My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:

3279
02:38:35.570 --> 02:38:38.300
I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,

3280
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:39.930
When she has so much English.

3281
02:38:39.930 --> 02:38:41.330
Let me speak, sir,

3282
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:43.700
For heaven now bids me;

3283
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:45.730
and the words I utter let none think flattery,

3284
02:38:45.730 --> 02:38:47.500
for they'll find 'em truth.

3285
02:38:48.730 --> 02:38:52.470
This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--

3286
02:38:52.470 --> 02:38:53.630
Though in her cradle,

3287
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:55.370
yet now promises upon this land

3288
02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:57.130
a thousand thousand blessings,

3289
02:38:57.130 --> 02:39:00.800
Which time shall bring to ripeness:

3290
02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:01.800
she shall be--

3291
02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.270
but few now living can behold that goodness--

3292
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:07.330
A pattern to all princes living with her,

3293
02:39:07.330 --> 02:39:09.000
And all that shall succeed:

3294
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.530
Saba was never more covetous of wisdom

3295
02:39:11.530 --> 02:39:12.700
and fair virtue

3296
02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:15.330
Than this pure soul shall be:

3297
02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:19.200
all princely graces,

3298
02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:24.130
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,

3299
02:39:24.130 --> 02:39:26.430
With all the virtues that attend the good,

3300
02:39:26.430 --> 02:39:29.770
Shall still be doubled on her:

3301
02:39:29.770 --> 02:39:33.000
truth shall nurse her,

3302
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.330
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:

3303
02:39:36.330 --> 02:39:38.300
She shall be loved and fear'd:

3304
02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:40.470
her own shall bless her;

3305
02:39:40.470 --> 02:39:44.030
Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,

3306
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:48.070
And hang their heads with sorrow:

3307
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:51.400
good grows with her:

3308
02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.800
In her days every man shall eat in safety,

3309
02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:55.300
Under his own vine, what he plants;

3310
02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:58.470
and sing the merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:

3311
02:39:58.470 --> 02:40:01.600
God shall be truly known;

3312
02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.770
and those about her

3313
02:40:02.770 --> 02:40:06.970
from her shall read the perfect ways of honour,

3314
02:40:06.970 --> 02:40:10.400
And by those claim their greatness,

3315
02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:12.030
not by blood.

3316
02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:18.930
Nor shall this peace sleep with her:

3317
02:40:18.930 --> 02:40:21.070
but as when the bird of wonder dies,

3318
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:22.530
the maiden phoenix,

3319
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:24.730
Her ashes new create another heir,

3320
02:40:24.730 --> 02:40:27.400
As great in admiration as herself;

3321
02:40:28.570 --> 02:40:33.300
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,

3322
02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:34.970
When heaven shall call her

3323
02:40:34.970 --> 02:40:38.130
from this cloud of darkness,

3324
02:40:38.130 --> 02:40:40.470
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour

3325
02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:46.070
Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,

3326
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:51.070
And so stand fix'd:

3327
02:40:51.070 --> 02:40:55.470
peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,

3328
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:59.170
That were the servants to this chosen infant,

3329
02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:05.230
Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:

3330
02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:06.870
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,

3331
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:08.630
His honour and the greatness of his name

3332
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:12.330
Shall be, and make new nations:

3333
02:41:12.330 --> 02:41:14.770
he shall flourish,

3334
02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:16.400
And, like a mountain cedar,

3335
02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:20.930
reach his branches to all the plains about him:

3336
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:26.730
our children's children shall see this,

3337
02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:29.570
and bless heaven.

3338
02:41:30.930 --> 02:41:34.630
Thou speakest wonders.

3339
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:38.600
She shall be, to the happiness of England,

3340
02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:41.230
An aged princess;

3341
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:42.570
many days shall see her,

3342
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:45.900
And yet no day without a deed to crown it.

3343
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.300
Would I had known no more!

3344
02:41:51.770 --> 02:41:52.830
but she must die,

3345
02:41:52.830 --> 02:41:56.930
She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,

3346
02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:00.800
A most unspotted lily shall she pass

3347
02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:03.600
To the ground,

3348
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:06.530
and all the world shall mourn her.

3349
02:42:07.970 --> 02:42:08.930
O lord archbishop,

3350
02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:10.800
Thou hast made me now a man!

3351
02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.900
never, before this happy child, did I get any thing:

3352
02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:16.730
This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,

3353
02:42:16.730 --> 02:42:18.430
That when I am in heaven

3354
02:42:18.430 --> 02:42:22.130
I shall desire to see what this child does,

3355
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:24.130
and praise my Maker.

3356
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:27.630
I thank ye all.

3357
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:28.770
To you, my good lord mayor,

3358
02:42:28.770 --> 02:42:30.270
And your good brethren,

3359
02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:32.270
I am much beholding;

3360
02:42:32.270 --> 02:42:35.530
I have received much honour by your presence,

3361
02:42:35.530 --> 02:42:37.230
And ye shall find me thankful.

3362
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:40.700
Lead the way, lords:

3363
02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:42.500
Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,

3364
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:44.200
She will be sick else.

3365
02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:46.300
This day, no man think has business at his house;

3366
02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:48.870
for all shall stay:

3367
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:53.170
This little one shall make it holiday.

3368
02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.200
