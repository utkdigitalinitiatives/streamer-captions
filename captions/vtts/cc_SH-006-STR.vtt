00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:34.930


2
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.530
I come no more to make youlaugh:

3
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830
things now, that bear aweighty

4
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.730
and a serious brow,

5
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.230
Sad, high, and working,full of state and woe,

6
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.800
Such noble scenes as drawthe eye to flow,

7
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.770
We now present.

8
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.900
Those that can pity, heremay,

9
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.170
if they think it well, letfall a tear;

10
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.630
The subject willdeserve it.

11
00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.100
Such as give their moneyout of hope

12
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.830
they may believe,

13
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.470
May here find truth too.Those that come to see

14
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.800
Only a show or two, and soagree the play may pass,

15
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.830
if they be still andwilling,

16
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.070
I'll undertake may seeaway

17
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.900
their shilling richly intwo short hours.

18
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.700
Only they that come tohear a merry bawdy play,

19
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.370
A noise of targets,

20
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.370
or to see a fellow

21
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.870
in a long motley coatguarded with yellow,

22
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.630
Will be deceived;

23
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.430
for, gentle hearers, know,

24
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.700
To rank our chosen truthwith such a show

25
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000
As fool and fight is,

26
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.430
beside forfeiting our ownbrains,

27
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.800
and the opinion that webring,

28
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.200
to make that only true wenow intend,

29
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000
will leave us never anunderstanding friend.

30
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.900
Therefore, for goodness'sake,

31
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.530
and as you are known thefirst

32
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.430
and happiest hearers ofthe town,

33
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.970
Be sad, as we would makeye:

34
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.300
think ye see the verypersons of our noble story

35
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.500
As they were living;

36
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.730
think you see them great,

37
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.370
And follow'd with thegeneral throng

38
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.870
and sweat of thousandfriends; then in a moment,

39
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.470
see how soon thismightiness meets misery:

40
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.400
And, if you can be merrythen, I'll say

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
A man may weep upon hiswedding-day.

42
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.100
Good morrow, and well met.

43
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.400
How have ye done sincelast we saw in France?

44
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.470
I thank your grace,

45
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.730
Healthful; and ever sincea fresh admirer

46
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.930
of what I saw there.

47
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.770
An untimely ague stay'd mea prisoner in my chamber

48
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.500
when those suns of glory,those two lights of men,

49
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.730
Met in the vale of Andren.

50
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.100
'Twixt Guynes and Arde:

51
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.570
I was then present, sawthem salute on horseback;

52
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.800
Beheld them, when theylighted,

53
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.470
how they clung in theirembracement,

54
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.930
as they grew together;

55
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.630
Which had they, what fourthroned ones

56
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.900
could have weigh'd such acompounded one?

57
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.370
All the whole time I wasmy chamber's prisoner.

58
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.470
Then you lost the view ofearthly glory:

59
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.200
men might say,

60
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.100
Till this time pomp wassingle,

61
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.300
but now married to oneabove itself.

62
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.700
Each following day becamethe next day's master,

63
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.370
till the last made formerwonders its.

64
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.870
To-day the French,

65
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.630
All clinquant, all ingold, like heathen gods,

66
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.930
Shone down the English;and, to-morrow,

67
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.230
they made Britain India:

68
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.800
every man that stoodshow'd like a mine.

69
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.430
Their dwarfish pages wereas cherubins, all guilt:

70
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.830
The two kings, equal inlustre,

71
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.200
were now best, now worst,

72
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.430
As presence did presentthem; him in eye,

73
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.900
Still him in praise: and,being present both

74
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.600
'Twas said they saw butone;

75
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.200
and no discerner durst waghis tongue in censure.

76
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.430
When these suns-- for sothey phrase 'em--

77
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.330
by their heralds challengedthe noble spirits to arms,

78
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.130
they did perform beyondthought's compass

79
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.800
O, you go far.

80
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.370
As I belong to worship andaffect in honour honesty,

81
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.300
the tract of every thing

82
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.170
would by a good discourserlose some life,

83
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.500
Which action's self wastongue to.

84
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.230
All was royal;

85
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.900
to the disposing of itnought rebell'd.

86
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.930
Order gave each thingview;

87
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.830
the office did distinctlyhis full function.

88
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.730
Who did guide,

89
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.270
I mean, who set the bodyand the limbs

90
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.170
Of this great sporttogether, as you guess?

91
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.230
One, certes, that promisesno element

92
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.630
in such a business.

93
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.430
I pray you, who, my lord?

94
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.000
All this was order'd bythe good discretion

95
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.670
Of the right reverendCardinal of York.

96
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.530
The devil speed him!

97
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.030
no man's pie is freed fromhis ambitious finger.

98
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.000
What had he to do in thesefierce vanities?

99
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.630
I wonder that such a keechcan with his very bulk

100
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.530
Take up the rays o' thebeneficial sun

101
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.500
and keep it from theearth.

102
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.600
Surely, sir,

103
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.300
There's in him stuff thatputs him to these ends;

104
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.330
For, being not propp'd byancestry,

105
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.500
whose grace chalkssuccessors their way,

106
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.400
nor call'd upon for highfeats done to the crown;

107
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.800
neither allied for eminentassistants;

108
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.870
but, spider-like,

109
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.130
Out of his self-drawingweb, he gives us note,

110
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.570
The force of his own meritmakes his way

111
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.100
A gift that heaven givesfor him,

112
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.870
which buys a place next tothe king.

113
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.970
I cannot tell what heavenhath given him,

114
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.670
--let some graver eyepierce into that;

115
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.530
but I can see his pride peepthrough each part of him:

116
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.400
whence has he that, if notfrom hell?

117
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.630
the devil is a niggard,

118
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.170
Or has given all before,

119
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.200
and he begins a new hellin himself.

120
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200
Why the devil,

121
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.400
Upon this French goingout, took he upon him,

122
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.630
Without the privity o' theking,

123
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.770
to appoint who shouldattend on him?

124
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.600
He makes up the file ofall the gentry;

125
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.730
for the most part such towhom

126
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.300
as great a charge aslittle honour

127
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.400
He meant to lay upon:

128
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.470
I do know Kinsmen of mine,three at the least,

129
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.500
that have by this sosickened their estates,

130
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.600
that never they shallabound as formerly.

131
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.230
O, many have broke theirbacks

132
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.570
with laying manors on 'em

133
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.400
For this great journey.

134
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.230
Grievingly I think, the peacebetween the French and us

135
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.430
not values the cost thatdid conclude it.

136
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.600
Every man, after the hideousstorm that follow'd,

137
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.300
was a thing inspired; and,not consulting,

138
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.930
broke into a generalprophecy;

139
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.900
That this tempest,

140
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.470
Dashing the garment ofthis peace,

141
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.270
aboded the sudden breachon't.

142
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.270
Which is budded out;

143
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.930
For France hath flaw'd theleague,

144
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.870
and hath attach'd ourmerchants' goods at Bourdeaux.

145
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.700
Is it therefore theambassador is silenced?

146
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.600
Marry, is't.

147
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.230
A proper title of apeace;

148
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.070
and purchased at asuperfluous rate!

149
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.300
Why, all this business ourreverend cardinal carried.

150
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.370
Like it your grace,

151
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.130
The state takes notice ofthe private difference

152
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.770
Betwixt you and thecardinal.

153
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.570
I advise you-- And take itfrom a heart

154
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.870
that wishes towards youhonour and plenteous safety

155
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.470
--that you read thecardinal's malice

156
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.300
and his potency together;to consider further

157
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.670
that what his highhatred would effect

158
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.170
wants not a minister inhis power.

159
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:59.000
You know his nature, thathe's revengeful,

160
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.400
and I know his sword hatha sharp edge:

161
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.570
it's long and, 't may besaid, it reaches far,

162
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.330
and where 'twill not extend,thither he darts it.

163
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.070
Bosom up my counsel,you'll find it wholesome.

164
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.170
Lo, where comes that rockthat I advise your shunning.

165
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.430
The Duke of Buckingham'ssurveyor, ha?

166
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.100
Where's his examination?

167
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.870
Here, so please you.

168
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.070
Is he in person ready?

169
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.900
Ay, please your grace.

170
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.430
Well, we shall then knowmore;

171
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.830
and Buckingham shalllessen this big look.

172
00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.300
This butcher's cur isvenom-mouth'd,

173
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.730
and I have not the powerto muzzle him;

174
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.330
therefore best not wakehim in his slumber.

175
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.870
A beggar's book outworthsa noble's blood.

176
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.770
What, are you chafed?

177
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.200
Ask God for temperance;

178
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.400
that's the appliance onlywhich your disease requires.

179
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.270
I read in's looks matteragainst me;

180
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.500
and his eye reviled me, ashis abject object:

181
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.670
at this instant he boresme with some trick:

182
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.100
he's gone to the king; I'llfollow and outstare him.

183
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.000
Stay, my lord,

184
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.070
And let your reason withyour choler question

185
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.500
What 'tis you go about:

186
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.170
to climb steep hillsrequires slow pace at first:

187
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.830
anger is like a full-hothorse,

188
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.870
who being allow'd his way,

189
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.370
Self-mettle tires him.

190
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.970
Not a man in England canadvise me like you:

191
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.900
be to yourself as youwould to your friend.

192
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.830
I'll to the king; and froma mouth of honour

193
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.400
quite cry down this Ipswichfellow's insolence;

194
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.600
or proclaim there'sdifference in no persons.

195
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.730
Be advised;

196
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.000
Heat not a furnace foryour foe

197
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.570
so hot that it do singeyourself:

198
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.500
we may outrun, by violentswiftness,

199
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.600
that which we run at,

200
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.500
And lose by over-running.

201
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.800
Be advised: I say again,

202
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.630
there is no English soulmore stronger

203
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.330
to direct you thanyourself,

204
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.000
If with the sap of reasonyou would quench,

205
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.770
Or but allay, the fire ofpassion.

206
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.930
Sir, I am thankful to you;

207
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:06.770
and I'll go along by yourprescription:

208
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.600
but this top-proud fellow,

209
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.530
whom from the flow of gallI name not

210
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.030
but from sincere motions,by intelligence,

211
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.500
And proofs as clear asfounts in July

212
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.470
when we see each grain ofgravel,

213
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.670
I do know to be corruptand treasonous.

214
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.700
Say not 'treasonous.'

215
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.100
To the king I'll say't;

216
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.830
and make my vouch asstrong as shore of rock.

217
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.200
Attend. This holy fox, orwolf, or both,

218
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.970
--for he is equal ravenousas he is subtle,

219
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.900
and as prone to mischiefas able to perform't;

220
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.970
his mind and placeinfecting one another,

221
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.300
yea, reciprocally--

222
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.270
Only to show his pomp

223
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.070
as well in France as hereat home,

224
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.230
suggests the king ourmaster

225
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.900
to this last costlytreaty,

226
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.870
the interview, thatswallow'd so much treasure,

227
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.570
and like a glass did breaki' the rinsing.

228
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:45.500
Faith, and so it did.

229
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.500
Pray, give me favour, sir.

230
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.630
This cunning cardinal

231
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.130
The articles o' thecombination drew

232
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.270
as himself pleased;

233
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.400
and they were ratified ashe cried 'Thus let be':

234
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.170
to as much end as give acrutch to the dead:

235
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.700
Now this follows,-- which,as I take it,

236
00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.400
is a kind of puppy to theold dam, treason,

237
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.330
--Charles the emperor,

238
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.170
under pretence to see thequeen his aunt--

239
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.330
For 'twas indeed hiscolour,

240
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.900
but he came to whisperWolsey,

241
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.300
--here makes visitation:

242
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.430
His fears were,

243
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.730
that the interview betwixtEngland and France might,

244
00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.030
through their amity, breedhim some prejudice;

245
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.570
for from this league peep'dharms that menaced him:

246
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.330
he privily deals with ourcardinal; and, as I trow,--

247
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.400
Which I do well;

248
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
for I am sure the emperorpaid ere he promised;

249
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.900
whereby his suit wasgranted ere it was ask'd;

250
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.430
but when the way was made,and paved with gold,

251
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.970
the emperor thus desired,

252
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.900
that he would please toalter the king's course,

253
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:30.900
And break the foresaidpeace.

254
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.330
Let the king know,

255
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.470
As soon he shall by me,

256
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.600
that thus the cardinal doesbuy and sell his honour

257
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.600
as he pleases, and for hisown advantage.

258
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.870
I am sorry to hear this ofhim;

259
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.670
and could wish he weresomething mistaken in't.

260
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.870
No, not a syllable:

261
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.170
I do pronounce him in thatvery shape

262
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.170
he shall appear in proof.

263
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.930
Your office, sergeant;execute it.

264
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.530
Sir, my lord the Duke ofBuckingham,

265
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.570
and Earl of Hereford,Stafford, and Northampton,

266
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.630
I arrest thee of hightreason,

267
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.200
in the name of our mostsovereign king.

268
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.800
Lo, you, my lord,

269
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.300
The net has fall'n uponme!

270
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.030
I shall perish underdevice and practise.

271
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.600
I am sorry to see youta'en from liberty,

272
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.330
to look on the businesspresent:

273
00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.370
'tis his highness'pleasure

274
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.200
You shall to the Tower.

275
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.130
It will help me nothing toplead mine innocence;

276
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.470
for that dye is on me

277
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.470
which makes my whitestpart black.

278
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.100
The will of heaven be donein this and all things!

279
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.200
I obey.

280
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.200
O my LordAbergavenny, fare you well!

281
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.370
Nay, he must bear youcompany.

282
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.130
The king is pleased youshall to the Tower,

283
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.570
till you know how hedetermines further.

284
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.270
As the duke said, the willof heaven be done,

285
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.770
and the king's pleasure byme obey'd!

286
00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.430
Here is a warrant from theking

287
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.600
to attach Lord Montacute;

288
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.270
and the bodies of theduke's confessor,

289
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.170
John de la Car,

290
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.170
One Gilbert Peck, hischancellor--

291
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.630
So, so; These are thelimbs o' the plot:

292
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.800
no more, I hope.

293
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.770
A monk o' the Chartreux.

294
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:18.730
O, Nicholas Hopkins?

295
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.330
He.

296
00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.500
My surveyor is false;

297
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.100
the o'er-great cardinalhath show'd him gold;

298
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.970
my life is spann'dalready:

299
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.600
I am the shadow of poorBuckingham,

300
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.330
Whose figure even thisinstant cloud puts on,

301
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.100
by darkening my clear sun.

302
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.030
My lord, farewell.

303
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.700
My life itself, and thebest heart of it,

304
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.630
Thanks you for this greatcare:

305
00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.900
I stood i' the level of afull-charged confederacy,

306
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.200
and give thanks to youthat choked it.

307
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.870
Let be call'd before us thatgentleman of Buckingham's;

308
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.700
in person I'll hear himhis confessions justify;

309
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.230
And point by point thetreasons

310
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.330
of his master he shallagain relate.

311
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.570
'Room for the Queen!'

312
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:38.600
Nay, we must longer kneel:I am a suitor.

313
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.330
Arise, and take place byus:

314
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.930
half your suit never nameto us;

315
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.970
you have half our power:the other moiety,

316
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.600
ere you ask, is given;

317
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.530
Repeat your will andtake it.

318
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.330
Thank your majesty.

319
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.530
That you would loveyourself,

320
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.030
and in that love notunconsider'd

321
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.830
leave your honour,

322
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.570
nor the dignity of youroffice,

323
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:02.970
is the point of mypetition.

324
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:05.670
Lady mine, proceed.

325
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.430
I am solicited, not by afew,

326
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.700
And those of truecondition,

327
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.330
that your subjects are ingreat grievance:

328
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.230
there have been commissionssent down among 'em,

329
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.700
which hath flaw'd the heartof all their loyalties:

330
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.430
wherein, although, my goodlord cardinal,

331
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.970
they vent reproaches mostbitterly on you,

332
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.630
as putter on of theseexactions,

333
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.930
yet the king our master

334
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.400
-- whose honour heavenshield from soil!

335
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.600
--even he escapes notlanguage unmannerly,

336
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.300
yea, such which breaks thesides of loyalty,

337
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.900
and almost appears in loudrebellion.

338
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.570
Not almost appears,

339
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.370
It doth appear; for, uponthese taxations,

340
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:46.800
The clothiers all,

341
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.200
not able to maintain themany to them longing,

342
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.500
have put off thespinsters,

343
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.730
carders, fullers, weavers,who,

344
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.170
Unfit for other life,

345
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.770
compell'd by hunger andlack of other means,

346
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.830
in desperate manner daringthe event to the teeth,

347
00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:02.270
are all in uproar, anddanger serves among then!

348
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.700
Taxation! Wherein? andwhat taxation?

349
00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.630
My lord cardinal,

350
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.100
You that are blamed for italike with us,

351
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.670
know you of this taxation?

352
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.400
Please you, sir,

353
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.600
I know but of a singlepart,

354
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.570
in aught pertains to thestate;

355
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.000
and front but in that file

356
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.130
where others tell stepswith me.

357
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.330
No, my lord, You know nomore than others;

358
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.370
but you frame things thatare known alike;

359
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.230
which are not wholesome

360
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.570
to those which would notknow them,

361
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.800
and yet must perforce betheir acquaintance.

362
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.600
These exactions, whereof mysovereign would have note,

363
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.330
they are most pestilent tothe bearing;

364
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.300
and, to bear 'em, the backis sacrifice to the load.

365
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:40.070
They say they are devisedby you;

366
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.800
or else you suffer toohard an exclamation.

367
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:46.870
Still exaction! The natureof it?

368
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.700
in what kind, let's know,Is this exaction?

369
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.700
I am much too venturous intempting of your patience;

370
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.170
but am bolden'd under yourpromised pardon.

371
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.130
The subjects' grief comesthrough commissions,

372
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:03.030
which compel from each thesixth part of his substance,

373
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.470
to be levied withoutdelay;

374
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.070
and the pretence for thisis named,

375
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.030
your wars in France:

376
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.370
this makes bold mouths:

377
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.170
tongues spit their dutiesout,

378
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.770
and cold hearts freezeallegiance in them;

379
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.770
their curses now livewhere their prayers did:

380
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.600
and it's come to pass,

381
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.470
this tractable obedienceis a slave

382
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.070
to each incensed will.

383
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:23.900
I would your highness

384
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.030
would give it quickconsideration,

385
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.470
for there is no primerbusiness.

386
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.030
By my life, this isagainst our pleasure.

387
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.870
And for me, I have nofurther gone in this

388
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.200
than by a single voice;

389
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.600
and that not pass'd me

390
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.300
but by learned approbationof the judges.

391
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.570
If I am Traduced byignorant tongues,

392
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.700
which neither know myfaculties nor person,

393
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.300
yet will be the chroniclesof my doing,

394
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.530
let me say 'tis but thefate of place,

395
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.200
and the rough brake thatvirtue must go through.

396
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.300
We must not stint ournecessary actions,

397
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.030
in the fear to copemalicious censurers;

398
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.800
which ever, as ravenousfishes,

399
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:02.000
do a vessel follow that isnew-trimm'd,

400
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.800
but benefit no furtherthan vainly longing.

401
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.600
What we oft do best, bysick interpreters,

402
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.470
once weak ones, is Notours,

403
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:12.970
or not allow'd;

404
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.830
what worst, as oft,hitting a grosser quality,

405
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.830
is cried up for our bestact.

406
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.930
If we shall stand still,

407
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.170
In fear our motion will bemock'd or carp'd at,

408
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.570
We should take root herewhere we sit,

409
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.800
or sit state-statues only.

410
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.930
Things done well, and witha care,

411
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.770
exempt themselves fromfear;

412
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:44.030
Things done withoutexample,

413
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:45.770
in their issue are to befear'd.

414
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.230
Have you a precedent ofthis commission?

415
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.370
I believe, not any.

416
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.770
We must not rend oursubjects from our laws,

417
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:54.200
And stick them in ourwill.

418
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.900
Sixth part of each? Atrembling contribution!

419
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.930
Why, we take from everytree lop, bark,

420
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.330
and part o' the timber;

421
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.630
And, though we leave itwith a root, thus hack'd,

422
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.270
The air will drink thesap.

423
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.630
To every county where thisis question'd

424
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.900
send our letters, withfree pardon

425
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.300
to each man that hasdenied the force

426
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300
of this commission:

427
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.330
pray, look to't; I put itto your care.

428
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.770
A word with you.

429
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.470
Let there be letters writto every shire,

430
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.230
Of the king's grace andpardon.

431
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.700
The grieved commons hardlyconceive of me;

432
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.100
let it be noised thatthrough our intercession

433
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.500
this revokement and pardoncomes:

434
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.870
I shall anon advise youfurther in the proceeding.

435
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.630
I am sorry that the Dukeof Buckingham

436
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.630
is run in yourdispleasure.

437
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.630
It grieves many:

438
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.670
The gentleman is learn'd,and a most rare speaker;

439
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.130
To nature none more bound;

440
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.800
his training such, that hemay furnish

441
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.070
and instruct greatteachers,

442
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.900
And never seek for aid outof himself.

443
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.030
Yet see, when these sonoble benefits

444
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.530
shall prove not welldisposed,

445
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.800
the mind growing oncecorrupt,

446
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.170
They turn to viciousforms,

447
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.170
ten times more ugly thanever they were fair.

448
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.770
This man so complete,

449
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.430
who was enroll'd 'mongstwonders,

450
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.470
and when we, almost withravish'd listening,

451
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.630
could not find his hour ofspeech a minute;

452
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.970
he, my lady, hath intomonstrous habits

453
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.500
put the graces that oncewere his,

454
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.170
and is become as black asif besmear'd in hell.

455
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.530
Sit by us; you shallhear--

456
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.430
This was his gentleman intrust--

457
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.200
of him things to strikehonour sad.

458
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.230
Bid him recount thefore-recited practises;

459
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.430
whereof we cannot feel toolittle, hear too much.

460
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.870
Stand forth, and with boldspirit relate

461
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.600
what you, most like acareful subject,

462
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.600
have collected out of theDuke of Buckingham.

463
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.100
Speak freely.

464
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.830
First, it was usual withhim,

465
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.500
every day it would infecthis speech,

466
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.700
that if the king shouldwithout issue die,

467
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.370
he'll carry it so to makethe sceptre his:

468
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.470
these very words I'veheard him utter

469
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.670
to his son-in-law,Lord Abergavenny;

470
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.800
to whom by oath he menacedrevenge upon the cardinal.

471
00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:24.000
Please your highness,

472
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.130
note this dangerousconception in this point.

473
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.930
Not friended by by hiswish,

474
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.470
to your high person hiswill is most malignant;

475
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.930
and it stretches beyondyou, to your friends.

476
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.670
My learn'd lord cardinal,deliver all with charity.

477
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.700
Speak on:

478
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.600
How grounded he his titleto the crown,

479
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.400
upon our fail?

480
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.430
to this point hast thouheard him

481
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.400
at any time speak aught?

482
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.300
He was brought to this

483
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.030
by a vain prophecy ofNicholas Henton.

484
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.300
What was that Henton?

485
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.670
Sir, a Chartreux friar,His confessor,

486
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.370
who fed him every minutewith words of sovereignty.

487
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:55.800
How know'st thou this?

488
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.230
Not long before yourhighness sped to France,

489
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:01.070
The duke being at theRose,

490
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.230
within the parish SaintLawrence Poultney,

491
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.230
did of me demand what wasthe speech

492
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.300
among the Londoners concerningthe French journey:

493
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.330
I replied, men fear'd theFrench

494
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.300
would prove perfidious tothe king's danger.

495
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.370
Presently the duke said,'twas the fear, indeed;

496
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.600
and that he doubted'twould prove

497
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.030
the verity of certainwords

498
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:23.600
Spoke by a holy monk;'that oft,' says he,

499
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.000
'Hath sent to me, wishingme to permit

500
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.900
John de la Car, mychaplain,

501
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.170
a choice hour to hear fromhim a matter of some moment:

502
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.500
Whom after under theconfession's seal

503
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.930
He solemnly had sworn,

504
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.830
that what he spoke my chaplainto no creature living,

505
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.600
but to me, should utter,

506
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:45.330
with demure confidencethis pausingly ensued:

507
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.600
neither the king nor'sheirs,

508
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.430
Tell you the duke, shallprosper:

509
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.730
bid him strive to gain thelove o' the commonalty:

510
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.930
the duke shall governEngland.'

511
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.300
If I know you well,

512
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.630
You were the duke'ssurveyor,

513
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.330
and lost your office on thecomplaint o' the tenants:

514
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.270
take good heed you

515
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.970
charge not in your spleena noble person

516
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.870
And spoil your noblersoul:

517
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.870
I say, take heed; Yes,heartily beseech you.

518
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.200
Let him on.

519
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.530
Go forward.

520
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.600
On my soul, I'll speak buttruth.

521
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.900
I told my lord the duke,

522
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.870
by the devil's illusionsthe monk might be deceived;

523
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.100
and that 'twas dangerousfor him

524
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.830
to ruminate on this sofar,

525
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.930
until it forged him somedesign,

526
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:26.870
which, being believed,

527
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.470
It was much like to do: heanswer'd, 'Tush,

528
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.270
It can do me no damage;'

529
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.630
adding further,

530
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.270
That, had the king in hislast sickness fail'd,

531
00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.570
The cardinal's and SirThomas Lovell's heads

532
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:39.970
should have gone off.

533
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.130
Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!

534
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.300
There's mischief in thisman: canst thou say further?

535
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.470
I can, my liege.

536
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:48.430
Proceed.

537
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.470
Being at Greenwich,

538
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.100
after your highness hadreproved the duke

539
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.430
about Sir WilliamBlomer,--

540
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.600
I remember of such a time:being my sworn servant,

541
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.200
The duke retain'd him his.But on; what hence?

542
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.970
'If,' quoth he, 'I forthis had been committed,

543
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.170
As, to the Tower, Ithought,

544
00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.330
I would have play'd thepart my father meant to act

545
00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.070
upon the usurper Richard;

546
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.030
who, being at Salisbury,

547
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.700
made suit to come in'spresence;

548
00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.230
which if granted, as hemade semblance of his duty,

549
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.300
would have put his knifeto him.'

550
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.230
A giant traitor!

551
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.530
Now, madam, may hishighness live in freedom,

552
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:19.000
and this man out ofprison?

553
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.800
God mend all!

554
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.870
There's something more wouldout of thee; what say'st?

555
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:26.530
After 'the duke hisfather,' with 'the knife,'

556
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.200
He stretch'd him, and, withone hand on his dagger,

557
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.370
Another spread on'sbreast,

558
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.870
mounting his eyes he diddischarge a horrible oath;

559
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.570
whose tenor was,--were heevil used,

560
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:37.930
he would outgo his father

561
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.370
by as much as aperformance

562
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.500
Does an irresolutepurpose.

563
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.230
There's his period,

564
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.800
To sheathe his knife inus.

565
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.670
He is attach'd;

566
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.100
Call him to present trial:

567
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.030
if he may find mercy inthe law, 'tis his:

568
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:56.070
if none, let himnot seek 't of us:

569
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.930
by day and night,

570
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.530
He's traitor to the height.

571
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.430
Is't possible the spellsof France

572
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:11.200
should juggle men intosuch strange mysteries?

573
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.230
New customs, though theybe never so ridiculous,

574
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.900
Nay, let 'em be unmanly,yet are follow'd.

575
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.230
Death! my lord, theirclothes are after

576
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.670
such a pagan cut too,

577
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:21.470
That, sure, they've wornout Christendom.

578
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.330
How now! What news, SirThomas Lovell?

579
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.430
Faith, my lord, I hear ofnone,

580
00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.800
but the new proclamation that'sclapp'd

581
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.970
upon the court-gate.

582
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.300
What is't for?

583
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.200
The reformation of ourtravell'd gallants,

584
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.530
That fill the court withquarrels, talk, and tailors.

585
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.170
I'm glad 'tis there:

586
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.200
now I would pray ourmonsieurs

587
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.570
to think an Englishcourtier may be wise,

588
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.500
And never see the Louvre.

589
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.430
They must either, for sorun the conditions,

590
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.800
leave those remnants offool and feather

591
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.830
that they got in France,

592
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.130
Or pack to their oldplayfellows:

593
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.570
there, I take it, theymay, 'cum privilegio,'

594
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.430
wear away the lag end of theirlewdness

595
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.270
and be laugh'd at.

596
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.870
'Tis time to give 'emphysic,

597
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.200
their diseases are grownso catching.

598
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.430
What a loss our ladies willhave of these trim vanities!

599
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.030
Ay, marry, There will bewoe indeed, lords:

600
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.370
the sly whoresons have gota speeding trick

601
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.400
to lay down ladies;

602
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.500
A French song and a fiddlehas no fellow.

603
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.230
The devil fiddle 'em! I amglad they are going,

604
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.400
For, sure, there's noconverting of 'em:

605
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.330
now an honest countrylord, as I am,

606
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.570
beaten a long time out ofplay,

607
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.430
may bring his plainsong andhave an hour of hearing;

608
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.500
and, by'r lady, heldcurrent music too.

609
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.670
Well said, Lord Sands;

610
00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.200
Your colt's tooth is notcast yet.

611
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.400
No, my lord; Nor shallnot, while I have a stump.

612
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.900
Sir Thomas, whither wereyou a-going?

613
00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:37.070
To the cardinal's: Yourlordship is a guest too.

614
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.900
O, 'tis true: This nighthe makes a supper,

615
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:41.830
and a great one, to manylords and ladies;

616
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:43.730
there will be the beautyof this kingdom,

617
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:44.800
I'll assure you.

618
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.400
That churchman bears abounteous mind indeed,

619
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.800
A hand as fruitful as theland that feeds us;

620
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.570
his dews fall every where.

621
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.170
No doubt he's noble;

622
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:55.630
He had a black mouth thatsaid other of him.

623
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.500
He may, my lord; haswherewithal:

624
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.730
in him sparing would show aworse sin than ill doctrine:

625
00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.600
Men of his way should bemost liberal;

626
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.970
They are set here forexamples.

627
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:07.300
True, they are so: But fewnow give so great ones.

628
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.570
My barge stays; Yourlordship shall along.

629
00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.600
Come, good Sir Thomas, Weshall be late else;

630
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.400
which I would not be, forI was sent for,

631
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.100
with Sir Henry Guildford thisnight to be comptrollers.

632
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.570
I am your lordship's.

633
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.600
Ladies, a general welcome fromhis grace salutes ye all;

634

this night he dedicates tofair content and you:

635
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.870
none here, he hopes,

636
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:33.000
In all this noble bevy,

637
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.130
has brought with her one careabroad;

638
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.130
he would have all as merryas, first,

639
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.470
good company, good wine,good welcome,

640
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.500
can make good people.

641
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.800
O, my lord, you're tardy:

642
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.770
The very thought of thisfair company

643
00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.670
clapp'd wings to me.

644
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.070
You are young, Sir HarryGuildford.

645
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.930
Sir Thomas Lovell,

646
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.170
had the cardinal but halfmy lay thoughts in him,

647
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.170
some of these should finda running banquet

648
00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.400
ere they rested,

649
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.870
I think would betterplease 'em:

650
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.670
by my life, they are asweet society of fair ones.

651
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.330
O, that your lordship werebut now confessor

652
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.900
to one or two of these!

653
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.870
I would I were they shouldfind easy penance.

654
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.870
Faith, how easy?

655
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.700
As easy as a down-bedwould afford it.

656
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.130
Sweet ladies, will itplease you sit?

657
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.530
Sir Harry, Place you thatside;

658
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.700
I'll take the charge ofthis:

659
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.530
His grace is entering.Nay, you must not freeze;

660
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:30.030
Two women placed togethermakes cold weather:

661
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.730
My Lord Sands, you are onewill keep 'em waking;

662
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.870
Pray, sit between theseladies.

663
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:38.430
By my faith, I thank yourlordship.

664
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.630
By your leave, sweetladies:

665
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.500
If I chance to talk alittle wild, forgive me;

666
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.030
I had it from my father.

667
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.800
Was he mad, sir?

668
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.330
O, very mad, exceedingmad, in love too:

669
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.100
But he would bite none;just as I do now,

670
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.330
He would kiss you twentywith a breath.

671
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.800
You're welcome, my fairguests:

672
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.300

673
00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.870
that is not freely merry,is not my friend: this,

674
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:11.600
to confirm my welcome; andto you all, good health.

675
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.030
Your grace is noble:

676
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.270
Let me have such a bowlmay hold my thanks,

677
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.570
And save me so muchtalking.

678
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.570
My Lord Sands,

679
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:21.570
I am beholding to you:cheer your neighbours.

680
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:22.700
Ladies, you are not merry:

681
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.270
gentlemen, whose fault isthis?

682
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.530
The red wine first mustrise

683
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.570
in their fair cheeks, mylord;

684
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.000
then we shall have 'emtalk us to silence.

685
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.530
You are a merry gamester,my Lord Sands.

686
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:35.730
Yes, if I make my play.

687
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.670
Here's to your ladyship:and pledge it, madam,

688
00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.000
For 'tis to such athing,--

689
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.600
You cannot show me.

690
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.300
I told your grace theywould talk anon.

691
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.300
(boom)

692
00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300
What's that?

693
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.600
Look out there, some ofye.

694
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.330
What warlike voice, and towhat end is this?

695
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:54.370
Nay, ladies, fear not;

696
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.870
by all the laws of waryou're privileged.

697
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.870
How now! what is't?

698
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.770
A noble troop ofstrangers;

699
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.970
For so they seem:

700
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:19.900
they've left their bargeand landed;

701
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.330
And hither make,

702
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:23.930
as great ambassadors fromforeign princes.

703
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.770
Good lord chamberlain, Go,give 'em welcome;

704
00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.830
you can speak the Frenchtongue;

705
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.130
And, pray, receive 'emnobly,

706
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.500
and conduct 'em into ourpresence,

707
00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500
where this heaven ofbeauty

708
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.800
shall shine at full uponthem.

709
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.800
Some attend him.

710
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.900
You have now a brokenbanquet; but we'll mend it.

711
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.570
A good digestion to youall:

712

A noble company! what aretheir pleasures?

715
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.000
Because they speak noEnglish,

716
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.370
thus they pray'd to tellyour grace,

717
00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.700
that, having heard by fame

718
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:41.930
of this so noble and sofair assembly

719
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:43.530
This night to meet here,

720
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.830
they could do no less

721
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.230
out of the great respectthey bear to beauty,

722
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.430
But leave their flocks;and,

723
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.970
under your fair conduct,

724
00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:53.100
Crave leave to view theseladies

725
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.370
and entreat an hour ofrevels with 'em.

726
00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.470
Say, lord chamberlain,

727
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:00.170
they have done my poorhouse grace;

728
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.500
for which I pay 'em athousand thanks,

729
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.430
and pray 'em take theirpleasures.

730
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.500
The fairest hand I evertouch'd! O beauty,

731
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.770
till now I never knewthee!

732
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.900
My lord!

733
00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.200
Your grace?

734
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.670
Pray, tell 'em thus muchfrom me:

735
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:45.730
There should be one amongst'em, by his person,

736
00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:49.500
More worthy this placethan myself; to whom,

737
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.270
If I but knew him, with mylove and duty

738
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:54.370
I would surrender it.

739
00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.130
I will, my lord.

740
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.800
What say they?

741
00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.500
Such a one, they allconfess,

742
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.870
There is indeed;

743
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:32.230
which they would have yourgrace find out,

744
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.230
and he will take it.

745
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.970
Let me see, then.

746
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.700
By all your good leaves,gentlemen;

747
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:08.130
here I'll make my royalchoice.

748
00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.870
Ye have found him,cardinal:

749
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.630
You hold a fair assembly;you do well, lord:

750
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.570
You are a churchman, or,I'll tell you, cardinal,

751
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.530
I should judge nowunhappily.

752
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.100
I am glad your grace isgrown so pleasant.

753
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.830
My lord chamberlain,Prithee, come hither:

754
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.300
what fair lady's that?

755
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.370
An't please your grace, SirThomas Bullen's daughter,

756
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.000
the Viscount Rochford,

757
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.300
one of her highness'women.

758
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.700
By heaven, she is a daintyone.

759
00:35:56.370 --> 00:36:01.070
Sweetheart, I wereunmannerly, to take you out,

760
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.770
And not to kiss you.

761
00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:10.770
A health, gentlemen! Letit go round.

762
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.670
Sir Thomas Lovell, is thebanquet ready

763
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.770
I' the privy chamber?

764
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:20.300
Yes, my lord.

765
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:25.330
Your grace, I fear, withdancing is a little heated.

766
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.970
I fear, too much.

767
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.270
There's fresher air, mylord, in the next chamber.

768
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.230
Lead in your ladies, everyone:

769
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.800
sweet partner, I must notyet forsake you:

770
00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:38.470
let's be merry: Good mylord cardinal,

771
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:39.730
I have half a dozenhealths

772
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.470
To drink to these fairladies,

773
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.230
and a measure to lead 'emonce again;

774
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.430
and then let's dream who'sbest in favour.

775
00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.200
Let the music knock it.

776
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:59.030
(music plays)

777
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:02.070
Whither away so fast?

778
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.500
O, God save ye!

779
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.570
Even to the hall, to hearwhat shall become

780
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.070
of the great Duke ofBuckingham.

781
00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.730
I'll save you that labour,sir. All's now done,

782
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.870
but the ceremony ofbringing back the prisoner.

783
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.330
Were you there?

784
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.770
Yes, indeed, was I.

785
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.470
Pray, speak what hashappen'd.

786
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.430
You may guess quicklywhat.

787
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.230
Is he found guilty?

788
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:25.030
Yes, truly is he, andcondemn'd upon't.

789
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:26.870
I am sorry for't.

790
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.630
So are a number more.

791
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.070
But, pray, how pass'd it?

792
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.570
I'll tell you in a little.

793
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.800
The great duke came to thebar;

794
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.100
where to his accusations

795
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.870
He pleaded still notguilty

796
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.570
and alleged many sharpreasons to defeat the law.

797
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.470
The king's attorney on thecontrary

798
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.830
Urged on the examinations,proofs, confessions

799
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.070
Of divers witnesses;

800
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.700
which the duke desired tohave brought

801
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.900
viva voce to his face:

802
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.870
At which appear'd againsthim his surveyor;

803
00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.830
Sir Gilbert Peck hischancellor; and John Car,

804
00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.270
Confessor to him; withthat devil-monk,

805
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.730
Hopkins, that made thismischief.

806
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.000
That was he that fed himwith his prophecies?

807
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.430
The same.

808
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.170
All these accused himstrongly;

809
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:13.800
which he fain would haveflung from him,

810
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.930
but, indeed, he could not:

811
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.870
And so his peers, uponthis evidence,

812
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:21.870
Have found him guilty ofhigh treason.

813
00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.800
Much he spoke, andlearnedly, for life;

814
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.570
but all was either pitiedin him or forgotten.

815
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.230
After all this, how did hebear himself?

816
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.530
When he was brought againto the bar,

817
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.030
to hear his knell rungout, his judgment,

818
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:37.170
he was stirr'd with suchan agony,

819
00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.770
he sweat extremely,

820
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.430
And something spoke incholer, ill, and hasty:

821
00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:47.470
But he fell to himselfagain,

822
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:48.730
and sweetly in all therest

823
00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.800
show'd a most noblepatience.

824
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.770
I do not think he fearsdeath.

825
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:53.670
Sure, he does not:

826
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.670
He never was so womanish;

827
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.900
the cause he may a littlegrieve at.

828
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.030
Certainly the cardinal isthe end of this.

829
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.770
'Tis likely, By allconjectures:

830
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.300
first, Kildare'sattainder,

831
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.400
Then deputy of Ireland;who removed,

832
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.500
Earl Surrey was sentthither, and in haste too,

833
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.970
Lest he should help hisfather.

834
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.100
That trick of state was adeep envious one.

835
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.130
At his return no doubt hewill requite it.

836
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:23.030
This is noted, and generally,whoever the king favours,

837
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.500
The cardinal instantlywill find employment,

838
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.170
And far enough from courttoo.

839
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.830
All the commons hate himperniciously,

840
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.930
and, o' my conscience,wish him ten fathom deep:

841
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:38.200
this duke as much theylove and dote on;

842
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.230
call him bounteousBuckingham,

843
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:41.730
The mirror of allcourtesy;--

844
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.070
Stay there, sir,

845
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.900
And see the noble ruin'dman you speak of.

846
00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.430
All good people,

847
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.900
You that thus far havecome to pity me,

848
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.730
Hear what I say, and thengo home and lose me.

849
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.500
I have this day received atraitor's judgment,

850
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:17.230
And by that name must die:yet, heaven bear witness,

851
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:19.230
And if I have a conscience,let it sink me,

852
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:22.830
Even as the axe falls, ifI be not faithful!

853
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.600
The law I bear no malicefor my death;

854
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.470
'T has done, upon thepremises, but justice:

855
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.830
But those that sought it Icould wish more Christians:

856
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.770
Be what they will, Iheartily forgive 'em:

857
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.670
Yet let 'em look theyglory not in mischief,

858
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.800
Nor build their evils onthe graves of great men;

859
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.970
For then my guiltless bloodmust cry against 'em.

860
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:54.870
For further life in thisworld I ne'er hope,

861
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.530
Nor will I sue,

862
00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.330
although the king havemercies

863
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.370
more than I dare makefaults.

864
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.100
You few that loved me,

865
00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.330
And dare be bold to weepfor Buckingham,

866
00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.100
His noble friends andfellows,

867
00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.370
whom to leave is onlybitter to him, only dying,

868
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.530
Go with me, like goodangels, to my end;

869
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.470
And, as the long divorceof steel falls on me,

870
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.300
Make of your prayers onesweet sacrifice,

871
00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.200
And lift my soul toheaven.

872
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.300
Lead on, o' God's name.

873
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.030
I do beseech your grace,for charity,

874
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.300
If ever any malice in yourheart were hid against me,

875
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:06.270
now to forgive me frankly.

876
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:07.370
Sir Thomas Lovell,

877
00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.770
I as free forgive you as Iwould be forgiven:

878
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.400
I forgive all;

879
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.900
There cannot be thosenumberless offences

880
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.130
'Gainst me, that Icannot take peace with:

881
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.430
no black envy shall markmy grave.

882
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.670
Commend me to his grace;

883
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.800
And if he speak ofBuckingham, pray, tell him

884
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.270
you met him half inheaven:

885
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.370
my vows and prayers yetare the king's;

886
00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:31.830
and, till my soul forsake,

887
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.100
shall cry for blessings onhim:

888
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.100
may he live longer

889
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.070
than I have time to tellhis years!

890
00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.400
Ever beloved and lovingmay his rule be!

891
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.770
And when old time shalllead him to his end,

892
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.970
Goodness and he fill upone monument!

893
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.070
To the water side I mustconduct your grace;

894
00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.330
Then give my charge up toSir Nicholas Vaux,

895
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.030
Who undertakes you to yourend.

896
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.430
Prepare there, the duke iscoming:

897
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.170
see the barge be ready;

898
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.300
And fit it with suchfurniture

899
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.000
as suits the greatness ofhis person.

900
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.500
Nay, Sir Nicholas, Let italone;

901
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.470
my state now will but mockme.

902
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.530
When I came hither,

903
00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.270
I was lord high constableand Duke of Buckingham;

904
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:25.470
now, poor Edward Bohun:

905
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.370
Yet I am richer than mybase accusers,

906
00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.100
That never knew what truthmeant:

907
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.100
I now seal it; And withthat blood

908
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.500
will make 'em one daygroan for't.

909
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.630
My noble father, Henry ofBuckingham,

910
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:39.170
Who first raised headagainst usurping Richard,

911
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:40.930
Flying for succor to hisservant Banister,

912
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.270
Being distress'd, was bythat wretch betray'd,

913
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:46.270
And without trial fell;God's peace be with him!

914
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:48.570
Henry the Seventhsucceeding,

915
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.270
truly pitying my father'sloss,

916
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.870
like a most royal prince,restored me to my honours,

917
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:55.830
and, out of ruins, made myname once more noble.

918
00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:59.500
Now his son, Henry theEighth, life, honour, name

919
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.130
and all that made me happy

920
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:03.400
at one stroke has takenfor ever from the world.

921
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:07.200
I had my trial, and, mustneeds say, a noble one;

922
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.330
which makes me, a littlehappier

923
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.970
than my wretched father:

924
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.370
Yet thus far we are one infortunes:

925
00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:16.800
both gell by our servants,by those men we loved most;

926
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.670
A most unnatural andfaithless service!

927
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:31.470
Heaven has an end in all:yet, you that hear me,

928
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.100
This from a dying manreceive as certain:

929
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.600
Where you are liberal ofyour loves and counsels

930
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.300
Be sure you be not loose;

931
00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.570
for those you make friendsand give your hearts to,

932
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.170
when they once perceive theleast rub in your fortunes,

933
00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.900
fall away like waterfrom ye,

934
00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:54.630
never found again but wherethey mean to sink ye.

935
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:02.430
All good people, Prayfor me!

936
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.030
I must now forsake ye:

937
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.700
the last hour of my longweary life

938
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.630
is come upon me.Farewell:

939
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:17.300
And when you would saysomething that is sad,

940
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:25.900
Speak how I fell. I havedone; and God forgive me!

941
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.030
O, this is full of pity!

942
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.230
Sir, it calls, I fear,

943
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.130
too many curses on theirbeads that were the authors.

944
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:11.770
If the duke be guiltless,

945
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.370
'Tis full of woe:

946
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.900
yet I can give you inklingof an ensuing evil,

947
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.170
if it fall,

948
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.600
Greater than this.

949
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.130
Good angels keep it fromus!

950
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.970
What may it be? You do notdoubt my faith, sir?

951
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.070
This secret is so weighty,

952
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.470
'twill require a strongfaith to conceal it.

953
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.670
Let me have it; I do nottalk much.

954
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.230
I am confident, You shall,sir:

955
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.500
did you not of late dayshear

956
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.030
A buzzing of a separation

957
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.570
Between the king andKatharine?

958
00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:48.030
Yes, but it held not:

959
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.370
For when the king onceheard it, out of anger

960
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.100
He sent command to thelord mayor straight

961
00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.300
To stop the rumor, andallay those tongues

962
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.430
That durst disperse it.

963
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:57.170
But that slander, sir,

964
00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.670
Is found a truth now: forit grows again

965
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:02.470
Fresher than e'er it was;

966
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:04.130
and held for certain

967
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:06.300
The king will ventureat it.

968
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:09.000
Either the cardinal,

969
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.800
Or some about him near,

970
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.600
have, out of malice to thegood queen,

971
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.500
possess'd him with ascruple

972
00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.530
That will undo her: toconfirm this too,

973
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:23.170
Cardinal Campeius isarrived, and lately;

974
00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.900
As all think, for thisbusiness.

975
00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:27.430
'Tis the cardinal;

976
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.500
And merely to revenge himon the emperor

977
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.670
For not bestowing on him,at his asking,

978
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.730
The archbishopric ofToledo, this is purposed.

979
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.230
I think you have hit themark:

980
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:40.630
but is't not cruel

981
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.070
That she should feel thesmart of this?

982
00:47:43.770 --> 00:47:48.000
The cardinal will have hiswill, and she must fall.

983
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.970
'My lord, the horses yourlordship sent for,

984
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.170
with all the care I had,

985
00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.970
I saw well chosen, ridden,and furnished.

986
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:57.130
They were young andhandsome,

987
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.270
and of the best breed inthe north.

988
00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:01.300
When they were ready toset out for London,

989
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.030
a man of my lordcardinal's,

990
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:08.130
by commission and mainpower, took 'em from me;

991
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.300
with this reason: Hismaster would be served

992
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.870
before a subject, if notbefore the king;

993
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:19.370
which stopped our mouths,sir.'

994
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:26.300
I fear he will indeed:well, let him have them:

995
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.670
He will have all, I think.

996
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.830
Well met, my lordchamberlain.

997
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:32.070
Good day to both yourgraces.

998
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.700
How is the king employ'd?

999
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:35.300
I left him private,

1000
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:37.870
Full of sad thoughts andtroubles.

1001
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:40.570
What's the cause?

1002
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.500
It seems the marriage withhis brother's wife

1003
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.030
Has crept too near hisconscience.

1004
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.970
No, his conscience

1005
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.200
Has crept too near anotherlady.

1006
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.270
'Tis so:

1007
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.630
This is the cardinal'sdoing, the king-cardinal:

1008
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.700
That blind priest, likethe eldest son of fortune,

1009
00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.400
Turns what he list.

1010
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.500
The king will know him oneday.

1011
00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.370
Pray God he do! he'llnever know himself else.

1012
00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.100
How holily he works in allhis business!

1013
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.830
And with what zeal! for,

1014
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:03.000
now he has crack'd theleague

1015
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Between us and the emperor,the queen's great nephew,

1016
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.600
He dives into the king'ssoul, and there scatters

1017
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.230
Dangers, doubts, wringingof the conscience,

1018
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:11.630
Fears, and despairs;

1019
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.030
and all these for hismarriage:

1020
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.670
And out of all these torestore the king,

1021
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.800
He counsels a divorce; aloss of her

1022
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.730
That, like a jewel, hashung twenty years

1023
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.600
About his neck, yet neverlost her lustre;

1024
00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.500
Of her that loves him withthat excellence

1025
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.230
That angels love good menwith; even of her

1026
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.370
That, when the greateststroke of fortune falls,

1027
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:36.100
Will bless the king: andis not this course pious?

1028
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.430
Heaven keep me from suchcounsel! '

1029
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.630
Tis most true these newsare every where;

1030
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:41.770
every tongue speaks 'em,

1031
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:43.770
And every true heart weepsfor't:

1032
00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:45.270
all that dare

1033
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.130
Look into these affairssee this main end,

1034
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.930
The French king's sister.

1035
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.200
Heaven will one day openthe king's eyes,

1036
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.200
that so long have sleptupon this bold bad man.

1037
00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.200
And free us from hisslavery.

1038
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.170
We had need pray,

1039
00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:01.900
And heartily, for ourdeliverance;

1040
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.270
Or this imperious man willwork us all

1041
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.500
From princes into pages:all men's honours

1042
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.500
Lie like one lump beforehim, to be fashion'd

1043
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:08.930
Into what pitch he please.

1044
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:09.930
For me, my lords,

1045
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.430
I love him not, nor fearhim; there's my creed:

1046
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.030
As I am made without him,so I'll stand,

1047
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.470
If the king please; hiscurses and his blessings

1048
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:21.330
Touch me alike, they'rebreath I not believe in.

1049
00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.370
I knew him, and I knowhim; so I leave him

1050
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:29.330
To him that made himproud, the pope.

1051
00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:30.500
Let's in;

1052
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.030
And with some otherbusiness put the king

1053
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.330
From these sad thoughts,that work too much upon him:

1054
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.900
My lord, you'll bear uscompany?

1055
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.830
Excuse me;

1056
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.370
The king has sent meotherwhere: besides,

1057
00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:43.730
You'll find a most unfittime to disturb him:

1058
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.500
Health to your lordships.

1059
00:50:46.770 --> 00:50:48.800
Thanks, my good lordchamberlain.

1060
00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.400
How sad he looks! sure, heis much afflicted.

1061
00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.570
Who's there, ha?

1062
00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:19.200
Pray God he be not angry.

1063
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:26.300
Who's there, I say? Howdare you thrust yourselves

1064
00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.870
Into my privatemeditations?

1065
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:30.570
Who am I? ha?

1066
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.230
A gracious king thatpardons all offences

1067
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.500
Malice ne'er meant: ourbreach of duty this way

1068
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.300
Is business of estate; inwhich we come

1069
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.570
To know your royalpleasure.

1070
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:41.570
Ye are too bold:

1071
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:44.200
Go to; I'll make ye knowyour times of business:

Who's there? my good lordcardinal? O my Wolsey,

1075
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.530
Thou art a cure fit for aking.

1076
00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:03.300
You're welcome,

Sir, you cannot.

1082
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.830
I would your grace wouldgive us but an hour

1083
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.270
Of private conference.

1084
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.870
We are busy; go.

1085
00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:17.030
This priest has no pridein him?

1086
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:18.530
Not to speak of:

1087
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.900
I would not be so sickthough for his place:

1088
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.500
But this cannot continue.

1089
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.370
If it do,

1090
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:24.230
I'll venture onehave-at-him.

1091
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.530
I another.

1092
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.200
Your grace has given aprecedent of wisdom

1093
00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.030
Above all princes, incommitting freely

1094
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.200
Your scruple to the voiceof Christendom:

1095
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.500
Who can be angry now? whatenvy reach you?

1096
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.800
The Spaniard, tied bloodand favour to her,

1097
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.930
Must now confess, if theyhave any goodness,

1098
00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.430
The trial just and noble.All the clerks,

1099
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:45.670
I mean the learned ones,in Christian kingdoms

1100
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:48.700
Have their free voices:Rome, the nurse of judgment,

1101
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.070
Invited by your nobleself, hath sent

1102
00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.830
One general tongue untous, this good man,

1103
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.070
This just and learnedpriest, Cardinal Campeius;

1104
00:52:57.070 --> 00:52:59.270
Whom once more I presentunto your highness.

1105
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.170
And once more in mine armsI bid him welcome,

1106
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.100
And thank the holyconclave for their loves:

1107
00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.200
They have sent me such a manI would have wish'd for.

1108
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.530
Your grace must needs deserveall strangers' loves,

1109
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.630
You are so noble. To yourhighness' hand

1110
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.930
I tender my commission; bywhose virtue,

1111
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.070
The court of Romecommanding, you, my lord

1112
00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:16.900
Cardinal of York, are join'dwith me their servant

1113
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.430
In the unpartial judgingof this business.

1114
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.700
Two equal men. The queenshall be acquainted

1115
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.270
Forthwith for what youcome. Where's Gardiner?

1116
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:26.930
I know your majesty hasalways loved her

1117
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:29.000
So dear in heart, not todeny her that

1118
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.800
A woman of less placemight ask by law:

1119
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.670
Scholars allow'd freely toargue for her.

1120
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.170
Ay, and the best she shallhave; and my favour

1121
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:40.770
To him that does best: Godforbid else. Cardinal,

1122
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.270
Prithee, call Gardiner tome, my new secretary:

1123
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.270
I find him a fit fellow.

1124
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.030
Give me your hand much joy

1125
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:56.400
and favour to you; You arethe king's now.

1126
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.470
But to be commanded

1127
00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.900
For ever by your grace,whose hand has raised me.

1128
00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.870
Come hither, Gardiner.

1129
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.500
My Lord of York, was notone Doctor Pace

1130
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.430
In this man's place beforehim?

1131
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:17.530
Yes, he was.

1132
00:54:17.530 --> 00:54:19.000
Was he not held a learnedman?

1133
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.270
Yes, surely.

1134
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.170
Believe me, there's an illopinion spread then

1135
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.500
Even of yourself, lordcardinal.

1136
00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.600
How! of me?

1137
00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:28.400
They will not stick to sayyou envied him,

1138
00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.730
And fearing he would rise,he was so virtuous,

1139
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.500
Kept him a foreign manstill; which so grieved him,

1140
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:36.430
That he ran mad and died.

1141
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:38.870
Heaven's peace be withhim!

1142
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.500
That's Christian careenough: for living murmurers

1143
00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.470
There's places of rebuke.He was a fool;

1144
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.630
For he would needs bevirtuous: that good fellow,

1145
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.270
If I command him, followsmy appointment:

1146
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:52.530
I will have none so nearelse.

1147
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.270
Learn this, brother,

1148
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.670
We live not to be grip'dby meaner persons.

1149
00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.230
Deliver this with modestyto the queen.

1150
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.230
The most convenient placethat I can think of

1151
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.100
For such receipt oflearning is Black-Friars;

1152
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.730
There ye shall meet aboutthis weighty business.

1153
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:12.870
My Wolsey, see itfurnish'd. O, my lord,

1154
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.970
Would it not grieve anable man to leave

1155
00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:19.800
So sweet a bedfellow? But,conscience, conscience!

1156
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:23.800
O, 'tis a tender place;and I must leave her.

1157
00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:35.230
Not for that neither: here'sthe pang that pinches:

1158
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:37.670
His highness having livedso long with her,

1159
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:38.930
and she so good a lady

1160
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:40.300
that no tongue could everpronounce

1161
00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.330
dishonour of her;

1162
00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:46.070
by my life, she never knewharm-doing:

1163
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:47.770
O, now, after so manycourses

1164
00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:49.400
of the sun enthroned,

1165
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.730
Still growing in a majestyand pomp, the which

1166
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.570
To leave a thousand-foldmore bitter than

1167
00:55:57.570 --> 00:56:01.630
'Tis sweet at first toacquire,--after this process,

1168
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.530
To give her the avaunt!

1169
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.830
It is a pity would move amonster.

1170
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.470
Hearts of most hard temper

1171
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.330
Melt and lament for her.

1172
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:10.230
O, God's will!

1173
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:12.170
much better she ne'er hadknown pomp:

1174
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:13.870
though't be temporal,

1175
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.370
Yet, if that quarrel,fortune,

1176
00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:17.330
do divorce it from thebearer,

1177
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:18.700
'tis a sufferance panging

1178
00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.700
As soul and body'ssevering.

1179
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:22.670
Alas, poor lady!

1180
00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:25.170
She's a stranger nowagain.

1181
00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:26.030
So much the more

1182
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:28.200
Must pity drop upon her.

1183
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.870
Verily, I swear, 'tisbetter to be lowly born,

1184
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.070
And range with humblelivers in content,

1185
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.500
Than to be perk'd up in aglistering grief,

1186
00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:36.800
And wear a golden sorrow.

1187
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.700
Our content is our besthaving.

1188
00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:39.900
By my troth andmaidenhead,

1189
00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:41.700
I would not be a queen.

1190
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.300
Beshrew me, I would,

1191
00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.970
And venture maidenheadfor't;

1192
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:46.200
and so would you,

1193
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.500
For all this spice of yourhypocrisy:

1194
00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.100
You, that have so fairparts of woman on you,

1195
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.500
Have too a woman's heart;

1196
00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:01.030
which ever yet affectedeminence, wealth, sovereignty;

1197
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:05.430
Which, to say sooth, areblessings; and which gifts,

1198
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:08.330
Saving your mincing,

1199
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:11.430
the capacity of your softcheveril conscience

1200
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:12.500
would receive,

1201
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.170
If you might please tostretch it.

1202
00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:16.570
Nay, good troth.

1203
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:20.830
Yes, troth, and troth; youwould not be a queen?

1204
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:24.200
No, not for all the richesunder heaven.

1205
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.730
'Tis strange: a three-pencebow'd would hire me,

1206
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.270
Old as I am, to queen it:

1207
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.670
but, I pray you,

1208
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.230
What think you of aduchess?

1209
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.970
have you limbs to bearthat load of title?

1210
00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:39.230
No, in truth.

1211
00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:43.670
Then you are weakly made:pluck off a little;

1212
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:45.730
I would not be a youngcount in your way,

1213
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.130
For more than blushingcomes to:

1214
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:51.470
if your back cannotvouchsafe this burthen,

1215
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:54.000
'tis too weak ever to geta boy.

1216
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.100
How you do talk!

1217
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.800
I swear again, I would notbe a queen

1218
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.770
For all the world.

1219
00:57:57.770 --> 00:57:59.700
In faith, for littleEngland

1220
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.030
You'ld venture anemballing:

1221
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:05.730
I myself would forCarnarvonshire,

1222
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.170
although there long'd nomore

1223
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:08.830
to the crown but that.

1224
00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.970
Lo, who comes here?

1225
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:16.130
Good morrow, ladies. Whatwere't worth to know

1226
00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:18.100
The secret of yourconference?

1227
00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.230
My good lord,

1228
00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:23.030
Not your demand; it valuesnot your asking:

1229
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:25.930
Our mistress' sorrows wewere pitying.

1230
00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:26.970
It was a gentle business,

1231
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.000
and becoming the action ofgood women:

1232
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.370
there is hope all will bewell.

1233
00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:33.930
Now, I pray God, amen!

1234
00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:35.870
You bear a gentle mind,

1235
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:39.730
and heavenly blessingsfollow such creatures.

1236
00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:40.670
That you may, fair lady,

1237
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:42.600
Perceive I speaksincerely,

1238
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.570
and high note's ta'en ofyour many virtues,

1239
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:48.330
the king's majestycommends his good opinion

1240
00:58:48.330 --> 00:58:49.930
of you to you,

1241
00:58:49.930 --> 00:58:51.470
and does purpose honour toyou

1242
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:55.370
no less flowing thanMarchioness of Pembroke:

1243
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:58.130
to which title a thousandpound a year,

1244
00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:02.200
annual support, out of hisgrace he adds.

1245
00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:04.670
I do not know

1246
00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:08.230
What kind of my obedienceI should tender;

1247
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.970
More than my all isnothing:

1248
00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.770
nor my prayers are notwords duly hallow'd,

1249
00:59:13.770 --> 00:59:16.470
nor my wishes more worththan empty vanities;

1250
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:24.700
yet prayers and wishes areall I can return.

1251
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:27.630
Beseech your lordship,

1252
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:30.800
Vouchsafe to speak mythanks and my obedience,

1253
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:34.000
As from a blushinghandmaid, to his highness;

1254
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.530
Whose health and royalty Ipray for.

1255
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:38.200
Lady, I shall not fail toapprove

1256
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.770
the fair conceit the kinghath of you.

1257
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.230
I have perused her well;

1258
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:47.330
Beauty and honour in herare so mingled

1259
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:49.330
That they have caught theking:

1260
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.470
and who knows yet

1261
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.200
But from this lady mayproceed a gem

1262
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:56.700
To lighten all this isle?

1263
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.970
I'll to the king, and sayI spoke with you.

1264
01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:02.970
My honour'd lord.

1265
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:11.370
Why, this it is; see, see!

1266
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:14.500
I have been beggingsixteen years in court,

1267
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.330
Am yet a courtierbeggarly,

1268
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:20.570
and you, O fate!

1269
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.430
A very fresh-fishhere--fie, fie, fie upon

1270
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.630
This compell'd fortune!

1271
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:26.900
--have your mouth fill'dup

1272
01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:28.100
Before you open it.

1273
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.500
This is strange to me.

1274
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.400
How tastes it? is itbitter?

1275
01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.970
forty pence, no.

1276
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:38.130
There was a lady once,'tis an old story,

1277
01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:39.430
That would not be a queen,

1278
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.130
that would she not,

1279
01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:44.600
For all the mud in Egypt:have you heard it?

1280
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.100
Come, you are pleasant.

1281
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.900
With your theme,

1282
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.200
I could O'ermount thelark.

1283
01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.770
The Marchioness ofPembroke!

1284
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:54.570
A thousand pounds a yearfor pure respect!

1285
01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:57.100
No other obligation!

1286
01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.870
By my life, that promisesmoe thousands:

1287
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:04.370
honour's train is longerthan his foreskirt.

1288
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.100
By this time I know

1289
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.200
your back will bear aduchess:

1290
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.300
say, are you not strongerthan you were?

1291
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.030
Good lady, Make yourselfmirth

1292
01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.570
with your particularfancy,

1293
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:18.830
And leave me out on't.

1294
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:21.770
Would I had no being,

1295
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.730
If this salute my blood ajot:

1296
01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:28.970
it faints me to think whatfollows.

1297
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.800
The queen is comfortless,

1298
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.370
and we forgetful in ourlong absence:

1299
01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.070
pray, do not deliver

1300
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.600
what here you've heard toher.

1301
01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.730
What do you think me?

1302
01:02:18.030 --> 01:02:19.570
Whilst our commission fromRome is read,

1303
01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.170
Let silence be commanded.

1304
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.070
What's the need?

1305
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.930
It hath already publiclybeen read,

1306
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:26.600
And on all sides theauthority allow'd;

1307
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.630
You may, then, spare thattime.

1308
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.930
Say, Henry King of England,come into the court.

1309
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.970
Henry King of England,come into the court.

1310

Sir, I desire you do meright and justice;

1314
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.530
And to bestow your pity onme:

1315
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:29.630
for I am a most poorwoman,

1316
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:32.000
and a stranger,

1317
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.270
Born out of yourdominions;

1318
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.970
having here no judgeindifferent,

1319
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.300
nor no more assurance

1320
01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.170
Of equal friendship andproceeding.

1321
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.230
Alas, sir, in what have Ioffended you?

1322
01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:53.570
what cause hath mybehavior

1323
01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:56.070
given to your displeasure,

1324
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:59.100
That thus you shouldproceed to put me off,

1325
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:00.970
And take your good gracefrom me?

1326
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.430
Heaven witness,

1327
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:10.570
I have been to you a trueand humble wife,

1328
01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:14.430
At all times to your willconformable;

1329
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.870
Ever in fear to kindleyour dislike,

1330
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:20.000
Yea, subject to yourcountenance,

1331
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.130
glad or sorry as I saw itinclined:

1332
01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:27.600
when was the hour

1333
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.770
I ever contradicted yourdesire,

1334
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:32.800
Or made it not mine too?

1335
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:34.800
Or which of your friends

1336
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.170
Have I not strove to love,

1337
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.770
although I knew he weremine enemy?

1338
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.800
what friend of mine

1339
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.730
That had to him derivedyour anger,

1340
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.170
did I continue in myliking?

1341
01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:49.930
nay, gave notice he wasfrom thence discharged.

1342
01:04:56.370 --> 01:05:00.900
Sir, consider that I havebeen your wife,

1343

Upward of twenty years,

and have been blest withmany children by you:

1346
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.370
if, in the course andprocess of this time,

1347
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:19.500
you can report, and proveit too,

1348
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.070
against mine honour aught,

1349
01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:26.370
My bond to wedlock, or mylove and duty,

1350
01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:31.130
Against your sacredperson, in God's name,

1351
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.030
Turn me away;

1352
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:34.600
and let the foul'stcontempt

1353
01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.730

Please you sir,

1356
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:45.570
The king, your father,

was reputed for a princemost prudent,

1358
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:52.730
of an excellent andunmatch'd wit and judgment:

1359
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:56.900
Ferdinand, My father, kingof Spain,

1360
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.770

that there had reign'd bymany

1362
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.530
A year before:

1363
01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:05.970
it is not to be question'd

1364
01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:08.270
That they had gather'd awise council to them

1365
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:12.230
Of every realm, that diddebate this business,

1366

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.270
Lord cardinal, to you Ispeak.

Your pleasure, madam?

1389
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:28.570
Sir,I am about to weep;

1390
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:31.970
but, thinking that we area queen,

1391
01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:35.070
or long have dream'd so,

1392
01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.100
certain the daughter of aking,

1393
01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.470
my drops of tears I'llturn to sparks of fire.

1394
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:43.170
Be patient yet.

1395
01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:46.500
I will, when you arehumble;

1396
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.730
nay, before, or God willpunish me.

1397
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:50.530
I do believe,

1398
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:52.130
Induced by potentcircumstances,

1399
01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:53.830
that you are mine enemy,

1400
01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:54.870
and make my challenge

1401
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.900
You shall not be my judge:

1402
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.500
for it is you have blownthis coal

1403
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.370
betwixt my lord and me;

1404
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:02.930
Which God's dew quench!

1405
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.670
Therefore I say again,

1406
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.700

1407
01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.530
Refuse you for my judge;

1408
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:14.470
whom, yet once more,

1409
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.870
I hold my most maliciousfoe,

1410
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:19.230
and think not at all afriend to truth.

1411
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:20.100
I do profess

1412
01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.730
You speak not likeyourself;

1413
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:24.370
who ever yet have stood tocharity,

1414
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.500
and display'd the effectsof wisdom

1415
01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.900
and disposition gentle,

1416
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:30.100
o'ertopping woman's power.

1417
01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.500
Madam, you do me wrong:

1418
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:34.970
I have no spleen againstyou;

1419
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:37.730
nor injustice for you orany:

1420
01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:38.930
how far I have proceeded,

1421
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:41.400
Or how far further shall,

1422
01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:44.000
is warranted by a commissionfrom the consistory,

1423
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.800
Yea, the whole consistoryof Rome.

1424
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:50.670
You charge me that I haveblown this coal:

1425
01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:51.630
I do deny it:

1426
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:53.330
The king is present:

1427
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.830
if it be known to him thatI gainsay my deed,

1428
01:08:55.830 --> 01:08:56.970
how may he wound,

1429
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.200
And worthily, myfalsehood!

1430
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.100
yea, as much as you havedone my truth.

1431
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.170
If he know that I am freeof your report,

1432
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:07.770
he knows I am not of yourwrong.

1433
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.770
Therefore in him it liesto cure me:

1434
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:11.870
and the cure is,

1435
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.170
to remove these thoughtsfrom you:

1436
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:16.370
the which before hishighness shall speak in,

1437
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:19.030
I do beseech you, graciousmadam,

1438
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:22.970
to unthink your speakingand to say so no more.

1439
01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.100
My lord,

1440
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.700
my lord, I am a simplewoman,

1441
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.770
much too weak to opposeyour cunning.

1442
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.600
You're meek andhumble-mouth'd;

1443
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.030
You sign your place andcalling,

1444
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.970
in full seeming,

1445
01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:39.030
With meekness andhumility;

1446
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:41.770
but your heart is cramm'dwith arrogancy,

1447
01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.430
spleen, and pride.

1448
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:46.630
You have, by fortune andhis highness' favours,

1449
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:49.170
Gone slightly o'er lowsteps and now are mounted

1450
01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:52.100
Where powers are yourretainers, and your words,

1451
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.170
Domestics to you, serveyour will as't please

1452
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.670
Yourself pronounce theiroffice.

1453
01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:00.400
I must warn you, You tendermore your person's honour

1454
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.300
than your high professionspiritual:

1455
01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:07.800
that again I do refuse youfor my judge;

1456
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.400
and here, Before you all,

1457
01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.770
appeal unto the pope,

1458
01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:16.000
To bring my whole cause'fore his holiness,

1459
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.500
And to be judged by him.

1460
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.230
The queen is obstinate,

1461
01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:25.230
Stubborn to justice, aptto accuse it,

1462
01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:26.930
and disdainful to be triedby't: '

1463
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:28.170
tis not well.

1464
01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:32.630
She's going away.

1465
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:34.000
Call her again.

1466
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.330
Katharine Queen of England,come into the court.

1467
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:39.900
Madam, you are call'dback.

1468
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:42.030
What need you note it?pray you, keep your way:

1469
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.070
When you are call'd,return.

1470
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:45.100
Now, the Lord help,

1471
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.430
They vex me past mypatience!

1472
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:50.170
Pray you, pass on:

1473
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:52.070
I will not tarry; no,

1474
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:54.100
nor ever more upon thisbusiness

1475
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.370
my appearance make in anyof their courts.

1476
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:03.770
Go thy ways, Kate:

1477
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:06.870
That man i' the world

1478
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.870
who shall report he has abetter wife,

1479
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.600
let him in nought betrusted,

1480
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.100
For speaking false inthat:

1481
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:18.100
thou art, alone, if thyrare qualities,

1482
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.670
sweet gentleness,

1483
01:11:19.670 --> 01:11:22.700
Thy meekness saint-like,wife-like government,

1484
01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:24.700
Obeying in commanding, andthy parts

1485
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.200
Sovereign and pious else,could speak thee out,

1486
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:37.330
The queen of earthlyqueens: she's noble born;

1487
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.570
And, like her truenobility,

1488
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:41.170
she has carried herselftowards me.

1489
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:46.800
Most gracious sir,

1490
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.000
In humblest manner Irequire your highness,

1491
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:50.500
That it shall please youto declare,

1492
01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.730
in hearing of all theseears,

1493
01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.700
--for where I am robb'dand bound,

1494
01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.000
There must I be unloosed,

1495
01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.170
although not there at onceand fully satisfied,

1496
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:00.630
--whether ever I didbroach

1497
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:01.870
this business to yourhighness;

1498
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.730
or laid any scruple inyour way,

1499
01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.700
which might induce you tothe question on't?

1500
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.070
or ever have to you,

1501
01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.630
but with thanks to God

1502
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:10.470
for such a royal lady,

1503
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:12.570
spake one the least word

1504
01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:13.700
that might be to theprejudice

1505
01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:14.630
of her present state,

1506
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:16.430
Or touch of her goodperson?

1507
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:18.130
My lord cardinal, I doexcuse you;

1508
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:20.470
yea, upon mine honour, Ifree you from't.

1509
01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:22.170
You are not to be taught

1510
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.330
That you have manyenemies,

1511
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:24.430
that know not why they areso,

1512
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:25.870
but, like to village-curs,

1513
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:27.370
Bark when their fellowsdo:

1514
01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:29.230
by some of these the queenis put in anger.

1515
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:31.370
You're excused:

1516
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:35.630
But will you be morejustified?

1517
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:37.530
You ever have wish'd thesleeping of this business;

1518
01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.930
never desired it to bestirr'd;

1519
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:40.770
but oft have hinder'd,oft,

1520
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:43.870
The passages made towardit:

1521
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:44.830
on my honour,

1522
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:46.570
I speak my good lordcardinal to this point,

1523
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.230
And thus far clear him.

1524
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:55.000
Now, what moved me to't,

1525
01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:01.300
I will be bold with timeand your attention:

1526
01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.570
Then mark the inducement.

1527
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.800
Thus it came; give heedto't:

1528
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.570
My conscience firstreceived a tenderness,

1529
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:13.930
Scruple, and prick,

1530
01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:15.130
on certain speechesutter'd

1531
01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:16.600
by the Bishop of Bayonne,

1532
01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.970
then French ambassador;

1533
01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:20.700
Who had been hither senton the debating

1534
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.830
A marriage 'twixt the Dukeof Orleans

1535
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:27.430
and our daughter Mary:

1536
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:30.300
i' the progress of thisbusiness,

1537
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.500
Ere a determinateresolution,

1538
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:38.100
he, I mean the bishop, didrequire a respite;

1539
01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.770
Wherein he might the kinghis lord advertise

1540
01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:46.400
Whether our daughter werelegitimate,

1541
01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.200
Respecting this ourmarriage with the dowager,

1542
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.200
Sometimes our brother'swife.

1543
01:13:55.730 --> 01:14:00.930
This respite shook thebosom of my conscience,

1544
01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:04.000
enter'd me, Yea, with asplitting power,

1545
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.600
and made to tremble theregion of my breast;

1546
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.670
which forced such way,

1547
01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:10.200
That many mazedconsiderings did throng

1548
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.770
And press'd in with thiscaution.

1549
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:14.300
First, methought I stoodnot

1550
01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.700
in the smile of heaven;

1551
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.200
who had commanded nature,that my lady's womb,

1552
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.170
If it conceived a malechild by me,

1553
01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.900
should do no more officesof life to't

1554
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.170
than the grave does to thedead;

1555
01:14:28.170 --> 01:14:30.700
for her male issue or diedwhere they were made,

1556
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.230
or shortly after thisworld had air'd them:

1557
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.770
hence I took a thought,

1558
01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:40.930
This was a judgment on me;

1559
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.130
that my kingdom,

1560
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:47.270
Well worthy the best heiro' the world,

1561
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:51.270
should not be gladded in'tby me:

1562
01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:54.730
then follows, that Iweigh'd the danger

1563
01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:59.470
which my realms stood inby this my issue's fail;

1564
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:04.330
and that gave to me many agroaning throe.

1565
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:11.330
Thus hulling in the wildsea of my conscience,

1566
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:13.630
I did steer toward thisremedy,

1567
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:16.100
whereupon we are nowpresent here together:

1568
01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.630
that's to say, I meant torectify my conscience,

1569
01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:21.030
--which I then did feelfull sick,

1570
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:22.130
and yet not well,--

1571
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:24.070
By all the reverendfathers of the land

1572
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:26.070
And doctors learn'd:

1573
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.070
first I began in private

1574
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:31.170
With you, my Lord ofLincoln;

1575
01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:33.470
you remember how under myoppression I did reek,

1576
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:34.670
When I first moved you.

1577
01:15:34.670 --> 01:15:36.530
Very well, my liege.

1578
01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.030
I have spoke long:

1579
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:39.200
be pleased yourself to say

1580
01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.700
How far you satisfied me.

1581
01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:41.970
So please your highness,

1582
01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.530
The question did at firstso stagger me,

1583
01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:46.530
Bearing a state of mightymoment in't

1584
01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.300
And consequence of dread,

1585
01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:50.200
that I committed thedaring'st counsel

1586
01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:51.930
which I had to doubt;

1587
01:15:51.930 --> 01:15:53.130
And did entreat yourhighness

1588
01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:56.430
to this course which youare running here.

1589
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.700
I then moved you,

1590
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.630
My Lord of Canterbury;

1591
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:04.400
and got your leave to makethis present summons:

1592
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.470
unsolicited I left noreverend person

1593
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.300
in this court;

1594
01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.930
But by particular consent

1595
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.770
proceeded under your handsand seals:

1596
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:16.170
therefore, go on:

1597
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.570
For no dislike i' theworld

1598
01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:20.070
against the person of thegood queen,

1599
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:24.530
but the sharp thorny pointsof my alleged reasons,

1600
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.500
drive this forward:

1601
01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:31.900
Prove but our marriagelawful,

1709
01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:50.170
In such a point of weight,so near mine honour,

1710
01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:53.500
More near my life, I fear,

1711
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:54.430
with my weak wit,

1712
01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.100
And to such men of gravityand learning,

1713
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:57.800
In truth, I know not.

1714
01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.370

1715
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:00.730

Alas, I am a woman,friendless, hopeless!

1722
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:23.400
Madam, you wrong the king'slove with these fears:

1723

01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:31.630
But little for my profit:

1726
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:32.630

1727

1728
01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:38.570

Though he be grown sodesperate to be honest,

1730
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:44.900

1731
01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:49.330
Nay, forsooth, my friends,

1732
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:51.230
They that must weigh outmy afflictions,

1733
01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:54.930
They that my trust mustgrow to, live not here:

1734

1739
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.600

Take heed, for heaven'ssake, take heed,

1763
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.830
lest at once the burthenof my sorrows

1764

fall upon ye.

1765
01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.030
Madam, this is a meredistraction;

1766
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:10.100
You turn the good we offerinto envy.

1767
01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.130

01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:16.630

1770

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:22.930
If ye be any thing butchurchmen's habits

1772
01:25:22.930 --> 01:25:29.470
Put my sick cause into hishands that hates me?

1773
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:32.500
Alas, has banish'd me hisbed already,

1774
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.230
His love, too long ago!

1775
01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:38.900
I am old, my lords,

1776
01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.800
And all the fellowship Ihold now with him

1777
01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.730
Is only my obedience.

1778
01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:47.570
What can happen to meabove this wretchedness?

1779
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:51.270
all your studies make me acurse like this.

1780
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:52.530
Your fears are worse.

1781
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:55.800
Have I lived thuslong--let me speak myself,

1782
01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.570
Since virtue finds nofriends--a wife, a true one?

1783
01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:01.730
A woman, I dare saywithout vain-glory,

1784
01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:04.000
Never yet branded withsuspicion?

1785
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.030
Have I with all my fullaffections

1786
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:07.730
Still met the king?

1787
01:26:07.730 --> 01:26:10.100
loved him next heaven?obey'd him?

1788
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.630
Been, out of fondness,superstitious to him?

1789
01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:14.870
Almost forgot my prayersto content him?

1790
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.670
And am I thus rewarded?

1791
01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:20.070
'tis not well, lords.

1792
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:22.170
Bring me a constant womanto her husband,

1793
01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:25.770
One that ne'er dream'd ajoy beyond his pleasure;

1794
01:26:25.770 --> 01:26:27.800
And to that woman, whenshe has done most,

1795
01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.270
Yet will I add an honour,a great patience.

1796
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:33.530
Madam, you wander from thegood we aim at.

1797
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:38.930
My lord, I dare not makemyself so guilty,

1798
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:41.070
To give up willingly thatnoble title

1799
01:26:41.070 --> 01:26:43.900
Your master wed me to:

1800
01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:47.030
nothing but death shalle'er divorce my dignities.

1801
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:48.030
Pray, hear me.

1802
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:50.900
Would I had never trodthis English earth,

1803
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.570
Or felt the flatteriesthat grow upon it!

1804
01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:59.200
Ye have angels' faces, butheaven knows your hearts.

1805
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:04.500
What will become of menow, wretched lady!

1806
01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:09.870
I am the most unhappywoman living.

1807
01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:14.430
Alas, poor wenches, whereare now your fortunes!

1808
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:19.300
Shipwreck'd upon akingdom,

1809
01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:24.000
where no pity, no friend,no hope;

1810
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.170
no kindred weep for me;

1811
01:27:27.170 --> 01:27:30.000
Almost no grave allow'dme:

1812
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.730
like the lily, that oncewas mistress of the field

1813
01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:35.630
and flourish'd,

1814
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:38.300
I'll hang my head andperish.

1815
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:46.070
If your grace could but bebrought to know

1816
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:48.170
our ends are honest,

1817
01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:51.100
You'ld feel more comfort:

1818
01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.400
why should we, good lady,

1819
01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:55.070
Upon what cause, wrongyou?

1820
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:56.200
alas, our places,

1821
01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.770
The way of our professionis against it:

1822
01:27:58.770 --> 01:28:03.600
We are to cure suchsorrows, not to sow 'em.

1823
01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.430
For goodness' sake,consider what you do;

1824
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:08.400
How you may hurt yourself,

1825
01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:10.870
ay, utterly grow from theking's acquaintance,

1826
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:12.830
by this carriage.

1827
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:15.100
The hearts of princes kissobedience,

1828
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.800
So much they love it;

1829
01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.230
but to stubborn spiritsthey swell, and grow

1830
01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:22.500
as terrible as storms.

1831
01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.530
I know you have a gentle,noble temper,

1832
01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:28.400
A soul as even as a calm:

1833
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.030
pray, think us those weprofess,

1834
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:34.930
peace-makers, friends, andservants.

1835
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:38.070
Madam, you'll find it so.

1836
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:39.230
You wrong your virtues

1837
01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:41.400
With these weak women'sfears:

1838
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.030
a noble spirit, as yourswas put into you,

1839
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:47.530
ever casts such doubts, asfalse coin, from it.

1840
01:28:47.530 --> 01:28:49.600
The king loves you;

1841
01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.230
Beware you lose it not:for us,

1842
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:54.400
if you please to trust usin your business,

1843
01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.300
we are ready to use ourutmost studies

1844
01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.500
in your service.

1845
01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.170
Do what ye will, my lords:

1846
01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.070
and, pray, forgive me,

1847
01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:06.800
If I have used myselfunmannerly;

1848
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.230
You know I am a woman,

1849
01:29:08.230 --> 01:29:13.500
lacking wit to make a seemlyanswer to such persons.

1850
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:17.030
Pray, do my service to hismajesty:

1851
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:20.000
He has my heart yet;

1852
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.400
and shall have my prayerswhile I shall have my life.

1853
01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:25.670
Come, reverend fathers,

1854
01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:28.500
Bestow your counsels onme:

1855
01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.400
she now begs, that littlethought,

1856
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.970
when she set footing here,

1857
01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:36.300
She should have bought herdignities so dear.

1858
01:29:46.730 --> 01:29:48.170
If you will now unite inyour complaints,

1859
01:29:48.170 --> 01:29:49.530
And force them with aconstancy,

1860
01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.070
the cardinal cannot standunder them:

1861
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:53.800
if you omit the offer ofthis time,

1862
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.800
I cannot promise

1863
01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.400
But that you shall sustainmoe new disgraces,

1864
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.600
With these you bearalready.

1865
01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.970
I am joyful to meet theleast occasion

1866
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:59.900
that may give me

1867
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:01.070
Remembrance of myfather-in-law, the duke,

1868
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:02.170
To be revenged on him.

1869
01:30:02.170 --> 01:30:04.370
Which of the peers haveuncontemn'd gone by him,

1870
01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:06.930
or at least strangelyneglected?

1871
01:30:06.930 --> 01:30:08.600
when did he regard thestamp of nobleness

1872
01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:09.970
in any person out ofhimself?

1873
01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:12.170
My lords, you speak yourpleasures:

1874
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.900
What he deserves of youand me I know;

1875
01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:16.100
What we can do to him,

1876
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.370
though now the time givesway to us, I much fear.

1877
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:21.500
If you cannot bar hisaccess to the king,

1878
01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.930
never attempt any thing onhim;

1879
01:30:22.930 --> 01:30:24.800
for he hath a witchcraft

1880
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.830
Over the king in's tongue.

1881
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:28.630
O, fear him not;

1882
01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:30.500
His spell in that is out:

1883
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.070
the king hath found matteragainst him

1884
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:34.930
that for ever mars thehoney of his language.

1885
01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.530
No, he's settled,

1886
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:38.100
Not to come off, in hisdispleasure.

1887
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:39.870
Sir, I should be glad tohear such news as this

1888
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:40.930
Once every hour.

1889
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:43.170
Believe it, this is true:

1890
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:45.100
In the divorce hiscontrary proceedings

1891
01:30:45.100 --> 01:30:46.370
Are all unfolded

1892
01:30:46.370 --> 01:30:49.370
wherein he appears as Iwould wish mine enemy.

1893
01:30:49.370 --> 01:30:50.730
How came his practises tolight?

1894
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.200
Most strangely.

1895
01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.300
O, how, how?

1896
01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.470
The cardinal's letters tothe pope miscarried,

1897
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:57.600
And came to the eye o' theking: wherein was read,

1898
01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:59.830
How that the cardinal didentreat his holiness

1899
01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:02.100
To stay the judgment o'the divorce;

1900
01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:04.000
for if it did take place,'I do,' quoth he,

1901
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.630
'perceive my king istangled in affection

1902
01:31:06.630 --> 01:31:09.770
to a creature of thequeen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'

1903
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:10.700
Has the king this?

1904
01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:11.570
Believe it.

1905
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:12.530
Will this work?

1906
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:14.030
The king in this perceiveshim,

1907
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:16.430
how he coasts and hedgeshis own way.

1908
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:18.400
But in this point all histricks founder,

1909
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.600
and he brings his physic

1910
01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:21.630
After his patient's death:

1911
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.330
the king already hathmarried the fair lady.

1912
01:31:24.330 --> 01:31:25.430
Would he had!

1913
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:26.800
May you be happy in yourwish, my lord

1914
01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:28.830
For, I profess, youhave it.

1915
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:31.370
Now, all my joy trace theconjunction!

1916
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:32.400
My amen to't!

1917
01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:33.770
All men's!

1918
01:31:33.770 --> 01:31:35.570
There's order given forher coronation:

1919
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:37.270
Marry, this is yet butyoung,

1920
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:39.230
and may be left to someears unrecounted.

1921
01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:40.230
But, will the king

1922
01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:42.270
Digest this letter of thecardinal's?

1923
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.430
The Lord forbid!

1924
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:44.330
Marry, amen!

1925
01:31:44.330 --> 01:31:46.800
No, no; there be moe wasps

1926
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.270
that buzz about his nose

1927
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:51.100
Will make this sting thesooner.

1928
01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:55.700
Cardinal Campeius isstol'n away to Rome;

1929
01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.330
hath ta'en no leave;

1930
01:31:57.330 --> 01:31:59.130
Has left the cause o' theking unhandled;

1931
01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:02.330
and is posted, as theagent of our cardinal,

1932
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:05.530
To second all his plot.

1933
01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:08.600
I do assure you the kingcried Ha! at this.

1934
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.670
Now, God incense him,

1935
01:32:09.670 --> 01:32:12.300
And let him cry Ha!louder!

1936
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:15.670
But, my lord, when returnsCranmer?

1937
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:17.300
He is return'd in hisopinions;

1938
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.330
which have satisfied theking for his divorce,

1939
01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:21.100
Together with all famouscolleges

1940
01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.100
Almost in Christendom:

1941
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.070
shortly, I believe,

1942
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:25.500
His second marriage shallbe publish'd,

1943
01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:27.430
and her coronation.

1944
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:29.730
Katharine no more shall becall'd queen,

1945
01:32:29.730 --> 01:32:33.470
but princess dowager andwidow to Prince Arthur.

1946
01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:35.700
This same Cranmer's

1947
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:38.570
A worthy fellow, and hathta'en much pain

1948
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:40.070
In the king's business.

1949
01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:42.900
The packet, Cromwell.Gave't you the king?

1950
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.000
To his own hand, in'sbedchamber.

1951
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.970
Look'd he o' the inside ofthe paper?

1952
01:32:46.970 --> 01:32:48.870
Presently he did unsealthem:

1953
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:50.230
and the first he view'd,

1954
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:52.200
He did it with a seriousmind;

1955
01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.400
a heed was in hiscountenance.

1956
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:56.700
You he bade attend himhere this morning.

1957
01:32:56.700 --> 01:32:58.430
Is he ready to comeabroad?

1958
01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:00.970
I think, by this he is.

1959
01:33:00.970 --> 01:33:02.270
Leave me awhile.

1960
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:08.070
It shall be to the Duchessof Alencon,

1961
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:11.570
The French king's sister:he shall marry her.

1962
01:33:11.570 --> 01:33:16.200
Anne Bullen! No; I'll noAnne Bullens for him:

1963
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:19.970
There's more in't thanfair visage.

1964
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:25.330
Bullen! No, we'll noBullens.

1965
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:27.600
Speedily I wish to hearfrom Rome.

1966
01:33:30.170 --> 01:33:32.930
The Marchioness ofPembroke!

1967
01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:38.830
He's discontented.

1968
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:39.800
May be, he hears the king

1969
01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:41.270
does whet his anger tohim.

1970
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:43.730
Sharp enough, Lord, forthy justice!

1971
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:46.070
The late queen'sgentlewoman,

1972
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:47.330
a knight's daughter,

1973
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:50.100
To be her mistress'mistress! the queen's queen!

1974
01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:52.470
This candle burns notclear:

1975
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:56.400
'tis I must snuff it;

1976
01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:58.070
Then out it goes.

1977
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:01.470
What though I know hervirtuous and well deserving?

1978
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:04.100
yet I know her for aspleeny Lutheran;

1979
01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.330
and not wholesome to ourcause,

1980
01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:07.870
that she should lie i' thebosom of our

1981
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:10.370
hard-ruled king.

1982
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.530
Again, there is sprung upan heretic,

1983
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:18.970
an arch one, Cranmer;

1984
01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:22.470
one hath crawl'd into thefavour of the king,

1985
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:24.200
And is his oracle.

1986
01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:26.170
He is vex'd at something.

1987
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:27.970
I would 'twere somethingthat would fret the string,

1988
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:30.370
The master-cord on'sheart!

1989
01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:31.670
The king, the king!

1990
01:34:31.670 --> 01:34:33.770
What piles of wealth hathhe accumulated

1991
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:35.170
To his own portion!

1992
01:34:35.170 --> 01:34:36.500
and what expense by thehour

1993
01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:38.130
seems to flow from him!

1994
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:39.070
How, i' the name ofthrift,

1995
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:40.800
Does he rake thistogether!

1996
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.070
Now, my lords, saw you thecardinal?

1997
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:46.170
My lord, we have stoodhere observing him:

1998
01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:48.470
some strange commotion isin his brain:

1999
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:49.830
he bites his lip, andstarts;

2000
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:51.870
Stops on a sudden, looksupon the ground,

2001
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:53.570
Then lays his finger onhis temple,

2002
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:55.430
straight springs out intofast gait;

2003
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:56.930
then stops again,

2004
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.600
Strikes his breast hard,

2005
01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.370
and anon he casts his eyeagainst the moon:

2006
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:04.130
in most strange postures wehave seen him set himself.

2007
01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:04.930
It may well be;

2008
01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:07.230
There is a mutiny in'smind.

2009
01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:09.770
This morning papers ofstate he sent me to peruse,

2010
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:11.070
As I required:

2011
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:12.430
and wot you what I foundthere,

2012
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:14.430
on my conscience, putunwittingly?

2013
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:16.330
Forsooth, an inventory,thus importing;

2014
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:18.400
The several parcels of hisplate, his treasure,

2015
01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.930
Rich stuffs, and ornamentsof household;

2016
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:22.770
which I find at such proudrate,

2017
01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:25.170
that it out-speakspossession of a subject.

2018
01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:26.130
It's heaven's will:

2019
01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:27.800
Some spirit put this paperin the packet,

2020
01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.470
To bless your eye withal.

2021
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:30.770
If we did think hiscontemplation

2022
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:31.600
were above the earth,

2023
01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.570
And fix'd on spiritualobject,

2024
01:35:33.570 --> 01:35:36.730
he should still dwell inhis musings:

2025
01:35:36.730 --> 01:35:39.730
but I am afraid his thinkingsare below the moon,

2026
01:35:39.730 --> 01:35:42.030
not worth his seriousconsidering.

2027
01:35:55.670 --> 01:35:56.730
Heaven forgive me!

2028
01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:58.730
Ever God bless yourhighness!

2029
01:35:58.730 --> 01:35:59.470
Good my lord,

2030
01:35:59.470 --> 01:36:00.770
You are full of heavenlystuff,

2031
01:36:00.770 --> 01:36:02.330
and bear the inventory ofyour best graces

2032
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:03.300
in your mind;

2033
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.130
the which you were nowrunning o'er:

2034
01:36:05.130 --> 01:36:06.030
you have scarce time

2035
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:08.000
To steal from spiritualleisure

2036
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.530
a brief span to keep yourearthly audit:

2037
01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:13.470
sure, in that I deem youan ill husband,

2038
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:15.900
and am glad to have youtherein my companion.

2039
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.100
Sir,For holy offices Ihave a time;

2040
01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.770
a time to think upon thepart of business

2041
01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:21.170
which I bear i' the state;

2042
01:36:21.170 --> 01:36:24.370
and nature does requireher times of preservation,

2043
01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:26.430
which perforce I, herfrail son,

2044
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:27.770
amongst my brethrenmortal,

2045
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:29.500
Must give my tendence to.

2046
01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.500
You have said well.

2047
01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.600
And ever may your highnessyoke together,

2048
01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:34.930
As I will lend you cause,

2049

2050
01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:38.630
'Tis well said again;

2051
01:36:38.630 --> 01:36:41.770
And 'tis a kind of gooddeed to say well:

2052
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:45.700
And yet words are nodeeds.

2053
01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:49.630
My father loved you:

2054
01:36:49.630 --> 01:36:50.930
His said he did;

2055
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:54.670
and with his deed didcrown his word upon you.

2056
01:36:54.670 --> 01:36:55.970
Since I had my office,

2057
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:58.270
I have kept you next myheart;

2058
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:59.500
have not alone employ'dyou

2059
01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:01.630
where high profits mightcome home,

2060
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.730
But pared my presenthavings,

2061
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:06.630
to bestow my bounties uponyou.

2062
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:09.570
Have I not made you, theprime man of the state?

2063
01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.870
I pray you, tell me,

2064
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:13.230
If what I now pronounceyou have found true:

2065
01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:14.870
And, if you may confessit, say withal,

2066
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:17.770
If you are bound to us orno.

2067
01:37:17.770 --> 01:37:19.270
What say you?

2068
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:22.370
My sovereign, I confessyour royal graces,

2069
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:24.470
Shower'd on me daily, havebeen more

2070
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:27.400
than could my studiedpurposes requite;

2071
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.030
which went beyond allman's endeavours:

2072
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:31.830
my endeavours have evercome too short

2073
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:33.070
of my desires,

2074
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:35.070
Yet filed with myabilities:

2075
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:37.630
mine own ends have beenmine

2076
01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:39.130
so that evermore theypointed

2077
01:37:39.130 --> 01:37:41.270
To the good of your mostsacred person

2078
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:42.970
and the profit of thestate.

2079
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.530
For your great gracesheap'd upon me,

2080
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:48.570
poor undeserver, I cannothing

2081
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:50.300
render but allegiantthanks,

2082
01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.900
My prayers to heaven foryou, my loyalty,

2083
01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:56.100
Which ever has and evershall be growing,

2084
01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:00.270
Till death, that winter,kill it.

2085
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:01.730
Fairly answer'd;

2086
01:38:01.730 --> 01:38:03.800
A loyal and obedientsubject

2087
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.100
is therein illustrated:

2088
01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:09.430
the honour of it does paythe act of it;

2089
01:38:09.430 --> 01:38:10.900
as, i' the contrary,

2090
01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:14.000
The foulness is thepunishment.

2091
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.130
I presume that,

2092
01:38:17.130 --> 01:38:19.330
as my hand has open'dbounty to you,

2093
01:38:19.330 --> 01:38:20.500
My heart dropp'd love,

2094
01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:21.930
my power rain'd honour,

2095
01:38:21.930 --> 01:38:24.130
more on you than any;

2096
01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:25.370
so your hand and heart,

2097
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:28.170
Your brain, and everyfunction of your power,

2098
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:31.700
Should, notwithstandingthat your bond of duty,

2099
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.670
As 'twere in love'sparticular,

2100
01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:36.430
be more to me, yourfriend, than any.

2101
01:38:37.770 --> 01:38:38.730
I do profess

2102
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:40.170
That for your highness'good I ever labour'd

2103
01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:42.330
More than mine own;

2104
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:43.630
that am, have, and will be

2105
01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.030
Though all the worldshould crack

2106
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:46.000
their duty to you,

2107
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
And throw it from theirsoul;

2108
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.100
though perils did abound,

2109
01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:50.400
as thick as thought couldmake 'em,

2110
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:51.970
and appear in forms morehorrid,

2111
01:38:51.970 --> 01:38:57.130
yet my duty, as doth a rockagainst the chiding flood,

2112
01:38:57.130 --> 01:38:59.800
Should the approach ofthis wild river break,

2113
01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.430
And stand unshaken yours.

2114
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:04.330
'Tis nobly spoken:

2115
01:39:04.330 --> 01:39:07.230
Take notice, lords, he hasa loyal breast,

2116
01:39:07.230 --> 01:39:09.700
For you have seen himopen't.

2117
01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.770
Read o'er this; and after,this:

2118
01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:15.830
and then to breakfast

2119
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:18.570
with what appetite youhave.

2120
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:29.830
What should this mean?

2121
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:34.330
What sudden anger's this?how have I reap'd it?

2122
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.200
He parted frowning fromme,

2123
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.200
as if ruin leap'd from hiseyes:

2124
01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.570
so looks the chafed lionupon the daring huntsman

2125
01:39:43.570 --> 01:39:45.930
that has gall'd him;

2126
01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:48.170
Then makes him nothing.

2127
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:52.470
I must read this paper;

2128
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:54.400
I fear, the story of hisanger.

2129
01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:03.230
'Tis so; This paper hasundone me:

2130
01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.670
'tis the account of allthat world of wealth

2131
01:40:05.670 --> 01:40:07.900
I have drawn together formine own ends;

2132
01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:10.100
indeed, to gain thepopedom,

2133
01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:12.330
And fee my friends inRome.

2134
01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.630
O negligence!

2135
01:40:14.630 --> 01:40:17.470
Fit for a fool to fall by:

2136
01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:20.270
what cross devil made meput this main secret

2137
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:21.700
in the packet I sent theking?

2138
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.830
Is there no way to curethis?

2139
01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:26.470
No new device to beat thisfrom his brains?

2140
01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:30.370
I know 'twill stir himstrongly;

2141
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:36.070
yet I know a way, if it takeright, in spite of fortune

2142
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:37.330
Will bring me off again.

2143
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:41.670
What's this? 'To thePope!'

2144
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:57.470
The letter, as I live,

2145
01:40:57.470 --> 01:41:01.700
with all the business Iwrit to's holiness.

2146
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:08.430
Nay then, farewell!

2147
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.630
I have touch'd the highestpoint of all my greatness;

2148
01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:18.430
And, from that fullmeridian of my glory,

2149
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.000
I haste now to mysetting:

2150
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.500
I shall fall like a brightexhalation

2151
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:35.830
in the evening,

2152
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:40.230
And no man see me more.

2153
01:41:53.370 --> 01:41:55.630
Hear the king's pleasure,cardinal:

2154
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.670
who commands you to renderup the great seal

2155
01:41:57.670 --> 01:41:59.770
presently into our hands;

2156
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:01.970
and to confine yourself toAsher House,

2157
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:03.370
my Lord of Winchester's,

2158
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:06.000
Till you hear further fromhis highness.

2159
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.200
Stay:

2160
01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.630
Where's your commission,lords?

2161
01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.400
words cannot carryauthority so weighty.

2162
01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:19.730
Who dare cross 'em,

2163
01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:22.900
Bearing the king's willfrom his mouth expressly?

2164
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:26.570
Till I find more than willor words to do it,

2165
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:30.130
I mean your malice, know,officious lords,

2166
01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.770
I dare and must deny it.

2167
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.270
Now I feel of what coarsemetal ye are moulded,

2168
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:40.100
envy:

2169
01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:41.930
How eagerly ye follow mydisgraces,

2170
01:42:41.930 --> 01:42:43.730
As if it fed ye!

2171
01:42:43.730 --> 01:42:45.230
and how sleek and wanton

2172
01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:48.200
Ye appear in every thingmay bring my ruin!

2173
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:52.670
Follow your enviouscourses, men of malice;

2174
01:42:52.670 --> 01:42:54.670
You have Christian warrantfor 'em,

2175
01:42:54.670 --> 01:42:55.730
and, no doubt, in time

2176
01:42:55.730 --> 01:42:58.100
will find their fitrewards.

2177
01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.230
That seal, you ask withsuch a violence,

2178
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:03.930
the king, mine and yourmaster,

2179
01:43:03.930 --> 01:43:05.870
with his own hand gave me;

2180
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:09.070
Bade me enjoy it, with theplace and honours,

2181
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:13.000
During my life; and, toconfirm his goodness,

2182
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.900
Tied it by letters-patents:now, who'll take it?

2183
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:19.430
The king, that gave it.

2184
01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.130
It must be himself, then.

2185
01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:25.400
Thou art a proud traitor,priest.

2186
01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.970
Proud lord, thou liest:

2187
01:43:26.970 --> 01:43:28.070
Within these forty hours

2188
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:29.300
Surrey durst better

2189
01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:31.330
Have burnt that tonguethan said so.

2190
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:34.470
Thy ambition, thou scarletsin,

2191
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:36.730
robb'd this bewailing landof noble Buckingham,

2192
01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:38.530
my father-in-law:

2193
01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:39.700
The heads of all thybrother cardinals,

2194
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.370
With thee and all thy bestparts bound together,

2195
01:43:41.370 --> 01:43:43.000
Weigh'd not a hair of his.

2196
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.630
Plague of your policy!

2197
01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:46.800
You sent me deputy forIreland;

2198
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.370
Far from his succor, fromthe king,

2199
01:43:48.370 --> 01:43:49.400
from all that might havemercy

2200
01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.830
on the fault thou gavesthim;

2201
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:52.570
Whilst your great goodness,out of holy pity,

2202
01:43:52.570 --> 01:43:54.230
Absolved him with an axe.

2203
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.070
This, and all else thistalking lord

2204
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:57.370
can lay upon my credit,

2205
01:43:57.370 --> 01:43:59.000
I answer is most false.

2206
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.300
The duke by law found hisdeserts:

2207
01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.300
how innocent I was

2208
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.270
From any private malice inhis end,

2209
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:07.270
His noble jury and foulcause can witness.

2210
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:08.870
If I loved many words,lord,

2211
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:09.770
I should tell you

2212
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:11.930
You have as little honestyas honour,

2213
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:13.230
Your long coat, priest,protects you;

2214
01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:14.300
thou shouldst feel mysword

2215
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.330
i' the life-blood of theeelse.

2216
01:44:16.330 --> 01:44:17.200
My lords,

2217
01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.330
Can ye endure to hear thisarrogance?

2218
01:44:18.330 --> 01:44:19.370
And from this fellow?

2219
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:20.530
if we live thus tamely,

2220
01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:22.230
To be thus jaded by apiece of scarlet,

2221
01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:24.600
Farewell nobility; let hisgrace go forward,

2222
01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:26.730
And dare us with his caplike larks.

2223
01:44:26.730 --> 01:44:29.100
All goodness is poison tothy stomach.

2224
01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:30.300
Yes, that goodness ofgleaning

2225
01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.300
all the land's wealth intoone

2226
01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:32.170
Into your own hands,

2227
01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:33.430
cardinal, by extortion;

2228
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:34.730
The goodness of yourintercepted packets

2229
01:44:34.730 --> 01:44:37.300
You writ to the popeagainst the king:

2230
01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.070
your goodness, since youprovoke me,

2231
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:41.470
shall be most notorious.

2232
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:43.800
My Lord of Norfolk, as youare truly noble,

2233
01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:45.370
As you respect the commongood,

2234
01:44:45.370 --> 01:44:47.300
the state of our despisednobility,

2235
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.830
our issues, who, if helive,

2236
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:51.370
will scarce be gentlemen,

2237
01:44:51.370 --> 01:44:53.430
Produce the grand sum ofhis sins,

2238
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:56.000
the articles collectedfrom his life.

2239
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.400
I'll startle you worsethan the scaring bell,

2240
01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.730
when the brown wench laykissing in your arms,

2241
01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:02.230
lord cardinal.

2242
01:45:02.230 --> 01:45:04.170
How much, methinks, Icould despise this man,

2243
01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:06.770
But that I am bound incharity against it!

2244
01:45:06.770 --> 01:45:09.730
Those articles, my lord,are in the king's hand:

2245
01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:12.630
But, thus much, they arefoul ones.

2246
01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:16.400
So much fairer andspotless

2247
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.170
shall mine innocencearise,

2248
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:19.870
When the king knows mytruth.

2249
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:20.970
This cannot save you:

2250
01:45:20.970 --> 01:45:21.830
I thank my memory,

2251
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:23.430
I yet remember some ofthese articles;

2252
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:24.700
and out they shall.

2253
01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:26.670
Now, if you can blush andcry 'guilty,' cardinal,

2254
01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:28.330
You'll show a littlehonesty.

2255
01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:29.100
Speak on, sir;

2256
01:45:29.100 --> 01:45:30.370
I dare your worstobjections:

2257
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:31.230
if I blush,

2258
01:45:31.230 --> 01:45:33.100
It is to see a noblemanwant manners.

2259
01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:35.330
I had rather want thosethan my head.

2260
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:36.430
Have at you!

2261
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:38.900
First, that, without theking's assent or knowledge,

2262
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.430
You wrought to be alegate;

2263
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:42.270
by which power you maim'dthe jurisdiction

2264
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:43.830
of all bishops.

2265
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:45.430
Then, that in all you writto Rome,

2266
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:48.430
or else to foreignprinces, 'Ego et Rex meus'

2267
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:50.600
Was still inscribed; inwhich you brought the king

2268
01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.270
To be your servant.

2269
01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:53.900
Then that, without theknowledge

2270
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.400
Either of king or council,

2271
01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:57.030
when you went ambassadorto the emperor,

2272
01:45:57.030 --> 01:45:59.030
you made bold to carryinto Flanders

2273
01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:00.400
the great seal.

2274
01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:01.870
Item, you sent a largecommission

2275
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:03.770
To Gregory de Cassado, toconclude,

2276
01:46:03.770 --> 01:46:05.930
Without the king's will orthe state's allowance,

2277
01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:08.300
A league between hishighness and Ferrara.

2278
01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:09.470
That, out of mereambition,

2279
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:11.300
you have caused your holyhat

2280
01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:13.200
to be stamp'd on theking's coin.

2281
01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.030
Then that you have sentinnumerable substance

2282
01:46:15.030 --> 01:46:17.370
By what means got, I leaveto your own conscience

2283
01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:19.270
To furnish Rome, and toprepare the ways

2284
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:20.300
You have for dignities;

2285
01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.970
to the mere undoing of allthe kingdom.

2286
01:46:23.130 --> 01:46:24.130
Many more there are;

2287
01:46:24.130 --> 01:46:26.070
Which, since they are ofyou, and odious,

2288
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:28.300
I will not taint my mouthwith.

2289
01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:30.870
O my lord, Press not afalling man too far! '

2290
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:32.370
tis virtue:

2291
01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:34.300
His faults lie open to thelaws;

2292
01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:36.500
let them, not you, correcthim.

2293
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:40.930
My heart weeps to see him solittle of his great self.

2294
01:46:40.930 --> 01:46:42.370
I forgive him.

2295
01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:45.170
Lord cardinal, the king'sfurther pleasure is,

2296
01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:47.230
Because all those thingsyou have done of late,

2297
01:46:47.230 --> 01:46:49.470
By your power legatine,within this kingdom,

2298
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:52.200
Fall into the compass of apraemunire,

2299
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.800
That therefore such a writbe sued against you;

2300
01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:58.130
To forfeit all your goods,lands, tenements,

2301
01:46:58.130 --> 01:47:00.700
Chattels, and whatsoever,

2302
01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:04.130
and to be out of theking's protection.

2303
01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:06.200
This is my charge.

2304
01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.200
And so we'll leave you toyour meditations

2305
01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:10.570
How to live better.

2306
01:47:10.570 --> 01:47:11.570
For your stubborn answer

2307
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:13.170
About the giving back thegreat seal to us,

2308
01:47:13.170 --> 01:47:14.700
The king shall know it,

2309
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.930
and, no doubt, shall thankyou.

2310
01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:21.770
So fare you well, mylittle good lord cardinal.

2311
01:47:27.770 --> 01:47:31.500
So farewell to the littlegood you bear me.

2312
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:44.170
Farewell! a long farewell,to all my greatness!

2313
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:49.730
This is the state of man:

2314
01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:54.500
to-day he puts forth thetender leaves of hopes;

2315
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:57.430
to-morrow blossoms,

2316
01:47:57.430 --> 01:48:00.270
And bears his blushinghonours thick upon him;

2317
01:48:01.870 --> 01:48:06.470
The third day comes afrost,

2318
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:09.070
a killing frost,

2319
01:48:09.070 --> 01:48:11.170
And, when he thinks, goodeasy man,

2320
01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:14.600
full surely his greatnessis a-ripening,

2321
01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:20.970
nips his root, and then hefalls, as I do.

2322
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.870
I have ventured, likelittle wanton boys

2323
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:29.270
that swim on bladders,

2324
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:32.730
This many summers in a seaof glory,

2325
01:48:32.730 --> 01:48:35.430
But far beyond my depth:

2326
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:41.070
my high-blown pride atlength broke under me

2327
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:42.900
and now has left me,

2328
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.700
Weary and old withservice,

2329
01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:48.430
to the mercy of a rudestream,

2330
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:52.370
that must for ever hideme.

2331
01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:00.730
Vain pomp and glory ofthis world,

2332
01:49:00.730 --> 01:49:02.470
I hate ye:

2333
01:49:03.930 --> 01:49:07.730
I feel my heart newopen'd.

2334
01:49:07.730 --> 01:49:10.300
O, how wretched is thatpoor man

2335
01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:12.570
that hangs on princes'favours!

2336
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:16.630
There is, betwixt thatsmile we would aspire to,

2337
01:49:16.630 --> 01:49:19.730
That sweet aspect ofprinces,

2338
01:49:19.730 --> 01:49:22.800
and their ruin,

2339
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:27.970
More pangs and fears thanwars or women have:

2340
01:49:27.970 --> 01:49:32.970
And when he falls, hefalls like Lucifer,

2341
01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:35.030
Never to hope again.

2342
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:57.170
Why, how now, Cromwell!

2343
01:49:58.370 --> 01:50:00.000
I have no power to speak,sir.

2344
01:50:01.330 --> 01:50:04.830
What, amazed at mymisfortunes?

2345
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:08.100
can thy spirit wonder agreat man should decline?

2346
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:11.370
Nay, an you weep, I amfall'n indeed.

2347
01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:14.770
How does your grace?

2348
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:17.100
Why, well;

2349
01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:20.930
Never so truly happy, mygood Cromwell.

2350
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:22.930
I know myself now;

2351
01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:25.070
and I feel within me apeace

2352
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:27.700
above all earthlydignities,

2353
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:32.630
A still and quietconscience.

2354
01:50:32.630 --> 01:50:34.500
The king has cured me,

2355
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:36.630
I humbly thank his grace;

2356
01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:37.900
and from these shoulders,

2357
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.800
These ruin'd pillars, outof pity,

2358
01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.130
taken a load would sink anavy,

2359
01:50:43.130 --> 01:50:45.500
too much honour:

2360
01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:48.130
O, 'tis a burthen,Cromwell,

2361
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:49.500
'tis a burthen too heavy

2362
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:51.470
for a man that hopes forheaven!

2363
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:55.530
I am glad your grace hasmade that right use of it.

2364
01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:59.930
I hope I have: I am ablenow, methinks,

2365
01:50:59.930 --> 01:51:02.730
Out of a fortitude of soulI feel,

2366
01:51:02.730 --> 01:51:05.270
To endure more miseriesand greater far

2367
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:08.870
Than my weak-heartedenemies dare offer.

2368
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:12.800
What news abroad?

2369
01:51:14.370 --> 01:51:16.970
The heaviest and the worst

2370
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.900
Is your displeasure withthe king.

2371
01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:21.330
God bless him!

2372
01:51:22.730 --> 01:51:25.830
The next is, that SirThomas More is chosen

2373
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:28.400
Lord chancellor in yourplace.

2374
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:32.870
That's somewhat sudden:

2375
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:35.870
But he's a learned man.

2376
01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:40.130
May he continue long inhis highness' favour,

2377
01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:43.600
and do justice for truth'ssake and his conscience;

2378
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.670
that his bones,

2379
01:51:44.670 --> 01:51:47.800
When he has run his courseand sleeps in blessings,

2380
01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:52.000
May have a tomb oforphans' tears wept on em!

2381
01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:55.570
What more?

2382
01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.000
That Cranmer is return'dwith welcome,

2383
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.770
Install'd lord archbishopof Canterbury.

2384
01:52:01.770 --> 01:52:04.370
That's news indeed.

2385
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:07.500
Last, that the Lady Anne,

2386
01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.730
Whom the king hath insecrecy long married,

2387
01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:13.030
This day was view'd inopen as his queen,

2388
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:14.470
Going to chapel;

2389
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:15.770
and the voice is now

2390
01:52:15.770 --> 01:52:17.900
Only about her coronation.

2391
01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:20.330
There was the weight thatpull'd me down.

2392
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:24.130
O Cromwell, The king hasgone beyond me:

2393
01:52:24.130 --> 01:52:27.770
all my glories in that onewoman

2394
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:29.400
I have lost for ever:

2395
01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:34.070
No sun shall ever usherforth mine honours,

2396
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:36.930
Or gild again the nobletroops that waited

2397
01:52:36.930 --> 01:52:38.630
Upon my smiles.

2398
01:52:43.230 --> 01:52:45.030
Go, get thee from me,Cromwell;

2399
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:47.430
I am a poor fall'n man,

2400
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:50.300
unworthy now to be thylord and master:

2401
01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:51.870
seek the king;

2402
01:52:51.870 --> 01:52:54.730
That sun, I pray, maynever set!

2403
01:52:54.730 --> 01:52:56.900
I have told him what andhow true thou art:

2404
01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.030
he will advance thee;

2405
01:52:58.030 --> 01:52:59.900
Some little memory of mewill stir him

2406
01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:01.870
I know his noble nature

2407
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:04.630
not to let thy hopefulservice perish too:

2408
01:53:04.630 --> 01:53:06.470
good Cromwell, Neglect himnot;

2409
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:07.730
make use now,

2410
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:10.000
and provide for thine ownfuture safety.

2411
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.670
O my lord, must I, then,leave you?

2412
01:53:12.670 --> 01:53:15.200
must I needs forego sogood, so noble

2413
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.630
and so true a master?

2414
01:53:17.630 --> 01:53:20.030
Bear witness, all thathave not hearts of iron,

2415
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:24.230
With what a sorrowCromwell leaves his lord.

2416
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:27.770
The king shall have myservice:

2417
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:29.600
but my prayers for ever

2418
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.770
and for ever shall beyours.

2419
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:36.770
Cromwell, I did not thinkto shed a tear

2420
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:38.300
In all my miseries;

2421
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.170
but thou hast forced me,

2422
01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:44.600
Out of thy honest truth,to play the woman.

2423
01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:49.570
Let's dry our eyes:

2424
01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:52.930
and thus far hear me,Cromwell;

2425
01:53:52.930 --> 01:53:55.530
And, when I am forgotten,as I shall be,

2426
01:53:55.530 --> 01:53:57.630
And sleep in dull coldmarble,

2427
01:53:57.630 --> 01:54:01.500
where no mention of memore must be heard of,

2428
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:05.700
say, I taught thee,

2429
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:12.600
Say, Wolsey, that oncetrod the ways of glory,

2430
01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.200
And sounded all the depthsand shoals of honour,

2431
01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.830
Found thee a way, out ofhis wreck, to rise in;

2432
01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:24.300
A sure and safe one, thoughthy master miss'd it.

2433
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:30.270
Mark but my fall, and thatthat ruin'd me.

2434
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:34.700
Cromwell, I charge thee,fling away ambition:

2435
01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:38.070
By that sin fell theangels; how can man, then,

2436
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:40.700
The image of his Maker,hope to win by it?

2437
01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:45.230
Love thyself last:

2438
01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:48.630
cherish those hearts thathate thee;

2439
01:54:48.630 --> 01:54:52.630
Corruption wins not morethan honesty.

2440
01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.730
Still in thy right handcarry gentle peace,

2441
01:54:56.730 --> 01:54:59.700
To silence envioustongues.

2442
01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:03.170
Be just, and fear not:

2443
01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:08.430
Let all the ends thouaim'st at be thy country's,

2444
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:15.300
Thy God's, and truth's;then if thou fall'st,

2445
01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:20.900
O Cromwell, thou fall'st ablessed martyr!

2446
01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:35.730
Serve the king; And,prithee, lead me in:

2447
01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:38.400
There take an inventory ofall I have,

2448
01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.670
To the last penny; 'tisthe king's:

2449
01:55:41.670 --> 01:55:46.530
my robe, and my integrityto heaven,

2450
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:48.700
is all I dare now callmine own.

2451
01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:03.800
O Cromwell, Cromwell!

2452
01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.300
Had I but served my Godwith half the zeal

2453
01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:10.000
I served my king,

2454
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:11.300
he would not in mine age

2455
01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:14.000
Have left me naked to mineenemies.

2456
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Good sir, have patience.

2457
01:56:18.330 --> 01:56:22.470
So I have. Farewell

2458
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:27.470
The hopes of court! myhopes in heaven do dwell.

2459
01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:43.900
You're well met onceagain.

2460
01:56:43.900 --> 01:56:44.730
So are you.

2461
01:56:44.730 --> 01:56:45.900
You come to take yourstand here,

2462
01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.170
and behold The Lady Anne

2463
01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:48.330
pass from her coronation?

2464
01:56:48.330 --> 01:56:49.400
'Tis all my business.

2465
01:56:50.230 --> 01:56:51.670
At our last encounter,

2466
01:56:51.670 --> 01:56:54.570
The Duke of Buckinghamcame from his trial.

2467
01:56:55.570 --> 01:56:58.170
'Tis very true: but thattime offer'd sorrow;

2468
01:56:58.170 --> 01:56:59.430
This, general joy.

2469
01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:01.730
'Tis well: the citizens, Iam sure,

2470
01:57:01.730 --> 01:57:04.370
have shown at full theirroyal minds

2471
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:07.800
As, let 'em have theirrights, they are ever forward

2472
01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:10.270
In celebration of this daywith shows,

2473
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:12.330
Pageants and sights ofhonour.

2474
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:13.270
Never greater,

2475
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:15.700
Nor, I'll assure you,better taken, sir.

2476
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:20.330
May I be bold to ask atwhat that contains,

2477
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:22.000
That paper in your hand?

2478
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.130
Yes; 'tis the list

2479
01:57:23.130 --> 01:57:25.070
Of those that claim theiroffices this day

2480
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:27.030
By custom of thecoronation.

2481
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:28.670
The Duke of Suffolk is thefirst,

2482
01:57:28.670 --> 01:57:30.370
and claims to behigh-steward;

2483
01:57:30.370 --> 01:57:31.930
next, the Duke of Norfolk,

2484
01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:33.500
He to be earl marshal:

2485
01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:34.570
you may read the rest.

2486
01:57:34.570 --> 01:57:35.770
I thank you, sir:

2487
01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:37.600
had I not known thosecustoms,

2488
01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:40.530
I should have beenbeholding to your paper.

2489
01:57:40.530 --> 01:57:43.530
But, I beseech you, what'sbecome of Katharine,

2490
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:46.070
The princess dowager? howgoes her business?

2491
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:48.400
That I can tell you too.

2492
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.230
The Archbishop ofCanterbury,

2493
01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:52.570
accompanied with otherlearned and reverend fathers

2494
01:57:52.570 --> 01:57:53.500
of his order,

2495
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.230
Held a late court atDunstable,

2496
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:57.700
six miles off from Ampthillwhere the princess lay;

2497
01:57:57.700 --> 01:57:59.470
to which she was oftencited by them,

2498
01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:00.670
but appear'd not:

2499
01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:04.200
And, to be short, for notappearance

2500
01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:05.770
and the king's latescruple,

2501
01:58:05.770 --> 01:58:08.030
by the main assent of allthese learned men

2502
01:58:08.030 --> 01:58:09.330
she was divorced,

2503
01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:12.600
And the late marriage madeof none effect

2504
01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:14.700
Since which she wasremoved to Kimbolton,

2505
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:17.270
Where she remains nowsick.

2506
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:18.870
Alas, good lady!

2507
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:21.170
(trumpets sound)

2508
01:58:21.170 --> 01:58:22.070
The trumpets sound!

2509
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:24.570
Stand close, the queen iscoming!

2510
01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:57.200
A royal train, believe me.These I know:

2511
01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.830
Who's that that bears thesceptre?

2512
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:01.370
Marquess Dorset:

2513
01:59:01.370 --> 01:59:04.400
And that the Earl ofSurrey, with the rod.

2514
01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:06.530
A bold brave gentleman.

2515
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:08.670
That should be the Duke ofSuffolk?

2516
01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:10.730
'Tis the same:high-steward.

2517
01:59:10.730 --> 01:59:12.370
And that my Lord ofNorfolk?

2518
01:59:12.370 --> 01:59:14.000
Yes;

2519
01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.170
Heaven bless thee!

2520
01:59:26.170 --> 01:59:29.730
Thou hast the sweetestface I ever look'd on.

2521
01:59:29.730 --> 01:59:34.100
Sir, as I have a soul, sheis an angel;

2522
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:36.830
Our king has all theIndies in his arms,

2523
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:41.030
And more and richer, whenhe strains that lady:

2524
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:43.870
I cannot blame hisconscience.

2525
01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:46.930
They that bear the clothof honour over her,

2526
01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:48.770
are four barons of theCinque-ports.

2527
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:53.370
Those men are happy; andso are all are near her.

2528
01:59:53.370 --> 01:59:56.370
I take it, she thatcarries up the train

2529
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:59.470
Is that old noble lady,Duchess of Norfolk.

2530
01:59:59.470 --> 02:00:03.400
It is; and all the restare countesses.

2531
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:08.470
Their coronets say so.These are stars indeed;

2532
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:11.070
And sometimes fallingones.

2533
02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.000
No more of that.

2534
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:46.900
How does your grace?

2535
02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:51.830
O Griffith, sick to death!

2536
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:55.070
My legs, like loadenbranches, bow to the earth,

2537
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:57.870
Willing to leave theirburthen.

2538
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:59.270
Reach a chair:

2539
02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:14.800
So; now, methinks, I feela little ease.

2540
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:18.700
Didst thou not tell me,Griffith,

2541
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.670
as thou led'st me,

2542
02:01:20.670 --> 02:01:22.230
That the great child ofhonour,

2543
02:01:22.230 --> 02:01:24.870
Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?

2544
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:28.570
Yes, madam; but I thinkyour grace,

2545
02:01:28.570 --> 02:01:32.230
Out of the pain yousuffer'd, gave no ear to't.

2546
02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:36.500
Prithee, good Griffith,tell me how he died:

2547
02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:38.970
If well, he stepp'd beforeme,

2548
02:01:38.970 --> 02:01:42.130
happily for my example.

2549
02:01:42.130 --> 02:01:45.030
Well, the voice goes,madam:

2550
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:46.930
For after the stout EarlNorthumberland

2551
02:01:46.930 --> 02:01:48.500
Arrested him at York,

2552
02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.900
and brought him forward,

2553
02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:53.230
As a man sorely tainted,to his answer,

2554
02:01:53.230 --> 02:01:56.770
He fell sick suddenly, andgrew so ill

2555
02:01:56.770 --> 02:01:58.970
He could not sit his mule.

2556
02:01:58.970 --> 02:02:01.230
Alas, poor man!

2557
02:02:01.230 --> 02:02:05.230
At last, with easy roads,he came to Leicester,

2558
02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:06.800
Lodged in the abbey;

2559
02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:07.930
where the reverend abbot,

2560
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:09.300
With all his covent,

2561
02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:12.000
honourably received him;

2562
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.200
and, three nights afterthis,

2563
02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:16.000
About the hour of eight,

2564
02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.870
which he himself Foretoldshould be his last,

2565
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:22.670
He gave his honours to theworld again,

2566
02:02:22.670 --> 02:02:25.170
His blessed part toheaven,

2567
02:02:25.170 --> 02:02:27.330
and slept in peace.

2568
02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:31.930
So may he rest; his faultslie gently on him!

2569
02:02:33.570 --> 02:02:34.530
Yet thus far, Griffith,

2570
02:02:34.530 --> 02:02:36.000
give me leave to speakhim,

2571
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.600
And yet with charity.

2572
02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:41.500
He was a man of anunbounded stomach,

2573
02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:45.030
ever ranking himself withprinces;

2574
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:47.130
one that, by suggestion,

2575
02:02:47.130 --> 02:02:51.030
Tied all the kingdom:simony was fair-play;

2576
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:53.600
His own opinion was hislaw:

2577
02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:55.830
i' the presence he wouldsay untruths;

2578
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:59.530
and be ever double both inhis words and meaning:

2579
02:02:59.530 --> 02:03:02.700
he was never, but where hemeant to ruin,

2580
02:03:02.700 --> 02:03:05.600
pitiful: his promiseswere,

2581
02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.100
as he then was, mighty;

2582
02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:14.500
But his performance, as heis now, nothing:

2583
02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:16.470
Noble madam,

2584
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:19.400
Men's evil manners live inbrass;

2585
02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:22.600
their virtues we write inwater.

2586
02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:24.170
May it please yourhighness

2587
02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:26.530
To hear me speak his goodnow?

2588
02:03:26.530 --> 02:03:27.500
Yes, good Griffith;

2589
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.200
I were malicious else.

2590
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.000
This cardinal,

2591
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.270
Though from an humblestock,

2592
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:35.300
undoubtedly was fashion'dto much honour

2593
02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:37.070
from his cradle.

2594
02:03:37.070 --> 02:03:40.570
He was a scholar, and aripe and good one;

2595
02:03:40.570 --> 02:03:44.830
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken,and persuading:

2596
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:48.200
Lofty and sour to themthat loved him not;

2597
02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:50.400
But to those men thatsought him

2598
02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:52.370
sweet as summer.

2599
02:03:52.930 --> 02:03:55.670
His overthrow heap'dhappiness upon him;

2600
02:03:55.670 --> 02:03:59.900
For then, and not tillthen, he felt himself,

2601
02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:03.630
And found the blessednessof being little:

2602
02:04:03.630 --> 02:04:06.670
And, to add greaterhonours to his age

2603
02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:11.670
Than man could give him,he died fearing God.

2604
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:15.570
After my death I wish noother herald,

2605
02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:17.530
No other speaker of myliving actions,

2606
02:04:17.530 --> 02:04:20.500
To keep mine honour fromcorruption,

2607
02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:23.500
But such an honestchronicler as Griffith.

2608
02:04:24.170 --> 02:04:26.700
Whom I most hated living,

2609
02:04:26.700 --> 02:04:27.630
thou hast made me,

2610
02:04:27.630 --> 02:04:29.670
With thy religious truthand modesty,

2611
02:04:29.670 --> 02:04:33.070
Now in his ashes honour:

2612
02:04:33.070 --> 02:04:35.000
peace be with him!

2613
02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:42.670
Patience, be near mestill; and set me lower:

2614
02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:47.900
I have not long to troublethee.

2615
02:04:50.170 --> 02:04:52.300
Good Griffith, cause themusicians

2616
02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:53.530
play me that sad note

2617
02:04:53.530 --> 02:04:58.500
I named my knell, whilst Isit meditating

2618
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:05.270
On that celestial harmonyI go to.

2619
02:05:09.930 --> 02:05:11.400
She is asleep:

2620
02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:14.570
good wench, let's sit downquiet,

2621
02:05:14.570 --> 02:05:18.430
For fear we wake her:softly, gentle Patience.

2622
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:14.500
Spirits of peace, whereare ye?

2623
02:06:15.970 --> 02:06:17.700
are ye all gone,

2624
02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:21.200
And leave me here inwretchedness behind ye?

2625
02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:25.070
Madam, we are here.

2626
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:27.230
It is not you I call for:

2627
02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:29.070
Saw ye none enter since Islept?

2628
02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:30.630
None, madam.

2629
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:35.000
No? Saw you not, even now,

2630
02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.830
a blessed troop invite meto a banquet;

2631
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:38.770
whose bright faces

2632
02:06:38.770 --> 02:06:43.230
Cast thousand beams uponme, like the sun?

2633
02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:46.200
They promised me eternalhappiness;

2634
02:06:46.200 --> 02:06:48.870
And brought me garlands,Griffith,

2635
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:51.970
which I feel I am notworthy yet to wear:

2636
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:59.000
I shall, assuredly.

2637
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.370
I am most joyful, madam,such good dreams

2638
02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:04.130
Possess your fancy.

2639
02:07:09.130 --> 02:07:10.870
Bid the music leave,

2640
02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.500
They are harsh and heavyto me.

2641
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:27.730
Do you note

2642
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:30.030
How much her grace isalter'd on the sudden?

2643
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:33.000
How long her face isdrawn? how pale she looks,

2644
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.900
And of an earthy cold?Mark her eyes!

2645
02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:42.730
She is going, wench: pray,pray.

2646
02:07:44.070 --> 02:07:45.700
Heaven comfort her!

2647
02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:48.500
An't like your grace,

2648
02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:50.970
You are a saucy fellow:

2649
02:07:50.970 --> 02:07:53.100
Deserve we no morereverence?

2650
02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:54.670
You are to blame,

2651
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:56.900
Knowing she will not loseher wonted greatness,

2652
02:07:56.900 --> 02:08:00.570
To use so rude behavior;go to, kneel.

2653
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:06.200
I humbly do entreat yourhighness' pardon;

2654
02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:08.770
My haste made meunmannerly.

2655
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:10.000
There is staying agentleman,

2656
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.570
sent from the king, to seeyou.

2657
02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:16.830
Admit him entrance,Griffith:

2658
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:19.700
but this fellow let mene'er see again.

2659
02:08:33.530 --> 02:08:37.670
If my sight fail not,

2660
02:08:37.670 --> 02:08:38.770
You should be lordambassador

2661
02:08:38.770 --> 02:08:42.000
from the emperor, my royalnephew,

2662
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and your name Capucius.

2663
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:49.330
Madam, the same; yourservant.

2664
02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.470
O, my lord,

2665
02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:55.530
The times and titles now

2666
02:08:55.530 --> 02:08:57.530
are alter'd strangely withme

2667
02:08:57.530 --> 02:08:59.770
since first you knew me.

2668
02:08:59.770 --> 02:09:00.700
But, I pray you,

2669
02:09:00.700 --> 02:09:02.970
What is your pleasure withme?

2670
02:09:02.970 --> 02:09:04.200
Noble lady,

2671
02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.230
First mine own service toyour grace;

2672
02:09:07.230 --> 02:09:08.830
the next, the king'srequest

2673
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:10.300
that I would visit you;

2674
02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:12.630
Who grieves much for yourweakness,

2675
02:09:12.630 --> 02:09:15.530
and by me sends you hisprincely commendations,

2676
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:17.930
And heartily entreats youtake good comfort.

2677
02:09:17.930 --> 02:09:21.230
O my good lord, thatcomfort comes too late;

2678
02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:27.400
'Tis like a pardon afterexecution:

2679
02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:30.900
That gentle physic, givenin time, had cured me;

2680
02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:36.470
But now I am past ancomforts here, but prayers.

2681
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:38.000
How does his highness?

2682
02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.070
Madam, in good health.

2683
02:09:41.070 --> 02:09:45.900
So may he ever do! andever flourish,

2684
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:49.500
When I shal l dwell withworms,

2685
02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:54.770
and my poor name banish'dthe kingdom!

2686
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:57.500
Patience, is that letter,I caused you write

2687
02:09:57.500 --> 02:09:58.630
yet sent away?

2688
02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:00.000
No, madam.

2689
02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:03.070
Sir, I most humbly prayyou to deliver

2690
02:10:03.070 --> 02:10:05.270
This to my lord the king.

2691
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:06.370
Most willing, madam.

2692
02:10:06.370 --> 02:10:09.130
In which I have commendedto his goodness

2693
02:10:09.130 --> 02:10:11.030
The model of our chasteloves,

2694
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:13.170
his young daughter;

2695
02:10:13.170 --> 02:10:14.530
The dews of heaven fallthick

2696
02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:16.630
in blessings on her!

2697
02:10:16.630 --> 02:10:20.730
Beseeching him to give hervirtuous breeding

2698
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:25.570
She is young, and of anoble modest nature,

2699
02:10:25.570 --> 02:10:28.630
I hope she will deservewell,

2700
02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:32.500
and a little to love herfor her mother's sake,

2701
02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:38.200
that loved him, heavenknows how dearly.

2702
02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:43.330
My next poor petition is,

2703
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:45.670
that his noble grace wouldhave some pity

2704
02:10:45.670 --> 02:10:47.600
Upon my wretched women,

2705
02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:51.600
that so long have follow'dboth my fortunes faithfully:

2706
02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:54.570
Of which there is not one,I dare avow,

2707
02:10:54.570 --> 02:10:58.370
And now I should not lie,

2708
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.730
but will deserve forvirtue

2709
02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:02.600
and true beauty of thesoul,

2710
02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:04.230
For honesty and decentcarriage,

2711
02:11:04.230 --> 02:11:06.730
A right good husband,

2712
02:11:06.730 --> 02:11:09.200
let him be a noble

2713
02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:13.830
and, sure, those men arehappy that shall have 'em.

2714
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:17.230
The last is, for my men;

2715
02:11:17.230 --> 02:11:20.600
they are the poorest,

2716
02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:24.700
But poverty could neverdraw 'em from me;

2717
02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:27.870
That they may have theirwages duly paid 'em,

2718
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:30.830
And something over toremember me by:

2719
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:33.900
If heaven had pleased tohave given me longer life

2720
02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:39.700
And able means, we had notparted thus.

2721
02:11:42.730 --> 02:11:46.470
These are the wholecontents: and, good my lord,

2722
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:50.130
By that you love thedearest in this world,

2723
02:11:50.130 --> 02:11:53.330
As you wish Christianpeace to souls departed,

2724
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:56.270
Stand these poor people'sfriend,

2725
02:11:56.270 --> 02:11:59.270
and urge the king to do methis last right.

2726
02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:01.300
By heaven, I will,

2727
02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:03.970
Or let me lose the fashionof a man!

2728
02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:11.200
I thank you, honest lord.

2729
02:12:12.970 --> 02:12:17.100
Remember me in all humilityunto his highness:

2730
02:12:17.100 --> 02:12:22.170
Say his long trouble

2731
02:12:22.170 --> 02:12:24.700
now is passing out of thisworld;

2732
02:12:27.370 --> 02:12:30.930
tell him, in death Ibless'd him,

2733
02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:36.200
For so I will. Mine eyesgrow dim.

2734
02:12:38.370 --> 02:12:40.200
Farewell, my lord.

2735
02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:50.430
Griffith, farewell.

2736
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:54.500
Nay, Patience,

2737
02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:57.500
You must not leave me yet:I must to bed;

2738
02:12:57.500 --> 02:12:59.500
Call in more women.

2739
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:02.070
When I am dead, goodwench,

2740
02:13:02.070 --> 02:13:04.300
Let me be used withhonour:

2741
02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:07.100
strew me over with maidenflowers,

2742
02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:10.370
that all the world mayknow I was a chaste wife

2743
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:12.730
to my grave:

2744
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:17.870
embalm me, then lay meforth:

2745
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:19.930
although unqueen'd,

2746
02:13:19.930 --> 02:13:26.300
yet like a queen, anddaughter to a king, inter me.

2747
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:30.630
I can no more.

2748
02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:21.570
It's one o'clock, boy,is't not?

2749
02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:23.070
It hath struck.

2750
02:14:24.130 --> 02:14:25.930
These should be hours fornecessities,

2751
02:14:25.930 --> 02:14:28.170
Not for delights;

2752
02:14:28.170 --> 02:14:31.900
times to repair our naturewith comforting repose,

2753
02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:34.930
and not for us to wastethese times.

2754
02:14:36.230 --> 02:14:37.670
Good hour of night, SirThomas!

2755
02:14:37.670 --> 02:14:39.630
Whither so late?

2756
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:41.330
Came you from the king, mylord

2757
02:14:41.330 --> 02:14:43.600
I did, Sir Thomas: andleft him at primero

2758
02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.400
With the Duke of Suffolk.

2759
02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.070
I must to him too, beforehe go to bed.

2760
02:14:47.070 --> 02:14:48.070
I'll take my leave.

2761
02:14:48.070 --> 02:14:50.230
Not yet, Sir ThomasLovell.

2762
02:14:50.230 --> 02:14:52.270
What's the matter? Itseems you are in haste:

2763
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:55.270
an if there be no greatoffence belongs to't,

2764
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:59.170
give your friend some touchof your late business:

2765
02:14:59.170 --> 02:15:01.830
affairs, that walk, asthey say spirits do,

2766
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:05.470
at midnight, have in thema wilder nature

2767
02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:09.430
than the business thatseeks dispatch by day.

2768
02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:11.600
My lord, I love you;

2769
02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.370
And durst commend a secretto your ear

2770
02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:15.400
Much weightier than thiswork.

2771
02:15:16.330 --> 02:15:17.600
The queen's in labour,

2772
02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:19.770
They say, in greatextremity;

2773
02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:21.970
and fear'd she'll with thelabour end.

2774
02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:25.900
The fruit she goes with Ipray for heartily,

2775
02:15:25.900 --> 02:15:29.470
that it may find goodtime, and live:

2776
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:31.970
but for the stock, SirThomas,

2777
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:34.500
I wish it grubb'd up now.

2778
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:38.630
Methinks I could cry theamen; and yet

2779
02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.070
my conscience says she's agood creature,

2780
02:15:41.070 --> 02:15:42.070
and, sweet lady,

2781
02:15:42.070 --> 02:15:43.630
does deserve our betterwishes.

2782
02:15:43.630 --> 02:15:44.870
But, sir, sir,

2783
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:46.330
Hear me, Sir Thomas:

2784
02:15:46.330 --> 02:15:48.330
you're a gentleman of mineown way;

2785
02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:50.630
I know you wise,religious;

2786
02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:52.700
And, let me tell you,

2787
02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:55.370
it will ne'er be well,

2788
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:57.970
'Twill not, Sir ThomasLovell, take't of me,

2789
02:15:57.970 --> 02:16:01.330
Till Cranmer, Cromwell,her two hands, and she,

2790
02:16:01.330 --> 02:16:03.530
Sleep in their graves.

2791
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:05.030
Now, sir, you speak oftwo

2792
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:07.630
the most remark'd i' thekingdom.

2793
02:16:07.630 --> 02:16:09.870
As for Cromwell, besidethat of the jewel house,

2794
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:11.370
is made master o' therolls,

2795
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:13.030
and the king's secretary;further, sir,

2796
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:15.530
Stands in the gap andtrade of moe preferments,

2797
02:16:15.530 --> 02:16:17.670
With which the time willload him.

2798
02:16:18.830 --> 02:16:21.800
The archbishop is theking's hand and tongue;

2799
02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:23.800
and who dare speak onesyllable against him?

2800
02:16:23.800 --> 02:16:26.530
Yes, yes, Sir Thomas;

2801
02:16:26.530 --> 02:16:27.830
There are that dare;

2802
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:31.230
and I myself have venturedto speak my mind of him:

2803
02:16:31.230 --> 02:16:36.930
and indeed this day, Sir,I may tell it you,

2804
02:16:36.930 --> 02:16:41.070
I think I have incensedthe lords o' the council,

2805
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:44.370
that he is, For so I knowhe is, they know he is,

2806
02:16:44.370 --> 02:16:45.970
A most arch heretic,

2807
02:16:45.970 --> 02:16:48.530
a pestilence that doesinfect the land:

2808
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:51.070
with which they moved havebroken with the king;

2809
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:53.630
who hath so far given earto our complaint,

2810
02:16:53.630 --> 02:16:56.100
of his great grace andprincely care

2811
02:16:56.100 --> 02:16:57.770
foreseeing those fellmischiefs

2812
02:16:57.770 --> 02:17:00.070
Our reasons laid beforehim,

2813
02:17:00.070 --> 02:17:02.370
hath commanded to-morrowmorning

2814
02:17:02.370 --> 02:17:05.300
to the council-board he beconvented.

2815
02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:08.030
He's a rank weed, SirThomas,

2816
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:09.600
And we must root him out.

2817
02:17:11.370 --> 02:17:14.270
From your affairs I hinderyou too long:

2818
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:17.230
good night, Sir Thomas.

2819
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:19.770
Many good nights, my lord:I rest your servant.

2820
02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:29.670
Charles, I will play nomore tonight;

2821
02:17:29.670 --> 02:17:32.800
My mind's not on't; youare too hard for me.

2822
02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:35.000
Sir, I did never win ofyou before.

2823
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:36.730
But little, Charles; norshall not,

2824
02:17:36.730 --> 02:17:38.770
when my fancy's on myplay.

2825
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:42.370
Now, Lovell, from thequeen what is the news?

2826
02:17:42.370 --> 02:17:43.800
I could not personallydeliver to her

2827
02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:44.700
What you commanded me,

2828
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:47.030
but by her woman I sentyour message;

2829
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:49.030
who return'd her thanks inthe great'st humbleness,

2830
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:52.600
and desired your highness mostheartily to pray for her.

2831
02:17:54.630 --> 02:17:55.870
What say'st thou, ha?

2832
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:58.600
To pray for her? what, isshe crying out?

2833
02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.430
So said her woman

2834
02:18:00.430 --> 02:18:01.270
and that her sufferancemade

2835
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:03.200
Almost each pang a death.

2836
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.870
Alas, good lady!

2837
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:07.730

Leave me alone;

2844
02:18:19.930 --> 02:18:21.500
For I must think of thatwhich company

2845
02:18:21.500 --> 02:18:23.400
Would not be friendly to.

2846
02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.800
I wish your highness aquiet night;

2847
02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.670

Bring him to us. Avoid thegallery.

2857

Ah, my good lord, I grieveat what I speak,

2867
02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:37.630
And am right sorry torepeat what follows

2868
02:19:37.630 --> 02:19:39.570
I have, and mostunwillingly,

Grievous complaints ofyou;

2871
02:19:46.770 --> 02:19:48.170
which, being consider'd,

2872
02:19:48.170 --> 02:19:49.430
Have moved us and ourcouncil,

that you shall thismorning come before us;

2874
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.400
where, I know,

2875
02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:56.300
You cannot with suchfreedom purge yourself,

2876
02:19:56.300 --> 02:19:58.230
But that, till furthertrial in those charges

2877
02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:00.300
Which will require youranswer,

2878
02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:01.970

It fits we thus proceed,

2882
02:20:09.730 --> 02:20:12.230

2883
02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.770
I humbly thank yourhighness;

2884
02:20:16.470 --> 02:20:18.700

where my chaff and cornshall fly asunder:

2887
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:24.630
for, I know,

2888
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:26.870
there's none stands undermore calumnious tongues

2889
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:29.370
Than I myself, poor man.

2890
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:32.600
Stand up, good Canterbury:

2891
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:33.470

2894
02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.800
Prithee, let's walk.

2895
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:44.730
Now, by my holidame. Whatmanner of man are you?

2896
02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:46.870
My lord, I look'd youwould have

2897
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:47.970
given me your petition,

2898
02:20:47.970 --> 02:20:49.230
that I should have ta'ensome pains

2899
02:20:49.230 --> 02:20:51.830
to bring together yourselfand your accusers;

2900
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:52.600
and to have heard you,

2901
02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:54.770
Without indurance,further.

2902
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:57.070
Most dread liege,

2903
02:20:57.070 --> 02:21:00.630
The good I stand on is mytruth and honesty:

2904
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:03.030
If they shall fail, I,with mine enemies,

2905
02:21:03.030 --> 02:21:04.730
Will triumph o'er myperson;

2906
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:08.900
which I weigh not, beingof those virtues vacant.

2907
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:11.730
I fear nothing what can besaid against me.

2908
02:21:11.730 --> 02:21:14.930
Know you not how yourstate stands i' the world,

2909
02:21:14.930 --> 02:21:17.730
with the whole world?

2910
02:21:20.130 --> 02:21:23.300
Your enemies are many, andnot small;

2911
02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:26.370
their practises must bearthe same proportion;

2912
02:21:26.370 --> 02:21:28.970
and not ever the justice andthe truth o' the question

2913
02:21:28.970 --> 02:21:32.570
carries the due o' theverdict with it:

2914
02:21:32.570 --> 02:21:34.230
at what ease might corruptminds

2915
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:36.500
procure knaves as corrupt

2916
02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:39.630
To swear against you? suchthings have been done.

2917
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:42.670
You are potently opposed;

2918
02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:45.070
and with a malice of asgreat size.

2919
02:21:47.470 --> 02:21:49.100
Ween you of better luck,

2920
02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.530
I mean, in perjuredwitness, than your master,

2921
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:52.830
Whose minister you are,

2922
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:56.230
whiles here he lived uponthis naughty earth?

2923
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:57.330
Go to, go to;

2924
02:21:57.330 --> 02:21:59.070
You take a precipice forno leap of danger,

2925
02:21:59.070 --> 02:22:01.470
And woo your owndestruction.

2926
02:22:02.970 --> 02:22:06.530
God and your majestyprotect mine innocence,

2927
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:08.730
or I fall into the trap islaid for me!

2928
02:22:10.530 --> 02:22:11.670
Be of good cheer;

2929
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:13.530
They shall no more prevailthan we give way to.

2930
02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.400
Keep comfort to you;

2931
02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.570
and this morning see youdo appear before them:

2932
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:19.200
if they shall chance, incharging you with matters,

2933
02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:20.470
to commit you,

2934
02:22:20.470 --> 02:22:23.000
The best persuasions to thecontrary fail not to use,

2935
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:23.830
and with what vehemency

2936
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:26.370
the occasion shallinstruct you:

2937
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:30.400
if entreaties will renderyou no remedy,

2938
02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:32.530
this ring deliver them,

2939
02:22:32.530 --> 02:22:34.630
and your appeal to usthere make before them.

2940
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:41.800
Look, the good man weeps!

2941
02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:44.730
He's honest, on minehonour.

2942
02:22:44.730 --> 02:22:45.630
God's blest mother!

2943
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:47.030
I swear he istrue--hearted;

2944
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:49.700
and a soul none better inmy kingdom.

2945
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:53.230
Get you gone, and do as Ihave bid you.

2946
02:23:04.100 --> 02:23:06.630
He has strangled hislanguage in his tears.

2947
02:23:08.170 --> 02:23:10.200
Come back: what mean you?

2948
02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:11.400
I'll not come back;

2949
02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:15.070
the tidings that I bring willmake my boldness manners.

2950
02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:17.730
Now, good angels fly o'erthy royal head,

2951
02:23:17.730 --> 02:23:20.870
and shade thy person undertheir blessed wings!

2952
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:22.430
Now, by thy looks I guessthy message.

2953
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:23.970
Is the queen deliver'd?

2954
02:23:23.970 --> 02:23:25.370
Say, ay; and of a boy.

2955
02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:28.900
Ay, ay, my liege; and of alovely boy:

2956
02:23:31.470 --> 02:23:34.470
the God of heaven both nowand ever bless her!

2957
02:23:34.470 --> 02:23:38.400
'tis a girl, promises boyshereafter.

2958
02:23:39.370 --> 02:23:43.630
Sir, your queen desiresyour visitation,

2959
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:46.600
and to be acquainted withthis stranger

2960
02:23:46.600 --> 02:23:50.500
'tis as like you as cherryis to cherry.

2961
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:53.500
Lovell!

2962
02:23:53.500 --> 02:23:54.500
Sir?

2963
02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:56.100
Give her an hundred marks.I'll to the queen.

2964
02:23:58.130 --> 02:24:02.870
An hundred marks! By thislight, I'll ha' more.

2965
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:05.570
An ordinary groom is forsuch payment.

2966
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:08.000
I will have more, or scoldit out of him.

2967
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.530
Said I for this, the girlwas like to him?

2968
02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:12.370
I will have more, or elseunsay't;

2969
02:24:12.370 --> 02:24:15.300
and now, while it is hot,I'll put it to the issue.

2970
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:20.330
I hope I am not too late;

2971
02:24:20.330 --> 02:24:21.170
and yet the gentleman,

2972
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:22.030
that was sent to me fromthe council,

2973
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:23.830
pray'd me to make greathaste.

2974
02:24:26.030 --> 02:24:28.730
All fast? what means this?

2975
02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:30.170
Ho! Who waits there?

2976
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:35.530
Sure, you know me?

2977
02:24:35.530 --> 02:24:39.430
Yes, my lord; But yet Icannot help you.

2978
02:24:39.430 --> 02:24:40.600
Why?

2979
02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:43.600
Your grace must wait tillyou be call'd for.

2980
02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:47.230
So.

2981
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:50.870
This is a piece of malice.

2982
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:53.330
I am glad I came this wayso happily:

2983
02:24:53.330 --> 02:24:55.630
the king shall understandit presently.

2984
02:25:00.770 --> 02:25:03.530
'Tis Butts, the king'sphysician:

2985
02:25:03.530 --> 02:25:04.470
as he pass'd along,

2986
02:25:04.470 --> 02:25:05.930
How earnestly he cast hiseyes upon me!

2987
02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:08.000
Pray heaven, he sound notmy disgrace!

2988
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:11.300
For certain, this is ofpurpose

2989
02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:14.970
laid by some that hate meGod turn their hearts!

2990
02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:16.930
I never sought theirmalice

2991
02:25:16.930 --> 02:25:18.600
To quench mine honour:

2992
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:21.500
they would shame to makeme wait else at door,

2993
02:25:21.500 --> 02:25:22.570
a fellow-counsellor,

2994
02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:24.830
'Mong boys, grooms, andlackeys.

2995
02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:29.130
But their pleasures mustbe fulfill'd,

2996
02:25:30.470 --> 02:25:32.770
and I attend withpatience.

2997
02:25:35.630 --> 02:25:37.300
I'll show your grace thestrangest sight

2998
02:25:37.300 --> 02:25:38.230
What's that, Butts?

2999
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:39.570
I think your highness sawthis many a day.

3000
02:25:39.570 --> 02:25:40.600
Body o' me, where is it?

3001
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.700
There, my lord:

3002
02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.870
The high promotion of hisgrace of Canterbury;

3003
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:46.070
Who holds his state atdoor, 'mongst pursuivants,

3004
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:48.000
Pages, and footboys.

3005
02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:51.900
Ha! 'tis he, indeed:

3006
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:56.230
Is this the honour they doone another?

3007
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:59.300
'Tis well there's oneabove 'em yet.

3008
02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:00.330
I had thought they hadparted

3009
02:26:00.330 --> 02:26:01.430
so much honesty among 'em

3010
02:26:01.430 --> 02:26:02.430
At least, good manners,

3011
02:26:02.430 --> 02:26:04.070
as not thus to suffer aman of his place,

3012
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:05.170
and so near our favour,

3013
02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:08.430
To dance attendance ontheir lordships' pleasures,

3014
02:26:08.430 --> 02:26:12.030
And at the door too, likea post with packets.

3015
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:19.100
By holy Mary, Butts,there's knavery:

3016
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:25.100
Speak to the business,master-secretary:

3017
02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.530
Why are we met in council?

3018
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:28.870
Please your honours,

3019
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:31.430
The chief cause concernshis grace of Canterbury.

3020
02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:33.170
Has he had knowledge ofit?

3021
02:26:33.170 --> 02:26:34.000
Yes.

3022
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.430
Who waits there?

3023
02:26:35.430 --> 02:26:36.570
Without, my noble lords?

3024
02:26:36.570 --> 02:26:37.270
Yes.

3025
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:38.700
My lord archbishop;

3026
02:26:38.700 --> 02:26:41.070
And has done half an hour,to know your pleasures.

3027
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:42.970
Let him come in.

3028
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:48.170
Your grace may enter now.

3029
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:03.400
My good lord archbishop,

3030
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.500
I'm very sorry to sit hereat this present,

3031
02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:09.570
and behold that chairstand empty:

3032
02:27:09.570 --> 02:27:11.830
but we all are men,

3033
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:13.670
In our own natures frail,

3034
02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:18.830
and capable of our flesh;few are angels:

3035
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:22.000
out of which frailty andwant of wisdom,

3036
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.630
you, that best shouldteach us,

3037
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:26.430
Have misdemean'd yourself,and not a little,

3038
02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:28.700
Toward the king first,then his laws,

3039
02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:31.770
in filling the wholerealm, by your teaching

3040
02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:33.230
and your chaplains,

3041
02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:36.430
For so we are inform'd,with new opinions,

3042
02:27:36.430 --> 02:27:39.570
Divers and dangerous;which are heresies,

3043
02:27:39.570 --> 02:27:43.130
And, not reform'd, mayprove pernicious.

3044
02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:44.400
Which reformation

3045
02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:47.530
must be sudden too, mynoble lords;

3046
02:27:47.530 --> 02:27:49.370
for those that tame wildhorses

3047
02:27:49.370 --> 02:27:52.800
Pace 'em not in theirhands to make 'em gentle,

3048
02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:55.800
But stop their mouths withstubborn bits, and spur 'em,

3049
02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:56.900
Till they obey the manage.

3050
02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:58.230
If we suffer,

3051
02:27:58.230 --> 02:28:00.970
Out of our easiness andchildish pity

3052
02:28:00.970 --> 02:28:05.230
To one man's honour, thiscontagious sickness,

3053
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.800
Farewell all physic:

3054
02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:09.370
and what follows then?

3055
02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:11.170
Commotions, uproars,

3056
02:28:11.170 --> 02:28:14.330
with a general taint ofthe whole state:

3057
02:28:14.330 --> 02:28:16.300
as, of late days, ourneighbours,

3058
02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:17.930
The upper Germany, candearly witness,

3059
02:28:17.930 --> 02:28:21.370
Yet freshly pitied in ourmemories.

3060
02:28:23.130 --> 02:28:25.130
My good lords,

3061
02:28:26.830 --> 02:28:28.370
hitherto, in all theprogress

3062
02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:30.030
Both of my life andoffice,

3063
02:28:30.030 --> 02:28:31.170
I have labour'd,

3064
02:28:31.170 --> 02:28:33.530
And with no little study,

3065
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:35.300
that my teaching and thestrong course

3066
02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:37.830
of my authority might goone way,

3067
02:28:37.830 --> 02:28:42.330
and safely; and the endwas ever, to do well:

3068
02:28:45.070 --> 02:28:47.130
nor is there living,

3069
02:28:47.130 --> 02:28:50.070
I speak it with a singleheart, my lords,

3070
02:28:50.070 --> 02:28:53.330
A man that more detests,more stirs against,

3071
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:55.370
Both in his privateconscience and his place,

3072
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:59.200
Defacers of a publicpeace, than I do.

3073
02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:01.330
Pray heaven, the king maynever find a heart

3074
02:29:01.330 --> 02:29:03.000
With less allegiance init!

3075
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:10.730
Men that make envy andcrooked malice nourishment

3076
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:12.730
Dare bite the best.

3077
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:17.670
I do beseech yourlordships,

3078
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:19.030
That, in this case ofjustice,

3079
02:29:19.030 --> 02:29:21.100
my accusers, be what theywill,

3080
02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:23.130
may stand forth face toface,

3081
02:29:23.130 --> 02:29:25.330
And freely urge againstme.

3082
02:29:25.330 --> 02:29:27.170
Nay, my lord, that cannotbe:

3083
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:28.270
you are a counsellor,

3084
02:29:28.270 --> 02:29:31.200
And, by that virtue, noman dare accuse you.

3085
02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:35.300
My lord, because we havebusiness of more moment,

3086
02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.830
We will be short with you.

3087
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:39.970
'Tis his highness'pleasure,

3088
02:29:39.970 --> 02:29:44.000
And our consent, forbetter trial of you,

3089
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.800
From hence you becommitted to the Tower;

3090
02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:48.730
Where, being but a privateman again,

3091
02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:51.800
You shall know many dareaccuse you boldly,

3092
02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:53.870
More than, I fear, you areprovided for.

3093
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:56.670
Ah, my good Lord ofWinchester, I thank you;

3094
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:57.970
You are always my goodfriend;

3095
02:29:57.970 --> 02:29:59.030
if your will pass,

3096
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:01.600
I shall both find yourlordship judge and juror,

3097
02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:03.200
You are so merciful:

3098
02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:06.100
I see your end;

3099
02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:08.200
'Tis my undoing:

3100
02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.730
love and meekness, lord,

3101
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:12.900
Become a churchman betterthan ambition:

3102
02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:15.300
Win straying souls withmodesty again,

3103
02:30:15.300 --> 02:30:16.830
Cast none away.

3104
02:30:18.970 --> 02:30:20.000
That I shall clear myself,

3105
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.070
Lay all the weight ye canupon my patience,

3106
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:23.100
I make as little doubt,

3107
02:30:23.100 --> 02:30:25.700
as you do conscienceindoing daily wrongs.

3108
02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:28.730
I could say more,

3109
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:32.800
But reverence to yourcalling makes me modest.

3110
02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:37.000
My lord, my lord, you area sectary,

3111
02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.400
That's the plain truth:

3112
02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.070
your painted glossdiscovers,

3113
02:30:41.070 --> 02:30:44.200
To men that understandyou, words and weakness.

3114
02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:46.200
My Lord of Winchester, youare a little,

3115
02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:48.670
By your good favour, toosharp;

3116
02:30:48.670 --> 02:30:50.630
men so noble, howeverfaulty,

3117
02:30:50.630 --> 02:30:51.830
yet should find respect

3118
02:30:51.830 --> 02:30:53.300
For what they have been:

3119
02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:56.170
'tis a cruelty to load afalling man.

3120
02:30:56.830 --> 02:30:58.570
Good master secretary,

3121
02:30:58.570 --> 02:31:00.730
I cry your honour mercy;

3122
02:31:00.730 --> 02:31:02.930
you may, worst of all thistable, say so.

3123
02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:03.730
Why, my lord?

3124
02:31:03.730 --> 02:31:05.230
Do not I know you for afavourer

3125
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:06.830
Of this new sect?

3126
02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:08.230
ye are not sound.

3127
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.930
Not sound?

3128
02:31:08.930 --> 02:31:10.100
Not sound, I say.

3129
02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:11.970
Would you were half sohonest!

3130
02:31:11.970 --> 02:31:15.030
Men's prayers then wouldseek you, not their fears.

3131
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:17.030
I shall remember this boldlanguage.

3132
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:19.630
Do. Remember your boldlife too.

3133
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:21.600
This is too much;

3134
02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:23.430
Forbear, for shame, mylords.

3135
02:31:23.430 --> 02:31:25.430
I have done.

3136
02:31:25.430 --> 02:31:26.500
And I.

3137
02:31:26.500 --> 02:31:29.130
Then thus for you, mylord:

3138
02:31:29.130 --> 02:31:32.470
it stands agreed, I takeit, by all voices,

3139
02:31:32.470 --> 02:31:35.270
that forthwith you beconvey'd to the Tower

3140
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:36.400
a prisoner;

3141
02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:39.030
There to remain till theking's further pleasure

3142
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:41.230
Be known unto us:

3143
02:31:41.230 --> 02:31:43.200
are you all agreed, lords?

3144
02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:44.830
We are.

3145
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:46.600
Is there no other way ofmercy,

3146
02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:48.600
But I must needs to theTower, my lords?

3147
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:49.970
What other would youexpect?

3148
02:31:49.970 --> 02:31:52.700
you are strangelytroublesome.

3149
02:31:52.700 --> 02:31:55.300
Let some o' the guard beready there.

3150
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.770
For me? Must I go like atraitor thither?

3151
02:31:59.770 --> 02:32:03.170
Receive him, and see himsafe i' the Tower.

3152
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:05.270
Stay,

3153
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:09.930
good my lords, I have alittle yet to say.

3154
02:32:09.930 --> 02:32:13.170
Look there, my lords;

3155
02:32:13.170 --> 02:32:14.330
By virtue of that ring,

3156
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:16.370
I take my cause out of thegripes of cruel men,

3157
02:32:16.370 --> 02:32:18.430
and give it to a mostnoble judge,

3158
02:32:18.430 --> 02:32:22.130
the king my master.

3159
02:32:22.130 --> 02:32:23.730
This is the king's ring.

3160
02:32:23.730 --> 02:32:25.000
'Tis no counterfeit.

3161
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.100
'Tis the right ring,

3162
02:32:27.100 --> 02:32:28.330
by heaven: I told ye all,

3163
02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:31.100
When ye first put thisdangerous stone a-rolling,

3164
02:32:31.100 --> 02:32:32.700
'Twould fall uponourselves.

3165
02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:33.400
Do you think, my lords,

3166
02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:34.400
The king will suffer

3167
02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:36.270
but the little finger ofthis man to be vex'd?

3168
02:32:36.270 --> 02:32:37.800
'Tis now too certain:

3169
02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:40.630
How much more is his lifein value with him?

3170
02:32:40.630 --> 02:32:42.470
Would I were fairly outon't!

3171
02:32:42.470 --> 02:32:44.630
My mind gave me, inseeking tales

3172
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:46.170
and informations againstthis man,

3173
02:32:46.170 --> 02:32:48.070
whose honesty the deviland his disciples

3174
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:49.570
only envy at,

3175
02:32:49.570 --> 02:32:51.530
Ye blew the fire thatburns ye:

3176
02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:53.330
now have at ye!

3177
02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:00.400
Dread sovereign,

3178
02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.100
how much are we bound toheaven

3179
02:33:04.100 --> 02:33:06.430
In daily thanks, that gaveus such a prince;

3180
02:33:06.430 --> 02:33:09.530
Not only good and wise,but most religious:

3181
02:33:09.530 --> 02:33:12.230
One that, in all obedience,makes the church

3182
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:14.130
The chief aim of hishonour;

3183
02:33:14.130 --> 02:33:15.870
and, to strengthen thatholy duty,

3184
02:33:15.870 --> 02:33:19.130
out of dear respect, hisroyal self in judgment

3185
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:21.230
comes to hear the cause

3186
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:23.730
betwixt her and this greatoffender.

3187
02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:25.430
You were ever good atsudden commendations,

3188
02:33:25.430 --> 02:33:27.030
Bishop of Winchester.

3189
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:29.970
But know,

3190
02:33:29.970 --> 02:33:31.830
I come not to hear suchflattery now,

3191
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:33.630
and in my presence;

3192
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:36.230
They are too thin and bareto hide offences.

3193
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:41.570
To me you cannot reach,you play the spaniel,

3194
02:33:41.570 --> 02:33:44.430
And think with wagging ofyour tongue to win me;

3195
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:49.070
But, whatsoe'er thoutakest me for,

3196
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:53.770
I'm sure thou hast a cruelnature and a bloody.

3197
02:33:54.770 --> 02:33:56.230
Good man, sit down.

3198
02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.600
Now let me see the proudesthe, that dares most,

3199
02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:04.570
but wag his finger atthee:

3200
02:34:04.570 --> 02:34:05.500
By all that's holy,

3201
02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:06.600
he had better starve

3202
02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:09.400
Than but once think thisplace becomes thee not.

3203
02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:10.600
May it please your grace,

3204
02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:12.470
No, sir, it does notplease me.

3205
02:34:14.270 --> 02:34:15.400
I had thought I had hadmen

3206
02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.500
of some understanding andwisdom of my council;

3207
02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:19.970
but I find none.

3208
02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:24.570
Was it discretion, lords,to let this man,

3209
02:34:24.570 --> 02:34:28.430
This good man,--few of youdeserve that title,--

3210
02:34:28.430 --> 02:34:30.070
This honest man,

3211
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:32.930
wait like a lousy footboyAt chamberdoor?

3212
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:35.800
and one as great as youare?

3213
02:34:38.930 --> 02:34:40.970
Why, what a shame wasthis!

3214
02:34:40.970 --> 02:34:44.170
Did my commission bid yeso far forget yourselves?

3215
02:34:45.030 --> 02:34:47.170
I gave ye power as he wasa counsellor to try him,

3216
02:34:47.170 --> 02:34:48.370
Not as a groom:

3217
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:50.200
there's some of ye, I see,

3218
02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:51.930
More out of malice thanintegrity,

3219
02:34:51.930 --> 02:34:54.600
Would try him to theutmost, had ye mean;

3220
02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:57.730
Which ye shall never havewhile I live.

3221
02:34:57.730 --> 02:34:59.730
Thus far, my most dreadsovereign,

3222
02:34:59.730 --> 02:35:03.500
may it like your grace tolet my tongue excuse all.

3223
02:35:04.270 --> 02:35:06.800
What was purposed concerninghis imprisonment,

3224
02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:09.730
was rather, if there befaith in men,

3225
02:35:09.730 --> 02:35:13.170
meant for his trial, andfair purgation to the world,

3226
02:35:13.170 --> 02:35:15.330
than malice, I'm sure, inme.

3227
02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:20.800
Well, well, my lords,respect him;

3228
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:24.470
Take him, and use himwell, he's worthy of it.

3229
02:35:27.670 --> 02:35:29.800
I will say thus much forhim,

3230
02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:32.100
if a prince may bebeholding to a subject,

3231
02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:35.100
I am, for his love andservice, so to him.

3232
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:38.270
Make me no more ado, butall embrace him:

3233
02:35:38.270 --> 02:35:40.500
Be friends, for shame, mylords!

3234
02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:48.630
My Lord of Canterbury,

3235
02:35:48.630 --> 02:35:50.700
I have a suit which youmust not deny me;

3236
02:35:50.700 --> 02:35:51.930
That is, a fair young maid

3237
02:35:51.930 --> 02:35:53.530
that yet wants baptism,

3238
02:35:53.530 --> 02:35:55.500
You must be godfather, andanswer for her.

3239
02:35:55.500 --> 02:35:57.630
The greatest monarch nowalive may glory

3240
02:35:57.630 --> 02:35:59.370
In such an honour:

3241
02:35:59.370 --> 02:36:00.370
how may I deserve it

3242
02:36:00.370 --> 02:36:01.830
That am a poor and humblesubject to you?

3243
02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:04.330
Come, come, my lord,you'ld spare your spoons:

3244
02:36:04.330 --> 02:36:05.930
you shall have two noblepartners with you;

3245
02:36:05.930 --> 02:36:09.600
the old Duchess of Norfolk,and Lady Marquess Dorset:

3246
02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:11.270
will these please you?

3247
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:14.170
Once more, my Lord ofWinchester, I charge you,

3248
02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:16.130
Embrace and love this man.

3249
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:20.100
With a true heart

3250
02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:21.730
And brother-love I do it.

3251
02:36:23.600 --> 02:36:25.300
And let heaven witness,

3252
02:36:25.300 --> 02:36:27.530
how dear I hold thisconfirmation.

3253
02:36:30.970 --> 02:36:35.370
Good man, those joyfultears show thy true heart:

3254
02:36:35.370 --> 02:36:36.300
The common voice, I see,

3255
02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.800
is verified of thee, whichsays thus,

3256
02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:41.130
'Do my Lord of Canterburya shrewd turn,

3257
02:36:41.130 --> 02:36:43.270
and he is your friend forever.'

3258
02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:45.800
Come, lords, we trifletime away;

3259
02:36:45.800 --> 02:36:48.570
I long to have this youngone made a Christian.

3260
02:36:48.570 --> 02:36:53.100
As I have made ye one,lords, one remain;

3261
02:36:53.100 --> 02:36:57.600
So I grow stronger, youmore honour gain.

3262
02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:45.430
Heaven, from thy endlessgoodness,

3263
02:37:45.430 --> 02:37:48.070

3264

And to your royal grace,and the good queen,

My noble partners, andmyself, thus pray:

May hourly fall upon ye!

Thank you, good lordarchbishop:

3272
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:18.330

3273
02:38:18.330 --> 02:38:19.370
Elizabeth.

3274
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:20.670
Stand up, lord.

3275
02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:25.470
With this kiss take myblessing:

3276
02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:29.800
God protect thee! Intowhose hand I give thy life.

3277
02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:30.900
Amen.

3278
02:38:33.330 --> 02:38:35.570
My noble gossips, ye havebeen too prodigal:

3279
02:38:35.570 --> 02:38:38.300
I thank ye heartily; soshall this lady,

3280
02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:39.930
When she has so muchEnglish.

3281
02:38:39.930 --> 02:38:41.330
Let me speak, sir,

3282
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:43.700
For heaven now bids me;

3283
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:45.730
and the words I utter letnone think flattery,

3284
02:38:45.730 --> 02:38:47.500
for they'll find 'emtruth.

3285
02:38:48.730 --> 02:38:52.470
This royal infant--heavenstill move about her!--

3286
02:38:52.470 --> 02:38:53.630
Though in her cradle,

3287
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:55.370
yet now promises upon thisland

3288
02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:57.130
a thousand thousandblessings,

3289
02:38:57.130 --> 02:39:00.800
Which time shall bring toripeness:

3290
02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:01.800
she shall be--

3291
02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.270
but few now living canbehold that goodness--

3292
02:39:05.270 --> 02:39:07.330
A pattern to all princesliving with her,

3293
02:39:07.330 --> 02:39:09.000
And all that shallsucceed:

3294
02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.530
Saba was never morecovetous of wisdom

3295
02:39:11.530 --> 02:39:12.700
and fair virtue

3296
02:39:12.700 --> 02:39:15.330
Than this pure soulshall be:

3297
02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:19.200
all princely graces,

3298
02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:24.130
That mould up such amighty piece as this is,

3299
02:39:24.130 --> 02:39:26.430
With all the virtues thatattend the good,

3300
02:39:26.430 --> 02:39:29.770
Shall still be doubled onher:

3301
02:39:29.770 --> 02:39:33.000
truth shall nurse her,

3302
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.330
Holy and heavenly thoughtsstill counsel her:

3303
02:39:36.330 --> 02:39:38.300
She shall be loved andfear'd:

3304
02:39:38.300 --> 02:39:40.470
her own shall bless her;

3305
02:39:40.470 --> 02:39:44.030
Her foes shake like afield of beaten corn,

3306
02:39:44.030 --> 02:39:48.070
And hang their heads withsorrow:

3307
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:51.400
good grows with her:

3308
02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.800
In her days every manshall eat in safety,

3309
02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:55.300
Under his own vine, whathe plants;

3310
02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:58.470
and sing the merry songs ofpeace to all his neighbours:

3311
02:39:58.470 --> 02:40:01.600
God shall be truly known;

3312
02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:02.770
and those about her

3313
02:40:02.770 --> 02:40:06.970
from her shall read theperfect ways of honour,

3314
02:40:06.970 --> 02:40:10.400
And by those claim theirgreatness,

3315
02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:12.030
not by blood.

3316
02:40:14.030 --> 02:40:18.930
Nor shall this peace sleepwith her:

3317
02:40:18.930 --> 02:40:21.070
but as when the bird ofwonder dies,

3318
02:40:21.070 --> 02:40:22.530
the maiden phoenix,

3319
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:24.730
Her ashes new createanother heir,

3320
02:40:24.730 --> 02:40:27.400
As great in admiration asherself;

3321
02:40:28.570 --> 02:40:33.300
So shall she leave herblessedness to one,

3322
02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:34.970
When heaven shall call her

3323
02:40:34.970 --> 02:40:38.130
from this cloud ofdarkness,

3324
02:40:38.130 --> 02:40:40.470
Who from the sacred ashesof her honour

3325
02:40:40.470 --> 02:40:46.070
Shall star-like rise, asgreat in fame as she was,

3326
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:51.070
And so stand fix'd:

3327
02:40:51.070 --> 02:40:55.470
peace, plenty, love,truth, terror,

3328
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:59.170
That were the servants tothis chosen infant,

3329
02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:05.230
Shall then be his, andlike a vine grow to him:

3330
02:41:05.230 --> 02:41:06.870
Wherever the bright sun ofheaven shall shine,

3331
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:08.630
His honour and thegreatness of his name

3332
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:12.330
Shall be, and make newnations:

3333
02:41:12.330 --> 02:41:14.770
he shall flourish,

3334
02:41:14.770 --> 02:41:16.400
And, like a mountaincedar,

3335
02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:20.930
reach his branches to allthe plains about him:

3336
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:26.730
our children's childrenshall see this,

3337
02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:29.570
and bless heaven.

3338
02:41:30.930 --> 02:41:34.630
Thou speakest wonders.

3339
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:38.600
She shall be, to thehappiness of England,

3340
02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:41.230
An aged princess;

3341
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:42.570
many days shall see her,

3342
02:41:42.570 --> 02:41:45.900
And yet no day without adeed to crown it.

3343
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.300
Would I had known nomore!

3344
02:41:51.770 --> 02:41:52.830
but she must die,

3345
02:41:52.830 --> 02:41:56.930
She must, the saints musthave her; yet a virgin,

3346
02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:00.800
A most unspotted lilyshall she pass

3347
02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:03.600
To the ground,

3348
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:06.530
and all the world shallmourn her.

3349
02:42:07.970 --> 02:42:08.930
O lord archbishop,

3350
02:42:08.930 --> 02:42:10.800
Thou hast made me now aman!

3351
02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.900
never, before this happychild, did I get any thing:

3352
02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:16.730
This oracle of comfort hasso pleased me,

3353
02:42:16.730 --> 02:42:18.430
That when I am in heaven

3354
02:42:18.430 --> 02:42:22.130
I shall desire to see whatthis child does,

3355
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:24.130
and praise my Maker.

3356
02:42:26.030 --> 02:42:27.630
I thank ye all.

3357
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:28.770
To you, my good lordmayor,

I have received muchhonour by your presence,

3361
02:42:35.530 --> 02:42:37.230
And ye shall find methankful.

3362
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:40.700
Lead the way, lords:

3363
02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:42.500
Ye must all see the queen,and she must thank ye,

3364
02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:44.200
She will be sick else.

3365
02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:46.300
This day, no man think hasbusiness at his house;

3366
02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:48.870
for all shall stay:

3367
02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:53.170
This little one shall makeit holiday.

3368
02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.200
