(Beck)
I think she's so many people's

only safety net.

15
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.039
(Bo Derek)
There's been times where

16
00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:43.210
I went hungry and she
brought over food for me,

17
00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.379
you know, she would go
to the store and buy food.

18
00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.130
(Grace)
And I could call Miss Major

19
00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.383
and she always picked up
the phone when I called,

20
00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:51.134
no matter what time it is.

21

(Valerie)
We get to call her things

22
00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.514
like sage, right?

23
00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:55.682
Wise.

24
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.101

folks out and spitting tacks.

(Melenie)
I know mama

26
00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.563
she's a dirty little vixen.

27
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:02.564
She really is.

28
00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:04.439
She plays innocent
but she's not.

29
00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:06.568
Not by the least.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:07.860
(Tumeka)
She's a phenomenal woman.

31
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.446
When she was in her 30s
and her in 20s

32
00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:13.783
she was advocating
for transgender rights.

33
00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:16.451
And to this day
she still does that.

34
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:17.579
(Smitty)
Major's told me she really

35
00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:20.707
doesn't care whether
you call her he, or she.

36
00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:23.668
She's a mother, she's a father,
she's a grandmother,

37
00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:24.794
a grandfather.

38
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.421
She's a little bit of everything
and she's really doesn't care.

Her methods and her legacy

is frightening
to the powers that be.

(Angela Davis)
She is our leader!

42
00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.513
She is showing us
how to do this work,

43
00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:37.557
so thank you so much Miss Major.

44
00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:38.348
(Major)
I don't know why

45
00:01:38.558 --> 00:01:39.601
I'm still here.

46
00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:41.644
I guess I still have stuff
to complain about,

47
00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:45.940
bitch about, and try to change
as much as humanly possible.

48
00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:49.611
And wake people up
to who my community is.

49
00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:50.570
(Major)
We have to look out

50
00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:52.614
for one another
because we're all we've got.

51
00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:54.364
The rest of the world
really doesn't give a shit

whether we live or die.

53
00:01:55.783 --> 00:01:57.117
And the thing is,
when the dust settles,

54
00:01:57.326 --> 00:01:58.703
I want a whole bunch
of transgender girls

55
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.705
to stand up and say
I'm still fucking here.

(Major)
I met Angela Davis years ago,

58
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.681
so I'm excited to talk
with her again on

59
00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.889
an even more personal level
since this is for the TGIJP.

60
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.690
So I think it's going
to be really exciting.

61
00:03:08.898 --> 00:03:11.233
This brunch, I'm so nervous.

62
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.694
But I can't afford
to be nervous

63
00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:13.861
or they're drive me
really crazy.

64
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.445
(Melenie)
These Mama.

65
00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:20.159
(Major)
So I have to... uh, no.

66
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:21.451
(Melenie)
But that one is really pretty.

67
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:24.956
(Major)
Those make too much noise.

68
00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:25.998
No. [laughs]

69
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.043
These are my girls,
they work with me,

70
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:29.961
they're my daughters.

71
00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:32.505
They're Janetta and Melenie.

72
00:03:32.714 --> 00:03:33.422
So it's been good.

73
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:35.717
They got here a little bit
earlier than I was expecting,

74
00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:38.720
so we've been running around,
puttering ever since then.

75
00:03:38.928 --> 00:03:43.928
Hand me the pill thing
up on the top shelf.

76
00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:48.104
Oh god these damn pills.

77
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.692
These are for my heart
and my kidney because

78
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.736
I'm a transplant person.

79
00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:59.615
I got a new kidney in '08
from a dear friend of mine

80
00:03:59.824 --> 00:04:03.745
from Los Angeles, Thom.

81
00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:06.539
And so now
I'm on these forever.

82
00:04:06.748 --> 00:04:07.330
(Janetta)
But that's okay,

83
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.916

Batman Cadillacs with
the fly wings in the back,

87
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:45.661
and we all went out to eat
and she takes off on Howard

88
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.206
and 6th Street
like a bat out of hell.

89
00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.750
And we're just flying down
the street, and I'm like

90
00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.170
oh my God, so Shania said
"Hold on girl!

91

I think a lot of people have

93
00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.423
a lot to say about
how Major drives.

94
00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:00.802
My current take on it is
I try to close my eyes

95
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.636
as much as possible...

although she has slowed down
a little bit some.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.314
But prayer is really
what I've found is

99
00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:16.776
the most successful thing
in dealing with her driving.

a little bit about

what we do at TGI Justice.

117

We do political education,

gender queer, gender variant,

119

intersex people to advocate
for their selves

(Major)
Our mail nights are

123
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.740
a couple times a month,
we get people to come over

124
00:06:45.948 --> 00:06:48.159
and help us read the mail
and then answer it

125
00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:50.536
and send them what they need.

126
00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.371
(Janetta)
Mail night was primarily set up

127
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.582
to just send information
and resources.

128
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.170
We've become a surrogate family
to a lot of people in prison.

129
00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:01.756
You know, they constantly
when they write us

130
00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:04.550
they're like "hi family,
how are things going,

131
00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.552
give everybody
in the office a hug."

132
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:09.429
And no matter what we send them
they always respond back

133
00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.806
and say thank you.

134
00:07:11.015 --> 00:07:12.558
(Trisha)
Even just one sentence,

135
00:07:12.767 --> 00:07:15.686
hi how are you, means a lot
to the girls that are in there,

136
00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:17.688
that doesn't get anything
from their family.

137
00:07:17.897 --> 00:07:19.357
(Kathy)
The work TGI does is

138
00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:20.733
very important because
no body else does it.

139
00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:22.568
The girls in prison,
the boys in prison,

140
00:07:22.777 --> 00:07:23.694
they take a lot of shit.

141
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:37.750
(Kathy)
You know, they take shit

142
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.294
from the corrupt guards,
they take shit from the inmates,

143
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.505
they take shit from every angle
and it's nice to have

144
00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:43.631
somebody in your corner.

145
00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.966
(Melenie)
And ladies and gentlemen,

146
00:07:45.174 --> 00:07:47.677
it is my esteemed and privileged
honor to introduce Angela Davis.

147
00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:50.513
[cheering and applause]

148

(Angela Davis)
So, good afternoon everyone.

149
00:07:54.183 --> 00:07:58.854
It is really wonderful
to be here at this gathering,

150
00:07:59.063 --> 00:08:04.063
and when I was asked to
participate I said absolutely.

151
00:08:05.444 --> 00:08:08.030
Because this is one
of the most important

152
00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:13.239
organizations in the country
that addresses issues

153
00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:20.001
of trans women in prison,
largely trans women of color,

154
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:23.838
but that of course
is the disproportionate-

155
00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:26.549
there's a disproportionate
number of trans women

156
00:08:26.757 --> 00:08:29.927
of color behind bars.

157
00:08:30.136 --> 00:08:34.557
But in the process,
shedding light on so many

158
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:39.765
aspects of the prison system
and the prison industrial complex

159
00:08:40.771 --> 00:08:44.567
that we would otherwise
not be aware of.

160
00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:47.695
(Major)
We're at the office at TGIJP,

161
00:08:47.903 --> 00:08:51.157
Transgender Gender Variant
and Intersex Justice Project.

162
00:08:51.323 --> 00:08:54.285
Well what we do is that
we work on trying to get rid

163
00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:57.288
of the abuses and the suffering
that transgender women

164
00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:00.249
of color go through
in the prison system.

165
00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:05.296
It started with Alex Lee,
he saw and noticed the abuses

166
00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:08.215
that were going on when
he was going to law school,

167
00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:13.424
and then he started TIP
and then from that it evolved

168
00:09:14.972 --> 00:09:17.517
into this, as things
went on and changed.

169
00:09:17.725 --> 00:09:21.562
I came along pretty early
and just worked with him a lot.

170
00:09:21.771 --> 00:09:26.108
When he left I became
the executive director.

171
00:09:26.317 --> 00:09:28.861
So the exciting thing
for us was,

172
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:34.070
we were the first Black
transgender ran organization

173
00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:36.577
that was involved
with social justice.

174
00:09:36.786 --> 00:09:38.287
(BobbieJean Baker)
Don't many trans women

175
00:09:38.496 --> 00:09:41.082
once they're released
from prison actually come

176
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:46.290
into an agency that advocates
for prisoners.

177
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.591
So it's a challenge trying
to get people involved.

178
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.052
But Major is very persistent.

179
00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:54.470
Very nagging.

180
00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.305
And every time she see you:
Queen!

181
00:09:56.515 --> 00:09:57.431
We need to talk girl.

182
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.974
I know you just got out,
you're trying to get

183
00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:01.561
your life together,
stuff's going on for you

184
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:03.687
and all that, but you need
to come back over here,

185
00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:05.940
help read some of these letters,
talk to some people

186
00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:07.942
who are still there.

187
00:10:08.484 --> 00:10:09.610
(Alex)
So prisons are basically

188
00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:13.114
a concentrated torture situation
for a lot of trans women.

189
00:10:13.322 --> 00:10:15.908
(Trisha)
I was ridiculed.

190
00:10:16.117 --> 00:10:20.371
I was raped by the inmates
and the officers

191
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:21.789
who worked the penitentiary.

192
00:10:22.123 --> 00:10:22.748
(Billie)
If other inmates see

193
00:10:22.998 --> 00:10:26.335
the prison guards disrespecting us,
then they feel like

194
00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:28.921
its carte blanche that
they can disrespect us too.

195
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.215
People will pass you around,
people will buy you

196
00:10:31.423 --> 00:10:33.425
and sell you, without
you even knowing it.

197
00:10:33.634 --> 00:10:35.886
I myself, I've never been
to prison, but I've been

198
00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:37.847
in jail a few times.

199
00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:41.725
And once that doors slams,
it's open season,

200
00:10:41.934 --> 00:10:43.936
you know you're a marked person.

201
00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:47.940
[music]

202
00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:48.899
(Bo Derek)
They don't want to give you

203
00:10:49.108 --> 00:10:51.777
your hormones if you're
a transgender woman.

204
00:10:51.986 --> 00:10:54.780
They don't want to keep you
away from the people

205
00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:58.535
who want to rape us
because we're easy prey.

206
00:10:58.742 --> 00:10:59.660
(Alex)
So, numerically I think

207
00:10:59.869 --> 00:11:01.662
there are more people
who fall under the umbrella

208
00:11:01.871 --> 00:11:03.664
of gender variant or gender
non-conforming who are actually

209
00:11:03.873 --> 00:11:05.374
sitting in prison
or jail because

210
00:11:05.584 --> 00:11:07.877
their gender presentation,
their gender identity

211
00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:08.878
makes it hard for them
to participate

212
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:10.713
in legal economy activities.

213
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:12.549
(Janetta)
When you can't get a legal job,

214
00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:16.427
you have to turn to street
economics in order to survive.

215
00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:19.013
You still have to survive.

216
00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:22.474
We have to be housed and fed
and clothed.

217
00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:23.434
(Malachi)
I think there's this

218
00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:26.854
huge mythology of "It's murderers,
and rapists, and people

219
00:11:27.062 --> 00:11:29.773
to be scared of" and it's
our brothers, our sisters,

220
00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:33.485
our aunties
and it's everyone in between.

221
00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:36.739
If rehabilitation or ability
to succeed in this world

222
00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:40.868
is really your goal,
then our people could be

223
00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:45.331
much better taken care of
in different settings, I believe.

224
00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:47.416
[Narrated by Major]
The number of people

225
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.505
incarcerated in the U.S.
has increased 500%

226
00:11:52.796 --> 00:11:55.550
in the past 30 years.

227
00:12:47.309 --> 00:12:48.102
(Morgan)
And so people are being

228
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.647
literally criminalized,
made criminals

229
00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:52.398
for how they're surviving.

230
00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:55.652
And we have to look at what
kind of society sets people up

231
00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:58.445
and says "Well, you don't
have what you need,

232
00:12:58.655 --> 00:12:59.947
you didn't pull yourself up
by your bootstraps

233
00:13:00.155 --> 00:13:01.824
so we're gonna
punish you for it.

234
00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.034
And whatever you do,
you're kind of gonna do wrong."

235
00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:06.829
(Malachi)
A lot of the girls and the guys

236
00:13:07.037 --> 00:13:08.623
are put in solitary confinement.

237
00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:14.461
(Janetta)
Transgender women end up

238
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:17.716
in the SHU solely based
on the fact that

239
00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:21.302
they are transgender
and a lot of times the officers

240
00:13:21.511 --> 00:13:22.721
just don't want to deal with us.

241
00:13:22.928 --> 00:13:24.888
So if there's any problems
that come up,

242
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:28.267
the simple solution for them
is just to put us in the SHU

243
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:30.562
and call it
for our own protection.

244
00:13:34.106 --> 00:13:36.191
(Major)
I'm signing the petition

245
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.611
to show support for
the people in Pelican Bay

246
00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:43.032
in the SHU with their hunger
strike for their five demands,

247
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.743
which are reasonable demands
considering the shit

248
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.411
that they have to go through.

249
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.913
And then be a part
of everybody's making sure

250
00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:51.332
that they stop this shit
that they're doing

251
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:54.711
to these people and so,
that's what I'm about to do now.

252
00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.963
One of our members who
has been in the SHU since

253
00:13:58.172 --> 00:14:02.510
her incarceration in
the federal prison up in Oregon,

254
00:14:02.719 --> 00:14:05.764
and the atrocities and stuff
that are happening up at

255
00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:10.971
Pelican Bay are going on in most
of the prisons in the country.

256
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:35.334
(Janetta)
Even when I was in the SHU

257
00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:39.380
for that very short period
of time, I was being harassed

258
00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:41.674
and sexually violated
by one person, and then

259
00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:46.882
basically I had to not complain
about anything because

260
00:14:47.429 --> 00:14:50.057
if I would have complained
about anything they would have

261
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.519
kept me in the SHU
for my safety.

262
00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:53.977
(Janetta)
The courts already gave you

263
00:14:54.186 --> 00:14:58.190
a sentence, but it's almost
like each guard and each warden,

264
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.360
they have their own sentence
that they want to put on you,

265
00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:05.155
to further marginalize you
and disenfranchise you

266
00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.826
and take away your value
and your worth.

267
00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:09.159
(Janetta)
In the SHU you don't have

268
00:15:09.368 --> 00:15:12.079
access to early release programs,
you don't have access

269
00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:16.041
to any rehabilitation,
any educational opportunities.

270
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.877
The meals are cold.

271
00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.962
It's very cold in the SHU.

272
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:21.046
They're damp.

273
00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:23.800
There's moisture
all over the walls.

274
00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:27.720
You get one blanket
and one sheet and one pillowcase

275
00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:31.390
and it's extremely cold,
you have to sleep in your jumpsuit.

276
00:15:31.599 --> 00:15:33.934
So many people have
different mental health issues,

277
00:15:34.143 --> 00:15:36.521
and it's like you got to
get used to all these screams

278
00:15:36.729 --> 00:15:39.982
and yells and cries for help.

279
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.190
And it's just like,
you'll go crazy in there.

280
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:48.949
You'll go crazy in there.

281
00:15:49.158 --> 00:15:50.409
(Janetta)
I was at a prison where I was

282
00:15:50.618 --> 00:15:52.369
the only transgender person,
and I can remember

283
00:15:52.579 --> 00:15:57.579
a lot of times calling
Mammy because I was just

284
00:15:57.876 --> 00:16:00.503
having such a difficult time
and sometimes I just needed

285
00:16:00.712 --> 00:16:05.215
to hear her voice to give me
the strength to move forward

286
00:16:05.424 --> 00:16:06.843
from one step to the other.

287
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.514
So I often called her
and she supported me 100%.

288
00:16:11.723 --> 00:16:15.560
Since I've been out
she's been there for me 100%,

289
00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:19.856
she immediately
got me involved in TGIJP.

290
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.275
(Lala)
Major walked me through a lot of it

291
00:16:23.484 --> 00:16:26.153
and it is what it is and do
what you have to do to stay safe.

292
00:16:26.361 --> 00:16:28.573
So she relates
and she understands

293
00:16:28.781 --> 00:16:30.240
and she just accepts.

294
00:16:30.449 --> 00:16:33.410
It's what every family
should be.

295
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.038
It's the definition
of unconditional love,

296
00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.206
no matter what.

297
00:16:38.207 --> 00:16:39.584
(Grace)
Coming from Africa

298
00:16:39.792 --> 00:16:43.922
and being broken and so forth,
Miss Major, she gave me hope.

299
00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:46.006
She showed me how to be a lady.

300
00:16:46.215 --> 00:16:48.133
She showed me how to dress.

301
00:16:48.342 --> 00:16:50.302
From people calling me
a football player now

302
00:16:50.512 --> 00:16:53.598
they call me look
at that sexy bitch.

303
00:16:53.806 --> 00:16:56.350
I'm a product of TGI Justice.

304
00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:59.604
And now when I write
the children that are in jails

305
00:16:59.812 --> 00:17:02.231
and prison and they read
my story and see I did

306
00:17:02.439 --> 00:17:05.527
three years in immigration
prison and I did one year

307
00:17:05.735 --> 00:17:06.945
in San Quentin.

308
00:17:07.152 --> 00:17:09.572
And I made it through.

309
00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:13.116
(BobbieJean)
I've seen her sit up there

310
00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:16.829
and buy money orders, and
put money on people's books,

311
00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:18.372
go see them.

312
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:20.457
I'm like, you don't
even know these people!

313
00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:23.126
Yes I do, they're trans,
and they're in jail.

314
00:17:23.335 --> 00:17:24.003
That's enough.

315
00:17:24.837 --> 00:17:26.213
(Major)
And that spend a mile

316
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:27.632
in my shoes, fuck my shoes.

317
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.384
Wear my dress, my wig,
my hair, my perfume,

318
00:17:30.552 --> 00:17:31.844
and then go out there.

319
00:17:32.177 --> 00:17:33.930
And after you get beat up
a couple of times

320
00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.515
and you come back here
to catch your breath,

321
00:17:35.807 --> 00:17:38.643
you may not even be safe
in your own home because

322
00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:41.061
the motherfucker you sleeping
with didn't get high yet

323
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.897
and he's gonna kick
your ass because

324
00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:45.274
you don't have enough money.

325
00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:47.986
We need to make
the girls feel safe.

326
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.865
Especially TGIJP, because
we understand what it's like,

327
00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:55.743
we have three girls
who are helping me to run this

328
00:17:55.952 --> 00:17:57.870
who just got out of prison.

329
00:17:58.078 --> 00:17:59.872
And we're trying
to help other girls,

330
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.415
to get them in that position.

331
00:18:01.624 --> 00:18:05.085
Because it is so empowering
to stand on your own two feet

332
00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:08.923
with nobody holding you,
and there you are.

333
00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:10.967
You know what I mean,
godammit that's

334
00:18:11.174 --> 00:18:13.511
the most wonderful thing
you can think of.

335
00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:19.219
[jazz music]

336
00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:28.358
(Major)
I was born in Chicago Illinois

337
00:18:28.568 --> 00:18:31.361
in 194mmmm.

338
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:34.364
My mother's name was
Edgar Mae Griffin-Gracy.

339
00:18:34.574 --> 00:18:37.367
My father's name was
Leroy Rudolph Gracy.

340
00:18:37.577 --> 00:18:40.955
They called my father Honey,
that was his name.

341
00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:44.374
And my mother,
most people called her Lulu.

342
00:18:44.584 --> 00:18:49.584
On my birth certificate,
it's Major Gracy.

343
00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:51.799
And I took on Griffin
because that was

344
00:18:52.008 --> 00:18:53.760
my mother's maiden name.

345
00:18:53.968 --> 00:18:57.680
And I wanted her to be
a part of who I was.

346
00:18:57.889 --> 00:19:00.390
So I'd heard that
in Latin countries

347
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.600
you had both names, so I thought
oh okay, that will work for me!

348
00:19:05.813 --> 00:19:07.314
And then I liked the way
it sounded,

349
00:19:07.523 --> 00:19:11.401
Major Griffin-Gracy,
that's so cool.

350
00:19:11.611 --> 00:19:14.404
So that's how I wound up
back at being Miss Major.

351
00:19:14.614 --> 00:19:17.575
I don't remember what year
it was, but I'm 73.

352
00:19:17.784 --> 00:19:19.409
I've had six
different birthdays,

353
00:19:19.619 --> 00:19:23.413
all of them in October,
all around the 25th,

354
00:19:23.623 --> 00:19:28.623
the only thing that changed
is the year, from '40 to '49,

355
00:19:31.756 --> 00:19:36.385
so somewhere in there
is an age I'm actually at.

356
00:19:36.594 --> 00:19:40.139
And who cares, you know?
So what the hell.

357
00:19:40.347 --> 00:19:42.642
My sister and I were really
close, she passed away.

358
00:19:44.102 --> 00:19:47.270
And I was very close to my mom
even though she couldn't

359
00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:51.109
understand my
transitioning stuff.

360
00:19:51.734 --> 00:19:54.946
I remember going back
after I'd been on hormones

361
00:19:55.278 --> 00:19:58.783
and had breasts growing,
and flashed her

362
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:02.161
[laughing]
and she fainted!

363
00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.788
[laughs]

364
00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:06.040
I was so surprised I stood there
looking at her going

365
00:20:06.248 --> 00:20:06.874
"Oh my gosh!

366
00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:08.960
She fainted!

367
00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:10.252
What am I supposed to do?"

368
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.294
[laughing]

369
00:20:11.754 --> 00:20:13.589
So of course my dad came
and threw me out,

370
00:20:13.923 --> 00:20:16.341
which was highly
understandable.

371
00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:20.179
The theory was
that it's a phase.

372
00:20:20.513 --> 00:20:23.599
I'm going to grow out of it,
as I turned 40

373
00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:25.977
[laughing]
and then 50.

374
00:20:26.185 --> 00:20:27.729
It's a phase.

375
00:20:27.937 --> 00:20:29.647
He's gonna grow out of it.

376
00:20:29.856 --> 00:20:31.440
I woulda wondered --
I would get tired

377
00:20:31.649 --> 00:20:34.234
of telling myself that,
you know what I mean.

378
00:20:34.443 --> 00:20:37.196
But they held onto that
until mother passed away.

379
00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:40.950
She still was sure that
next year was gonna be the year

380
00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:45.287
I became the man
I was supposed to be.

381
00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.665
And it was so hard explaining
to her, I am the man

382
00:20:47.874 --> 00:20:48.875
I'm supposed to be.

383
00:20:49.083 --> 00:20:50.710
I'm lovely.

384
00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:57.466
My sister couldn't handle it
at all, Cookie was

385
00:20:57.675 --> 00:20:59.426
five years younger than me.

386
00:20:59.635 --> 00:21:02.597
And it was just
so much trauma for her.

387
00:21:02.805 --> 00:21:05.265
And when I would send
pictures back I'd send them

388
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:07.560
to my sister to see
how I was doing in New York

389
00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:09.937
and what I looked like
and what was going on.

390
00:21:10.146 --> 00:21:11.147
And it was just
so heartbreaking

391
00:21:11.354 --> 00:21:14.108
when she burned
all those pictures.

392
00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:16.027
And my mother never got over it.

393
00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:20.363
She had like three boxes
full of pictures.

394
00:21:20.573 --> 00:21:24.160
And every holiday, well
we're gonna put them in a book.

395
00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.245
[laughing]

396
00:21:26.453 --> 00:21:30.499
No one ever bought a book,
and they never left the box.

397
00:21:30.708 --> 00:21:32.375
So Cookie told mother
one year that she was

398
00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:35.378
going to do it for her.

399
00:21:35.588 --> 00:21:39.217
Mother got all excited
and Cookie came back

400
00:21:39.424 --> 00:21:40.927
and put a bunch of ashes
in front of my mother

401
00:21:41.135 --> 00:21:42.427
on her table.

402
00:21:42.637 --> 00:21:44.639
Mother goes
"Well, what is this?"

403
00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:46.557
"Oh, those are your pictures."

404
00:21:46.766 --> 00:21:49.811
And she turned around
and walked out.

405
00:21:50.978 --> 00:21:53.022
So, that was between them.

406
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:56.358
I had my own issues
with my folks.

407
00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.401
It be what it be.

408
00:22:00.071 --> 00:22:02.824
Cookie killed herself
when she was 26.

409
00:22:03.032 --> 00:22:05.660
In Peoria, Illinois.

410
00:22:06.744 --> 00:22:10.873
It was pretty devastating,
there was nothing I could do

411
00:22:11.082 --> 00:22:13.584
to help her or save her.

412
00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:16.336
And I would have liked to.

413
00:22:16.546 --> 00:22:18.172
My dad made a mistake
of telling me one day that,

414
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.216
"Well, she took
the easy way out."

415
00:22:20.423 --> 00:22:21.509
That's not easy.

416
00:22:21.717 --> 00:22:22.301
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.512
You can say that
all you fucking want to.

418
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.347
That is not an easy thing to do.

419
00:22:27.557 --> 00:22:29.725
Because I think there's
an innate thing in us

420
00:22:29.934 --> 00:22:33.980
to want to live,
see the next day.

421
00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:43.281
Oh my transition,
it was years in the making.

422
00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:47.159
It's not something that
just happens overnight.

423
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.745
You think about these things,
you have these feelings

424
00:22:49.954 --> 00:22:54.954
that you just can't shake,
you just can't get away from them.

425
00:22:57.795 --> 00:23:00.590
I happened to be of course
at home, my mother

426
00:23:00.798 --> 00:23:01.924
and dad were out.

427
00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:04.093
And I went through my mother's
closet and put on one

428
00:23:04.302 --> 00:23:05.803
of the little dresses
that would fit,

429
00:23:06.012 --> 00:23:07.429
and was flitting
around the house.

430
00:23:07.638 --> 00:23:10.558
And then I ventured
into the backyard, and then

431
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:14.270
I went to the garage door,
stood by the door panting,

432
00:23:14.477 --> 00:23:17.982
that I'd come to the garage
and someone might have seen me,

433
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:20.860
and then I ran back
into the house and stuff.

434
00:23:21.068 --> 00:23:25.781
And it wasn't until I met
this older queen in Chicago,

435
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:30.990
her name was Kitty,
and she dressed me up

436
00:23:33.122 --> 00:23:35.625
and showed me how to
put on make up and stuff.

437
00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:38.711
And it was kind of like
the movie with Natalie Wood,

438
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.631
the Gypsy movie where
she gets dressed up in that scene,

439
00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:44.926
and she's so surprised
how pretty she was.

440
00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:48.721
(Natalie Wood)
I'm a pretty girl Mama.

441
00:23:51.015 --> 00:23:52.808
(Major)
That's exactly

442
00:23:53.017 --> 00:23:55.728
what happened to me, you know.

443
00:23:55.937 --> 00:23:58.064
When Kitty was through with me
and I looked at myself

444
00:23:58.272 --> 00:24:03.027
in the mirror, I was
absolutely dumbfounded, you know.

445
00:24:03.235 --> 00:24:06.572
It was like "there's Major!

446
00:24:06.781 --> 00:24:07.949
Where the hell have you been?"

447
00:24:08.157 --> 00:24:09.033
[laughs]

448
00:24:10.868 --> 00:24:12.703
(Tracie)
Being transgender women,

449
00:24:12.912 --> 00:24:15.623
and being transgender women
of color, and coming out

450
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:19.627
in the late '60s and early '70s,
there was a landscape

451
00:24:19.835 --> 00:24:23.463
already out there, the landscape
itself was not healthy at all,

452
00:24:23.673 --> 00:24:28.468
there was the street, there was
the clubs, there was the stage,

453
00:24:28.678 --> 00:24:29.804
and there were pageants.

454
00:24:30.012 --> 00:24:33.182
And then coming from home,
whether we were put out,

455
00:24:33.391 --> 00:24:35.518
whether we left, whether
we were treated violently,

456
00:24:35.726 --> 00:24:37.311
or however, this is
what we brought

457
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.105
to our new environment.

458
00:24:39.313 --> 00:24:43.150
And many, many trans women
of color leave home early in life.

459
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:48.734
[music]

460
00:24:53.035 --> 00:24:55.705
(Tumeka)
I ended up leaving home at 18,

461
00:24:55.913 --> 00:24:59.792
I was given $200, a car,
and told to never come back

462
00:25:00.001 --> 00:25:04.547
unless I come home
and be a man in public

463
00:25:04.755 --> 00:25:06.132
and be a girl inside the house.

464
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.677
Well, I can't do that,
I have to be me 24/7.

465
00:25:09.885 --> 00:25:13.514
So I've been disowned,
cut off, and I've been alone,

466
00:25:13.723 --> 00:25:15.725
I've done a lot of things,
nefarious things,

467
00:25:15.933 --> 00:25:17.560
that I am not proud of.

468
00:25:17.768 --> 00:25:20.521
But nor would I have changed
if I could go back in time

469
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:21.605
and change.

470
00:25:21.814 --> 00:25:23.733
I would not change it
because it helped me grow

471
00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:25.985
and become who I am today.

472
00:25:26.193 --> 00:25:28.404
If my family loved me,
I wouldn't have

473
00:25:28.612 --> 00:25:29.947
probably been a prostitute.

474
00:25:30.156 --> 00:25:32.700
I wouldn't have probably been
a booster going

475
00:25:32.908 --> 00:25:34.660
in stores stealing to survive.

476
00:25:34.869 --> 00:25:38.122
I probably wouldn't mess
with this dope dealer

477
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.667
or this pimp, or something,
because they were the only one

478
00:25:41.876 --> 00:25:44.420
that wasn't ashamed
to show me love in public.

479
00:25:44.628 --> 00:25:45.713
(Alexis)
So, I got to live me

480
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.465
though for now.

481
00:25:47.673 --> 00:25:50.092
And this is who I am,
and this is who I'm going to be.

482
00:25:50.301 --> 00:25:51.761
You don't get
a chance to choose.

483
00:25:51.969 --> 00:25:53.763
(Andrea)
That's true, it chooses you.

484
00:25:53.971 --> 00:25:57.767
I tried to tell my mother that,
who was a therapist.

485
00:25:57.975 --> 00:25:59.727
And also a gangsta.

486
00:25:59.935 --> 00:26:01.479
(Valerie)
Don't pick on us therapists!

487
00:26:01.687 --> 00:26:02.730
(Andrea)
And also a gangsta.

488
00:26:02.938 --> 00:26:05.399
And she used to wake me up
in the middle of the night

489
00:26:05.608 --> 00:26:10.321
with a gun to my head
and say you know I could kill you.

490
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:11.447
(Valerie)
Oh that was my father,

491
00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:12.740
did they know each other?

492
00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:13.991
(Andrea)
And she would say you know

493
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.411
I could kill you right now,
you know they kill Black boys,

494
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.372
you know I could say
you were breaking in.

495
00:26:20.581 --> 00:26:22.958
And I'd be like!

496
00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:25.961
(Trisha)
I was thrown out to the wolves.

497
00:26:26.462 --> 00:26:30.341
And a lot of children
committed suicide as we may remember.

498
00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.384
(Valerie)
My father wanted me

499
00:26:32.593 --> 00:26:36.055
to be his son, oh poor thing.

500
00:26:36.263 --> 00:26:39.266
And he was a career Navy man.

501
00:26:39.475 --> 00:26:42.394
And he loved putting
a gun to my head.

502
00:26:42.603 --> 00:26:46.649
And at first it was
I'll kill you and kill myself.

503
00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:49.860
And then when I turned around
14, 15, he went into this

504
00:26:50.069 --> 00:26:52.196
"I'll kill you
and do the time."

505
00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:55.366
And I thought now wait a minute
something's changed right there.

506
00:26:55.575 --> 00:26:58.410
You get to live,
something's happened.

507
00:26:58.619 --> 00:26:59.995
(Smitty)
When Major came around,

508
00:27:00.204 --> 00:27:02.123
they called her Mama Major.

509
00:27:02.331 --> 00:27:04.959
She was a, just
a warm welcoming Mama.

510
00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:06.669
(Trisha)
I seen a couple of the girls

511
00:27:06.877 --> 00:27:10.381
and a few other people
either call her Granny or Mom.

512
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.217
So I asked her, I said
do you mind if I call you Mom?

513
00:27:13.425 --> 00:27:18.013
And she said no I don't sweetie,
so I started calling her mom.

514
00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:19.014
(Malachi)
One of the reasons that

515
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:22.476
I call Miss Major "mama" is because,
when you're around

516
00:27:22.685 --> 00:27:27.231
Miss Major, she will stop
the whole world to look at you

517
00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:29.024
and to really see you.

518
00:27:29.233 --> 00:27:32.778
And she is able to see
the pain that you carry

519
00:27:32.987 --> 00:27:35.532
and the joy that you carry,
and there can be like

520
00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:38.784
5,000 phones ringing
and a foundation officer

521
00:27:38.993 --> 00:27:41.078
that's like waiting,
and she's gonna be like

522
00:27:41.287 --> 00:27:44.665
ok you need to wait, because
I'm taking care of this person.

523
00:27:44.874 --> 00:27:46.750
You just want to fold
in her arms and sit there

524
00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:49.504
for 30 years because
you feel safe there

525
00:27:49.712 --> 00:27:52.464
and you feel seen there
and beautiful.

526
00:27:52.673 --> 00:27:56.636
And I think, our people
don't get to feel that a lot.

527
00:27:56.844 --> 00:27:58.387
(Grace)
And I would be so tired,

528
00:27:58.597 --> 00:28:00.764
and I'd tell Mama put
my bags in the trunk of your car

529
00:28:00.973 --> 00:28:04.476
because I got no place to stay,
and Miss Major would take me

530
00:28:04.685 --> 00:28:06.687
to the New Pacific
and rent a hotel there

531
00:28:06.896 --> 00:28:08.981
and say sleep miss thing.

532
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:14.190
From there I knew
that someone cared.

533
00:28:14.486 --> 00:28:17.990
And whoever this woman was
I knew that was my mother

534
00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:20.242
and I asked her to please
be my mother.

535
00:28:21.536 --> 00:28:23.454
(Melenie)
And Mama, anyone who is

536
00:28:23.663 --> 00:28:26.415
really close to her
and who loves her and she loves

537
00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:29.835
and chooses, she's very
dysfunctional with us.

538
00:28:30.044 --> 00:28:30.836
All of us.

539
00:28:31.045 --> 00:28:35.007
And so if she's not,
if she doesn't give you grief

540
00:28:35.216 --> 00:28:38.093
or jabs at you or whatever,
you don't mean as much to her

541
00:28:38.302 --> 00:28:41.514
as someone that she does jab
and play around with,

542
00:28:41.722 --> 00:28:43.891
and you know, Mama how she is.

543
00:28:44.099 --> 00:28:47.895
"I'm gonna do no matter what,"
you know.

544
00:28:48.103 --> 00:28:50.231
So, it's very special for me.

545
00:28:50.439 --> 00:28:52.233
(BobbieJean)
I said I need someone

546
00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:54.276
to walk on this journey with me.

547
00:28:54.485 --> 00:28:56.946
And she said, I don't want
no more children,

548
00:28:57.154 --> 00:28:59.198
I've got enough gay children.

549
00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:02.284
I said well I don't need
no mama, I do need a grandmama,

550
00:29:02.493 --> 00:29:04.286
because I already had
a gay mother.

551
00:29:04.495 --> 00:29:06.706
And so she said, Ok,
just don't treat me

552
00:29:06.914 --> 00:29:10.292
like no grandmama,
I'm not old and shit.

553
00:29:10.502 --> 00:29:11.711
But I'll be your granny.

554
00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:14.547
And so a relationship
ensued from there.

555
00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:15.674
(Morgan)
I don't call Miss Major mama

556
00:29:15.881 --> 00:29:18.842
but I do call her
the Anna Wintour of TGIJP,

557
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:21.554
because she's our
editor in chief.

558
00:29:21.762 --> 00:29:24.557
And in the way that the editor
of Vogue is so clear

559
00:29:24.765 --> 00:29:27.351
on her purpose, Miss Major is
really clear on her purpose,

560
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:32.439
which is to love all of us
and to fight for all of us.

561
00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:36.860
And she's really powerful
and clear in that purpose.

562
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:40.281
(BobbieJean Baker)
She's been very instrumental

563
00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:45.489
in keeping me focused on
school, obtaining the necessary

564
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.665
certifications and knowledge
and training to do

565
00:29:48.872 --> 00:29:50.791
this work that I'm doing.

566
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.211
And she never wants to hear
the words "I can't."

567
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.254
Because you can.

568
00:29:56.297 --> 00:29:58.215
[instrumental music]

569
00:29:58.424 --> 00:29:59.216
(Major)
Like when I first got

570
00:29:59.425 --> 00:30:02.469
kicked out of college,
I was just stunned.

571
00:30:02.679 --> 00:30:06.098
I thought, wait a minute --
don't they need a minority?

572
00:30:06.307 --> 00:30:07.057
[laughs]

573
00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:11.186
I graduated early,
I graduated at 16.

574
00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:16.395
I wanted to get out
of Chicago so I went to Minnesota

575
00:30:16.609 --> 00:30:18.277
'cause I had an aunt
who lived there.

576
00:30:18.485 --> 00:30:20.237
They had the white boys

577
00:30:20.446 --> 00:30:21.740
of doom in Minnesota.

578
00:30:21.947 --> 00:30:25.242
Corn-fed, thick, tall.

579
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:28.412
Oh I thought going there
I would just be

580
00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:29.913
the queen of the ball, child.

581
00:30:30.122 --> 00:30:32.166
A Black girl with
all these white boys around?

582
00:30:32.374 --> 00:30:33.585
It'll be wonderful.

583
00:30:33.959 --> 00:30:36.420
So I was there, I was unpacking
my stuff and I only took

584
00:30:36.629 --> 00:30:39.340
a couple of dresses --
one little pair of shoes,

585
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:44.136
two wigs for evening
when I would zip out.

586
00:30:44.345 --> 00:30:48.349
My roommate found that stuff
when I was in one of my classes

587
00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:53.228
and when I came back my stuff
was sitting on my bed.

588
00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:56.106
So I said "What,
you wear dresses?"

589
00:30:56.315 --> 00:30:57.274
[laughs]

590
00:30:57.483 --> 00:31:00.152
He said, "No, I was looking
for something and I found those,

591
00:31:00.361 --> 00:31:01.862
and whose are those?"

592
00:31:02.071 --> 00:31:05.866
"Well, they're mine, stupid,
they're in my closet,

593
00:31:06.075 --> 00:31:07.284
they're mine."

594
00:31:07.493 --> 00:31:12.493
So he told everybody on
our floor that I wore dresses.

595
00:31:16.753 --> 00:31:19.296
The cute boys
didn't pay it any attention.

596
00:31:19.506 --> 00:31:21.508
They said, "Well,
if you do that, do you cook?"

597
00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:22.509
"Yeah, I can cook."

598
00:31:22.717 --> 00:31:25.344
"Oh, well you know there's
a kitchen at the far end."

599
00:31:25.553 --> 00:31:29.808
So I fixed breakfasts
and lunches and you know

600
00:31:30.015 --> 00:31:33.435
"I have some soup
and sandwiches in my room."

601
00:31:33.812 --> 00:31:36.188
[laughs]

602
00:31:38.023 --> 00:31:41.485
The dorm patron or whatever
the hell he was,

603
00:31:41.694 --> 00:31:44.238
he came in my room telling me,
"Well, you know this shit's

604
00:31:44.446 --> 00:31:46.533
gotta go --
we're not having this here."

605
00:31:46.741 --> 00:31:48.325
And you can't tell me
what to do.

606
00:31:48.535 --> 00:31:48.992
I'm grown.

607
00:31:49.201 --> 00:31:50.787
I don't know
what you're issue is.

608
00:31:50.994 --> 00:31:55.290
And so I went to class,
came back like a week later,

609
00:31:55.499 --> 00:31:59.587
they had all my stuff packed up,
had it by the door --

610
00:31:59.796 --> 00:32:00.630
and a little note on it.

611
00:32:00.839 --> 00:32:02.507
"It was really nice having
you here and the experience

612
00:32:02.715 --> 00:32:05.593
of meeting you was
really different.

613
00:32:05.802 --> 00:32:08.345
Bye."

614
00:32:08.555 --> 00:32:10.765
And off I had to go.

615

00:32:21.568 --> 00:32:26.568
what I missed, if I could have
gone, what could I have done?

618
00:32:27.699 --> 00:32:30.451
Could I have still held
onto my transgender self

619
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.620
and still done something?

620
00:32:32.829 --> 00:32:34.037
You know.

621
00:32:34.246 --> 00:32:35.790
So now when I see one
of the girls and they say,

622
00:32:35.998 --> 00:32:36.791
"Oh, well I'm late.

623
00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:38.375
I gotta go to class."

624
00:32:38.585 --> 00:32:41.588
Inside I dance around
like Snoopy in summertime.

625
00:32:41.796 --> 00:32:42.379
Hey!

626
00:32:42.589 --> 00:32:43.506
Yeah, godammit!

627
00:32:43.715 --> 00:32:45.215
You going to school!

628
00:32:45.424 --> 00:32:46.383
[laughs]

629
00:32:46.593 --> 00:32:47.552
(Tracie)
And I was trying to figure out

630
00:32:47.802 --> 00:32:50.304
what I wanted to do with
my life, I had no experience,

631
00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:52.640
I had no job experience,
and I wanted a career.

632
00:32:53.056 --> 00:32:56.519
So Major said, well you know
what I want some implants,

633
00:32:56.728 --> 00:32:57.812
I want a new pair of implants.

634
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.856
So I'm going to go
to City College

635
00:33:00.063 --> 00:33:03.776
to the financial aid office
to get a loan and get surgery,

636
00:33:03.902 --> 00:33:04.694
come go with me.

637
00:33:04.903 --> 00:33:06.153
I was like oh my god
I'm not going anywhere, because

638
00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:11.158
believe it or not I was so,
so afraid of going out in public,

639
00:33:11.659 --> 00:33:14.995
because of the harassment I had
experienced all my entire life.

640
00:33:15.204 --> 00:33:16.873
But I went,
because Major was with me.

641
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.666
Major was walking next to me.

642
00:33:18.958 --> 00:33:22.504
And we walked throughout
the whole campus, financial aid,

643
00:33:22.712 --> 00:33:25.965
the classrooms, the parking lot,
and then we left.

644
00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:29.343
Long story short, Major
did not go to City College.

645
00:33:29.552 --> 00:33:32.012
I went to City College.

646
00:33:32.221 --> 00:33:34.348
And I realized some years later
that she had walked me

647
00:33:34.557 --> 00:33:37.392
through that process
for my being comfortable.

648
00:33:37.602 --> 00:33:39.562
And that was one of the first
times that she was really

649
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:41.480
so, so supportive of me.

New York was wonderful.

652
00:33:56.621 --> 00:34:00.875
New York was the place
to be at that time.

653
00:34:01.083 --> 00:34:04.587
Everything was changing,
people's attitude

654
00:34:04.796 --> 00:34:07.464
about stuff was different.

655
00:34:07.674 --> 00:34:10.927
Women were starting
to burn their bras.

656
00:34:12.094 --> 00:34:15.347
One of the best things that
I really enjoyed

657
00:34:15.557 --> 00:34:17.391
about the '60s, was hookin'.

658
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.435
Hookin' was fabulous
in New York then.

659
00:34:20.645 --> 00:34:22.354
You know, the girls would be
walking down the middle

660
00:34:22.564 --> 00:34:24.774
of the street flipping grapes
and catching them

661
00:34:24.983 --> 00:34:28.402
and you know, licking on hotdogs
and stuff at the corner.

662
00:34:28.611 --> 00:34:31.405
And the tricks were
just everywhere.

663
00:34:31.614 --> 00:34:34.449
It was fabulous.

664
00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:39.496
And you made good money,
which was the best part about it.

My generation went through

666
00:34:44.502 --> 00:34:48.548
a time of we'll be out hooking,
you can only go out in

667
00:34:48.756 --> 00:34:52.467
any amount of safety
between midnight and 3:30 AM,

668
00:34:52.677 --> 00:34:53.553
that was it.

669
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:56.931
And then you had to learn,
after you learned to paint properly

670
00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.099
and wear the right dress
and find shoes that

671
00:34:59.308 --> 00:35:01.644
you were comfortable in,
how to run in them,

672
00:35:01.853 --> 00:35:06.649
change clothes, leap over cars,
pop up on the next corner

673
00:35:06.858 --> 00:35:09.068
with a new wig, another dress
and a different pair of shoes,

674
00:35:09.276 --> 00:35:13.031
and watch the police
run by chasing you.

675
00:35:14.657 --> 00:35:15.825

I got involved with a couple

680
00:35:22.707 --> 00:35:27.707
of drag shows back then,
the Jewelbox Revue

681
00:35:28.337 --> 00:35:29.672
and the Powder Puff Review.

682
00:35:29.881 --> 00:35:32.675
And they would go on
what's called the Chitlin' Circuit

683
00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:37.884
and perform, and it would be
25 men and 1 woman was their guise.

684
00:35:40.182 --> 00:35:44.937
And the only woman
in the whole little company

685
00:35:45.145 --> 00:35:50.145
was this guy named Storme DeLarverie
who was the male MC.

686
00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:55.907
And I was a showgirl because I was so tall.

687
00:35:58.576 --> 00:36:00.410
I knew Mal really well.

688
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.497
And she was their first
Black major act.

689
00:36:04.624 --> 00:36:06.042
And when Mal and I worked
together to try to

690
00:36:06.249 --> 00:36:09.211
get together an act, they said
they didn't want two Black girls

691
00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:12.214
as major acts in the show.

692
00:36:14.299 --> 00:36:16.928
We couldn't go
to the theaters painted.

693
00:36:17.136 --> 00:36:20.098
We had to go looking like men.

694
00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:22.892
And we had to paint there,
so that meant getting

695
00:36:23.101 --> 00:36:25.687
there three hours earlier
than the show.

696
00:36:25.895 --> 00:36:28.480
And then we couldn't leave done.

697
00:36:30.692 --> 00:36:34.070
The young queens like myself,
a couple of the dancers,

698
00:36:34.361 --> 00:36:35.613
"Miss thing,
I can paint at home.

699
00:36:35.822 --> 00:36:38.074
I don't need to be painting
there around all the musty old

700
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:39.701

God, Stonewall was

00:37:09.271 --> 00:37:11.065
a wonderful place to be in.

705
00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:14.234
Because all of the things
that you need to be around

706
00:37:14.443 --> 00:37:17.822
or see was there.

707
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.200
There was older gentlemen
there who were tricks

708
00:37:21.408 --> 00:37:22.242
and going to pay you money.

709
00:37:22.451 --> 00:37:25.830
There was trade there,
you know boys that hooked over

710
00:37:26.038 --> 00:37:29.416
on Broadway or on 5th Avenue
and would come there

711
00:37:29.625 --> 00:37:32.670
to spend their little bit
of money and stuff.

712
00:37:32.879 --> 00:37:37.299
There were other girls there,
there was an atmosphere

713
00:37:37.508 --> 00:37:42.508
of enjoying who we were,
you know, in our space.

714
00:37:44.182 --> 00:37:48.770
And one of the things
I remember about that day was,

715
00:37:48.978 --> 00:37:53.191
I think they had just
buried Judy Garland that day.

716
00:37:53.398 --> 00:37:55.943
And all I can remember
about that is,

717
00:37:57.069 --> 00:38:02.069
she had a casket full of lilies
that just brought you to tears

718
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.744
when you saw it on TV.

719
00:38:04.952 --> 00:38:07.705
Why it was on TV I have no idea.

720
00:38:08.623 --> 00:38:12.334
Stonewall wasn't on TV
and that should have been.

721
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.047
And what happened was
that night, it was just

722
00:38:16.255 --> 00:38:21.052
a matter of they used to do
that to us all the time.

723
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.597
Just come into the bar,
and the lights would go on

724
00:38:24.806 --> 00:38:27.850
and everybody would
just stream out.

725
00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:30.144
Nothing ever really had
to get said, because

726
00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:32.563
you knew just what had
to happen, you knew that's

727
00:38:32.772 --> 00:38:34.148
what the routine was.

728
00:38:34.314 --> 00:38:38.152
And it was just a night that,
it simply

729
00:38:38.694 --> 00:38:40.487
wasn't going to happen.

730
00:38:41.155 --> 00:38:43.157
It's just, it's a feeling
that you get,

731
00:38:43.323 --> 00:38:45.576
like when you go to a movie
and see something together

732
00:38:45.868 --> 00:38:48.621
and everybody ahs
and gasps at the same time?

733
00:38:48.955 --> 00:38:53.458
That's the feeling,
you just knew, everyone just

734
00:38:53.793 --> 00:38:57.588
looked at one another
and sat down.

735
00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:01.466
Not leaving,
not going anywhere.

736
00:39:01.717 --> 00:39:04.136
You know the girls,
we can put up with some stuff,

737
00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:06.055
you know,
but I guess it was just like

738
00:39:06.264 --> 00:39:08.558
at that time, we were done.

739
00:39:08.766 --> 00:39:12.352
Can't take any more,
this has got to stop here.

740
00:39:12.854 --> 00:39:17.650
After that, you heard
well someone threw a shoe,

741
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.653
someone threw a beer bottle
or whatever have you.

742
00:39:20.862 --> 00:39:23.531
I don't know who threw what,
and it doesn't matter.

743
00:39:23.781 --> 00:39:26.868
All that mattered was
we were bustin' the cops' ass.

744
00:39:29.452 --> 00:39:34.452
And when the community
at large got involved,

745
00:39:36.043 --> 00:39:39.630
all of a sudden it was
white gay guys who had did this,

746
00:39:39.839 --> 00:39:42.717
and lesbians, and oh there
might have been

747
00:39:42.925 --> 00:39:46.137
a drag queen or two there.

748
00:39:46.386 --> 00:39:47.680
Really?

749
00:39:47.889 --> 00:39:51.142
When we frequented that bar,
you know what I mean,

750
00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:52.518
and hung out there.

751
00:39:52.727 --> 00:39:54.896
Across the street is
this little park.

752
00:39:55.187 --> 00:39:57.940
The most disappointing thing
for me is in this park,

753
00:39:58.149 --> 00:40:00.693
they have statues
to commemorate Stonewall.

754
00:40:00.902 --> 00:40:03.779
Two lesbians, two gay guys.

755
00:40:03.988 --> 00:40:05.447
And I'm sure the gay guys
are trying to molest

756
00:40:05.656 --> 00:40:08.075
each other on the bench,
and the lesbians are talking

757
00:40:08.284 --> 00:40:10.536
about moving in
and getting a new cat.

758
00:40:10.745 --> 00:40:15.374
No transgender woman,
and there should be one,

759
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:20.212
and she should be flying in
and getting ready to land.

760
00:40:21.714 --> 00:40:24.133
Where are we when we were
such a part of this?

761
00:40:24.342 --> 00:40:25.509
Where's the respect
for the folks

762
00:40:25.718 --> 00:40:27.136
that have gone through this?

763
00:40:27.345 --> 00:40:30.723
Like Sylvia Rivera
and Marsha Johnson, you know

764
00:40:30.932 --> 00:40:33.475
fuck me, it's just,
there were other people there

765
00:40:33.684 --> 00:40:37.521
who had a voice before
this happened, who was

766
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.523
trying to make things better.

767
00:40:39.774 --> 00:40:41.567
Girls of color.

768
00:40:42.026 --> 00:40:43.694
Friends, you know.

769
00:40:43.986 --> 00:40:48.824
And they just berated them
and talked about them like

770
00:40:49.075 --> 00:40:51.369
they were drug addicts
and alcoholics.

771
00:40:51.577 --> 00:40:56.415
And in going through this,
they pulled this thing away from us.

772
00:40:56.624 --> 00:40:58.417
I understand that it was
important that I was

773
00:40:58.626 --> 00:41:03.339
in Stonewall because
I'm one of the last Black girls

774
00:41:03.547 --> 00:41:05.132
who were there
that's still alive.

775
00:41:05.424 --> 00:41:08.177
That to me is
a pretty amazing thing.

776
00:41:08.427 --> 00:41:12.723
But the thing is for me,
it's not what I did,

777
00:41:12.932 --> 00:41:14.850
it's what I do now.

778
00:41:15.475 --> 00:41:17.979
It's who I help now.

779
00:41:18.312 --> 00:41:23.312
How I train my energies to keep
the agency I work for going.

780
00:41:24.944 --> 00:41:27.487
You know, because there's
girls in prison who need

781
00:41:27.697 --> 00:41:30.866
to hear from us, who need
to know that somebody out here

782
00:41:31.075 --> 00:41:33.703
gives a damn
whether they live or die.

783
00:41:33.953 --> 00:41:37.164
I want things better for the,
for everybody.

784
00:41:37.415 --> 00:41:39.792
Not just my community,
I want things better for everybody.

785
00:41:40.001 --> 00:41:42.712
And if they would accept
my community just

786
00:41:43.004 --> 00:41:46.882
for who they are, it would
be better for everybody.

787
00:41:47.466 --> 00:41:51.387
We're the last bastion
that you can talk about

788
00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:56.434
and ridicule and throw things
at and beat up and it's okay.

789
00:41:56.767 --> 00:41:58.352
You know some of my girls
have been attacked

790
00:41:58.561 --> 00:42:03.357
by four and five boys,
and my girls went to jail,

791
00:42:03.566 --> 00:42:05.151
the boys went home.

792
00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:07.403
You know, how dare they
make that assumption?

793
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:11.323
We may not have started
anything, you know?

794
00:42:11.532 --> 00:42:14.785
And if we happen to win
that battle when they fight us,

795
00:42:15.077 --> 00:42:18.289
oh then we get a charge.

796
00:42:18.497 --> 00:42:19.623
Assault to commit murder.

797
00:42:19.832 --> 00:42:22.543
He started this shit!

798
00:42:22.752 --> 00:42:24.587
But they don't think about it.

799
00:42:24.795 --> 00:42:28.549
The legal system is off,
the justice system is off,

800
00:42:28.758 --> 00:42:29.675
the police are off.

801
00:42:29.884 --> 00:42:34.472
I mean, California has
some really great laws, yay.

802
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.933
They have some laws
that really want to protect

803
00:42:38.142 --> 00:42:41.270
my trans community, yay.

804
00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:44.690
Do the police read those laws?

805
00:42:44.899 --> 00:42:46.192
No.

806
00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.695
If they do something against
a transgender person,

807
00:42:50.112 --> 00:42:53.991
are there any repercussions
for what they've done?

808
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.242
No.

809
00:42:55.451 --> 00:42:59.914
But for me, if you tap that
wallet that they have,

810
00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:02.708
they'll stop fucking
with my community.

811
00:43:02.917 --> 00:43:07.379
If they gotta pay 'cause
they did something to us, a fine,

812
00:43:07.588 --> 00:43:09.340
they're not going
to do it anymore.

813
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:11.008
They're not going to do it
in prison, they're not going

814
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.635
to do it when they arrest us,
they're not going

815
00:43:12.885 --> 00:43:13.803
to do it in jail.

816
00:43:14.261 --> 00:43:16.515
They're going to leave us
alone because they know

817
00:43:16.722 --> 00:43:18.891
that we have some power.

818
00:43:19.308 --> 00:43:21.561
Right now we don't
have any power.

819
00:43:21.894 --> 00:43:23.813
We don't have any power.

820
00:43:26.357 --> 00:43:28.234
(Tumeka)
I've had some negative

821
00:43:28.442 --> 00:43:32.238
experiences with the police
department in San Francisco

822
00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:34.657
where I had to sue them.

823
00:43:34.865 --> 00:43:38.119
I was not on paperwork
I had given up my number,

824
00:43:38.327 --> 00:43:41.872
and I had changed my life around
and I was in love with this guy

825
00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:44.792
and he pulled a robbery
in my building, and some guy

826
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.670
seen him from behind
and the police came to my house,

827
00:43:47.878 --> 00:43:50.339
and when they went
to put handcuffs on him,

828
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:52.216
I told them
it wasn't him, it was me.

829
00:43:52.424 --> 00:43:53.759
I ended up going back,
and that's how I got

830
00:43:53.968 --> 00:43:55.094
my second number.

831
00:43:55.302 --> 00:43:58.013
But during that course,
while I was fighting the case,

832
00:43:58.222 --> 00:44:02.476
the deputies that worked
there repeatedly raped me

833
00:44:02.685 --> 00:44:07.064
for several months until
I got tired and I decided

834
00:44:07.273 --> 00:44:09.108
to tell someone about it.

835
00:44:17.116 --> 00:44:21.203
They had to move me because
they were afraid of retaliation

836
00:44:21.412 --> 00:44:24.248
from inside of
the police department because

837
00:44:24.541 --> 00:44:27.042
this officer was well known
and well liked.

838
00:44:27.251 --> 00:44:29.461
I took numerous
lie detector tests

839
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:31.088
and passed and everything.

840
00:44:31.297 --> 00:44:33.883
And we ended up
settling out of court.

841
00:44:34.091 --> 00:44:37.428
And that's how I ended up
implementing transgender

842
00:44:37.637 --> 00:44:40.764
sensitivity training
inside of the jailhouses,

843
00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:43.518
that was part of my settlement
and that was the most important

844
00:44:43.726 --> 00:44:47.522
part of my settlement
with the Sheriff's Department.

845
00:44:48.772 --> 00:44:49.982
(Major)
One of the things I love about

846
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:52.776
my community is we're
a pretty tough fucking

847
00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:55.112
bunch of cookies,
you know what I mean.

848
00:44:55.321 --> 00:44:56.906
We take the abuse that
we get in the street

849
00:44:57.114 --> 00:45:00.284
from people and what goes on
in our personal lives,

850
00:45:00.492 --> 00:45:02.703
from people that we think
are going to love us anyway,

851
00:45:02.912 --> 00:45:07.912
like family, you know,
and we still survive.

852
00:45:09.919 --> 00:45:14.919
So, in my heart I hope that,
[crying] I'm sorry.

853
00:45:16.551 --> 00:45:20.721
That when the dust settles,
my girls will be okay.

854
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:22.723
I was in New York
for Stonewall.

855
00:45:27.353 --> 00:45:30.022
I was in Danemmora
and Sing Sing, and after

856
00:45:30.231 --> 00:45:33.568
the Attica Riots,
I got sent to Attica.

857
00:45:33.776 --> 00:45:36.070
Spent all my time in there
in a cell getting to meet

858
00:45:36.278 --> 00:45:37.821
the guys who pulled
this thing off, and listened

859
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.158
and watched all the abuses
they were putting

860
00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:42.451
those people through.

861
00:45:42.826 --> 00:45:47.289
They don't need an excuse,
they just run through us.

862
00:45:47.498 --> 00:45:50.209
They run through our families,
they run through our society,

863
00:45:50.417 --> 00:45:51.418
they run through who we are.

864
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:55.756
I got arrested for
robbing a john in New York,

865
00:45:56.006 --> 00:45:58.425
and then was sent upstate.

866
00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:02.388
I wound up going
to Sing Sing first.

867
00:46:02.597 --> 00:46:06.225
I got out on parole, I went
and stayed with some friends,

868
00:46:06.643 --> 00:46:09.311
and I shaved, of course.

869
00:46:09.562 --> 00:46:12.649
Got a little light foundation,
and colored my hair,

870
00:46:12.856 --> 00:46:16.860
arched my eyebrows,
and lightly dusted,

871
00:46:17.486 --> 00:46:21.407
I don't think I was over painted,
but I lightly dusted,

872
00:46:21.658 --> 00:46:23.784
and I went into parole
and they said that I was trying

873
00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:28.872
to change my appearance
in order to abscond from parole.

874
00:46:29.206 --> 00:46:31.543
And violated me
right there on the spot.

875
00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:36.589
Then they sent me to Dannemora,
which has a mental hospital

876
00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:39.883
on one side of the wall,
prison on the other.

877
00:46:40.134 --> 00:46:42.637
Well they sent me to
the mental hospital first.

878
00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.807
I had platinum blonde hair,
about two inches long.

879
00:46:47.099 --> 00:46:49.351
My breasts had been developing
because I'd been on hormones

880
00:46:49.686 --> 00:46:51.979
for years, and I thought
I was the hottest young thing

881
00:46:52.354 --> 00:46:55.941
since white sliced bread.
[laughing]

882
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.400
Got in there, and they,
ooh, did their best

883
00:47:01.947 --> 00:47:03.240
to break my spirit.

884
00:47:03.449 --> 00:47:06.243
They shaved me completely bald.

885
00:47:06.452 --> 00:47:10.247
They shaved off my eyebrows,
they made me walk through

886
00:47:10.497 --> 00:47:14.084
the prison naked, you know.

887
00:47:14.293 --> 00:47:19.293
It was so uh, it was so hard.

888
00:47:20.299 --> 00:47:24.554
On September 12, 1971,
there was an uprising

889
00:47:24.763 --> 00:47:28.390
by prison inmates of
the Attica Correctional Facility,

890
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.686
which was a maximum-security
prison located

891
00:47:31.894 --> 00:47:33.605
in western New York.

892
00:47:33.813 --> 00:47:37.316
It ended with the bloodiest
prison confrontation

893
00:47:37.525 --> 00:47:40.194
in American history.

894
00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:44.239
For five days, thirteen hundred
prisoners rebelled,

895
00:47:44.448 --> 00:47:49.448
took over the prison,
and held forty guards hostage.

896
00:47:50.538 --> 00:47:53.499
They made a list of demands,
the prisoners,

897
00:47:53.708 --> 00:47:57.712
including improvements in
living conditions and educational

898
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.674
and training opportunities
and centered into negotiations

899
00:48:01.882 --> 00:48:04.343
with state officials.

900
00:48:04.552 --> 00:48:07.971
The negotiations failed
and state police

901
00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.266
and National Guard troops
seized the prison.

902
00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:13.770
In the course of taking it
over they killed

903
00:48:13.977 --> 00:48:18.977
forty-three individuals,
including ten of the hostages.

904
00:48:19.651 --> 00:48:22.361
I met Black and the guys
who were from Attica

905
00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:25.782
who had got the riots
started when they sent them

906
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:30.285
to Dannemora to the hole
where they had been housing me.

907
00:48:30.494 --> 00:48:35.332
That's when I got to meet them
and talk with them,

908
00:48:35.542 --> 00:48:38.460
and developed some
very lasting

909
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:41.380
and good relationships
with them.

910
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:44.341
They opened my eyes
to different things that were

911
00:48:44.551 --> 00:48:49.551
going on and really politicized me
as to how I was helping

912
00:48:50.013 --> 00:48:51.683
the system to survive
and not helping

913
00:48:51.891 --> 00:48:53.475
my community survive.

914
00:48:54.393 --> 00:48:56.688
(Angela Davis)
I was just talking to Miss Major

915
00:48:56.896 --> 00:49:01.233
a few minutes ago
and I noticed in the bio

916
00:49:01.442 --> 00:49:06.442
that she became politicized
in Attica and I said

917
00:49:08.115 --> 00:49:09.909
I didn't realize that.

918
00:49:10.117 --> 00:49:14.329
And then we started talking
and she was pointing out

919
00:49:14.539 --> 00:49:18.208
that Black, Big Black,
Frank Smith was

920
00:49:18.417 --> 00:49:23.417
the one who really encouraged
her to think about

921
00:49:24.591 --> 00:49:27.217
all of these issues
in a much broader way.

922
00:49:27.426 --> 00:49:30.971
And so I said well, of course,
it makes so much sense.

923
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:33.265
We're all connected, aren't we?

924
00:49:35.434 --> 00:49:36.268
(Major)
Yes dear?

925
00:49:36.477 --> 00:49:38.979
(Cayenne)
Hi Miss Major, in Attica,

926
00:49:39.188 --> 00:49:44.188
your acceptance, Frank BB Smith,
was my stepfather.

927
00:49:44.985 --> 00:49:47.488
(Major)
Oh how wonderful!

928
00:49:47.697 --> 00:49:49.532
(Cayenne)
So you're like the first

929
00:49:49.741 --> 00:49:54.119
trans person outside
of him accepting me,

930
00:49:54.328 --> 00:49:58.165
that I probably heard
a story about him.

931
00:49:58.791 --> 00:50:00.502
(Major)
Listen, I'm thinking about

932
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:04.421
driving up so you
and I can go see Black's...

933
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:05.757
(Cayenne)
When?

934
00:50:05.965 --> 00:50:06.674
(Major)
I'd like for you to

935
00:50:06.883 --> 00:50:10.803
take me to his grave.

936
00:50:12.722 --> 00:50:17.059
I want to give him my respect
and let him know that I met you.

937
00:50:17.476 --> 00:50:18.728
(Cayenne)
Oh, yeah.

938
00:50:18.937 --> 00:50:20.939
(Major) He was such an important
part of my life.

939
00:50:21.146 --> 00:50:22.649
(Cayenne)
By the time my mother

940
00:50:22.857 --> 00:50:26.945
got with him, he was
already doing law work,

941
00:50:27.152 --> 00:50:28.571
he had got out of-

942
00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:29.864
(Major)
That was after Attica.

943
00:50:30.072 --> 00:50:32.909
(Cayenne)
Yeah, that was after Attica.

944
00:50:33.116 --> 00:50:35.995
I had been hearing about her
for years, but I had never

945
00:50:36.203 --> 00:50:39.832
actually had the experience
of meeting her, one,

946
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.126
but ever hearing
this story about Attica.

947
00:50:43.335 --> 00:50:45.547
All I knew was Frank
was monumental

948
00:50:45.755 --> 00:50:48.925
in this whole riot thing.

949
00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:51.343
But that's as far as it went.

950
00:50:51.553 --> 00:50:53.095
Frank had never told me,
he just said,

951
00:50:53.303 --> 00:50:56.558
"I had a friend
who was like you,

952
00:50:56.766 --> 00:50:58.851
and believe it or not,
I was locked up."

953
00:50:59.059 --> 00:51:01.938
And it was Black that actually --
'cause I ran away --

954
00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:05.692
he came and got me; actually,
he found me, don't ask me how.

955
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.737
But he found me, and he
sat me down and he explained,

956
00:51:09.946 --> 00:51:11.614
"You're a girl."

957
00:51:11.823 --> 00:51:12.865
And I went, "Huh?"

958
00:51:13.073 --> 00:51:14.909
and he said, "Well,
you can't tell your mother this,

959
00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:17.620
but that's what's
going on inside you.

960
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:21.916
And you want to live this,
that's why you're doing

961
00:51:22.124 --> 00:51:24.586
certain things your mother
doesn't agree to.

962
00:51:24.794 --> 00:51:27.630
Like wearing her clothes,
like wearing her heels."

963
00:51:27.839 --> 00:51:30.008
None of it made sense to me,
he kind of put

964
00:51:30.215 --> 00:51:33.595
that picture together,
and got me back into the house.

965
00:51:33.803 --> 00:51:37.849
But somehow him telling
my mother how much stuff

966
00:51:38.057 --> 00:51:41.435
he had went through in Attica
all related to Miss Major.

967
00:51:41.644 --> 00:51:42.729
(Major)
Yeah.

968
00:51:42.937 --> 00:51:45.188
(Cayenne)
And their friendship wasn't

969
00:51:45.397 --> 00:51:49.819
something that was sexual,
it was a real friendship.

970
00:51:50.028 --> 00:51:51.613
I don't know, maybe it was.

971
00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:53.405
(Major)
Yeah, no -- we just talked --

972
00:51:53.615 --> 00:51:54.114
(Cayenne)
You see, I had to

973
00:51:54.323 --> 00:51:56.325
jump back and look --

974
00:51:56.534 --> 00:51:59.871
You never know up in Attica.
[cross talk]

975
00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:01.706
(Major)
Yeah, we talked a lot,

976
00:52:01.914 --> 00:52:04.499
because he's the one
who made me politically aware

977
00:52:04.709 --> 00:52:07.127
of all the shit that was
going on, and what I can do

978
00:52:07.336 --> 00:52:09.922
to get my girls together
to go through it.

979
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:11.674
So while he did what
he was doing with

980
00:52:11.883 --> 00:52:13.676
the Five-Percenters
and the Muslims;

981
00:52:13.885 --> 00:52:17.013
I was working with
the transgender girls in prison.

982
00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.974
And we were together,
he was really

983
00:52:20.182 --> 00:52:21.976
a wonderful, wonderful man.

984
00:52:22.184 --> 00:52:22.727
(Cayenne)
How were they with

985
00:52:22.935 --> 00:52:24.687
the transgender girls in prison?

986
00:52:24.896 --> 00:52:27.857
(Major)
Shady as fucking shit.

987
00:52:28.066 --> 00:52:30.317
(Melenie)
So, normal. [laughter]

988
00:52:36.074 --> 00:52:39.535
(Debbie)
At first, when I met Major,

989
00:52:39.744 --> 00:52:42.622
he basically was a loner.

990
00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.125
He did not trust
many people at all.

991
00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:49.629
He always thought
that somebody was after him,

992
00:52:49.837 --> 00:52:52.882
or somebody had a hidden agenda.

993
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:57.386
But little by little,
he began to open up.

994
00:52:57.595 --> 00:52:58.721
(Major)
I was doing drag shows,

995
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:03.810
and it was with this group,
and one of the guys in the group

996
00:53:04.018 --> 00:53:08.690
introduced me to Debbie,
and then Debbie and I slowly

997
00:53:08.898 --> 00:53:10.733
became really close friends,
and then we started

998
00:53:10.942 --> 00:53:12.359
hanging out and stuff.

999
00:53:12.568 --> 00:53:16.572
(Debbie)
Major always tried to build up

1000
00:53:16.781 --> 00:53:21.781
my self-esteem,
as a young, Black woman.

1001
00:53:22.787 --> 00:53:24.371
Major did a lot of shows.

1002
00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.207
He was with a group
called The Cherries.

1003
00:53:27.416 --> 00:53:32.416
And I used to watch him intently,
putting on the makeup.

1004
00:53:33.548 --> 00:53:35.883
As a matter of fact,
I think that's where I learned

1005
00:53:36.092 --> 00:53:38.427
how to apply makeup myself.

1006
00:53:38.636 --> 00:53:42.598
It was what I would call
a really cool relationship

1007
00:53:42.807 --> 00:53:46.393
that developed
into so much more.

1008
00:53:46.602 --> 00:53:51.602
It developed into camaraderie,
and then it developed into love,

1009
00:53:53.609 --> 00:53:57.905
and several years later,
I would say a good

1010
00:53:58.114 --> 00:54:03.114
five years later, we decided
there should be something

1011
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:07.790
of both of us in this world.

1012
00:54:07.999 --> 00:54:12.628
And we decided it was time
that we moved in together,

1013
00:54:12.837 --> 00:54:15.631
and we started a life together.

1014
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.841
(Major)
At the time I had never slept

1015
00:54:17.049 --> 00:54:19.510
with any women at all.

1016
00:54:19.719 --> 00:54:21.637
And we were just sitting
one day looking out the window

1017
00:54:21.846 --> 00:54:26.517
at the Hudson, and
the sailboats on it and stuff.

1018
00:54:26.726 --> 00:54:30.646
I was holding her,
and something came up

1019
00:54:30.855 --> 00:54:32.857
and she started crying,
I told her not to cry,

1020
00:54:33.065 --> 00:54:36.736
I kissed her on the cheek,
and bingo.

1021
00:54:36.944 --> 00:54:37.653
You know.

1022
00:54:37.862 --> 00:54:39.781
So it wasn't
as horrible as I had

1023
00:54:39.989 --> 00:54:41.783
heard it was going to be,
so I was like, oh,

1024
00:54:41.991 --> 00:54:43.910
this isn't as bad as
they told me, child

1025
00:54:44.118 --> 00:54:45.953
I'm going again.
[laughing]

1026
00:54:46.162 --> 00:54:48.371
(Debbie)
And the outcome was

1027
00:54:48.581 --> 00:54:53.581
we had a beautiful,
bouncing baby boy in 1978.

1028
00:54:53.878 --> 00:54:55.838
And we still co-parent.

1029
00:54:56.047 --> 00:55:00.134
Now, Christopher is 35 years old,
but whenever there is

1030
00:55:00.342 --> 00:55:03.930
something going on in his life,
Major and I, we talk about it.

1031
00:55:04.138 --> 00:55:05.848
This is what parents do.

1032
00:55:06.057 --> 00:55:09.685
No matter whether you are
transgendered or straight,

1033
00:55:09.894 --> 00:55:12.021
bisexual, no matter what.

1034
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:13.898
You have responsibilities.

1035
00:55:14.106 --> 00:55:18.401
And Major has always met
his responsibilities

1036
00:55:18.611 --> 00:55:22.364
when it comes to being a father.

1037
00:55:22.573 --> 00:55:25.492
Major is an excellent father.

1038
00:55:25.743 --> 00:55:26.326
(Major)
Yeah,

1039
00:55:26.536 --> 00:55:30.164
he's just the light of my life.

1040
00:55:30.372 --> 00:55:31.666
And he was born heavy.

1041
00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:35.044
You know how babies are
all wrinkly and skinny and ugly

1042
00:55:35.253 --> 00:55:37.213
and they go "oh they're
so cute," they look like

1043
00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.173
little rodents, you know
what I mean? Ew!

1044
00:55:39.381 --> 00:55:42.635
Christopher was a baybee,
and his face was all smooth

1045
00:55:42.844 --> 00:55:46.222
and lovely and kissable,
it was just so wonderful.

1046
00:55:46.429 --> 00:55:49.600
I mean who expected me
to have a child, you know?

1047
00:55:49.809 --> 00:55:52.061
That was just
the most amazing thing going.

1048
00:55:52.352 --> 00:55:55.480
And I lost a lot of
girlfriends in New York,

1049
00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:58.441
when I told them
that Debbie was pregnant.

1050
00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:03.030
They just thought as if
I had slapped them

1051
00:56:03.239 --> 00:56:05.490
in the face or something,
you know what I mean.

1052
00:56:06.491 --> 00:56:10.288
We moved out here to California,
He handled flying so cool.

1053
00:56:10.495 --> 00:56:15.334
I got the kind of carriage
for him where he was on my chest.

1054
00:56:15.543 --> 00:56:17.962
And so people, if they
looked they would see

1055
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.798
I had breasts and a baby.

1056
00:56:21.007 --> 00:56:22.341
And a beard.

1057
00:56:22.550 --> 00:56:23.342
[laughing]

1058
00:56:23.551 --> 00:56:26.846
And was in a man's suit.

1059
00:56:27.054 --> 00:56:29.181
Debbie moved out here,
we stayed together for a while,

1060
00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:33.435
and then it just didn't work,
you know, and so she went

1061
00:56:33.644 --> 00:56:36.396
back East to New York.

1062
00:56:36.606 --> 00:56:38.274
And she left Christopher
with me.

1063
00:56:38.481 --> 00:56:43.481
You know, and I felt
so honored that she did and lucky.

1064
00:56:44.572 --> 00:56:48.408
So we drove there together,
all three of us.

1065
00:56:48.618 --> 00:56:50.703
And I stayed until she got
an apartment and stuff there.

1066
00:56:50.912 --> 00:56:53.664
Then I came back out here
to California and then

1067
00:56:53.873 --> 00:56:57.417
when I got back out here
I thought okay, raising a baby

1068
00:56:57.627 --> 00:57:00.546
is going to be hard, you know,
I may know what to do

1069
00:57:00.922 --> 00:57:02.506
but maybe I should see
what other people are

1070
00:57:02.715 --> 00:57:04.466
doing to help me do this.

1071
00:57:04.675 --> 00:57:09.055
There was a group for fathers
who were raising their children.

1072
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.849
So I went to go to this group.

1073
00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.392
[laughs]
Hmm.

1074
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:16.729
Needless to say I did not
only not get in,

1075
00:57:16.938 --> 00:57:21.938
but two or three of them
came out to cuss me out at the door.

1076
00:57:22.818 --> 00:57:25.404
It's like wait a minute,
so I have tits,

1077
00:57:25.613 --> 00:57:27.865
what is your issue?

1078
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:29.325
(Beck)
Christopher was always

1079
00:57:29.533 --> 00:57:31.410
really confident, "that's
my daddy" even though

1080
00:57:31.619 --> 00:57:32.662
people would see a woman.

1081
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.414
I feel like she's like
deeply genderqueer in this way

1082
00:57:35.623 --> 00:57:37.166
that someone will be like,
you're a woman,

1083
00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:38.417
and she'll be like
I'm a wonder woman,

1084
00:57:38.626 --> 00:57:39.877
wonder what kind of woman I am.

1085
00:57:40.086 --> 00:57:43.422
She's happy to be with
her full beard and a dress.

1086
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:47.301
She just wants to be herself
and be seen as herself.

1087
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.762
(Christopher)
Daddy's just... daddy's just daddy.

1088
00:57:49.971 --> 00:57:54.433
I mean he runs the house,
he talks a lot.

1089
00:57:54.642 --> 00:57:58.437
He rules with his voice
and not with his fist.

1090
00:57:58.646 --> 00:57:59.981
I got a lot of love
when I was a kid.

1091
00:58:00.189 --> 00:58:03.609
I was definitely the most
loved kid, like ever.

1092
00:58:06.028 --> 00:58:07.279
(Interviewer)
So the last time you were

1093
00:58:07.487 --> 00:58:08.531
in a room with your mom
and your dad

1094
00:58:08.739 --> 00:58:10.241
at the same time was...

1095
00:58:10.574 --> 00:58:12.535
(Christopher)
About 23 years ago --

1096
00:58:12.743 --> 00:58:13.995
no, too many.

1097
00:58:14.203 --> 00:58:14.704
23?

1098
00:58:14.912 --> 00:58:15.579
(Major)
Yeah.

1099
00:58:15.788 --> 00:58:16.706
(Christopher)
23 years ago. Yeah, a long time.

1100
00:58:16.914 --> 00:58:18.498
(Major)
It's been a while.

1101
00:58:18.708 --> 00:58:22.378
(Christopher)
Yes.

1102
00:58:22.586 --> 00:58:23.295
(Christopher)
It was not good.

1103
00:58:23.504 --> 00:58:28.504
We were in a diner somewhere
here in New York and I mean

1104
00:58:29.719 --> 00:58:30.886
I don't remember much
of the conversation.

1105
00:58:31.095 --> 00:58:32.763
At that time I was 12.

1106
00:58:32.972 --> 00:58:34.974
I know there were not nice words
happening and I mostly

1107
00:58:35.182 --> 00:58:37.476
tuned most of it out.

1108
00:58:37.685 --> 00:58:39.311
Most of my troubles
today have absolutely nothing

1109
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.022
to do with my father.

1110
00:58:41.772 --> 00:58:43.858
So I'm blessed.

1111
00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:48.571
I'm here for daddy's
building dedication.

1112
00:58:48.779 --> 00:58:52.074
I think it's a huge honor
and it's nice to know

1113
00:58:52.283 --> 00:58:54.702
that he's gonna be
immortalized in a building.

1114
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:56.454
It's like, he's a building.

1115
00:58:56.662 --> 00:58:57.121
Yeah.

1116
00:58:57.329 --> 00:58:58.122
[laughter]

1117
00:58:58.330 --> 00:58:58.956
That's my dad.

1118
00:58:59.165 --> 00:58:59.790
Yeah.

1119
00:58:59.999 --> 00:59:00.916
You know the building
around the corner?

1120
00:59:01.125 --> 00:59:02.668
[laughter]

1121
00:59:02.877 --> 00:59:04.003
[group singing]

1122
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:09.211
We're gonna sit
at the welcome table,

1123
00:59:09.509 --> 00:59:13.513
we're gonna sit
at the welcome table

1124
00:59:13.721 --> 00:59:15.639
one of these days
hallelujah

1125
00:59:15.848 --> 00:59:20.848
We're gonna sit
at the welcome table

1126
00:59:21.979 --> 00:59:24.607
we're gonna sit
at the welcome table

1127
00:59:24.815 --> 00:59:26.150
one of these days

1128
00:59:26.358 --> 00:59:28.569
We're gonna thank
and honor our elders

1129
00:59:28.778 --> 00:59:33.778
We're gonna thank
and honor our elders

1130
00:59:34.075 --> 00:59:37.578
we're gonna thank
and honor our elders

1131
00:59:37.787 --> 00:59:38.412
one of these days

1132
00:59:39.163 --> 00:59:40.790
(Reina Gossett)
We at the Miss Major Jay Toole

1133
00:59:40.998 --> 00:59:45.044
Building for Social Justice
know exactly who Jay is here for.

1134
00:59:45.252 --> 00:59:48.089
Jay is here for people
who have disabilities.

1135
00:59:48.297 --> 00:59:50.091
Who have HIV and AIDS.

1136
00:59:50.299 --> 00:59:52.843
Jay is here for the homeless people,
people living

1137
00:59:53.052 --> 00:59:55.054
on the streets
or homeless shelters.

1138
00:59:55.262 --> 00:59:58.517
Jay is here for queer people
of color, trans and gender

1139
00:59:58.724 --> 01:00:01.977
non-conforming people navigating
the prison industrial complex.

1140
01:00:02.186 --> 01:00:03.771
(Jay Toole)
I was homeless, you know,

1141
01:00:03.979 --> 01:00:06.065
and I was in my box
and this thought would

1142
01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:10.986
go through my mind:
I'm gonna die in a box.

1143
01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:13.072
No one's gonna know who I was.

1144
01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.199
No one's gonna know
I was on this earth.

1145
01:00:15.407 --> 01:00:19.120
And then one fucking queer
put their hand out to me,

1146
01:00:19.328 --> 01:00:21.038
and here I am.

1147
01:00:21.247 --> 01:00:25.251
Major, we have a fucking
building named after us.

1148
01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:26.794
Isn't that like amazing?

1149
01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:27.878
[laughter]

1150
01:00:28.087 --> 01:00:28.963
(Jay Toole)
Me and Major talked

1151
01:00:29.171 --> 01:00:31.465
in San Francisco a week
and a half ago

1152
01:00:31.674 --> 01:00:33.634
and we tried to figure out
how long we've known each other,

1153
01:00:33.843 --> 01:00:36.178
and it seems like it's 1964-

1154
01:00:36.387 --> 01:00:37.012
(Audience)
Wooo!

1155
01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:38.472
(Jay Toole)
...that we met.

1156
01:00:38.681 --> 01:00:42.143
You know,
we go back a little ways.

1157
01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:43.936
I love this building.

1158
01:00:44.145 --> 01:00:47.189
Our doors stay open,
we help whoever walks through.

1159
01:00:47.398 --> 01:00:51.152
And to be in the same space
with Major.

1160
01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.444
I love my community.

1161
01:00:52.653 --> 01:00:55.489
You saved my life.

1162
01:00:55.698 --> 01:00:57.491
Now go out
and save somebody else's.

1163
01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:00.161
[applause]

1164
01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:01.328
(Major)
This is absolutely

1165
01:01:01.538 --> 01:01:04.915
a wonderful thing
that this is not a memorial.

1166
01:01:05.124 --> 01:01:08.335
I'm actually alive
to pay attention to this

1167
01:01:08.545 --> 01:01:10.505
and I just want to say
that I hope each and every one

1168
01:01:10.713 --> 01:01:14.425
of you when you leave here
and anyone says 'oh,

1169
01:01:14.634 --> 01:01:18.095
I'm here about the GLBT...'
no, no, no motherfucker.

1170
01:01:18.304 --> 01:01:20.764
T comes first.

1171
01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:23.309
I want you all to know
that I love and care about

1172
01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:26.521
all of my Black sisters
out there whether

1173
01:01:26.729 --> 01:01:29.106
I know them or not,
whether they know me or not,

1174
01:01:29.315 --> 01:01:31.483
I hope they hear about me,
I hope they come here

1175
01:01:31.692 --> 01:01:33.528
and get some services
because this is the building

1176
01:01:33.736 --> 01:01:35.530
to get the fucking services at.

1177
01:01:35.738 --> 01:01:40.117
I love you Jay for all
the years we've known each other

1178
01:01:40.326 --> 01:01:41.243
and this is only the beginning.

1179
01:01:41.452 --> 01:01:44.038
You all must continue
fighting for us because

1180
01:01:44.246 --> 01:01:45.497
I'm getting tired.

1181
01:01:45.706 --> 01:01:46.583
My heels cannot take it.

1182
01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.585
I'm in flats come
to think about it.

1183
01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:51.337
[laughter]
So hang in there.

1184
01:01:51.546 --> 01:01:55.299
Thank you so very, very much
from the bottom of my heart.

1185
01:01:55.508 --> 01:02:00.508
Thank you
[applause]

1186
01:02:03.349 --> 01:02:08.349
[piano music]

1187
01:02:49.812 --> 01:02:50.605
(Matt)
When I first met Major

1188
01:02:50.813 --> 01:02:53.357
the kind of work she was
doing was just trying to survive,

1189
01:02:53.566 --> 01:02:56.611
we were all at that stage
at that point.

1190
01:02:56.819 --> 01:02:58.697
And it's kind of there that
I noticed the struggles

1191
01:02:58.904 --> 01:03:02.783
that she had, she really,
the prejudice to try to find

1192
01:03:02.992 --> 01:03:07.992
work was just, very blatant,
and very obvious.

1193
01:03:09.708 --> 01:03:14.708
[club music]

1194
01:03:15.004 --> 01:03:16.130
(Matt)
Major always seemed to

1195
01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:18.882
find people who, or actually
these people would find her,

1196
01:03:19.091 --> 01:03:24.013
who were kind of struggling
with their own self-identity.

1197
01:03:24.221 --> 01:03:26.849
And she always seemed to have
people like that as roommates.

1198
01:03:27.057 --> 01:03:31.228
She'd always gather a whole group
of new folks and she would

1199
01:03:31.437 --> 01:03:34.148
teach them, build them up,
show them how to paint,

1200
01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:36.568
show them that they really
are valuable, and that

1201
01:03:36.776 --> 01:03:38.986
they're more than their past,
and then send them back out

1202
01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:41.405
in the world and we'd
see them all over.

1203
01:03:41.614 --> 01:03:43.490
Usually in San Diego performing,
you know one minute

1204
01:03:43.742 --> 01:03:45.660
they're practically
a street kid,

1205
01:03:45.868 --> 01:03:48.747
and then next moment,
after a month or two

1206
01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:51.999
with Major's tutelage,
they're now performing

1207
01:03:52.207 --> 01:03:56.337
with local drag troupes
and making a living.

1208
01:03:56.546 --> 01:03:58.590
(Major)
Ok, well that was the end of

1209
01:03:58.798 --> 01:04:02.426
the second show, but we have,
an encore performance,

1210
01:04:02.635 --> 01:04:03.678
a third show.

1211
01:04:03.969 --> 01:04:05.888
Please child, we're gonna
close the bar!

1212
01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:07.097
[laughs]

1213
01:04:07.348 --> 01:04:09.475
Be with you in just a minute,
hope you enjoy the show.

1214
01:04:09.726 --> 01:04:10.810
I'm Major, they'll be right back.

1215
01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:12.436
(Audience member)
All right girl.

1216
01:04:12.645 --> 01:04:14.355
(Tracie)
She was elected as the head

1217
01:04:14.564 --> 01:04:19.109
of a food delivery program,
for people with AIDS.

1218
01:04:19.318 --> 01:04:21.613
They would have a contest
for a spokesperson.

1219
01:04:21.821 --> 01:04:25.617
And the people, the guys in
the community elected Major,

1220
01:04:25.825 --> 01:04:28.869
but the corporation itself
did not think she was

1221
01:04:29.078 --> 01:04:33.248
a fit aesthetic for
the organization, and she rode

1222
01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:35.417
in the gay pride parade
that year, and they put her

1223
01:04:35.627 --> 01:04:37.252
in the back of the float.

1224
01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:38.671
And that was so painful
to see her.

1225
01:04:38.879 --> 01:04:41.633
But she sat there on the back
of the float

1226
01:04:41.841 --> 01:04:44.259
with this enormous petticoat on.

1227
01:04:44.468 --> 01:04:46.679
And her son to the next of her.

1228
01:04:46.887 --> 01:04:48.598
Everybody just waved
and waved and waved to her,

1229
01:04:48.807 --> 01:04:52.644
you know, that was so empowering
to see, that no matter

1230
01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:55.814
what she was faced
with she came out on top.

1231
01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:57.231
(Beck)
She had a significant other

1232
01:04:57.439 --> 01:04:59.983
for many years, Joe Bob,
in San Diego.

1233
01:05:00.192 --> 01:05:02.529
And when he passed, she got
the Veteran's Hospital

1234
01:05:02.737 --> 01:05:05.824
to create an AIDS memorial garden,
which was a big deal

1235
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:07.534
at the time, for like
a Veteran's Hospital

1236
01:05:07.742 --> 01:05:10.662
to really recognize that some
of the veterans were dying

1237
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.079
of AIDS at the time.

1238
01:05:12.287 --> 01:05:13.497
(Speaker)
The idea for this garden

1239
01:05:13.706 --> 01:05:18.252
originated in March
of this year when we lost one

1240
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.506
of our patients,
Joe Bob Michael.

1241
01:05:21.714 --> 01:05:25.552
And his friend Major
and I talked about,

1242
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:28.053
it would be nice to have
some kind of living memorial

1243
01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:31.850
to remember the patients that
we knew and had loved and lost.

1244
01:05:32.057 --> 01:05:33.518
(Tracie)
And to me that was like,

1245
01:05:33.726 --> 01:05:36.478
oh my god, she's African American,
she's a trans person,

1246
01:05:36.688 --> 01:05:39.481
and she's six foot five,
and she's walking in her truth.

1247
01:05:39.691 --> 01:05:40.859
How wonderful that is.

1248
01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:44.779
And it gave me strength
to wish more for myself.

1249
01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:46.363
(Smitty)
Major has had three

1250
01:05:46.573 --> 01:05:48.949
major loves in her life.

1251
01:05:49.784 --> 01:05:53.621
She had Joe Bob back
in San Diego, and she was

1252
01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:56.708
his caregiver for many years
before he passed.

1253
01:05:56.916 --> 01:06:01.916
Shannon she was with for
I think at least a couple of years.

1254
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.049
Shannon actually lived
with Major and her parents in

1255
01:06:06.258 --> 01:06:09.470
the Menlo Park house while
she was taking care of her parents.

1256
01:06:09.679 --> 01:06:14.349
And unfortunately he struggled
with drugs and some other issues

1257
01:06:14.559 --> 01:06:19.396
and he committed suicide
at that house in Menlo Park.

1258
01:06:19.606 --> 01:06:23.568
He hung himself in
the garage, and unfortunately

1259
01:06:23.776 --> 01:06:28.447
Major came home and found him.

1260
01:06:28.656 --> 01:06:33.452
(Major)
And then I met Beck,

1261
01:06:33.661 --> 01:06:38.661
and he just caressed my heart
and took all my pain away.

1262
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:51.345
[crying] I don't know
if I would have made these

1263
01:06:51.554 --> 01:06:54.348
last 10 years without him,
you know?

1264
01:06:56.475 --> 01:06:58.310
(Beck)
I think Major is the only person

1265
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.104
I have been so deeply
in love with.

1266
01:07:01.313 --> 01:07:03.691
And it was kind of
a slow build-up.

1267
01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.652
(Smitty)
There was a big age gap,

1268
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:07.946
and I thought oh lord Major!

1269
01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:10.532
I got to know Beck,
and there really was

1270
01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.659
a beautiful love there.

1271
01:07:12.867 --> 01:07:14.493
(Beck)
Major had really good game,

1272
01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:18.665
I think, like she really let me
initiate a lot, like I knew

1273
01:07:18.873 --> 01:07:21.626
she was really interested in me,
but she also never really

1274
01:07:21.834 --> 01:07:26.421
called me, and over time I would
just call her every night

1275
01:07:26.631 --> 01:07:28.967
and I've pretty much talked to her
or seen her everyday

1276
01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:30.677
probably for almost 8 years.

1277
01:07:30.885 --> 01:07:32.929
I think she has such a solid core
of sensing

1278
01:07:33.136 --> 01:07:34.681
her own hotness in the world.

1279
01:07:34.889 --> 01:07:37.684
And so she used to come
to my apartment and she would

1280
01:07:37.892 --> 01:07:41.688
try to do this walk for me
that she felt was so sexy.

1281
01:07:41.896 --> 01:07:44.064
And she was on dialysis,
her balance was off

1282
01:07:44.273 --> 01:07:47.484
so she'd literally be bumping
into walls as she did

1283
01:07:47.694 --> 01:07:48.987
this sexy walk coming to me.

1284
01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:51.906
And it was just so endearing.

1285
01:07:52.114 --> 01:07:53.950
Major really was the one
to break up with me.

1286
01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:57.745
I really want to have a family
and I think eventually

1287
01:07:57.954 --> 01:08:01.708
she was like you're not happy
and I think you should go out

1288
01:08:01.916 --> 01:08:04.209
and find someone who's younger
and live your life

1289
01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:06.713
and get to do the things
I've already gotten to do.

1290
01:08:06.921 --> 01:08:11.921
So I eventually moved out
and everyone told me

1291
01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:14.261
that we would need
more space from each other,

1292
01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:16.639
we would need some sort
of break, but we just

1293
01:08:16.848 --> 01:08:19.391
never got that. I don't think
we ever really needed it.

1294
01:08:19.601 --> 01:08:22.729
And we just love each other
so deeply and want to talk

1295
01:08:22.937 --> 01:08:26.189
to each other all the time,
and we just are huge emotional

1296
01:08:26.398 --> 01:08:30.235
and material support
for each other.

1297
01:08:30.444 --> 01:08:31.445
(Major)
We're like two lesbians,

1298
01:08:31.654 --> 01:08:35.658
we share a dog, he has her
a week, I have her a week...

1299
01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:36.951
(Beck)
I hope that she'll live

1300
01:08:37.159 --> 01:08:39.621
a long time
and I think about having a home

1301
01:08:39.954 --> 01:08:42.081
where she will also be there
and having a partner

1302
01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:46.251
and a family that will
see her as a huge part of my life.

1303
01:08:51.841 --> 01:08:52.550
(Beck)
I just kind of feel like

1304
01:08:52.759 --> 01:08:57.346
we're a package deal
and I think it's a pretty

1305
01:08:57.555 --> 01:09:00.516
good package you know.

1306
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.794
(Valerie)
Nobody knew that we existed.

1307
01:09:28.002 --> 01:09:31.964
And they really didn't give
a damn how we were treated.

1308
01:09:32.172 --> 01:09:36.886
So we had to humanize
ourselves to people to let

1309
01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:41.348
service providers and
governmental entities know

1310
01:09:41.599 --> 01:09:44.018
that we're not just
these glamour dolls

1311
01:09:44.226 --> 01:09:47.021
or these mentally
confused people

1312
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:52.229
or these white academicians
who coincidentally contracted

1313
01:09:54.028 --> 01:09:56.614
HIV or just happened
to become homeless.

1314
01:09:56.823 --> 01:09:58.741
That we were suffering.

1315
01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:02.161
And just as they demonstrated
a sense of urgency about

1316
01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:06.248
white gay men, they needed
to get up and demonstrate

1317
01:10:06.456 --> 01:10:09.711
that same sense of urgency
about transgender people.

1318
01:10:09.919 --> 01:10:14.214
Whether you understood
who we were or not was irrelevant.

1319
01:10:14.423 --> 01:10:16.926
We'll get to that in the 2000's.

1320
01:10:17.135 --> 01:10:18.636
You don't need to understand us.

1321
01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:21.263
You need to respond.

1322
01:10:21.471 --> 01:10:25.308
And, my work with Major
was about saying to people,

1323
01:10:25.518 --> 01:10:26.728
now here's how
you're going to do it.

1324
01:10:26.936 --> 01:10:28.688
You're going to put us on
your community planning groups

1325
01:10:28.896 --> 01:10:31.065
and you're going
to listen to us!

1326
01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:36.236
You are going to share power
next to these freaks of nature

1327
01:10:36.529 --> 01:10:37.905
that you're
not comfortable with.

1328
01:10:38.114 --> 01:10:43.035
You're just going to have
to be uncomfortable, deal with it.

1329
01:10:44.996 --> 01:10:47.999
(Sharyn)
Major was in charge of

1330
01:10:48.207 --> 01:10:53.207
the transgender drop-in center
and she was a health educator.

1331
01:10:55.798 --> 01:11:00.798
And of course, Major was
known and loved by everyone.

1332
01:11:03.598 --> 01:11:08.144
And if there was any problem,
particularly with

1333
01:11:08.351 --> 01:11:10.479
any of the women in
the trans community,

1334
01:11:10.688 --> 01:11:15.151
she was their go-to person,
it was Mama,

1335
01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:17.486
Miss Major, you know.

1336
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.321
(Guy)
I met Major in the Tenderloin

1337
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:21.574
doing street outreach
for HIV positive,

1338
01:11:21.783 --> 01:11:23.159
mostly homeless folks.

1339
01:11:23.785 --> 01:11:25.912
We often noticed that
a lot of the people

1340
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.956
who could benefit
from services were not coming.

1341
01:11:29.165 --> 01:11:31.542
They were in the street
and they were not necessarily

1342
01:11:31.751 --> 01:11:32.919
comfortable coming
into an agency.

1343
01:11:33.127 --> 01:11:34.879
So we decided we should,
we should go out.

1344
01:11:35.087 --> 01:11:37.965
About three times a week
we would park a van someplace

1345
01:11:38.174 --> 01:11:40.009
and set up chairs
on the sidewalk

1346
01:11:40.218 --> 01:11:42.929
and hand out condoms
and bleach and syringes,

1347
01:11:43.137 --> 01:11:44.555
and offer HIV testing.

1348
01:11:44.764 --> 01:11:46.808
So we kind of made it up
as we went, there was

1349
01:11:47.016 --> 01:11:49.769
very little direction,
it was mostly from the funders

1350
01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:52.980
and the City, they were-
it was mostly 'don't do that.'

1351
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:57.026
This doesn't fit in the program
or the contract

1352
01:11:57.359 --> 01:11:58.277
or the funding stream.

1353
01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:02.990
And what I really love
about Major is that that just

1354
01:12:03.282 --> 01:12:04.742
doesn't matter at all.

1355
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:08.538
You just do something that
needs to be done and then you know,

1356
01:12:08.746 --> 01:12:10.873
people either get it
or they don't

1357
01:12:11.123 --> 01:12:12.499
and funding comes
or it doesn't.

1358
01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:15.127
These street clinics,
they didn't really start

1359
01:12:15.335 --> 01:12:16.504
until Major arrived.

1360
01:12:16.712 --> 01:12:18.172
And she would always be late.

1361
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.259
And people would sometimes
stop and talk to us.

1362
01:12:21.466 --> 01:12:24.762
But it didn't start
happening until

1363
01:12:24.971 --> 01:12:27.265
some really big vehicle came.

1364
01:12:27.472 --> 01:12:32.472
She would pull in and open
her window and start cursing

1365
01:12:32.812 --> 01:12:35.273
that there wasn't any parking
and that we weren't in

1366
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.650
the right place and you know,
she'd let us have it

1367
01:12:37.859 --> 01:12:38.818
from the very beginning.

1368
01:12:39.026 --> 01:12:42.238
And that's when clinic
would start, that's when

1369
01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:45.741
the girls would come
and then we'd be on our way.

1370
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:46.701
(Valerie)
It's an indictment

1371
01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:49.328
when you're with Major,
if you really know Major

1372
01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:50.538
and what she's done.

1373
01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:54.292
It makes you ask yourself
now what am I doing?

1374
01:12:54.499 --> 01:12:56.043
What am I doing again?

1375
01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:57.920
Do I just want to be pretty?

1376
01:12:58.129 --> 01:13:00.548
Do I just want to conform?

1377
01:13:00.756 --> 01:13:03.843
What would I do if I really
used my life as

1378
01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:07.346
an instrument of social change?

1379
01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:10.182
(Tumeka)
She deserves to be recognized

1380
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.727
for what she does
in our community.

1381
01:13:12.935 --> 01:13:15.313
And it's just not
here in San Francisco

1382
01:13:15.521 --> 01:13:16.731
that she advocates.

1383
01:13:16.939 --> 01:13:20.192
She's up, at her age
that woman moves around

1384
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.028
like a 22 year old girl.

1385
01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:24.322
When she really should be
sitting down.

1386
01:13:24.530 --> 01:13:29.530
I've seen her sick and tired,
legs hurting, legs swollen.

1387
01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:32.955
Her eyes hurting where
she can barely see.

1388
01:13:33.164 --> 01:13:35.333
But she gets up
and she's there.

1389
01:13:35.541 --> 01:13:38.127
She's speaking, she's advocating,
and I'm

1390
01:13:38.336 --> 01:13:39.003
"girl why are you there?

1391
01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:39.712
Aren't you sick?"

1392
01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:41.547
"Yes I am but I have to do this."

1393
01:13:41.756 --> 01:13:43.049
(Major)
This is our lives,

1394
01:13:43.257 --> 01:13:46.010
we live this each and every day,
and imagine having

1395
01:13:46.218 --> 01:13:49.180
to leave your house and worry
every day if you're going

1396
01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:51.849
to get back home because
of someone else's bullshit.

1397
01:13:52.058 --> 01:13:54.810
We have to stop it,
we can stop it,

1398
01:13:55.019 --> 01:13:56.354
you must stop it.

1399
01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:58.356
Because I would love
for the dust to settle,

1400
01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:01.150
and all the transgender girls
and guys in this world

1401
01:14:01.359 --> 01:14:03.569
stand up and go
I'm still fucking here!

1402
01:14:03.778 --> 01:14:06.322
[cheering and applause]

1403
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:07.281
(Tracie)
It was really challenging

1404
01:14:07.489 --> 01:14:08.658
these last couple of years
because she's had

1405
01:14:08.866 --> 01:14:12.078
insurmountable health issues
where it appeared

1406
01:14:12.286 --> 01:14:15.122
that the end may be
near for her.

1407
01:14:15.331 --> 01:14:17.499
(Thom)
We had known each other for

1408
01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:21.712
probably at least
18 years if not more.

1409
01:14:21.921 --> 01:14:24.131
I found out that she needed
a kidney, you know,

1410
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.549
with all the issues
that she had.

1411
01:14:25.758 --> 01:14:26.676
And of course I offered.

1412
01:14:26.884 --> 01:14:29.387
Major's a very,
very dear friend of mine.

1413
01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:32.640
(Billie)
I lost my left eye to cancer,

1414
01:14:32.848 --> 01:14:35.434
and Miss Major lost her
right eye, so we used

1415
01:14:35.643 --> 01:14:38.312
to joke about walking up
and down the street,

1416
01:14:38.521 --> 01:14:42.775
so she would be my left eye
and I would be her right eye.

1417
01:14:42.984 --> 01:14:45.194
But you know,
we have to keep on going,

1418
01:14:45.403 --> 01:14:46.696
we have to keep on going.

1419
01:14:46.904 --> 01:14:49.532
And Major instilled
that in me, never give up,

1420
01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.617
no matter what,
never give up.

1421
01:14:51.826 --> 01:14:52.492
(Major)
Whoo, I wanna see

1422
01:14:52.702 --> 01:14:54.578
80, 90, and 100.

1423
01:14:54.787 --> 01:14:56.914
Now once I get there,
I'm good to go.

1424
01:14:57.123 --> 01:15:02.123
Willard Scott's gonna go,
"and Miss Major is 100 today!"

1425
01:15:02.837 --> 01:15:04.046
Yes! I can go now.

1426
01:15:04.255 --> 01:15:09.255
[laughs]

1427
01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:12.221
One trans woman
on Willard Scott's mouth.

1428
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.683
You know what I mean?
[laughs]

1429
01:15:15.891 --> 01:15:18.436
I still feel 35.

1430
01:15:18.644 --> 01:15:23.065
And I can't do the things
I used to do at 35,

1431
01:15:23.274 --> 01:15:28.112
but I can still chase the boys
I like to have

1432
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.364
and still do the things
I need to do, and still have

1433
01:15:30.573 --> 01:15:34.452
good, enjoyable,
long-lasting, wonderful sex.

1434
01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.454
Just 'cause there's snow
on the roof honey don't mean

1435
01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:39.081
that the fireplace is out.

1436
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:42.251
Adjusting to being older
and going through all the shit

1437
01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.545
that you have to go through
just to survive,

1438
01:15:44.754 --> 01:15:49.300
have medical coverage, eat,
live somewhere decent,

1439
01:15:49.509 --> 01:15:52.344
get around
and about comfortably,

1440
01:15:52.553 --> 01:15:56.766
negotiate through society
and be okay.

1441
01:15:56.974 --> 01:15:58.476
They don't tell you
that it's gonna be

1442
01:15:58.684 --> 01:16:00.352
hard as fucking hell.

1443
01:16:00.561 --> 01:16:01.437
(Malachi)
For someone who's taught us

1444
01:16:01.645 --> 01:16:04.440
so much and has survived
this long and who's not

1445
01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:06.484
done it for personal glory
or money.

1446
01:16:06.692 --> 01:16:08.486
And like, a bitch
is broke you know.

1447
01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:11.030
She hasn't built up a nice 401K.

1448
01:16:11.238 --> 01:16:13.533
How do we think about
our mandates to take care

1449
01:16:13.741 --> 01:16:16.202
of our elders who have
taken such good care of us.

1450
01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:19.288
And if Miss Major has
a building named after her,

1451
01:16:19.497 --> 01:16:22.041
she damned well better have
a place to live.

1452
01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:24.335
How do we make sure
that the rest of her life

1453
01:16:24.668 --> 01:16:27.963
is as comfortable
as she's made us powerful.

1454
01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:29.757
(Melenie)
I want her to be taken care of,

1455
01:16:29.965 --> 01:16:34.965
and to you know, to not have
to worry about things.

1456
01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:37.723
And to have people to lean on.

1457
01:16:37.932 --> 01:16:42.932
I think in our communities
that's one of the saddest things

1458
01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:45.815
is the isolation
and the loneliness of aging.

1459
01:16:46.023 --> 01:16:47.526
(Major)
I feel very fortunate to be

1460
01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:51.403
a 71 year-old proud
transgender woman, hoorah.

1461
01:16:51.612 --> 01:16:56.033
[applause]

1462
01:16:56.242 --> 01:16:58.494
And it would be really nice
if I had some girlfriends

1463
01:16:58.702 --> 01:17:00.830
my age for us to sit
and talk about the bullshit

1464
01:17:01.038 --> 01:17:06.038
that they tried to pull
on us back in '69, '65, '62.

1465
01:17:07.086 --> 01:17:10.507
For me, when somebody dies,
I always feel that

1466
01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:13.384
if it's someone that shouldn't
have died at the time

1467
01:17:13.593 --> 01:17:16.555
that a part of me
died with them.

1468
01:17:16.762 --> 01:17:19.223
Just because no matter
what you believe,

1469
01:17:19.431 --> 01:17:23.018
we're all a part of each other.

1470
01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:24.145
Period.

1471
01:17:24.353 --> 01:17:25.104
(BobbieJean Baker)
How many of you know

1472
01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:26.606
you're a vessel full of power?

1473
01:17:26.814 --> 01:17:28.232
[applause]

1474
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.568
Can we get this
turned down some?

1475
01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.402
Is it possible?

1476
01:17:31.611 --> 01:17:35.072
Cause I'm loud anyway.

1477
01:17:35.281 --> 01:17:36.073
You can hear me?

1478
01:17:36.282 --> 01:17:36.907
(Audience)
Yes!

1479
01:17:37.116 --> 01:17:38.659
(BobbieJean Baker)
Ok.

1480
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:43.455
[singing]
I am troubled

1481
01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:48.169
but not distressed

1482
01:17:48.377 --> 01:17:53.377
Perplexed,
but not in despair

1483
01:17:57.803 --> 01:18:02.803
I'm a vessel full of power

1484
01:18:07.229 --> 01:18:12.229
I've got a treasure
none can compare

1485
01:18:16.447 --> 01:18:21.447
Persecuted,
but not forsaken

1486
01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:29.371
Cast down,
but not destroyed

1487
01:18:32.631 --> 01:18:37.468
I'm a vessel
Hallelujah!

1488
01:18:37.677 --> 01:18:41.347
full of power

1489
01:18:41.556 --> 01:18:46.556
I've got a treasure,
from the Lord

1490
01:18:55.402 --> 01:18:56.904
(Major)
The loss of any girl is

1491
01:18:57.112 --> 01:18:59.073
just really, really rough.

1492
01:18:59.281 --> 01:19:02.619
And then to realize
that it doesn't have to be

1493
01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:04.870
murdered or beaten up
because someone disapproves

1494
01:19:05.079 --> 01:19:10.079
of who they are,
but through neglect and uncaring

1495
01:19:11.377 --> 01:19:13.420
and doctors who don't
really take care of us.

1496
01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:18.630
It's kind of like a societal
killing spree, indirectly.

1497
01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:25.307
That they just feel as if
well whatever they do to us,

1498
01:19:25.517 --> 01:19:27.893
we deserve,
we've asked for this.

1499
01:19:28.102 --> 01:19:31.355
It builds and adds up.

1500
01:19:31.564 --> 01:19:34.942
If you let it, it will
carry you away,

1501
01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:40.030
so you have to just figure out
what your sense of grieving is,

1502
01:19:40.239 --> 01:19:44.910
and then work with it,
and keep them in your heart,

1503
01:19:45.119 --> 01:19:48.330
cherish the memories
that you do have.

1504
01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.668
And if it's sad and you need
to cry then go through

1505
01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:54.461
whatever it is, and then
get up that next day,

1506
01:19:54.671 --> 01:19:57.089
get your shit together
and go out there

1507
01:19:57.298 --> 01:20:00.301
and just be who you are
because that will make somebody

1508
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:03.513
pay for what they've done
to the girls

1509
01:20:03.722 --> 01:20:06.307
who aren't here
to do that anymore.

1510
01:20:06.516 --> 01:20:11.103
You have to go forward for them,
is what I try to do.

1511
01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:17.396
Keep going forward, because
we've got to make a difference.

1512
01:20:23.742 --> 01:20:27.953
[singing]
Let your light shine bright

1513
01:20:28.162 --> 01:20:32.833
Don't ever give up the fight

1514
01:20:33.042 --> 01:20:37.421
you chose to be,
so why not be free?

1515
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:38.673
(Janet)
Yeah, I'm not from

1516
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.550
San Francisco, and coming
into this space

1517
01:20:40.759 --> 01:20:41.718
as Celebrity Grand Marshal.

1518
01:20:41.925 --> 01:20:42.719
(Major)
Sure, yeah, yeah.

1519
01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:44.679
(Janet)
How would you advise me

1520
01:20:44.887 --> 01:20:46.723
for the five minutes
that I do have to speak?

1521
01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:48.725
What would you advise me
to say as someone

1522
01:20:48.932 --> 01:20:50.267
who is from here,
what do you think that

1523
01:20:50.476 --> 01:20:51.603
these people need to hear?

1524
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:54.271
(Major)
They need to know that

1525
01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.692
we have substance,
we have meaning,

1526
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:01.028
that this is only
a step forward.

1527
01:21:01.236 --> 01:21:04.741
This isn't the change
that we deserve yet.

1528
01:21:04.948 --> 01:21:08.160
In this congratulatory thing
that you're giving me,

1529
01:21:08.369 --> 01:21:11.623
realize that it is not
where it needs to be,

1530
01:21:11.831 --> 01:21:14.875
where we're going to push it
to be and the community's

1531
01:21:15.084 --> 01:21:18.630
going to help us all get there.

1532
01:21:18.838 --> 01:21:21.340
No girl is gonna be left behind,
and we're not throwin'

1533
01:21:21.549 --> 01:21:23.718
any bitches under the bus.

1534
01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:26.763
And you all are so powerful
and articulate

1535
01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:28.765
and marvelous and wonderful.

1536
01:21:28.972 --> 01:21:31.141
And true spirits and souls,
you know.

1537
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:34.604
Just knowing that you exist
is such a blessing

1538
01:21:34.813 --> 01:21:36.480
for me, personally.

1539
01:21:36.689 --> 01:21:41.689
So... I love you all so much.

1540
01:21:42.236 --> 01:21:45.698
Thanks, baby.
Thank you so much.

Celebrity Grand Marshal,
Janet Mock!

1544
01:21:55.708 --> 01:21:56.626
Make a round of applause
for her.

(Janet)
Forty-five years ago today,

1547
01:22:01.213 --> 01:22:06.213
our forbearers, gays
and lesbians, low-income queers,

1548
01:22:06.636 --> 01:22:11.636
homeless youth, fly drag queens,
and fierce trans women

1549
01:22:12.433 --> 01:22:16.228
fought to live
their lives openly, safely,

1550
01:22:16.437 --> 01:22:19.524
and without restrictions.

1551
01:22:19.732 --> 01:22:24.612
Legend says that in 1969
Marsha P. Johnson threw

1552
01:22:24.821 --> 01:22:27.657
a Molotov cocktail into
the crowd kicking off

1553
01:22:27.866 --> 01:22:30.200
the Stonewall Uprising.

1554
01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:33.454
Others say it was actually
Sylvia Rivera throwing

1555
01:22:33.663 --> 01:22:37.291
a brick at the police
that served as a catalyst

1556
01:22:37.499 --> 01:22:40.210
for our liberation.

1557
01:22:40.419 --> 01:22:44.716
Regardless, it was
unapologetic trans people

1558
01:22:44.924 --> 01:22:48.553
who helped ignite our movement
forty-five years ago

1559
01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:49.762
and I am proud-

1560
01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:53.600
to be a product
of their resilience,

1561
01:22:53.808 --> 01:22:56.561
their fearlessness
and their brilliance.

1562
01:22:56.769 --> 01:22:59.731
Yesterday I was lucky enough
to share an afternoon

1563
01:22:59.939 --> 01:23:02.232
with Miss Major Griffin-Gracy.

1564
01:23:02.441 --> 01:23:04.777
I sat at her side
and realized that

1565
01:23:04.985 --> 01:23:08.656
she was and has always
been the answer.

1566
01:23:08.865 --> 01:23:11.534
It was Miss Major who told me
to never forget

1567
01:23:11.743 --> 01:23:15.329
that I am trans just as much
as I am Black,

1568
01:23:15.538 --> 01:23:18.332
just as much as I am a woman.

1569
01:23:18.541 --> 01:23:22.504
It was Miss Major who taught me
to center my sisters in my work.

1570
01:23:22.712 --> 01:23:26.758
She has always centered us,
those of us most forgotten

1571
01:23:26.966 --> 01:23:29.259
by LGBT movement leaders.

1572
01:23:29.468 --> 01:23:33.388
For decades Miss Major,
with little resources,

1573
01:23:33.598 --> 01:23:38.598
no pay or accolades has
taken care of our sisters behind bars,

1574
01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:41.898
our sisters working
on the streets, our sisters

1575
01:23:42.105 --> 01:23:44.024
searching for mothers.

1576
01:23:44.233 --> 01:23:46.736
She is the blueprint
for our liberation

1577
01:23:46.945 --> 01:23:50.615
and has ensured that
the path that I walk on,

1578
01:23:50.823 --> 01:23:55.410
that we all walk on is
less rocky because she exists.

1579
01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:59.624
We must never forget that
Stonewall was not a parade;

1580
01:23:59.832 --> 01:24:02.877
it was a police riot.

1581
01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:05.880
We must never forget
that whole communities

1582
01:24:06.088 --> 01:24:08.550
of low-income trans
and queer folk were fighting

1583
01:24:08.758 --> 01:24:10.259
for their lives that night.

1584
01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:13.596
Our siblings are still
fighting HIV/AIDS,

1585
01:24:13.805 --> 01:24:16.139
our sisters are still
banished to the darkness

1586
01:24:16.348 --> 01:24:20.812
of street corners, our people
are still being locked away

1587
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.647
and hunted down.

1588
01:24:22.855 --> 01:24:25.107
We must remember.

1589
01:24:25.315 --> 01:24:27.026
We must remember.

1590
01:24:27.234 --> 01:24:29.236
We must remember.

1591
01:24:29.444 --> 01:24:32.657
The memories of this day,
of all of you standing here

1592
01:24:32.865 --> 01:24:36.911
will serve as an enduring
reminder of our legacy

1593
01:24:37.119 --> 01:24:42.119
of resilience, of where
we are now and how far

1594
01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:45.753
we must move
and journey together.

That we shine never dies

No such thing
