00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.430


2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.230
You shall find the time Audrey.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.030
Patience, gentle Audrey.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.700
Faith, the priest was good enough,

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.800
for all the old gentleman's saying.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.830
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey,

7
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.630
a most vile Martext.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.930
But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.170
lays claim to you.

10
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.630
Aye, I know who 'tis.

11
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830
He hath no interest in me in the world.

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.300
Here comes the man you mean.

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.130
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown.

14
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.730
By my troth, we that have good wits

15
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.230
have much to answer for.

16
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.700
We shall be flouting; we cannot hold.

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.900
Good even, Audrey.

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.570
God ye good even, William.

19
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.070
And good even to you, sir.

20
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.370
Good even, gentle friend.

21
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.830
Cover thy head, cover thy head.

22
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.170
Nay, prithee, be covered.

23
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.530
How old are you, friend?

24
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.730
F...

25
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.270
Five and twenty, sir.

26
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.670
A ripe age.

27
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.100
Is thy name William?

28
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.200
William, sir.

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.300
A fair name.

30
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.730
Wast born i' the forest here?

31
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.030
Ay, sir, I thank God.

32
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.470
"Thank God"--a good answer.

33
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.600
Art rich?

34
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.000
Faith, sir, so-so.

35
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.700
"So-so" is good, very good, very excellent good,

36
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.000
and yet it is not.

37
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.430
It is but so-so.

38
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.570
Art thou wise?

39
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.230
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

40
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.430
Why, thou sayest well.

41
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.900
You do love this maid.

42
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.000
I do, sir.

43
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.130
Give me your hand.

44
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.570
Art thou learned?

45
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.670
No, sir.

46
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.230
Then learn this of me.

47
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.830
To have is to have,

48
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.200
for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink,

49
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.430
being poured out of a cup into a glass,

50
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.630
by filling the one doth empty the other,

51
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.000
for all your writers do consent that ipse is he.

52
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.670
Now, you are not ipse.

53
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.800
I am he.

54
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.170
Which he, sir?

55
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.700
He, sir, that must marry this woman.

56
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.930
Therefore, you clown, abandon--

57
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.470
which is in the vulgar "leave"--

58
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.800
the society--which in the boorish is "company"--

59
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.170
of this female-- which in the common is "woman"--

60
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.370
which together is

61
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.130
abandon the society of this female,

62
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.100
or, clown, thou perishest;

63
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.100
or, to thy better understanding, diest;

64
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.770
or, to wit, I kill thee;

65
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.970
make thee away,

66
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.470
translate thy life into death,

67
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.930
thy liberty into bondage.

68
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.770
I will deal in poison with thee or in bastinado or in steel.

69
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.630
I will bandy with thee in faction.

70
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.270
I will o'errun thee with policy.

71
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.300
I will kill you a hundred and fifty ways!

72
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.130
Therefore, tremble and depart!

73
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.500
Do, good William.

74
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.530
God rest you merry, sir.

75
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.030
Ah! Oh, Ee-yah!

76
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.370
Our master and mistress seeks you.

77
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.830
Come, away, away.

78
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.830
Trip, Audrey. Trip, Audrey.

79
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.000
I attend. I attend.

80
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.270
Is't possible that on so little acquaintance

81
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.530
you should like her?

82
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.300
That but seeing, you should love her?

83
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.800
And loving, woo?

84
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800
And wooing, she should grant?

85
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.670
And will you persever to enjoy her?

86
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.800
Neither call the giddiness of it in question,

87
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.130
nor the poverty of her, the small acquaintance,

88
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.370
nor my sudden wooing, nor her sudden consenting;

89
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.930
but say with me, I love Aliena.

90
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.900
Say with her that she loves me.

91
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.730
Consent to it both that we may enjoy each other.

92
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.300
It shall be to your good,

93
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.500
for my father's house and all the revenue

94
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.370
that was old Sir Rowland's will I bestow upon you

95
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.870
and here live and die a shepherd.

96
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.970
You have my consent.

97
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.430
Let your wedding be tomorrow.

98
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.230
Thither will I invite the duke and all's contented followers.

99
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.500
Go you, and prepare Aliena,

100
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.870
for look you,

101
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.500
here comes my Rosalind.

102
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.430
God save you, brother.

103
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.630
And you, fair sister.

104
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.200
O, my dear Orlando,

105
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.300
how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf.

106
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.130
It is my arm.

107
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.200
I thought thy heart had been wounded

108
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.800
with the claws of a lion.

109
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.900
Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

110
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.470
Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon

111
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.770
when he showed me your handkerchief?

112
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.430
Aye, and greater wonders than that.

113
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.970
O, I know where you are.

114
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.670
Nay, 'tis true.

115
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.330
There was never anything so sudden

116
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.300
as the fight of two rams

117
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.700
or Caesar's thrasonical brag of "I came, saw, and overcame,"

118
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.070
for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked,

119
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.700
no sooner looked but they loved,

120
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.470
no sooner loved but they sighed,

121
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.170
no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason,

122
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.230
no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;

123
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.630
and in these degrees

124
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.170
have they made a pair of stairs to marriage

125
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.530
which they will climb incontinent

126
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.970
or else be incontinent before marriage.

127
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.670
They are in the very wrath of love,

128
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.870
and they will together.

129
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.570
Clubs cannot part them.

130
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.170
They shall be married tomorrow,

131
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.470
and I will bid the duke to the nuptial,

132
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.130
but, O, how bitter a thing it is

133
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.200
to look into happiness through another man's eyes.

134
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200
By so much the more shall I tomorrow

135
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.970
be at the height of heart-heaviness

136
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.200
by how much I shall think my brother happy

137
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.370
in having what he wishes for.

138
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.470
Why then, tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

139
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.670
I can live no longer by thinking.

140
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:44.230
I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.

141
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.500
Know of me then, I can do strange things.

142
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.970
I have, since I was three year old,

143
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.630
conversed with a magician

144
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.800
most profound in his art and yet not damnable.

145
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.230
If you do love Rosalind

146
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.400
so near the heart as your gesture cries it out,

147
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.770
when your brother marries Aliena,

148
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.130
shall you marry her.

149
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.200
I know into what straits of fortune she is driven,

150
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.170
and it is not impossible to me,

151
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.330
if it appear not inconvenient to you,

152
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.430
to set her before your eyes tomorrow,

153
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.970
human as she is and without any danger.

154
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.230
Speakest thou in sober meanings?

155
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.200
By my life, I do, which I tender dearly,

156
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.100
although I say I am a magician.

157
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.470
Therefore, put you in your best array,

158
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.600
and bid your friends,

159
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.300
for if you will be married tomorrow, you shall,

160
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.330
and to Rosalind, if you will.

161
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.270
Here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.

162
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.030
Youth, you have done me much ungentleness

163
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.030
to show the letter that I writ to you.

164
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.200
I care not if I have.

165
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.770
It is my study to seem despiteful and ungentle to you.

166
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.030
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd.

167
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.500
Look on him; love him.

168
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.200
He worships you.

169
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.530
Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

170
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.330
It is to be all made of sighs and tears,

171
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.130
and so am I for Phebe.

172
00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:27.770
And I for Ganymede.

173
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.100
And I for Rosalind.

174
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.200
And I for no woman.

175
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.400
It is to be all made of fantasy,

176
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.530
all made of passion,

177
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.130
and all made of wishes,

178
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:46.170
all adoration, duty, and observance,

179
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.100
all humbleness,

180
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.500
all patience and impatience,

181
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.270
all purity,

182
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.200
all trial,

183
00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.000
all obedience;

184
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.370
and so am I for Phebe.

185
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.600
And so am I for Ganymede.

186
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.170
And so am I for Rosalind.

187
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.600
And so am I for no woman.

188
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.500
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

189
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.900
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

190
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.400
If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

191
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.800
Who do you speak to, "Why blame you me to love you?"

192
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.970
To her that is not here nor doth not hear.

193
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.730
I pray you, no more of this.

194
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.900
It is like the howling of Irish wolves

195
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.770
against the moon.

196
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.430
I will help you, if I can.

197
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.500
I would love you, if I could.

198
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.400
Tomorrow, meet me all together.

199
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.830
I will marry you, if ever I marry woman,

200
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.900
and I'll be married tomorrow.

201
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.270
I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man,

202
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.270
and you shall be married tomorrow.

203
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.170
I will content you,

204
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.800
if what pleases you contents you,

205
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.470
and you shall be married tomorrow.

206
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.030
As you love Rosalind, meet;

207
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.330
as you love Phebe, meet;

208
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.670
and as I love no woman, I'll meet.

209
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.000
So fare you well.

210
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.530
I have left you commands.

211
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.330
I'll not fail, if I live.

212
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.870
Nor I.

213
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:12.870
Nor I.

214
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.130
Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey.

215
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.770
Tomorrow will we be married.

216
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.130
I do desire it with all my heart,

217
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.500
and I hope it is no dishonest desire

218
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.700
to desire to be a woman of the world.

219
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.370
Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.

220
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.770
Well met, honest gentleman.

221
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.030
By my troth, well met.

222
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.230
Come, sit, sit, in a song.

223
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.300
We are for you; sit i' the middle.

224
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.270
It was a lover and his lass--

225
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:43.830
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino

226
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.830
and a hey noni nonino--

227
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.270
that o'er the green corn fields did pass

228
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.870
in springtime, in springtime, in springtime,

229
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.870
the only pretty ring time,

230
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.270
when birds do sing

231
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.800
hey ding a ding a ding,

232
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.300
hey ding a ding a ding,

233
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.830
hey ding a ding a ding.

234
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.330
Sweet lovers love the spring.

235
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.430
Between the acres of the rye--

236
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.200
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino,

237
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.730
and a hey noni nonino--

238
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.970
these pretty country folk would lie

239
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.800
in springtime, in springtime, in springtime,

240
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.030
the only pretty ring time

241
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.900
when birds do sing

242
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.500
hey ding a ding a ding,

243
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.170
hey ding a ding a ding,

244
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.800
hey ding a ding a ding.

245
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.370
Sweet lovers love the spring.

246
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.130
This carol they began that hour--

247
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.300
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino,

248
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.830
and a hey noni nonino--

249
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.870
how that a life was but a flower

250
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.430
in springtime, in springtime, in springtime,

251
00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.330
the only pretty ring time

252
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.900
when birds do sing

253
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.400
hey ding a ding a ding,

254
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.900
hey ding a ding a ding,

255
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.430
hey ding a ding a ding.

256
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.830
Sweet lovers love the spring.

257
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.830
And therefore take the present time--

258
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.730
with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino,

259
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.000
and a hey noni nonino--

260
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.570
for love is crowned with the prime

261
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:28.170
in springtime, in springtime, in springtime,

262
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.200
the only pretty ring time

263
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.700
when birds do sing

264
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.570
hey ding a ding a ding,

265
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.900
hey ding a ding a ding,

266
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.330
hey ding a ding a ding.

267
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.130
Sweet lovers love the spring.

268
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.330
Truly, young gentlemen,

269
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.470
though there was no great matter in the ditty,

270
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.400
yet the note was very untunable.

271
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.700
You are deceived, sir.

272
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.170
We kept time, lost not our time.

273
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:50.430
By my troth, yes,

274
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.830
I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song.

275
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.230
God by you, and God mend your voices.

276
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.530
Come, Audrey.

277
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.570
Dost thou believe, Orlando,

278
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.770
that the boy can do all this that he hath promised?

279
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.370
I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not

280
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.230
as those that fear they hope and know they fear.

281
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.900
Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged.

282
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.870
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,

283
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.900
you will bestow her on Orlando here?

284
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.270
That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

285
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.700
You say you will have her when I bring her?

286
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.030
That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

287
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.400
You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?

288
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.530
That will I should I die the hour after.

289
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.600
But if you do refuse to marry me,

290
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.500
you will give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

291
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.970
So is the bargain.

292
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.900
You say you'll have Phebe if she will?

293
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.500
Though to have her and death were both one thing.

294
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:05.870
I have promised to make all this matter even.

295
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.130
Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;

296
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.870
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter.

297
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.470
Keep your word, Phebe, to marry me

298
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.570
or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd.

299
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.730
Keep your word, Silvius,

300
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.270
to marry her if she do refuse me.

301
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:32.530
And from hence I go to make these doubts all even.

302
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.170
I do remember in this shepherd boy

303
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.970
some lively touches of my daughter's favor.

304
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.570
My lord, the first time that I ever saw him

305
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.870
methought he was a brother to your daughter.

306
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.700
There is, sure, another flood toward,

307
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.970
and these couples are coming to the ark.

308
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.230
Here comes a pair of very strange beasts

309
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.100
which in all tongues are called fools.

310
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.500
Salutation and greeting to you all!

311
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.900
Good my lord, bid him welcome.

312
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.730
This is the motley-minded gentleman

313
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.370
I have so often met in the forest.

314
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.600
He hath been a courtier, he swears.

315
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.870
If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.

316
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.200
I have trod a measure.

317
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.530
I have flattered a lady.

318
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.200
I have been politic with my friend,

319
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.800
smooth with mine enemy.

320
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.600
I have undone three tailors.

321
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.730
I have had four quarrels and like to have fought one.

322
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.130
And how was that ta'en up?

323
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.500
Faith, we met and found our quarrel

324
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.400
was upon the seventh cause.

325
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.700
How seventh cause?

326
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.400
Good my lord, like this fellow.

327
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.800
I like him very well.

328
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.000
God 'ild you, sir.

329
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.300
I desire you of the like.

330
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.570
I press in here, sir,

331
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.730
amongst the rest of the country copulatives,

332
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.500
to swear and to forswear

333
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.800
according as marriage binds and blood breaks,

334
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.500
a poor virgin, sir,

335
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.330
an ill-favored thing, sir, but mine own;

336
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.030
a poor humor of mine, sir,

337
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.430
to take that that no man else will.

338
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.270
Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir,

339
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.470
in a poor house--

340
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.230
as your pearl in your foul oyster.

341
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.270
Faith, he is very swift and sententious.

342
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.630
But, for the seventh cause--

343
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.930
how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?

344
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.270
Upon a lie seven times removed--

345
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.530
bear your body more seeming, Audrey--

346
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.200
as thus, sir:

347
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.970
I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard.

348
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.370
He sent me word

349
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.870
if I said his beard was not cut well,

350
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.670
he was in the mind it was.

351
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.770
This is called the Retort Courteous.

352
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.300
If I sent him word again "It was not well cut,"

353
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:28.170
he would send me word, he cut it to please himself.

354
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.170
This is called the Quip Modest.

355
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.600
If again "It was not well cut," he disabled my judgment.

356
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.800
This is called the Reply Churlish.

357
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.200
If again "It was not well cut,"

358
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.530
he would answer I spake not true.

359
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.530
This is called the Reproof Valiant.

360
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.000
If again "It was not well cut," he would say I lie.

361
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.230
This is called the Countercheque Quarrelsome,

362
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.470
and so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

363
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.730
And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

364
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.070
I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,

365
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.930
nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct,

366
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.700
and so we measured swords and parted.

367
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.230
Is not this a rare fellow, my lord?

368
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.430
He's as good at anything and yet a fool.

369
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.330
He uses his folly like a stalking-horse

370
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.070
and under the presentation of that,

371
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.570
he shoots his wit.

372
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.230
Then is there mirth in heaven

373
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.600
when earthly things made even atone together.

374
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.530
Good duke, receive thy daughter.

375
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.900
Hymen from heaven brought her,

376
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.270
yea, brought her hither

377
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.000
that thou mightst join her hand with his

378
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.570
whose heart within his bosom is.

379
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.370
To you, I give myself, for I am yours.

380
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.170
To you I give myself, for I am yours.

381
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.500
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

382
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.630
If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

383
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.670
If sight and shape be true,

384
00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.430
why then, my love, adieu.

385
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.530
I'll have no father if you be not he.

386
00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.000
I'll have no husband if you be not he...

387
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.130
nor ne'er wed woman if you be not she.

388
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.470
Peace, ho.

389
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.130
I bar confusion.

390
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.570
'Tis I must make conclusion

391
00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.500
of these most strange events.

392
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.970
Here's eight that must take hands

393
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.270
to join in Hymen's bands

394
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.730
if truth holds true contents.

395
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.000
You and you no cross shall part.

396
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:46.800
You and you are heart in heart.

397
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.770
You to his love must accord

398
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.000
or have a woman to your lord.

399
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.830
You and you are sure together

400
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.470
as the winter to foul weather.

401
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.730
Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing,

402
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.700
feed yourselves with questioning

403
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.630
that reason wonder may diminish

404
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.330
how thus we met and these things finish.

405
00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.200
Wedding is great Juno's crown,

406
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.470
O blessed bond of board and bed.

407
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.030
'Tis Hymen peoples every town.

408
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.600
High wedlock then be honored.

409
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.000
Honor, high honor, and renown

410
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.700
to Hymen, god of every town.

411
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.300
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me.

412
00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.030
Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.

413
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.430
I will not eat my word now thou art mine.

414
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:09.300
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

415
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.400
Let me have audience for a word or two.

416
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.570
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland

417
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.330
that bring these tidings to this fair assembly.

418
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.070
Duke Frederick,

419
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.470
hearing how that every day

420
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.770
men of great worth resorted to this forest,

421
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.400
address'd a mighty power,

422
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.100
which were on foot, in his own conduct,

423
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.770
purposely to take his brother here

424
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.000
and put him to the sword,

425
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.730
and to the skirts of this wild wood, he came,

426
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.470
where, meeting with an old religious man,

427
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:48.300
after some question with him

428
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.230
was converted

429
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.170
both from his enterprise

430
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:54.100
and from the world,

431
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.130
his crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother

432
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.570
and all their lands restored to them again

433
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:01.030
that were with him exiled.

434
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.370
This to be true,

435
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.200
I do engage my life.

436
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.000
Welcome, young man.

437
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.730
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding.

438
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.170
To the one his lands withheld

439
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:33.100
and to the other a land itself at large,

440
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.230
a potent dukedom.

441
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.970
First, in this forest, let us do those ends

442
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.700
which here were well begun and well begot:

443
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.800
and after, every of this happy number

444
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.230
that have endured shrewd days and nights with us

445
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:51.900
shall share the good of our returned fortune

446
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.670
according to the measure of their states.

447
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.000
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity

448
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.100
and fall into our rustic revelry.

449
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.230
Play, music!

450
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.500
And you, brides and bridegrooms all,

451
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.500
with measure heap'd in joy,

452
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.870
to the measures fall.

453
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.030
Sir, by your patience.

454
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:17.770
If I heard you rightly, the duke hath put on a religious life

455
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.130
and thrown into neglect the pompous court?

456
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.130
He hath.

457
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.530
To him will I.

458
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.000
Out of these convertites,

459
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.200
there is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

460
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.530
You to your former honor I bequeath.

461
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.370
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.

462
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.900
You to a love that your true faith doth merit.

463
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:54.630
You to your land and love and great allies.

464
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.130
You to a long and well-deserved bed.

465
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.370
And you to wrangling,

466
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.670
for thy loving voyage is but for two months victuall'd.

467
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.900
So, to your pleasures.

468
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.830
I am for other than for dancing measures.

469
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.530
Stay, Jaques, stay.

470
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:23.770
To see no pastime I, what you will have,

471
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.870
I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.

472
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.830
Proceed, proceed.

473
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:40.230
We will begin these rites as we do trust they'll end,

474
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.330
in true delights.

475
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.900
It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue,

476
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.500
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue.

477
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.300
If it be true that good wine needs no bush,

478
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.600
'tis true that a good play needs no epilogue.

479
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.300
Yet to good wine, they do use good bushes,

480
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.970
and a good play proves the better

481
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.400
by the help of good epilogue.

482
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.430
What a case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue

483
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.000
nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play.

484
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.800
I am not furnished like a beggar.

485
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.070
Therefore, to beg will not become me.

486
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:13.170
My way is to conjure you,

487
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.000
and I'll begin with the women.

488
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.830
I charge you, O women, for the love you bear to men,

489
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.470
to like as much of this play as please you;

490
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:30.170
and I charge you, O men, for the love you bear to women--

491
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.470
as I perceive by your simpering none of you hates them--

492
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:39.870
that between you and the women, the play may please.

493
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.670
If I were a woman,

494
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.100
I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me,

495
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.670
complexions that liked me, and breaths that I defied not;

496
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.600
and as many of you as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths

497
00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.400
will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,

498
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.400
bid me farewell.

499
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.470
