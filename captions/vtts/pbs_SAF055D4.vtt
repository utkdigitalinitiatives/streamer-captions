WEBVTT

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.930
WE'VE COME TO A CARIBBEAN ISLAND

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.200
WHOSE ONLY INHABITANTS
ARE MONKEYS

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.230
TO ASK THE QUESTION: WHAT CAN
THEY TEACH US ABOUT OURSELVES?

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.930
<i>CAN WE FIND THE ROOTS
 OF HUMAN MORALITY</i>

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.060
<i>IN HOW CHIMPANZEES SHARE?</i>

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.830
<i>DO CHIMPS USE TOOLS...</i>

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.900
YOU WANT A STICK?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
<i>THE SAME WAY WE DO?</i>

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.260
<i>WHAT'S THE LINK
 BETWEEN THIS ODD PRIMATE</i>

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.060
<i>AND A SPECIAL HUMAN SKILL?</i>

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.530
IT MAKES HER SMILE.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.730
<i>AND WE'LL FIND OUT HOW
 TO BEHAVE IN POLITE SOCIETY.</i>

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.160
I'M ALAN ALDA.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.930
PRESENTATION OF
<i> SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FRONTIERS</i>

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.060
IS MADE POSSIBLE BY A GRANT
FROM GTE CORPORATION.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.230
AT GTE, IT'S AMAZING
WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.560
Alda:
THIS ISLAND OFF
THE COAST OF PUERTO RICO

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.200
IS A PRESERVE FOR MACAQUE
MONKEYS ORIGINALLY FROM INDIA.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.430
MONKEYS HERE LIVE PRETTY MUCH AS
THEY WOULD IF WE WEREN'T AROUND.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.200
IT'S A GREAT PLACE
FOR MONKEY WATCHING.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.500
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.460
MONKEY WATCHING IS FASCINATING
FOR TWO REASONS--

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.730
HOW LIKE US THEY ARE

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.630
AND HOW<i> NOT</i> LIKE US THEY ARE.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.630
THE BIG DIFFERENCE, OF COURSE,
IS IN OUR HEADS.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.060
PEOPLE ARE CAPABLE OF LANGUAGE,
MATHEMATICS, CULTURE

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.730
COMPLEX SOCIAL STRUCTURES

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.300
WONDERS THAT SEEM TO US

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.200
TO BE SO FAR ABOVE
THE ABILITIES OF MONKEYS

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.430
THAT THEY MUST BE
UNIQUELY HUMAN.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.900
BUT ARE THEY?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.300
THAT'S THE QUESTION WE'LL BE
ASKING FOR THE NEXT HOUR.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.960
HOW MUCH OF<i> US</i> IS IN<i> THEM?</i>

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.900
AND HOW MUCH OF<i> THEM</i> IS IN<i> US?</i>

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.330
OUR FIRST STORY IS ABOUT WHAT
THESE DAYS IS A VERY HOT TOPIC--

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.730
AGGRESSION.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.400
MACAQUES-- RHESUS MONKEYS--
SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.160
HANGING OUT IN LARGE GROUPS.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.360
MOSTLY, THEY GET ALONG
JUST FINE

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.400
AND ARGUMENTS ONLY RARELY
TURN VIOLENT ENOUGH

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.330
FOR SOMEONE TO GET HURT.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.030
AND WHEN THINGS DO GET
A LITTLE TOO STRESSFUL

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.860
THE MONKEYS HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM
ON THE ISLAND

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.630
TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.800
BUT WHAT IF THEY LIVED
IN MORE CROWDED CONDITIONS?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.760
THESE MONKEYS AREN'T
ON AN ISLAND.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.400
THEY'RE IN A LARGE ENCLOSURE

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.730
AT THE YERKES PRIMATE CENTER
IN ATLANTA.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.160
HOW THEY COPE WITH CROWDING HERE
MAY HELP US UNDERSTAND

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.700
HOW THEIR FELLOW PRIMATES,
PEOPLE, COPE WITH THE STRESS

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.760
OF LIVING IN THE CROWDED CITIES.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.600
IT MAY LOOK AS THOUGH THE
MONKEYS HERE HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.860
BUT THEY'RE 500 TIMES
MORE CROWDED

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.730
THAN THEY ARE ON THE ISLAND.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.100
THEY'RE PART OF
A LONG-TERM EXPERIMENT

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.800
ON CROWDING IN MONKEYS

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.630
INSPIRED BY THE IDEAS OF YERKES
PRIMATOLOGIST FRANS DE WAAL.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.300
HOW LONG HAVE PEOPLE BEEN
STUDYING CROWDING IN ANIMALS?

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.600
PROBABLY VERY LONG.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.230
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL STUDY
CAME OUT IN THE '60s

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.230
WHERE SOMEONE DID
A STUDY ON RATS.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.800
RATS LIVED IN A SMALL ROOM

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.900
AND AS IT GOT MORE CROWDED,
THE MORE THEY MULTIPLIED

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.860
AND THEY BECAME
VERY AGGRESSIVE.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.930
THEY EVEN KILLED
AND ATE EACH OTHER.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.330
Alda:
IT'S UNUSUAL HERE AT YERKES

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.930
FOR THE MONKEYS TO GET PACKED
TOGETHER THE WAY THE RATS WERE

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.330
BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.400
THEY HAVE TO BE ROUNDED UP
FOR ROUTINE MEDICAL CARE.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.230
THEY'RE USED TO THE OPERATION

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.460
AND THEY HEAD
FOR THEIR INDOOR CAGE

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.530
AS SOON AS THEIR KEEPERS APPEAR.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.660
ONCE INSIDE, THEY'RE ANYTHING
BUT AGGRESSIVE.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.860
IN FACT, THEIR BEHAVIOR
REMINDED ME

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.700
OF THE WAY WE HUMANS COPE WITH
BEING TIGHTLY PACKED TOGETHER.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.260
Alda:
WHEN YOU CROWD PEOPLE
IN AN ELEVATOR

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260
YOU DON'T TEND
TO GET AGGRESSION

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.000
YOU TEND TO GET RITUALIZED
POLITE BEHAVIOR.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.460
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN
LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.200
YEAH, THEY AVOID
INTERACTION

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.100
AND SO THEY AVOID ANYTHING
THAT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.160
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY
CROWDED SPACE.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
AND IF YOU DO
WITH RHESUS MONKEYS

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.030
AN ACUTE CROWDING EXPERIMENT--

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.260
SORT OF THE ELEVATOR EFFECT--
YOU GET SIMILAR BEHAVIOR.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.460
THEY MAY STAY NEXT TO EACH
OTHER, BUT THEY DON'T MOVE

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.560
AND THEY DON'T INTERACT
VERY MUCH.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.300
Alda:
SO WHEN WE'RE REALLY
PACKED TOGETHER

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.400
PEOPLE AND MONKEYS
SEEM TO COPE IN THE SAME WAY

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.860
BY BEING VERY CAREFUL.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.830
BUT WHAT ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE?

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.530
MONKEY SOCIETY IS BASED
ON A STRICT HIERARCHY

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.900
IN WHICH EVERYONE KNOWS
HIS OR HER PLACE.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.000
IN THIS MODERATELY
CROWDED ENCLOSURE

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.430
ONE IMPORTANT WAY TO AVOID
CONFLICT IS BY GRINNING A LOT--

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.600
MORE SCIENTIFICALLY CALLED
"THE BARED TEETH RESPONSE."

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.130
De Waal:
THAT'S A BEHAVIOR
THAT GOES UP DRAMATICALLY

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.900
UNDER MORE CROWDED
CONDITIONS

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.800
AS IF THE SUBORDINATES ARE
TELLING THE DOMINANTS

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.300
"I'M STILL SUBORDINATE
IN THE HIERARCHY

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.600
SO YOU DON'T NEED
TO ATTACK ME."

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.830
ARE THERE SOME MONKEYS
WHERE BARING THE TEETH

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.630
IS A SIGN OF AGGRESSION?

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.930
YOU CAN SHOW YOUR
TEETH IN TWO WAYS.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.160
IF A RHESUS MONKEY
OPENS THE MOUTH

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.560
AND STARES AT SOMEONE

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.160
THAT'S A THREAT.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.900
BUT BARING THE TEETH
IN A SMILE TYPE OF WAY

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.400
IS A SUBMISSIVE GESTURE.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.200
IN THE APES SUCH AS
CHIMPANZEES AND IN HUMANS

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.130
IT HAS GOT AN AFFILIATIVE
AND FRIENDLY COMPONENT

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.560
BUT STILL NERVOUSNESS
IS OFTEN INVOLVED

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.430
AND IF SOMEONE SMILES
TOO MUCH

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.400
WE SAY THAT'S
A NERVOUS PERSON.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.730
RIGHT.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.330
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.030
ABOUT GETTING SCRATCHED
AND BITTEN LATER.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.630
Alda:
PETER JUDGE IS IN CHARGE
OF THE CROWDING STUDIES.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.500
HERE'S A TYPICAL INCIDENT

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.700
IN THE LONG HOURS
HE SPENDS MONKEY WATCHING.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.000
THIS BABY IS JUST
A FEW WEEKS OLD

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.100
AND A POPULAR PLAYMATE
FOR THE OTHER MONKEYS.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.600
THE MOTHER, NAMED ALLIE

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.930
IS CONSTANTLY FENDING OFF
UNWANTED INVITATIONS.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.330
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.500
SUDDENLY, A YOUNG MONKEY
CALLED D.J. GETS TOO ROUGH.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.600
ALLIE THREAT D.J.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.530
Alda:
BUT MOMENTS LATER,
D.J. APPROACHES ALLIE

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.630
AND THE TWO MONKEYS MAKE UP.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.900
D.J. SIT
PROXIMITY ALLIE.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.230
D.J. GROOM ALLIE.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.300
Alda:
GROOMING EACH OTHER IS THE
MONKEY'S MAIN WAY OF RELAXING

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.300
AND HAVING A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.800
WHAT PETER JUDGE FOUND

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.430
IS THAT IN THE POTENTIALLY
EXPLOSIVE CONDITIONS OF CROWDING

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.130
MONKEYS DO A LOT MORE TO KEEP
THE PEACE BETWEEN EACH OTHER

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.860
THAN THEY DO WHEN
THEY HAVE ROOM TO SPARE.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.460
Judge:
IF YOU LOOK AT
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.200
SOME AGGRESSION GOES UP,
AND SOME DOESN'T.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.200
IF YOU LOOK AT
FRIENDLY BEHAVIOR

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.500
ALMOST EVERY CATEGORY
OF FRIENDLY BEHAVIOR INCREASES.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.330
IF IN A CONDITION LIKE THAT

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.860
WHERE YOU'RE ALWAYS CLOSE
TO YOUR POTENTIAL AGGRESSOR

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.300
IT'S WORTH YOUR WHILE

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.730
TO RESTORE THE RELATIONSHIP
AND RESOLVE THE CONFLICT.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.100
Alda:
RHESUS MONKEYS HAVE BEEN OFF ON
THEIR OWN EVOLUTIONARY PATHWAY

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.660
SEPARATE FROM THE ONE
THAT LED TO HUMANS

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:06.960
FOR SOMETHING LIKE
30 MILLION YEARS.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.700
MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO US--

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.760
SEPARATED BY ONLY SIX MILLION
YEARS OF EVOLUTION--

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.300
ARE CHIMPANZEES.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.460
IT WAS WATCHING CHIMPS

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.860
THAT FIRST CONVINCED
FRANS DE WAAL 20 YEARS AGO

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.360
THAT THE HIGHER PRIMATES
ALL SHARE

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.400
A DEEPLY-ROOTED INSTINCT
FOR MAKING PEACE.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.130
THIS GROUP OF 19 CHIMPANZEES

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.230
LIVING BELOW FRANS' OFFICE
AT YERKES

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.960
INCLUDED JIMOH, THE ALPHA MALE
OR GROUP LEADER

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.130
AND PEONY, THE DOMINANT FEMALE,
HERE WITH HER DAUGHTER.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.100
THE ADOLESCENT MALES
IN THE GROUP

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.160
OFTEN ACT LIKE ADOLESCENTS.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.630
BUT THE FIGHTS
RARELY GET SERIOUS

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.760
AND AS WITH THE RHESUS MONKEYS

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.900
THEY USUALLY END
IN FRIENDLY RECONCILIATIONS

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.400
THIS ONE INVOLVING
TICKLING AND LAUGHTER.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.300
NOW WE WILL THROW THEM
IN ONE AT A TIME.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.300
Alda:
FRANS RECENTLY BEGAN
SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH HIS CHIMPS

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.700
THAT ARE CONVINCING HIM
THAT NOT ONLY PEACEMAKING

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.100
BUT EVEN SUCH SUPPOSEDLY
HUMAN TRAITS AS MORALITY

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.800
HAVE BIOLOGICAL ROOTS
THAT WE SHARE WITH CHIMPANZEES.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.800
THESE BUNDLES OF LEAVES
ARE A TREAT FOR THE CHIMPS

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.560
AN ADDITION TO
THEIR REGULAR DIET.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.960
De Waal:
THAT'S A JUVENILE
WHO TOOK IT

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.730
AND THE ALPHA MALE
TAKES IT OVER FROM HIM.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.400
Alda:
MOST OF THE CHIMPS GATHER
AROUND A BUNDLE

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.260
AND PEACEFULLY SHARE THE LEAVES.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.000
BUT THE BUNDLE RIGHT BELOW US

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.430
WAS TAKEN BY A YOUNG FEMALE
CALLED GEORGIA

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.400
WHO IS MUCH LESS WILLING
TO SHARE.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.700
IS GEORGIA
STINGY

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.830
BECAUSE SHE HASN'T LEARNED
TO SHARE

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.560
OR IS SHE NATURALLY STINGY?

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.360
IN HUMAN TERMS,
YOU WOULD SAY

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.530
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE CONFIDENCE
AND THE POSITION YET

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.230
TO BE GENEROUS WITH OTHERS.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.930
SHE'S STILL VERY MUCH
IN A COMPETITIVE MODE

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.230
LIKE "HOW MUCH
CAN I GET MYSELF?"

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.730
Alda:
GEORGIA SAT WITH HER BACK TO US
FIRMLY MONOPOLIZING HER BUNDLE.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.700
WE COLLECT THOUSANDS
OF FOOD TRANSFERS

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.060
BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.000
AMONG ADULTS,
IT'S RECIPROCAL--

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.700
IF I SHARE WITH YOU,
YOU WILL SHARE WITH ME.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.760
JUVENILES ARE TOTALLY
OUT OF THIS.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.060
JUVENILES WORK ON
A STEALING OPERATION.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.730
Alda:
GEORGIA'S TACTIC
OF STEALING BACKFIRES

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.060
AS ANOTHER JUVENILE STEALS
THE WHOLE BUNDLE FROM HER.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.730
THAT'S A TYPICAL
JUVENILE WAY
OF DOING IT.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.560
Alda:
GEORGIA'S SELFISHNESS
HAS OTHER CONSEQUENCES.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.160
INDIVIDUALS
SUCH AS GEORGIA

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.830
WHO ARE NOT VERY GENEROUS--

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.630
WHEN THEY ARE IN NEED OF FOOD

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.960
THEY ARE REJECTED
BY OTHER INDIVIDUALS

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.260
AS IF THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS
ARE SAYING

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.430
"WELL, YOU'RE NEVER
SHARING WITH ME

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.260
WHY SHOULD I SHARE WITH YOU?"

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.300
AND THIS IS ALSO HOW
YOUNG FEMALES SUCH AS GEORGIA

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.730
ARE GRADUALLY LEARNING

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.560
IT IS MUCH BETTER TO COOPERATE

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.060
WITH A SYSTEM
LIKE THAT.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.200
WE GET ACTUALLY MORE OUT OF IT

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.000
BY COOPERATING
AND CONTRIBUTING TO IT.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.360
Alda:
FRANS AND HIS RESEARCH ASSISTANT
MIKE SERES HAVE KEPT TRACK

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.860
IN THE THOUSANDS
OF TRIALS THEY HAVE RUN

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.660
OF JUST WHO SHARES WITH WHOM.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.930
WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS THAT
THE CHIMPS KEEP TRACK, TOO.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.330
SO IF ONE CHIMP SHARES FOOD
WITH ANOTHER IN THE MORNING

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.960
THE GENEROSITY IS RETURNED

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.730
BY A SPELL OF GROOMING
IN THE AFTERNOON.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.960
THE VERY YOUNG ARE ALLOWED
TO GET AWAY WITH BEHAVIOR

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.830
THAT THE FEMALES IN THIS GROUP

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.230
DON'T TOLERATE FROM
AN ADOLESCENT MALE.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.900
HE PICKS UP A STICK
AND TRIES INTIMIDATION

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.230
BUT THE GROUP ISN'T IMPRESSED.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.230
HERE'S GEORGIA,
AGAIN CAUSING TROUBLE.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.760
JIMOH AMBLES OVER,
NUDGES HER GENTLY

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.460
AND SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND
IN APOLOGY.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.460
AGAIN, JIMOH BREAKS UP
A SQUABBLE.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:13.100
SO WHILE AS IN HUMAN SOCIETY,
THERE'S CONFLICT AND AGGRESSION

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.130
CHIMPS HAVE MANY STRATEGIES
FOR KEEPING THE PEACE.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.860
FRANS SEES IN THESE BEHAVIORS

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.560
THE ROOT OF WHAT IN HUMANS
WE CALL MORALITY.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.600
THEY HAVE MANY OF THE EMOTIONS
AND ELEMENTS OF HUMAN MORALITY

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.030
SUCH AS EMPATHY
AND SYMPATHY PROBABLY

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.030
GENEROSITY, CERTAIN FORMS OF
ALTRUISM, RULES AND REGULATIONS

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.700
CONFLICT RESOLUTION, WHICH IS
ONE OF MY MAIN INTERESTS

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.660
IS HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS
AMONG THEMSELVES.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.460
AND BASICALLY, YOU CAN LOOK
AT HUMAN MORALITY AS A SYSTEM

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.960
THAT RESOLVES CONFLICTS
AMONG PARTIES

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.660
THAT LIVE IN ONE SOCIETY.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.400
DOES THAT LEAD YOU TO THINK
IN A DIFFERENT WAY

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.730
ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF HUMAN
MORALITY THAN YOU DID BEFORE?

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.100
HUMAN MORALITY MUST HAVE
SOME DEEP EVOLUTIONARY ROOTS.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.830
IT MUST COME FROM SOMEWHERE

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.860
AND PROBABLY IN OTHER ANIMALS,
WE CAN FIND NOT THE WHOLE SYSTEM

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.000
BUT WE CAN FIND CERTAIN ELEMENTS
OF HUMAN MORALITY

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.800
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M SEEING
WHEN I LOOK AT CHIMPANZEES.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.560
Alda:
CHIMPANZEES ARE OUR CLOSEST
NONHUMAN RELATIVES.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.060
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY
PRIMATES WITH A CODE OF ETHICS.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.600
EVEN THOUGH THEY BRANCHED OFF
FROM US 40 MILLION YEARS AGO

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.230
THERE'S A SPECIES OF MONKEY
THAT ALSO TRADES TIT FOR TAT--

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.730
CAPUCHINS.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.600
CAPUCHINS ARE BEING STUDIED

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.330
BY ONE OF FRANS DE WAAL'S
RESEARCH STUDENTS, LISA PARR.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.060
CAPUCHINS ARE
WELL KNOWN

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.030
FOR BEING VERY
MANIPULATIVE IN THEIR FOOD.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.560
SO YOU CAN SEE
THAT THEY'LL... OOPS.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.400
HE WASN'T TOO GOOD
ABOUT THAT MANIPULATION.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.560
HE WANTS THE WHOLE BUNCH,
NOT JUST A PIECE.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.400
THEY ALSO HAVE
LARGE BRAINS

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.830
FOR THEIR BODY SIZE.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:52.060
IT'S THE LARGEST AMONG
THE NEW WORLD MONKEYS.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.230
AND THEY ALL HAVE
CREWCUTS, TOO.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.460
TODAY'S EXPERIMENT WILL INVOLVE
"BIAS," A FEMALE CAPUCHIN...

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.130
Woman:
COME ON, VINCENT.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.800
Alda:
AND VINCENT, A MALE COLLEAGUE.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.160
VINCENT IS GIVEN
A BUCKET OF APPLES.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.730
THEN IT'S TIME FOR US
TO DISCREETLY WITHDRAW.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.300
THESE TWO ARE
VERY TOLERANT
OF ONE ANOTHER.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.100
THEY'RE SITTING
CLOSE TOGETHER

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.400
DOING WHAT WE'VE TERMED
"PASSIVE FOOD SHARING."

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.900
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.030
IT MEANS THAT
THE FOOD POSSESSOR

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.560
IS SITTING
CLOSE ENOUGH

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.130
SO THAT
DISCARDED PIECES

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:39.800
AND BROKEN
BITS OF PIECES

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.860
ARE WITHIN REACH OF THE
PASSIVE FOOD PARTNER.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.600
BECAUSE HE'S NOT
PREVENTING HER

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.730
FROM TAKING THE FOOD,
THAT'S SHARING.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.330
IS THERE
ANY INDICATION

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.060
HE'S LEAVING THESE
PIECES DELIBERATELY

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.330
IN SOME WAY?

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.400
I MEAN, IS HE
JUST A SLOPPY EATER

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.730
THAT DOESN'T CARE
WHO GRABS HIS FOOD?

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.300
WELL, WE HAVE CONTROL
STUDIES THAT WE DO

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.030
WHERE THERE'S ONLY
ONE ANIMAL IN THE CAGE

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.900
AND UNDER THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.860
THE ANIMAL USUALLY DOESN'T
SIT CLOSE TO THE MESH

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.300
SO THE PIECES AREN'T
LEFT WITHIN REACH.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.230
Alda:
SO CAPUCHINS, TOO,
SHARE AND SHARE ALIKE.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.700
IT SEEMS THAT NO MATTER WHAT
PRIMATE SPECIES HE LOOKS AT

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.730
FRANS DE WAAL FINDS EVIDENCE
OF COOPERATION AND PEACEMAKING.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.300
Alda:
IT SEEMS KIND OF
A REASSURING IDEA

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:34.230
THAT THIS DRIVE FOR HOLDING DOWN
VIOLENCE COMES NATURALLY TO...

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:39.030
TO OUR COUSINS
AND PROBABLY TO US.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.830
I'M GLAD YOU SAID "NATURALLY"

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.230
BECAUSE USUALLY PEOPLE
USE ANIMALS ONLY

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.230
FOR THE BAD SIDE
OF HUMAN NATURE.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.060
LIKE WHAT PEOPLE DO IN RWANDA

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.260
WE SAY THEY ARE
ACTING LIKE ANIMALS.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.560
AS SOON AS WE DO SOMETHING BAD
IT'S BEASTLY BEHAVIOR.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.960
IF WE DO SOMETHING GOOD

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.500
IT'S OUR NOBLE HUMAN NATURE
THAT CAUSES IT

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.660
AND I THINK WE HAVE
BOTH SIDES IN US

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.430
AND WE CAN SEE BOTH SIDES
IN OTHER PRIMATES

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.130
IS THAT WE HAVE AGGRESSIVE
TENDENCIES, VIOLENT TENDENCIES.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.660
BUT AT THE SAME TIME

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.130
WE HAVE MECHANISMS TO DEAL
WITH THESE ISSUES.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.000
Alda:
LIKE HUMAN BABIES

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.160
CHIMP BABIES ARE DEPENDENT
ON THEIR MOTHERS

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.430
WHEN THEY'RE BORN AND
FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.860
AS THEY LEARN TO
BECOME GOOD CHIMPS.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.000
BUT WHEN CHIMPS ARE
BORN IN CAPTIVITY

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.630
MOTHERS DON'T SEEM ABLE
TO TEACH THEIR BABIES

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.560
THE PROPER RULES
OF CHIMP SOCIETY.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.360
SO AT YERKES, BABIES ARE BROUGHT
HERE TO THE CHIMP NURSERY

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:48.860
WHERE IT'S UP TO HUMANS TO TEACH
THEM HOW TO BECOME GOOD CHIMPS.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.260
ABANDONED AT BIRTH

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.860
THREE-WEEK-OLD JULIE IS
NOW BEING RAISED BY KIM BARD

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.630
WHO TRIES TO BE
AS CHIMPLIKE AS SHE CAN.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.760
Bard:
WE NURTURE THEM AS BABIES

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.100
CHIMPANZEE-STYLE.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.400
WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE HUMANS

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.930
WE WANT THEM TO BE
GOOD CHIMPANZEES.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.930
SO HUMAN BABIES
YOU WOULD FEED LYING DOWN

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.960
CHIMP BABIES EAT LIKE THIS.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.330
WHAT ARE YOU
SMILING AT?

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.500
IS THAT A SMILE?

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.400
YES, THAT'S
A SMILE.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.700
SHE SMILES WITH
THE BOTTOM TEETH

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.400
A LITTLE
LIKE BOB HOPE.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.600
THEY SMILE WITH
THE BOTTOM GUMS

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:25.130
IN HER CASE, SHOWING.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.900
IF YOU SEE
THE TOP TEETH

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.830
IT'S BY DEFINITION NOT
A SMILE ON A CHIMPANZEE.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.060
Alda:
LIKE HUMAN BABIES, CHIMP BABIES
ARE MAGNETS TO ADULTS.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.960
I MUST BE AT LEAST
AS PROGRAMMED AS SHE IS

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.330
BECAUSE I GOT A LOT
MORE INTERESTED

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.660
AS SOON AS SHE
GRABBED MY FINGERS.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.500
DO YOU FIND
THAT HAPPENING
IN A MOTHER CHIMP

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.900
IF THE BABY GRABS
ONTO HER?

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.900
SHE HAS THE BABY
GRABBING ONTO HER
ALL THE TIME.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.460
AND WHAT SHE DOES IS
DO THESE KINDS OF...

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.730
WHAT DOES IT DO WHEN
I MOVE HER LEG?

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.900
WHAT DOES IT DO WHEN
I MOVE THE OTHER LEG?

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.800
Alda:
AND SOON I WAS PLAYING
MOTHER CHIMP.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.800
SO WHAT HAPPENS
IF I DO THIS?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.600
THAT MAKES HER SMILE.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.330
IF I DO THIS?

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.100
IF I DO THIS?

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.900
AND A ONE AND A TWO AND
A THREE AND A FOUR AND A FIVE.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.660
LOOK AT THIS,
THE BEGINNING OF AEROBICS.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.600
OH, YOU WANT TO DO PULL-UPS?

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.130
OH, GOOD, VERY...
AND TWO AND THREE.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.900
ONE MORE, YOU CAN DO IT,
YOU CAN DO IT.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.060
AND FOUR.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.960
SHE'S SMILING, SHE LOVES IT.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.500
Alda:
IN THEIR OWN SOCIAL GROUPS

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.560
YOUNG CHIMPS INTERACT WITH
RELATIVES OF ALL AGES--

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.730
BROTHERS, SISTERS, COUSINS,
AUNTS AND UNCLES.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.130
THEY LEARN ESSENTIAL
CHIMP MANNERS

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.730
THE DOs AND DON'Ts
OF CHIMP SOCIETY.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.560
MOST IMPORTANT, YOUNG FEMALES,
SOON TO BE MOTHERS THEMSELVES

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.560
LEARN HOW TO HANDLE BABIES.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.130
SO IN THE NURSERY, YOUNG
FEMALE CHIMPS ARE ENCOURAGED

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.100
TO PLAY WITH YOUNGER ANIMALS.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.800
TODAY, EVELYNE, AGE THREE

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.130
IS THERE TO HELP LOOK
AFTER ANDIE, WHO'S 18 MONTHS.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.000
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.200
UNTIL THE NURSERY PROGRAM BEGAN

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.700
MANY FEMALE CHIMPS
RAISED IN CAPTIVITY

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.800
WERE UNPREPARED FOR MOTHERHOOD.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.930
Woman:
THERE HAVE BEEN MOTHERS
AROUND INFANTS WHO GO:

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.430
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WHEN THEY CRY.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:25.430
SHOULD I PICK THEM UP
OR TOSS THEM SOMEWHERE?"

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.130
THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT OCCURS IN THE WILD.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.260
A LOT OF JUVENILES
GET EXPERIENCE

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.930
WITH THE YOUNGER SIBLINGS

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.400
AND THEY KNOW--
THEY LEARN HOW TO REACT.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.060
Woman:
PROTECT HER,
PROTECT ANDIE-- GOOD.

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.400
Alda:
EVELYNE GOT A LITTLE WORRIED
BY OUR CAMERA.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.460
ANDIE WAS DISPLAYING AT YOU ALL

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.060
AND EVELYNE WANTS HER TO KEEP
HER DISTANCE A LITTLE BIT

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.230
SO SHE KIND OF GRABBED HER BACK.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.060
EVELYNE IS BEING VERY
PROTECTIVE TOWARDS ANDIE.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.800
Alda:
WHILE EVELYNE WAS THE PERFECT
OLDER SISTER WITH ANDIE

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.730
SEVEN-MONTH-OLD LINDSAY
WAS A BIT MORE PUZZLING.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.900
Woman:
OH, THAT WAS TOO MUCH.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.730
THAT'S RIGHT, GIVE HER A HUG.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.660
Alda:
CURIOSITY TOOK
OVER FROM CARING

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.060
UNTIL FINALLY A TOE
WAS JUST TOO TEMPTING.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.230
(<i> squeals</i> )

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.330
OH, THAT WAS
TOO MUCH.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.160
THAT WAS TOO MUCH.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.900
HELLO.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.400
Alda:
THEN IT WAS MY TURN.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.560
HEY, LUCAS.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.900
HEY, LITTLE
THINGS.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.730
HELLO, PAL,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.060
Alda:
I HAD BEEN CAUTIONED
TO EXPECT ANYTHING.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.400
DO YOU WANT TO SIT?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.260
MERLIN'S VERY HAPPY.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.760
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.900
HOW ARE YOU?

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.060
Woman:
GOOD BOY.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.160
YEAH!

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.760
Alda:
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:43.060
AND NOW IT WAS TIME FOR ME
TO LEARN A FEW CHIMP MANNERS.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.230
Bard:
IT'S OKAY.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.530
NOW, THAT SCARED ME.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.400
DOES HE MIND IF I GET SCARED?

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.730
YES, IT WILL
SCARE HIM, TOO.

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.060
IF HE COMES UP IN
MY FACE LIKE THAT

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.730
IS HE TRYING
TO SCARE ME?

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:54.960
NO, HE'S SCARED.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.230
THIS ONE'S POKING ME IN THE EAR.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.400
HE'S GROOMING.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.400
HE'S TELLING YOU
HE'S NERVOUS

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.360
AND THE WAY TO
CALM CHIMPANZEES

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.700
WHEN THEY'RE NERVOUS

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.730
BOTH TO MAKE YOU
A LITTLE CALMER

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.960
AND TO MAKE HIM
CALMER IS TO GROOM.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.160
HOW WOULD
I DO THAT?

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.700
DON'T LOOK AT THEIR FACE

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.500
BUT YOU LOOK AT THE PART
THAT YOU'RE GROOMING

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.760
AND IMMEDIATELY
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.400
THAT THEY RELAX
AND NOT MOVE

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.730
AND GET INTO THIS
VERY STILL POSTURE.

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.600
WE MAKE CHIMPANZEE
GROOMING SOUNDS.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.560
EITHER A...
(<i> sucks teeth</i> )

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.730
OR THE KIND THAT
KATHY MAKES IS A...
(<i> blows raspberries</i> ).

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.930
BUT IT'S A VERY
FOCUSED ATTENTION.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.800
THAT GOT HIS
ATTENTION A LOT.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.660
AND HE JUST CALMS
IMMEDIATELY.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.560
(<i> sucking teeth</i> )

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.100
HE'S GROOMING.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.960
Kathy:
IS HE
GROOMING YOU?

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.900
I THINK HE'S TRYING
TO EAT MY CHIN HERE.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.060
Bard:
DO YOU LIKE HIS
AFTERSHAVE, MERLIN?

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.400
IF YOU HAVE
A FRECKLE

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.060
THAT MIGHT BE
INTRIGUING.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.360
A FRECKLE?

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.360
WHAT, DO THEY LIKE THEM
FOR DESSERT, OR WHAT?

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.230
THIS IS A WAY
TO ASK FOR PLAY.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.730
WHEN THEY
PUT THEIR HAND
ON THEIR HEAD?

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.760
LIKE, "TICKLE
ME RIGHT THERE."

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.600
NOW, IF I WERE TO ASK
FOR A LITTLE TICKLING.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.430
THEY'RE NOT REALLY WATCHING.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.230
YOU NEED TO GET
REALLY LOOSE

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.960
AND SO YOU GET LOOSE.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.660
I'M GOING TO GET
REALLY LOOSE NOW.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.830
AND WHENEVER
THEY TOUCH YOU

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.730
EVEN IF THEY
DON'T MEAN IT AS
TICKLING, YOU LAUGH.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.060
(<i> imitates
 chimp hooting</i> )

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:26.430
Alda:
UNFORTUNATELY, MY CHIMP LAUGH
DIDN'T SEEM TOO CONVINCING

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.660
ESPECIALLY TO MERLIN.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.230
OUCH!

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.400
Bard:
THAT'S NOT NICE.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.500
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.900
HE'S SAYING,
"I'M REALLY SORRY."

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.060
Alda:
MERLIN AND I MADE UP
AS ALL GOOD CHIMPS SHOULD.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.260
THAT'S OKAY.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.260
AND HERE IN THE YERKES NURSERY,
THAT'S THE GOAL:

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:50.060
REARING CHIMPS TO BE THE
BEST CHIMPS THEY CAN BE.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.460
PUT SOME HONEY
IN HERE.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.300
Alda:
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.900
MIKE TOMASELLO GIVES THE CHIMPS
AT YERKES SOME HONEY.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.260
...WHERE THEY POKE
STICKS INTO HOLES

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.400
AND BEEHIVES AND...

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.560
Alda:
IN THE WILD, CHIMPS OFTEN USE
SIMPLE TOOLS TO GET AT FOOD.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.460
THEY CRACK OPEN NUTS WITH ROCKS

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.900
AND POKE STICKS
INTO BEEHIVES FOR HONEY.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.660
YOU WANT A STICK?

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.230
THIS USE OF TOOLS
SEEMS VERY HUMANLIKE

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:46.230
YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE
BEHAVIOR APES SHARE WITH HUMANS.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.600
IT HAS EVEN LED TO SPECULATION
THAT APES LEARN SKILLS

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.230
AND PASS THEM ONTO OTHERS,
JUST AS WE DO.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.400
BUT IS THAT REALLY
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.260
HOW DO THEY LEARN
TO DO THIS?

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.460
DO THEY LEARN
THE SAME WAY WE DO?

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.230
WELL, THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF DIFFERENT THEORIES

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.760
ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT
GO ABOUT LEARNING IT.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.160
I WOULD SAY THEY DO
GO ABOUT LEARNING IT

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.900
IN VERY MUCH THE SAME WAY
THAT A CHILD WOULD.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.630
THEY ARE EXPOSED TO THE TOOL

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.800
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM
IN FRONT OF THEM

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.760
AND THEY EITHER SOME COMBINATION

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.660
OF TRIAL AND ERROR OR
INSIGHTFUL PROBLEM SOLVING.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.000
IN MANY CASES THEY DO EMPLOY
INSIGHTFUL PROBLEM SOLVING

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.660
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DON'T
HAVE TO TRY OUT EVERY SOLUTION.

00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.260
THEY CAN LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AND
SEE WHICH ONE MIGHT WORK BETTER.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.960
Alda:
THAT CHIMPS CAN FIGURE OUT FOR
THEMSELVES HOW TO USE A STICK

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.360
TO GET HONEY IS
IMPRESSIVE ENOUGH.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.730
BUT CAN THEY PICK UP THE SKILL
BY WATCHING OTHERS AS WE CAN?

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.500
TO HELP ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.730
MIKE TOMASELLO HAS RECRUITED
ANOTHER PRIMATE SPECIES

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.900
A CLOSE RELATIVE OF BOTH
CHIMPANZEES AND GORILLAS--

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.560
THE ORANGUTAN.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.060
ORANGS ARE MORE PLACID AND
EASIER TO WORK WITH THAN CHIMPS

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.760
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE
THEIR LITTLE FOIBLES.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.260
Alda:
IS IT OKAY TO LOOK
THEM IN THE EYE?

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.400
HE MIGHT SPIT AT YOU,
BUT OTHERWISE
IT'LL BE FINE.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.060
Alda:
THIS IS INEY.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.130
MY JOB WAS TO TRY TEACHING HER

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.960
HOW TO USE A RAKE
TO GET A PIECE OF FRUIT.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.230
LOOK AT THIS,
LOOK AT THIS.

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.130
Alda:
I MADE A SHOW OF TURNING
THE RAKE OVER

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.730
MAKING IT EASIER
TO PULL IN THE APPLE.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.900
GOOD, MMM.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.400
Alda:
INEY IGNORED MY ADVICE.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.030
TIRAM LOOKED UNCOOPERATIVE
FROM THE START.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:41.400
THIS TIME MY RAKE WAS
ALREADY TURNED OVER

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.160
SO I SIMPLY PULLED IT IN.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:51.430
TIRAM ALSO IGNORED MY ACTION
AND EXPERIMENTED ON HIS OWN.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.930
GOOD JOB,
GOOD JOB, TIRAM.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.130
WHAT I DID WITH THE RAKE
DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.730
NOW, I DON'T GET IT.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.500
I DIDN'T TURN IT OVER.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.460
BUT TIRAM DID TURN
THE RAKE OVER-- WHY?

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.100
BECAUSE TIRAM
IS GOING TO DO

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.630
WHATEVER HE IS
GOING TO DO

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.530
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.400
HE'S FIGURING OUT
HOW TO DO IT.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.000
I THINK THE REASON

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.730
THAT THEY DON'T DO
EXACTLY WHAT I DO IS

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.860
THAT I DON'T GRAB IT
WITH MY FEET.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.560
I'M JUST USING MY HANDS.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.700
Alda:
TOMASELLO BELIEVES THAT
WHAT APES LEARN FROM OTHERS

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.730
IS THE GENERAL IDEA
THAT A TOOL CAN BE USEFUL

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.400
NOT THE EXACT DETAILS
OF HOW TO USE IT.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.730
Alda:
SO THEY BENEFIT
FROM SEEING IT USED

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.330
AND THEY COME OVER TO THE PLACE
WHERE IT'S BEING USED

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.560
AND THEY'LL PICK IT UP
AND USE IT

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.200
BUT THEY WON'T EXACTLY
IMITATE THE USE.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.400
IT'S NOT LIKE A CARPENTER
TEACHING HIS DAUGHTER

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.700
HOW TO USE A PLANE.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.200
Alda:
THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
HOW APES LEARN

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.460
AND HOW CHILDREN LEARN IS
MIKE TOMASELLO'S MAIN INTEREST.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.800
THIS IS
MATTHEW.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.960
HEY, MATTHEW.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.960
HEY.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.460
HI, THIS IS FUN.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.830
Alda:
AND I FINALLY GOT TO WORK

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.460
WITH A PRIMATE SPECIES
I'M A BIT MORE USED TO.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.630
THAT'S AN AIRPLANE.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.000
YEAH, IT'S
AN AIRPLANE.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.800
THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.000
Alda:
TOMASELLO HAS SET UP
AN EXPERIMENT WITH CHILDREN

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
SIMILAR TO THE ONE WITH ORANGS.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.060
WATCH ME, MATTHEW.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:27.730
Alda:
WITH THE RAKE ALREADY ON
ITS BACK, I PULL IN THE TOY.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.900
THE KEY POINT IS THAT
I DIDN'T TURN THE RAKE OVER.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.230
IT WAS ALREADY
THE WAY I WANTED IT.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.230
AND MATTHEW ALSO DOESN'T
TURN THE RAKE OVER

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.860
EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY
WORK BETTER IF HE DID.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:47.730
Tomasello:
IT'S ALAN'S TURN.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.900
NEXT TIME, I MAKE A SHOW
OF FLIPPING THE RAKE.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.200
(<i> both laughing</i> )

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.000
NOW IT'S
MATTHEW'S TURN.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.060
Woman:
THAT LOOKS LIKE FUN.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.060
Alda:
AND THAT'S ALL MATTHEW NEEDS.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.460
Woman:
ALL RIGHT.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.730
GOOD JOB, MATTHEW.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.960
MIKE'S GOING
TO DROP IT HERE.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.460
RACHEL, WATCH.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.300
NOW, WATCH ME.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:18.760
Alda:
WITH RACHEL, I AGAIN MAKE
A BIG DEAL OF FLIPPING THE RAKE.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.730
AND I TAKE
IT OUT, SEE?

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.500
MIKE'S GOING
TO DROP IT IN.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.900
NOW, IT'S YOUR TURN.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.130
YOU TRY IT.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.060
Alda:
RACHEL GETS IT AT ONCE.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.560
BUT LIKE THE ORANGS, SHE PUTS
HER OWN SPIN ON THE SOLUTION.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.060
(<i> all laughing</i> )

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.460
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.400
YOU'RE PRETTY
GOOD WITH THAT.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.730
OH, MY TURN, OKAY.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.230
Alda:
BUT AFTER AGAIN WATCHING
WHAT I DO WITH THE RAKE

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.330
RACHEL IMITATES MY
ACTIONS PRECISELY.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.060
AND IT'S THIS ABILITY
TO EXACTLY IMITATE

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.400
THAT MIKE TOMASELLO BELIEVES
IS THE KEY DIFFERENCE

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.160
IN HOW HUMANS LEARN
WHEN COMPARED TO APES.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.230
IT GIVES KIDS LIKE ANNA
A SHORT CUT TO LEARNING

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.530
THAT APES DON'T HAVE.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.800
Mike:
NOW, YOUR TURN.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.700
Alda:
AND IT MAY BE
WHAT ENABLES US TO PASS ON

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.630
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.030
EVERYTHING THAT'S
BEEN LEARNED BEFORE.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.360
Alda:
VERY GOOD.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.900
Mike:
GOOD JOB, GOOD.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.830
Alda:
THE WAY CHIMPS USE
STICKS TO GET HONEY

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.630
IS A REMINDER OF BOTH
HOW LIKE US THEY ARE

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:37.630
AND HOW NOT LIKE US THEY ARE,
AND IT GIVES US ANOTHER INSIGHT

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.900
INTO WHAT MAKES HUMANS
SO DIFFERENT.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:44.360
YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING WE
CAN LEARN ABOUT THE WAY WE LEARN

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.960
BY STUDYING THIS MORE BASIC
WAY THAT CHIMPS LEARN?

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:52.030
OFTEN WITH HUMANS THE PROBLEM IS
WE ARE SO IMMERSED IN SOMETHING

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.100
WE CAN'T GET OUT
OF IT TO SEE IT.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:57.030
WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED
GOING TO ANOTHER CULTURE

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.560
AND SEEING THEM DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.360
AND WE DIDN'T REALIZE
WHAT WE DID

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.960
UNTIL WE SAW THAT IT
COULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.430
AND I THINK THAT'S
A LOT OF THE VALUE

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.460
OF STUDYING NONHUMAN PRIMATES

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.360
IS TO SEE HOW SOMETHING
IS DONE DIFFERENTLY.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.100
EVEN THOUGH THE WAY APES LEARN

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.500
IS DIFFERENT FROM
THE WAY HUMANS LEARN

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.130
WHEN APES ARE REARED
AND TAUGHT BY HUMANS

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:38.100
THEY CAN LEARN SOME
SURPRISINGLY HUMAN SKILLS.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.660
THE BEST KNOWN OF THESE IS
WHEN CHIMPS AND SOME GORILLAS

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:43.900
HAVE BEEN TAUGHT
A SIMPLE LANGUAGE.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.800
BUT WHAT'S NOT SO WELL KNOWN

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.860
IS THAT SOME CHIMPS HAVE BEEN
TAUGHT ELEMENTARY MATH SKILLS.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.200
Alda:
THIS IS THE PLAYGROUND OF
A UNIQUE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.300
HOUSED AT OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.830
WHERE SALLY BOYSEN IS TEACHING
CHIMPANZEES TO COUNT.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.760
WE'RE GOING
TO DO TWO.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.300
ONE, TWO--
SEE THAT?

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.500
WHERE'S
THE TWO?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.100
THAT'S IT!

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.200
LUCKY YOU.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.730
ONE, TWO.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.400
Alda:
BOB, FOUR YEARS OLD,
IS ONE OF HER YOUNGEST PUPILS.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.830
BUT WE'RE
NOT DONE YET.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.130
LET'S TRY A COOKIE.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.000
WAIT, I'VE GOT
TO SHOW YOU.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.060
CAN YOU SHOW ME
WHERE ONE IS?

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:22.260
THERE IT
IS-- GOOD!

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.130
WE NEED TO MAKE
IT LIGHT UP.

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.900
MAKE IT LIGHT
UP-- GOOD!

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:30.160
Alda:
LIKE MOST FOUR-YEAR-OLDS, BOB'S
ATTENTION SOMETIMES WANDERS.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.400
HE'S LEARNING THOSE
FIRST TWO NUMBERS

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.030
AND ONCE... I KNEW HE
WAS GOING TO DO THAT.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.130
HIS ATTENTION SPAN
IS A LOT SHORTER
THAN A CHILD'S.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.560
WE INVEST A LOT
MORE TIME IN PLAYING

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.330
AND SOCIAL INTERACTION
THAN IN ACTUAL TRAINING.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.800
THAT'S KIND OF THE OPPOSITE
OF WHAT YOU SEE WITH CHILDREN.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.430
THEY SPEND A COUPLE HOURS AT
SCHOOL AND 15 MINUTES IN RECESS.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:55.660
WE SPEND 15 MINUTES IN SCHOOL
AND TWO HOURS IN RECESS.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.930
Alda:
WHILE BOB IS STILL
IN KINDERGARTEN

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.060
10-YEAR-OLD SHEBA IS
ALREADY A FIRST-GRADER.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.260
SEVEN.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.530
THAT WAS THE
RIGHT ANSWER.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:10.330
Alda:
SHE'S LEARNING HER NUMBERS
FROM ONE THROUGH SEVEN.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.100
THIS, THIS, THIS,
HOW MANY IS THAT?

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.660
HOW MANY
IS IT?

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.330
FIVE IS THE
RIGHT ANSWER!

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.600
YOU GET
THEM ALL!

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.200
OKAY,
GOOD WORK.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.000
Alda:
SHEBA ALSO UNDERSTANDS ZERO.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.200
OKAY, LOOK,
SHEBA?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.530
HOW MANY THINGS
DO WE HAVE THERE?

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.500
NONE-- THERE
ARE NO CANDIES.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500
Alda:
AND SOMETIMES SHE
RUNS THE CLASS HERSELF.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.300
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD GET
REINFORCED ANYWAY?

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.630
HOW MANY IS THAT?
IT WAS ONE-- GOOD!

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.500
I DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO BE HERE.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.030
Alda:
NOW THAT SHEBA KNOWS HER NUMBERS

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.900
SALLY PLANS A NEW CHALLENGE.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.060
SHE PUTS THREE PEACHES
IN ONE BOX...

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.360
AND THREE PEACHES IN ANOTHER.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.830
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:04.200
A CHIMP HAS EVER BEEN GIVEN
AN ADDITION PROBLEM.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.630
HOW MANY
PEACHES?

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:06.730
HOW MANY?

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:07.760
SHOW ME.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.000
YES, SIX IS THE
RIGHT ANSWER!

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.030
GOOD GIRL!

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:12.700
SIX PEACHES OUT THERE!

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.460
Alda:
SHEBA MUST COUNT
THE FIRST SET OF PEACHES

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.100
HOLD THAT NUMBER IN HER HEAD

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.930
THEN CONTINUE THE COUNTING
WITH THE SECOND SET.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.460
PICK THE RIGHT
ANSWER-- FIVE! GOOD!

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.360
Alda:
WITHOUT EVER BEING
TRAINED TO ADD

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.130
SHEBA GETS IT RIGHT
THE FIRST TIME.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.860
THEN SALLY MAKES THE TASK
EVEN HARDER

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.260
BY REPLACING THE PEACHES
WITH PLASTIC NUMBERS.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.560
SEE THAT ONE?

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.700
HERE WE GO.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.060
HOW MANY
WAS THAT?

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.460
CAN YOU PICK?
SHOW ME.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.630
FOUR!

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.330
Alda:
ALTHOUGH SHEBA'S PERFORMANCE
MAY SEEM ASTONISHING

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.560
SALLY ISN'T SURPRISED.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.130
TO FIND CAPABILITIES
IN THE RANGE WE HAVE

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.200
WITH NUMERICAL CONCEPTS
IS NOT SURPRISING TO ME.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.500
IT MEANS WE HAVE
TO RETHINK OUR IDEAS

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.360
ABOUT WHAT HUMANNESS IS ABOUT

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.830
AND ALSO WHAT
CHIMPANZEE-NESS IS ABOUT.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.130
Alda:
THERE'S ONE NUMBERS GAME
SALLY HAS DEVISED

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.400
THAT NEATLY DEMONSTRATES
SHEBA'S CHIMPANZEE-NESS.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.830
WANT TO SIT
RIGHT HERE?

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:20.860
Alda:
ONE OF THE PLAYERS IS SARAH.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.500
HER JOB IS TO EAT CANDIES.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.660
SHEBA'S JOB IS TO CHOOSE
HOW MANY CANDIES SARAH GETS.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.930
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR DOWN HERE.

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.930
ARE YOU WATCHING,
MISS PRISS?

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:35.360
Alda:
HERE'S HOW THE GAME WORKS.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.300
WHICH SHOULD WE
GIVE TO SARAH?

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.730
Alda:
WHICHEVER SET OF CANDY SHEBA
POINTS TO FIRST GOES TO SARAH.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.330
SARAH GETS FOUR,
SHEBA ONLY GETS TWO...

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.560
Alda:
SHEBA GETS WHAT'S LEFT.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.260
SO IF SHEBA UNDERSTANDS THE GAME

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.960
SHE SHOULD PICK
THE SMALLER AMOUNT FIRST.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.930
FIVE IN THAT ONE,
ONE IN THERE.

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.260
WHICH ONE DO YOU
WANT SARAH TO HAVE?

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.660
SARAH GETS THESE.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.530
Alda:
BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES THEY TRY IT

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.430
SHEBA ALWAYS POINTS
TO THE LARGER AMOUNT FIRST.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.030
IT'S A GAME SHE JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WIN.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.000
SALLY HAS A HUNCH

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.600
THAT MAKING THE TASK
MORE ABSTRACT MIGHT HELP.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.060
WHICH ONE
DO YOU WANT--

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.000
YOU WANT TO GIVE
TWO TO SARAH.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.100
Alda:
AND REMARKABLY, SHEBA NOW PICKS
THE SMALLER NUMBER FIRST.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:21.360
OH, YOU LUCKY GIRL.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.560
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:28.660
Alda:
SARAH IS NOT THAT IMPRESSED
BY SHEBA'S NEW SKILL.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.100
WE HAVE A FOUR HERE--

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.630
WAIT TILL I SHOW YOU
WHAT ELSE WE GOT.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.860
LOOK HERE.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.230
NOW, WHICH SHOULD
WE GIVE TO SARAH?

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.100
TWO-- WE'LL GIVE
SARAH TWO.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.960
Alda:
SALLY BOYSEN SUSPECTS

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.930
THAT BECAUSE OF SHEBA'S
NATURAL GREEDINESS

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.730
SHE CAN'T RESIST
THE CANDIES THEMSELVES.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.130
BUT THE NUMBERS
ENGAGE HER REASON

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:51.930
ALLOWING HER TO PLAY
THE GAME INTELLIGENTLY.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.100
(<i> hooting</i> )

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.630
UNLIKE SHEBA, THE MALES
IN SALLY'S GROUP

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:00.600
ARE TOO BIG AND TOO AGGRESSIVE
TO BE LET OUT OF THEIR CAGES.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.660
OH, LOOK AT
THAT BIG TOE!

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.630
I GOT YOUR TOE REAL
GOOD, DIDN'T I?

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:11.800
Alda:
STILL, SALLY HAS FOUND A WAY
TO PLAY WITH THEM

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.800
AND TO WORK WITH THEM.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.130
DARRELL, HOW MUCH
OF A PEACH IS THIS?

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.960
HALF OF A
PEACH, RIGHT.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.800
Alda:
DARRELL IS WORKING ON FRACTIONS.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.430
IT'S A HALF
OF A PEACH.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.100
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.060
WHAT'S THAT IN YOUR
MOUTH, A PEACH PIT?

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.660
THANK YOU.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.800
YUMMY, YUMMY.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.630
HOW MANY OF THESE
DO I HAVE?

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.900
TWO BANANAS,
RIGHT.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.660
THERE'S TWO
BANANAS HERE.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.660
NOW WATCH WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.900
I CUT LIKE THIS,
AND ONE MORE TIME

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.130
NOW I HAVE THIS
LITTLE WEENSY PIECE.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:44.930
A FOURTH OF
A BANANA-- RIGHT!

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.860
Alda:
WHEN SALLY CUTS THE FRUIT
IN FRONT OF HIM

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.230
DARRELL CHOOSES
THE CORRECT FRACTION.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:53.760
I'VE GOT
ANOTHER FOURTH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.860
DARRELL HAS TO UNDERSTAND
THERE ARE WHOLE THINGS

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.800
AND PARTS OF THINGS,
AND WE CAN ASSIGN A NAME

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:02.800
FOR DIFFERENT PARTS
OF AN APPLE, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.600
SO THERE'S A SPECIAL
NAME FOR HALF AN APPLE

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.730
AND A SPECIAL NAME FOR
ONE-FOURTH OF AN APPLE...

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:10.030
(<i> chimps shrieking</i> )

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.830
Alda:
THE CHIMPS AREN'T HAPPY

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:15.600
WHEN SALLY TURNS HER
ATTENTION TO THE CAMERA

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.400
BUT THEY FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET REVENGE.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.430
SOON THEY'RE CALM ENOUGH
TO START WORK AGAIN.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.660
DARRELL'S NEXT CHALLENGE
IS TO FIGURE OUT

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.430
WHAT FRACTION OF A PEAR
THIS REPRESENTS

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:34.360
WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING
THE FRUIT CUT UP.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.530
IT'S NOT A HALF--
YOU'RE GUESSING
ALL OF THEM.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.160
GUESSING
ALL OF THEM.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.130
I WANT TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.200
LOOK, WHAT IF I TOOK
A WHOLE PEAR LIKE THIS?

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.030
THIS IS ONE PEAR,
ISN'T IT?

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.460
AND I'M GOING TO
CUT IT UP FOR YOU.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.800
DARRELL'S
STILL NOT ABLE

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.760
TO RELIABLY PICK
THE CORRECT FRACTION.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.800
IT REALLY HELPS HIM
STILL AT THIS PHASE

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.600
OF HIS UNDERSTANDING
OF THE CONCEPT

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.960
TO SEE A WHOLE
PIECE OF FRUIT

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.760
DIVIDED
INTO PORTIONS.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.330
BUT WE'RE WORKING
TOWARDS THAT.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.530
DARRELL, LOOK HOW MANY
PIECES I CUT THIS INTO--

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.960
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR-- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:15.230
IT MEANS THIS IS
ONLY ONE FOURTH!

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.900
THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S ONE-
FOURTH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.200
DO YOU WANT IT?

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.530
YOU DON'T
WANT IT? OKAY.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.130
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
A PIECE OF CANDY?

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.700
ALL RIGHT,
THERE YOU GO.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:27.930
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:29.330
WE'RE STILL WORKING.

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:32.460
ARE YOU GOING TO BE AFRAID
OF DOGS YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.130
Alda:
SALLY BELIEVES THAT
CHIMPS, LIKE HUMANS

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.800
HAVE AN INTUITIVE
UNDERSTANDING OF NUMBERS.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.330
IT ISN'T THAT SALLY IS
TEACHING THEM TO COUNT

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.860
OR ADD OR DO FRACTIONS.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.860
INSTEAD, SHE'S SIMPLY GIVING
HER CHIMPANZEES AN OPPORTUNITY

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.800
TO SHOW US WHAT THEY CAN DO.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.960
(<i> Sally imitates chimp hooting</i> )

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
UH-OH,
DON'T HURT HIM.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.600
DON'T HURT SKYLER.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.000
Alda:
THESE ARE PRIMATES, TOO.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.400
LEMURS-- THE MOST DISTANT
OF OUR PRIMATE COUSINS.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.500
LEMURS BRANCHED OFF
FROM THE FAMILY TREE

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.030
70 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.300
COMMON THEN,
THEY LIVE WILD TODAY

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.560
ONLY ON THE ISLAND
OF MADAGASCAR.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.500
BUT ABOUT 500 LEMURS ALSO
LIVE HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.730
IN A FOREST OWNED
BY DUKE UNIVERSITY.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:50.500
SOME LEMURS ARE NOCTURNAL.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.900
THEY WAKE UP ONLY
WHEN IT GETS DARK.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:57.230
THIS LEMUR IS AN AYE-AYE.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:39:59.730
HIS NAME IS NOSFERATU.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.160
IN MADAGASCAR, THE AYE-AYE
IS CONSIDERED AN EVIL OMEN

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.000
AND OFTEN SHOT ON SIGHT.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.600
AYE-AYES ARE ONE OF THE MOST
HIGHLY-ENDANGERED PRIMATES

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.060
IN THE WORLD.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.930
AND ONE OF THE WEIRDEST.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:17.800
TO EAT BREAKFAST,
NOSFERATU SCOOPS OUT AN EGG

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.300
USING HIS EXTRAORDINARY
SIX-INCH LONG MIDDLE FINGER.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:34.630
BREAKFAST OVER,
NOSFERATU GOES FORAGING

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.700
MUCH AS HE WOULD IN THE FOREST

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.030
LOOKING FOR WORMS
AND INSECT LARVAE

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.930
LIVING INSIDE TREE BRANCHES.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.860
HOW HE DOES IT

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.660
FASCINATES DUKE UNIVERSITY
PSYCHOLOGIST CARL ERICKSON.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.930
HOW DO YOU FIND FOOD
IN A RAIN FOREST AT NIGHT

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.500
WHEN IT'S RATHER RARE

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.000
AND IT'S HIDDEN BELOW
THE SURFACE OF THE TREE?

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.630
IT SEEMS LIKE
A FORMIDABLE PROBLEM

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.500
AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT'S IN HIS HEAD

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.900
WHEN HE DOES THAT.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.060
Alda:
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S
IN NOSFERATU'S HEAD

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.560
CARL IS MAKING AN
ARTIFICIAL TREE BRANCH

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.000
COMPLETE WITH HIDING
PLACES FOR WORMS.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.800
HE'S GOING TO TEST THREE
DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.430
ABOUT HOW THE AYE-AYE
IS FINDING ITS PREY.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:25.930
THE FIRST HYPOTHESIS IS
THAT NOSFERATU'S SHARP EARS

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:30.830
CAN HEAR THE WORMS EVEN
WHEN THEY'RE DEEP IN THE WOOD.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:33.330
PERHAPS WHEN HE TAPS,
THE PREY GET EXCITED

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.860
HE HEARS THAT EXCITEMENT

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.060
AND SO HE GOES
FOR THE ACT OF PREY.

00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:40.800
ONE WAY TO MAKE TO SURE
THAT HE CAN'T HEAR THEM

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.330
IS TO HAVE THEM DEAD.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:45.330
Alda:
CHOPPED UP AND
THEREFORE SILENT WORMS

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.330
TEST THE SECOND POSSIBILITY

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:51.360
THAT NOSFERATU SMELLS HIS PREY
RATHER THAN HEARING IT.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.160
THE THIRD OPTION IS
THAT IT'S NOT THE WORMS

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.630
BUT THE HOLES THE AYE-AYE FINDS,
SO ONE IS LEFT EMPTY.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.800
THE CAVITIES ARE TWO INCHES
BENEATH THE SURFACE.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.360
NOSFERATU CAN'T WAIT
TO BEGIN THE HUNT.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.960
Erickson:
HE IS VERY EAGER

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:12.060
AND AS YOU CAN SEE OFTENTIMES
I CAN'T GET THE WOODBLOCKS IN

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:13.500
FAST ENOUGH FOR HIM.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.560
Alda:
NOSFERATU HAS NO TROUBLE
FINDING THE FIRST CAVITY

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.230
WITH THE LIVE WORMS.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.230
AFTER FISHING THEM OUT,
HE MOVES ON

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.000
AND AT ONCE HE FINDS THE HOLE
WITH THE DEAD WORMS.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:36.160
BUT WORMS, LIVE OR DEAD, DON'T
SEEM TO BE WHAT HE'S LOCATING

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.430
BECAUSE SOON HE FINDS
THE EMPTY CAVITY AS WELL.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.100
IT'S THE CAVITIES, NOT THE
WORMS, HE'S SEARCHING FOR.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.230
WHAT WE NEED TO DO THEN IS FIND
OUT WHAT IT IS ABOUT CAVITIES

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.800
THAT IS SO INTERESTING
TO THE AYE-AYE.

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:56.960
Alda:
ONE THING ABOUT CAVITIES
THE AYE-AYE FINDS INTERESTING

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.130
IS THEIR SHAPE.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.630
CARL MAKES A PAIR
OF X-SHAPED CAVITIES

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.460
AND GIVES THEM TO NOSFERATU
TO CHECK OUT.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.930
THE AYE-AYE TAPS AROUND

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:11.630
APPARENTLY MAKING A MENTAL MAP
OF THE SHAPE

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.730
THEN SELECTS WHERE TO GNAW
VERY PRECISELY.

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.630
Erickson:
THE AYE-AYE SEEMS TO HAVE
SELECTED THE AREA

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.160
NEAR THE INTERSECTION.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.430
AND THIS SUGGESTS TO US

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:27.860
THAT IT'S NOT SIMPLY DETECTING
THE CONFIGURATION

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.200
BUT IS GOING BEYOND THAT TO TRY
TO FIND A STRATEGIC LOCATION

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.600
AND REACH ALL THE ARMS OF THE X
THROUGH A SINGLE ENTRY POINT.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:43.360
Alda:
CARL HAS MADE A CUT-AWAY BRANCH
WITH TUNNELS AND A CENTRAL HOLE

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.930
TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON
INSIDE THE TREE.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.230
NOSFERATU, AS USUAL, IS AN
ENTHUSIASTIC COLLABORATOR.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.630
THE EXTRAORDINARY FLEXIBILITY
OF NOSFERATU'S MIDDLE FINGER

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.630
MEANS THE WORMS HAVE ALMOST
NOWHERE TO HIDE.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:15.600
THE AYE-AYE MAY BE ONLY
A VERY DISTANT RELATIVE

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.460
BUT IN ITS ABILITY
TO CREATE MENTAL MAPS

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.030
AND IN PARTICULAR
IN ITS EXTRAORDINARY DEXTERITY

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.830
THERE'S A KINSHIP WITH HUMANS
THAT SHINES THROUGH

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.560
EVEN 70 MILLION YEARS
OF EVOLUTION.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.530
FOR OUR LAST STORY, WE'RE
HEADING BACK TO CAYO SANTIAGO

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.560
ABOUT A HALF MILE OFF
THE SHORE OF PUERTO RICO.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.630
WHILE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:56.230
YOU CAN LEARN ABOUT MONKEYS
IN CAPTIVITY

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.930
THERE ARE SOME THINGS-- LIKE
MATTERS OF SEXUAL POLITICS--

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:03.100
THAT CAN ONLY BE STUDIED
IN MONKEYS IN THE WILD

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:05.230
AND THE MONKEYS ON CAYO SANTIAGO

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:07.560
ARE ABOUT AS WILD
AS MONKEYS CAN BE.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.930
(<i> chattering</i> )

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.630
900 RHESUS MONKEYS
LIVE ON THIS ISLAND TODAY--

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.160
THE DESCENDANTS OF MONKEYS
RELEASED HERE 60 YEARS AGO.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.660
MOTHERS ARE AT THE CENTER
OF RHESUS SOCIETY

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.760
AS JOHN BERARD OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF PUERTO RICO HAS LEARNED

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.060
FROM 13 YEARS
OF MONKEY WATCHING.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.500
THE MOTHER-INFANT
BOND IN PRIMATES

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.500
AS IN HUMANS,
IS VERY STRONG

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.560
AND THE WHOLE SOCIETY
REVOLVES AROUND MOM.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.430
Alda:
THE CAYO SANTIAGO MONKEYS
HAVE BEEN WATCHED

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.430
BY GENERATIONS OF RESEARCHERS.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.560
BUT PROBABLY NO ONE HAS
GOT TO KNOW THEM AS WELL

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.100
AS JOHN BERARD.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.630
HE WILL COME SPEND
A PORTION OF EACH
DAY WITH HIS MOM.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.260
Alda:
WANDERING THE ISLAND WITH HIM

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:04.030
IS LIKE BEING INTRODUCED
TO HIS EXTENDED FAMILY...

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.500
THIS IS HER
ADULT SON.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.900
(<i> loud screeching</i> )

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.000
Alda:
AND SOME OF ITS SQUABBLES.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.730
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED?

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.730
THIS MALE WENT
AFTER THE INFANT

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.930
AND THEN THE MOTHER
CAME BY AND SCOOPED
UP HER KID

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.530
AND THEN TURNED AND
SCREAMED AT THE MALE.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.060
Alda:
WHO BOSSES WHOM IS BUILT
INTO MONKEY SOCIETY.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:28.630
FEMALES INHERIT THEIR RANK FROM
MOM AND KEEP IT ALL THEIR LIVES.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.130
THIS IMPERIOUS BLOND MONKEY IS
THE GROUP'S DOMINANT FEMALE.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:40.130
AND THIS IS THE DOMINANT MALE,
SCATTERING ALL BEFORE HIM.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:44.460
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:48.100
WHILE THE MONKEYS
LIVE FREELY HERE

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.200
THEY GET SOME HELP
FROM THOSE WHO WATCH THEM.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.500
THIS FEEDING CORRAL
PROVIDES MUCH OF THEIR FOOD

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.760
AND IS A GOOD PLACE TO SEE THE
DOMINANCE HIERARCHY IN ACTION.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.630
WHAT'S MOST OF
THEIR FIGHTING ABOUT?

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.700
MOST OF IT ACTUALLY
IS JUST LITTLE
FAMILY SPATS.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.630
LIKE WHAT? "IT'S YOUR
TURN TO DO THE DISHES?"

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.360
LIKE WHAT WOULD IT BE?

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.860
WELL, IT'S... OFTEN
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.900
IT'S SIMPLY,
"YOU'RE IN MY SPOT."

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.200
"YOU'RE IN MY SPOT"?

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.030
THAT'S WHAT
THEY FIGHT ABOUT?

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:21.830
THEY HAVE THIS
WHOLE ISLAND!

00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:27.100
Alda:
UNLIKE FEMALES, MOST MALES
LEAVE HOME AT PUBERTY.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.200
WHEN THEY JOIN A NEW GROUP

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.300
THEY ENTER AT THE BOTTOM
OF THE SOCIAL LADDER.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.360
IT'S HUMILIATING AND STRESSFUL

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.130
AND JOHN BERARD'S RESEARCH
HAS BEEN AIMED

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.230
AT FINDING OUT WHY THEY DO IT.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:44.460
THIS YOUNG FEMALE IS THE KEY
TO THE ANSWER.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.230
FOLLOWED BY HER BABY,
SHE LEAVES THE FEEDING CORRAL

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:51.660
AND IS IN TURN FOLLOWED
BY A HIGH-RANKING MALE.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.130
MOST PREVIOUS RESEARCH
ON MONKEYS WOULD SUGGEST

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:58.000
HE IS THE MOST LIKELY
TO MATE WITH HER.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.100
BUT TAGGING ALONG IS A LOW-
RANKING NEWCOMER TO THE GROUP.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.600
AND NOW AN ELABORATE GAME
BEGINS.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.300
THE FEMALE IS IN CONTROL HERE

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.900
SITTING BETWEEN THE HIGH-
RANKING MALE ON THE LEFT

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.130
AND THE NEWCOMER ON THE RIGHT.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:20.000
THE DOMINANT MALE STAYS CLOSE,
BUT THE NEWCOMER STROLLS AWAY

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.900
AND THE FEMALE FOLLOWS.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:28.030
THE YOUNG MALE HAS FOUND
A SECLUDED SPOT IN THE BUSHES.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.600
AS THE FEMALE HEADS TOWARD HIM

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.400
THE OLDER MALE SPOTS HER
AND CHASES HER AWAY.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.930
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.860
BUT IT WAS CLEARLY A RISK SHE
WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.630
NOW, WHAT IS
THIS ATTRACTION

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.430
TO THE NEW GUY
IN THE GROUP?

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.100
IT'S LIKE ALL THOSE MOVIES

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.930
WHERE THE YOUNG GUY COMES IN
ON A MOTORCYCLE

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.200
AND HE'S NEW TO TOWN,
AND ALL THE WOMEN SAY "WOW!"

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.600
WHAT IS THAT?

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.760
I THINK IT'S THE
MOTORCYCLE THING.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.030
THEY USED TO HAVE
MOTORCYCLES HERE
BACK IN THE '40s.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.700
LITTLE MONKEY
MOTORCYCLES.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.100
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS THE ATTRACTION?

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:03.560
IT'S JUST NOVELTY.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.760
YOU KNOW, IT'S
JUST PRETTY OBVIOUS

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.400
THAT THEY LIKE
NEW MALES.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.230
WE'VE BEEN WATCHING
THE FEMALES IN THIS
GROUP FOR SIX YEARS

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.800
AND EVERY YEAR
IT'S THE SAME THING,
IT'S THE NEW GUYS.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.860
FORGET ABOUT THE
GUYS THEY MATED
WITH LAST YEAR

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.430
FORGET ABOUT THE
LONG-TERM RESIDENTS.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.430
IT'S JUST THE
NOVELTY ASPECT.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.960
Alda:
BACK IN THE BUSHES

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.200
THE NOVELTY OF THE OUTSIDER
PROVES IRRESISTIBLE.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.200
UNTIL AGAIN, THE DOMINANT MALE
INTERRUPTS

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.300
AND AGAIN VENTS HIS ANGER
AGAINST THE FEMALE.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:38.160
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:43.660
JOHN'S RESEARCH SUGGESTS
A MALE'S HIGH RANK

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.230
DOESN'T CUT MUCH ICE
WITH THE GROUP'S FEMALES.

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.730
IN FACT, IT MAY ACT
AGAINST HIM.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.400
DO MONKEYS DEVELOP A LONG-TERM
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP HERE?

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.260
NO, TYPICALLY
WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:57.000
THAT MALES JOIN GROUPS

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.900
AND FEMALES
GO OUT OF THE WAY

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.560
TO MATE WITH
THE NEW GUYS.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.200
SO THEY MATE THE FIRST
YEAR IN THE GROUP

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.530
THEN THEY BECOME
FRIENDS AFTER THAT.

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:07.360
BUT ONCE THEY
BECOME FRIENDS

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.330
RHESUS FEMALES DON'T
MATE WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.260
THE MATING STOPS AFTER
THE FRIENDSHIP STARTS?

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.000
SO IT'S LIKE SEX FIRST

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.260
AND THEN FRIENDSHIP,
AND THAT'S IT.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.730
AND THEY NEVER REKINDLE
THE OLD FLAME?

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.500
ONCE IT'S OUT,
IT'S OUT.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.030
Alda:
WHAT JOHN WANTS TO KNOW NOW IS

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.700
WHO IS FATHERING
MOST OF THE OFFSPRING

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.900
THE OUTSIDERS OR THE INSIDERS?

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.930
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT--

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:37.000
AN ISLAND-WIDE PROGRAM
OF PATERNITY TESTING.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.030
THE RESEARCHERS ARE CAPTURING
THE MONKEYS ONE BY ONE

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.960
FOR BLOOD TESTING.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.460
IT'S A TENSE TIME FOR PEOPLE
AND MONKEYS ALIKE.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.430
JOHN FREES MOST OF THE MONKEYS

00:50:57.430 --> 00:51:00.130
AND THE MOTHER AND BABY
HE'S AFTER

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.300
OBLIGINGLY RUN INTO A CAGE.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.400
MOTHER AND BABY ARE
LIGHTLY ANESTHETIZED

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:11.330
SO THAT BLOOD SAMPLES
CAN BE EASILY TAKEN.

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:15.830
BOTH WILL WAKE UP IN AN HOUR
OR SO AND BE RELEASED.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.660
THE RESULTS OF THE
DNA FINGERPRINTS

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:23.230
CONFIRM WHAT JOHN SUSPECTED:
THE NEWCOMERS TO THE GROUP

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.360
DESPITE THEIR
LOWLY SOCIAL STATUS

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.760
ARE SIRING AS MANY OFFSPRING
AS THE DOMINANT MALES.

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.160
SO THE ISLAND'S BABIES
HAVE MANY DIFFERENT FATHERS

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.500
AND THEREFORE
MANY DIFFERENT GENES

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.160
THANKS TO THE FEMALES'
TASTE FOR NOVELTY.

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.700
Alda:
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE IS
THE EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.800
TO HAVING NOVELTY
BEING EXCITING?

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.930
I MEAN, I PRESUME THAT THAT'S...

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.260
SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS WHY
NOVELTY IS A FACTOR IN THIS.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.730
HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.360
THEIR KIDS ARE BEING SIRED
BY DIFFERENT MALES EVERY YEAR

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.800
AND THAT MUST BE ADAPTIVE
IN SOME WAY.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.730
RHESUS LIVE IN A VARIETY OF
HABITATS, FROM PAKISTAN TO CHINA

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.360
FROM SEA LEVEL
TO HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:06.000
SO IN ORDER TO ADAPT TO THAT
MANY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.860
PERHAPS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE
A GENETICALLY DIVERSE STOCK.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.600
Alda:
THERE'S ONE MORE SURPRISE
FROM JOHN'S RESEARCH--

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.230
ANOTHER REASON HIGH
SOCIAL RANK FOR MALES

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:20.730
CAN BE A CURSE
RATHER THAN A BLESSING.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.960
THE SONS OF HIGH-RANKING FEMALES
INHERIT THEIR MOM'S RANK

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.900
AND THEY'RE TREATED LIKE PRINCES
BY EVERYONE IN THE GROUP.

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:39.860
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO FIGHT
THEIR OWN BATTLES.

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.060
NO SOONER HAS THIS HIGH-BORN
SON PICKED A QUARREL

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.500
THAN A FEMALE FROM THE GROUP
RUSHES IN TO FINISH IT.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.900
(<i> screeching</i> )

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.860
WHEN THESE PRIVILEGED MALES
FINALLY DO LEAVE HOME

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:59.060
THEY HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME
OF IT THAN MORE LOWLY MONKEYS.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:02.430
THEY'RE THE VICTIMS
OF MUCH MORE AGGRESSION...

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:03.900
(<i> squealing</i> )

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:09.400
AND MANY NEVER DO SUCCESSFULLY
ENTER A NEW GROUP

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.130
LIVING OUT THEIR LIVES
AS SOLITARY HERMITS

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:14.260
ON THE FRINGES
OF MONKEY SOCIETY.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:17.260
Alda:
IT KIND OF SOUNDS
LIKE FAMILIAR BEHAVIOR--

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:19.200
YOU KNOW, THE PRIVILEGED KID

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.060
WHO CAN'T NECESSARILY
TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.800
WHEN HE'S ON HIS OWN.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.730
RIGHT, THEY DON'T
KNOW HOW TO BUY CORN
FLAKES OR ANYTHING.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.530
THEY HAVE ALWAYS HAD IT
PROVIDED FOR THEM.

00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:35.760
Alda:
WE BEGAN OUR EXPLORATION
OF THE PRIMATE WORLD

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.800
BY ASKING HOW MUCH OF OUR
NONHUMAN COUSINS IS IN US

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.130
AND HOW MUCH OF US IS IN THEM.

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.230
WHAT WE'VE FOUND CAN LEAD
TO A NEW APPRECIATION

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:49.900
OF BOTH THEM AND US--

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.000
OF THE THINGS WE SHARE THROUGH
OUR COMMON EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.630
AND OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE
EACH PRIMATE SPECIES UNIQUE

00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:59.930
SINCE WE'VE GONE
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:04.130
Alda:
IT'S EASY TO TALK ABOUT THESE
ANIMALS AS IF THEY'RE HUMAN.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:07.560
A LOT OF THEIR BEHAVIOR SEEMS
LIKE OURS, SO YOU THINK

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:11.230
"THEIR THINKING PROCESS
MUST BE LIKE OURS," BUT IT...

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:13.160
OR MAYBE IT IS, I DON'T KNOW.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.300
HOW MUCH IS IT?

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.200
AGAIN, YOU HAVE
TO BE CAREFUL.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.260
YOU'RE ASKING, "WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THEIR MINDS?"

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:22.130
AND THE REAL ANSWER IS
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:24.260
ALL<i> I</i> KNOW IS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.530
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THESE RULES
EXIST IN THEIR LIVES

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.200
BECAUSE ALL THE MALES
AND ALL THE FEMALES

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.200
DO THE SAME SORT OF THING.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.230
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
WHEN THEY'RE...

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:36.900
Alda:
AND AFTER AN HOUR
OF MONKEY WATCHING

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.830
I BEGAN TO WONDER JUST
WHO WAS WATCHING WHOM.

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.400
TAKES A LIKING TO...

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.330
THIS GUY IS JUMPING AROUND
FROM TREE TO TREE.

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.130
HE'S GOT HIS EYE ON ME.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.960
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE NEW GUY HERE.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:51.300
SHE KNOWS THAT.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.330
AND SHE'S DOING THIS
LIP-SMACKING THING AT ME.

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.530
THAT'S SIMPLY
A SIGN OF
ASSURANCE.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:59.060
IT'S NEITHER AGGRESSIVE
NOR SUBMISSIVE.

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:00.930
SHE'S NOT BLOWING
ME KISSES?

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.460
NO.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:12.700
PRESENTATION OF
<i> SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN FRONTIERS</i>

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:16.600
IS MADE POSSIBLE BY A GRANT
FROM GTE CORPORATION.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:21.060
AT GTE, IT'S AMAZING
WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.730
