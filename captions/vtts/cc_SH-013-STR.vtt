00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:53.430


2
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.700
Tranio,

3
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.170
since for the great desire I had

4
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.830
to see fair Padua, nursery of arts,

5
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.170
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy, the pleasant garden of great Italy;

6
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.100
and by my father's love and leave am arm'd

7
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.970
with his good will and thy good company,

8
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.930
my trusty servant, well-approved in all,

9
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.800
here let us breathe and haply institute

10
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.870
a course of learning and ingenious studies.

11
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.430
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens

12
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.170
gave me my being and my father first,

13
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.370
a merchant of great traffic through the world,

14
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.970
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.

15
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.900
Vincetino's son brought up in Florence,

16
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.030
it shall become to serve all hopes conceived,

17
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.100
to deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.

18
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.170
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.830
virtue and that part of philosophy

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.200
will I apply that treats of happiness by virtue specially to be achieved.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Well, tell me thy mind,

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.230
for I have Pisa left and am to Padua come

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.830
as he that leaves a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep

24
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.900
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870
I am in all affected as yourself,

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.870
glad that you thus resolve

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.000
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.200
Only, good master, while we do admire

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.500
this virtue and this moral discipline,

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800
let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray,

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.830
or so devote to Aristotle's cheques

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.600
as Ovid be an outcast quite abjured.

34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.030
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have

35
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300
and practise rhetoric in your common talk.

36
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.470
Music and poesy use to quicken you.

37
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.070
The mathematics and metaphysics,

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.670
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you.

39
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.630
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en.

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.830
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

41
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.600
Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.

42
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,

43
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.700
we could at once put us in readiness--

44
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.800
ow--

45
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500
and take a lodging fit to entertain

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.670
such friends as time in Padua shall beget.

47
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.770
But stay a while.

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.900
What company is this?

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.330
Master, some show to welcome us to town.

50
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
Gentlemen, importune me no farther,

51
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.970
for how I firmly am resolved you know;

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.830
that is, not bestow my youngest daughter

53
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.730
before I have a husband for the elder.

54
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.530
If either of you both love Katharina,

55
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470
because I know you well and love you well,

56
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800
leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

57
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900
To cart her rather.

58
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.370
She's too rough for me.

59
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.570
There, there, Hortensio, will you any wife?

60
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.770
I pray you, sir, is it your will

61
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.500
to make a stale of me amongst these mates?

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.630
Mates, maid, how mean you that?

63
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.800
No mates for you

64
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.170
unless you were of gentler, milder mold.

65
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.470
I' faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.

66
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.000
I wis it is not halfway to her heart,

67
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.900
but if it were, doubt not her care should be

68
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.730
to comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool

69
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.730
and paint your face and use you like a fool.

70
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.400
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us.

71
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.930
And me too, good Lord.

72
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.630
Hush, master.

73
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.230
Here's some good pastime toward.

74
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.700
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.970
But in the other's silence

76
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.070
do I see maid's mild behavior and sobriety.

77
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.430
Peace, Tranio.

78
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.200
Gentlemen, that I may soon make good what I have said--

79
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870
Bianca, get you in,

80
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.630
and let it not displease thee, good Bianca,

81
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.670
for I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

82
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.300
A pretty peat.

83
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.130
It is best put finger in the eye,

84
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.230
an she knew why.

85
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.070
Sister, content you in my discontent.

86
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.230
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe.

87
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.870
My books and instruments shall be my company,

88
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.570
on them to look and practise by myself.

89
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.300
Hark, Tranio, thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

90
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.570
Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?

91
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca's grief.

92
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.770
Why will you mew her up, Signior Baptista,

93
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.000
for this fiend of hell,

94
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.500
and make her bear the penance of her tongue?

95
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.330
Gentlemen, content ye.

96
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.070
I am resolved.

97
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.530
Go in, Bianca.

98
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.300
And for I know she taketh most delight

99
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.800
in music, instruments, and poetry,

100
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.100
schoolmasters will I have within my house,

101
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070
fit to instruct her youth.

102
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.270
If you, Hortensio, or, Signior Gremio, you,

103
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.670
know any such, prefer them hither,

104
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.000
for to cunning men I will be very kind

105
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.170
and liberal to mine own children in good bringing up.

106
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.200
And so farewell.

107
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.370
Katharina, you may stay,

108
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.970
for I have more to commune with Bianca.

109
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.930
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?

110
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.530
What?

111
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.700
Shall I be appointed hours?

112
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.000
As though, belike,

113
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.530
I knew not what to take and what to leave?

114
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.530
Ooh.

115
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.470
Ha!

116
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.370
Oh.

117
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.470
Phew.

118
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.730
You may go to the devil's dam.

119
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.700
Your gifts are so good, here's none will hold you.

120
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.070
Their love is not so great, Hortensio,

121
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.670
but we may blow our nails together

122
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.870
and fast it fairly out.

123
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.270
Our cakes dough on both sides.

124
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.800
Farewell.

125
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.930
And yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca,

126
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.100
if I can by any means light on a fit man

127
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.970
to teach her that wherein she delights,

128
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.330
I will wish him to her father.

129
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.570
So will I, Signior Gremio,

130
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.000
but a word, I pray.

131
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.870
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle,

132
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.500
know now, upon advice,

133
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.800
it touches us both

134
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.570
that we may yet again have access

135
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.530
to our fair mistress and be happy rivals

136
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.700
in Bianco's love,

137
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.430
to labor and effect one thing specially.

138
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.630
What's that, I pray?

139
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.030
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

140
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.130
A husband? A devil.

141
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.230
I say a husband.

142
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.500
I say a devil.

143
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.570
Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich,

144
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.770
any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?

145
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.030
Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine

146
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.470
to endure her loud alarums,

147
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.530
why, man, there be good fellows in the world,

148
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.900
an a man should light on them,

149
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.200
would take her with all faults, and money enough.

150
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.400
I cannot tell,

151
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.730
but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition

152
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.870
to be whipped at the high cross every morning.

153
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.800
Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten apples,

154
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.030
but come;

155
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.700
since this bar in law makes us friends,

156
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.530
it shall be so far forth friendly maintained

157
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
till by helping Baptista's eldest daughter to a husband

158
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.500
we set his youngest free for a husband

159
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.530
and then have to't a fresh, hmm?

160
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.700
Sweet Bianca.

161
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.400
Happy man be his dole.

162
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.100
He that runs fastest gets the ring.

163
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.470
How say you, Signior Gremio?

164
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.870
I am agreed,

165
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.500
and would I had given him the best horse in Padua

166
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.800
to begin his wooing

167
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.370
that would thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her,

168
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.970
and rid the house of her.

169
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.970
Come on.

170
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.900
I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible

171
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.270
that love should of a sudden take such hold?

172
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.870
Tranio, till I found it to be true,

173
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.630
I never thought it possible or likely;

174
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.470
But see, while idly I stood looking on,

175
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.270
I found the effect of love in idleness

176
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.130
and now in plainness do confess to thee,

177
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.730
that art to me as secret and as dear

178
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.470
as Anna to the queen of Carthage was,

179
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.630
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,

180
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.600
if I achieve not this young, modest girl.

181
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.930
Well, counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst.

182
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.800
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

183
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.900
Master, it is no time to chide you now.

184
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.500
Affection is not rated from the heart.

185
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.700
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so--

186
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.970
"Redime te captum quam queas minimo."

187
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.100
Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:

188
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300
the rest will comfort for thy counsel's sound.

189
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.230
Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,

190
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.370
perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

191
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.070
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face

192
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.670
such as the daughter of Agenor had

193
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.730
that made great Jove to humble him to her hand

194
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.970
when with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

195
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.070
Saw you no more?

196
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.430
Mark'd you not how her sister

197
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.330
began to scold and raise up such a storm

198
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.470
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

199
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.970
Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,

200
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.230
and with her breath, she did perfume the air.

201
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.330
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

202
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.570
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.

203
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.430
I pray, awake, sir.

204
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.730
If you love the maid,

205
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.270
bend thoughts and wits to achieve her.

206
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.770
Thus it stands.

207
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.700
Her eldest sister is so cursed and shrewd

208
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.670
that till the father rid his hands of her,

209
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.900
Master, your love must live a maid at home.

210
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.870
Therefore has he closely mew'd her up,

211
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.030
because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.

212
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.930
Oh, Tranio, what a cruel father's he.

213
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.130
But art thou not advised,

214
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.470
he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters

215
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.000
to instruct her?

216
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.970
Ay, marry, am I, sir, and now 'tis plotted.

217
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.300
I have it, Tranio.

218
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.970
Master, for my hand, both our inventions meet and jump in one.

219
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.300
Well, tell me thine first.

220
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.170
You will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid.

221
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.200
- That's your device. - It is; may it be done?

222
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.230
Not possible, for who shall bear your part,

223
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.000
and be in Padua here Vincentio's son,

224
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.300
keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,

225
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.270
visit his countrymen and banquet them?

226
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.470
Basta; content thee, for I have it full.

227
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.270
We have not yet been seen in any house,

228
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.830
nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces for man or master.

229
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.030
Then it follows thus,

230
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.300
thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,

231
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.370
keep house and port and servants as I should.

232
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.200
I will some other be, some Florentine,

233
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.130
some Neapolitan, or a meaner man of Pisa.

234
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.600
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so.

235
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.270
Tranio, at once, uncase thee.

236
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.870
Take my color'd hat and cloak.

237
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.100
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,

238
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.270
but I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

239
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.800
So had you need.

240
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.730
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,

241
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.270
and I am tied to be obedient,

242
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.100
for so your father charged me at our parting.

243
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.800
"Be serviceable to my son," quoth he,

244
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800
although I think 'twas in another sense.

245
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.830
I am content to be Lucentio, because so well I love Lucentio.

246
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.770
Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves,

247
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.630
and let me be a slave to achieve that maid

248
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.030
whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.

249
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.330
Here comes the rogue.

250
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.730
Sirrah, where have you been?

251
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.930
Where have I been?

252
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.300
Nay, how now. Where are you?

253
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.870
Dear Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes?

254
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.070
Or you stolen his?

255
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.570
Or both? Pray, what's the news?

256
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.900
Sirrah, come hither.

257
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.730
'Tis no time to jest, and feign your manners to the time.

258
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.670
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,

259
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.500
puts my apparel and my countenance on,

260
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.230
for in a quarrel since I came ashore,

261
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.000
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried.

262
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.930
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,

263
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.900
while I make way from hence to save my life.

264
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.000
You understand me?

265
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.100
I, sir? Ne'er a whit.

266
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.770
And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth.

267
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.330
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

268
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.530
Yeah, the better for him.

269
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.870
Would I were so too.

270
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.370
So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,

271
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.030
that Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.

272
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.230
But, sirrah, not for my sake but your master's,

273
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.270
I advise you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies.

274
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.070
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;

275
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.200
but in all places else, your master Lucentio.

276
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.000
Tranio, let's go.

277
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.070
One thing more rests that thyself execute--

278
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.570
to make one among these wooers--

279
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.970
if thou ask me why, sufficeth,

280
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.130
my reasons are both good and weighty.

281
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.370
Verona, for a while, I take my leave,

282
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.400
to see my friends in Padua,

283
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.000
but of all--

284
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.230
oh--

285
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.370
my best beloved and approved friend, Hortensio;

286
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.770
and I trow this is his house.

287
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.830
Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.

288
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.930
Knock, sir?

289
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.100
Whom should I knock?

290
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500
Is there any man has abused your worship?

291
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.630
Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

292
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.900
Knock you here, sir?

293
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.330
Why, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?

294
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.070
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate

295
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.300
and rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

296
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.800
My master is grown quarrelsome.

297
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.000
I should knock you first,

298
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.870
then I know after who comes by the worst.

299
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.030
Will it not be?

300
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.130
Faith, sirrah,

301
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.730
an you'll not knock, I'll ring it.

302
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.600
I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

303
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.430
Help, masters, help! My master is mad!

304
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.400
Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

305
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.730
How now, what's the matter?

306
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.200
My old friend Grumio...

307
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.930
And my good friend Petruchio!

308
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.700
How do you all at Verona?

309
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.130
Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?

310
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.700
"Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato," may I say.

311
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.730
Ooh, um, "Alla nostra casa ben venuto,

312
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.470
molto honorato signor mio Petruchio."

313
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.570
Rise, Grumio, rise.

314
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.700
Up, up, up, up.

315
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.170
We will compound this quarrel.

316
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.470
Nay, sir, 'tis no matter, what he 'leges in Latin.

317
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.070
If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service,

318
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.730
look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir.

319
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.030
Well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so,

320
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.330
being perhaps, for aught I see, 2 and 30, a pip out,

321
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.170
whom to God I had well knock'd at first,

322
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.930
then had not Grumio come by the worst?

323
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.130
A senseless villain.

324
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.530
Good Hortensio, I bade the rascal knock upon your gate

325
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.470
and could not get him for my heart to do it.

326
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.270
Knock at the gate? O heavens, spake you not these words plain,

327
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.600
"Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here, knock me well,

328
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.700
knock me soundly"?

329
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.670
And come you now with, "Knock at the gate"?

330
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.630
Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

331
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.870
Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge.

332
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.470
Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,

333
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.270
your ancient, pleasant, trusty servant Grumio.

334
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.730
And tell me now, sweet friend,

335
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.770
what happy gale blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

336
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.900
Oh, such wind as scatters young men through the world

337
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.970
to seek their fortune farther than at home

338
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.430
where small experience grows.

339
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.370
But in a few, Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me.

340
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.930
Antonio, my father, is deceased,

341
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.130
Oh.

342
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.330
Oh.

343
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.430
And I have thrust myself into this maze,

344
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.500
haply to wive and thrive as best I may.

345
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.930
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,

346
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.330
and so am come abroad to see the world.

347
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.000
Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee

348
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.300
and wish thee to a shrewd ill-favor'd wife?

349
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.500
Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel,

350
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.000
and yet I promise you, she shall be rich, and very rich.

351
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.470
Yet thou'rt too much my friend,

352
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.830
and I'll not wish thee to her.

353
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.030
Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we,

354
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.200
few words suffice;

355
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.230
and therefore, if thou know one rich enough

356
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.500
to be Petruchio's wife,

357
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.400
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance,

358
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.300
be she as foul as was Florentius' love,

359
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.430
as old as Sibyl,

360
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.000
and as cursed and shrewd as Socrates' Xanthippe--

361
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.070
or a worse-- she moves me not,

362
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.000
or not removes, at least, affection's edge in me,

363
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.470
were she as rough as are the Adriatic seas:

364
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.400
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua.

365
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.170
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

366
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.730
Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.

367
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.970
Why, give him gold enough, marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby

368
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.170
or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head,

369
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.730
though she have as many diseases as 2 and 50 horses,

370
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.700
nothing comes amiss so money comes withal.

371
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.530
But, Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,

372
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.570
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.

373
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.270
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife

374
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.930
with wealth enough and young and beauteous,

375
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.930
brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.

376
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.530
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,

377
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.770
is that she is intolerable cursed and shrewd and froward,

378
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.330
so beyond all measure that,

379
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.300
were my state far worser than it is,

380
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

381
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.570
Hortensio, peace.

382
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.070
Thou know'st not gold's effect.

383
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.100
Tell me her father's name, and 'tis enough,

384
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.470
for I will board her,

385
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.470
though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

386
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.170
Her father is Baptista Minola, an affable and courteous gentleman.

387
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.330
Her name is Katharina Minola,

388
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.870
renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

389
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.370
I know her father, though I know not her.

390
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.670
He knew my deceased father well.

391
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.730
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;

392
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.700
and therefore, let me be thus bold with you

393
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.630
to give you over at this first encounter,

394
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.470
unless you will accompany me thither.

395
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.770
I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.

396
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.630
O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do,

397
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.200
she would think scolding would do little good upon him.

398
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.500
She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so.

399
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.430
That's nothing, an he begin once, he'll rail in his rope tricks.

400
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.870
I'll tell you what sir, an she stand him but a little,

401
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.530
he'll throw a figure in her face, so disfigure her with it,

402
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.870
she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.

403
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.130
You know him not, sir.

404
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.970
Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,

405
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.800
for in Baptista's keep, my treasure is.

406
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.230
He hath the jewel of my life in hold--

407
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.500
his youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca--

408
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.970
and her withholds from me and other more,

409
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.930
suitors to her and rivals in my love,

410
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.430
supposing it a thing impossible

411
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.130
for those defects I have before rehearsed

412
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.430
that ever Katharina shall be woo'd.

413
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.170
Therefore, this order hath Baptista ta'en

414
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.830
that none shall have access unto Bianca

415
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.100
till Katharine the cursed have got a husband.

416
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.170
Katharine the cursed, a title for a maid, of all titles the worst.

417
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.300
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace

418
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.700
and offer me disguised in sober robes

419
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.900
to old Baptista as a schoolmaster

420
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.030
well seen in music to instruct Bianca

421
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.400
that so I may by this device

422
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.700
at least have leave and leisure to make love to her

423
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.630
and, unsuspected, court her by herself.

424
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.830
Here's no knavery.

425
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.230
See, to beguile the old folks,

426
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.370
how the young folks lay their heads together.

427
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.770
Master, master, look about you. Who goes there, ha?

428
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.030
Oh, oh, peace, Grumio.

429
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.230
It is the rival of my love.

430
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.670
Petruchio, stand by a while.

431
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.230
O, very well.

432
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.100
I have perused the note.

433
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.400
Hark you, sir,

434
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.530
I'll have them very fairly bound:

435
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.100
all books of love, see that at any hand;

436
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.400
and see you read no other lectures to her,

437
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.330
you understand me.

438
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.370
Over and beside Signior Baptista's liberality,

439
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.430
I'll mend it with a largess.

440
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.830
Take your paper too,

441
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.770
and let me have them very well perfumed,

442
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.770
for she is sweeter than perfume itself

443
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.870
to whom they go to.

444
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.970
Mm.

445
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.470
Nay, what will you read to her?

446
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.400
Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you

447
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.230
as for my patron, stand you so assured,

448
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.230
as firmly as yourself were still in place.

449
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.800
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words than you--

450
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.900
Hmm?

451
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.370
Unless you were a scholar, sir.

452
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.700
O this learning, what a thing it is.

453
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.300
O this woodcock, what an ass it is.

454
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.470
Grumio, mum.

455
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.900
God save you, Signior Gremio.

456
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.170
And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.

457
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.500
Trow you whither I am going?

458
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.830
To Baptista Minola.

459
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.530
I promised to inquire carefully

460
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.500
about a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,

461
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.770
and by good fortune,

462
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.730
I have lighted well on this young man,

463
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.400
for learning and behavior fit for her turn,

464
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.370
well read in poetry and other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

465
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.630
'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman

466
00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.670
hath promised me to show me to another,

467
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.100
a fine musician to instruct our mistress;

468
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.970
so shall I no whit be behind in duty to fair Bianca,

469
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.170
so beloved of me.

470
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.270
Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.

471
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.670
And that his bags shall prove.

472
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.300
Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.

473
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.730
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,

474
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.200
I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.

475
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.770
Here is a gentleman by chance I met,

476
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.030
upon agreement from us to his liking,

477
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.970
will undertake to woo cursed Katharine.

478
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.070
Huh?

479
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.300
Yea, and to marry her

480
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.270
if her dowry please.

481
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.930
So said, so done, is well.

482
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.530
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

483
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.600
I know she is an irksome, brawling scold.

484
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.430
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

485
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.300
No, say'st me so, friend?

486
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.500
What countryman?

487
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.670
Born in Verona, old Antonio's son.

488
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.770
My father dead--

489
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.870
Oh.

490
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.070
my fortune lives for me,

491
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.170
and I do hope good days and long to see.

492
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.030
O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange,

493
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.270
but if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name.

494
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.970
You shall have me assisting you in all.

495
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.100
But will you woo this wildcat?

496
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.200
Will I live?

497
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.330
Will he woo her? Aye, or I'll hang her.

498
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.070
Why came I hither but to that intent?

499
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.870
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?

500
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.300
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?

501
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.630
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds,

502
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.770
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?

503
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.930
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,

504
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.570
and heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?

505
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.770
Have I not, in a pitched battle, heard

506
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.930
loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?

507
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.530
And do you tell me of a woman's tongue

508
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.100
that gives not half so great a blow to hear

509
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.900
as will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?

510
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.930
Tush, tush. Fear boys with bugs.

511
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.800
For he fears none.

512
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.270
Hortensio, hark,

513
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.170
this gentleman is happily arrived,

514
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.200
my mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

515
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.230
Mm, I promised we would be contributors

516
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.330
and bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe'er.

517
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.500
And so we will, provided that he win her.

518
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.800
I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

519
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.430
Gentlemen, God save you.

520
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.500
If I may be bold, tell me, I beseech you,

521
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.770
which is the readiest way

522
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.770
to the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

523
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.430
He that has the two fair daughters?

524
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.530
Is't he you mean?

525
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.630
Even he, Biondello.

526
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.630
Hark you, sir, you mean not her to--

527
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.870
Perhaps, him and her, sir.

528
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.100
What have you to do?

529
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.770
Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

530
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.330
I love no chiders, sir.

531
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.670
Biondello, let's away.

532
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.800
Well begun, Tranio.

533
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.470
Sir, a word ere you go.

534
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.330
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of,

535
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.430
yea or no?

536
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.500
And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

537
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.530
No, if without more words you will get you hence.

538
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.600
Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free

539
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.330
for me as for you?

540
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.670
But so is not she.

541
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.270
For what reason, I beseech you?

542
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.830
For this reason, if you'll know,

543
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.970
that she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

544
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.070
That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

545
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.700
Softly, my masters.

546
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.230
If you be gentlemen, do me this right.

547
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.870
Hear me with patience.

548
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.830
Baptista is a noble gentleman

549
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.400
to whom my father is not all unknown,

550
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.700
and were his daughter fairer than she is,

551
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.230
she may more suitors have and me for one.

552
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.730
Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers.

553
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.870
Then well one more may fair Bianca have,

554
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.070
and so she shall.

555
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.500
Lucentio shall make one,

556
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.130
though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

557
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.170
What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.

558
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.300
Sir, give him head.

559
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.630
I know he'll prove a jade.

560
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.730
Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

561
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.370
Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,

562
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.300
did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

563
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.430
No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two,

564
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.470
the one as famous for a scolding tongue

565
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.330
as is the other for beauteous modesty.

566
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.700
Sir, sir, the first's for me.

567
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.830
Let her go by.

568
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.430
Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules,

569
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.570
and let it be more than Alcides' 12.

570
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.970
Sir, understand you this of me in sooth.

571
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.800
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,

572
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.030
her father keeps from all access of suitors

573
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.500
and will not promise her to any man

574
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.700
until the elder sister first be wed.

575
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.100
The younger then is free and not before.

576
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.470
If it be so, sir,

577
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.370
that you are the man must stead us all--

578
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.700
and me amongst the rest--

579
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.100
and if you break the ice and do this feat,

580
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.200
achieve the elder,

581
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.530
and set the younger free for our access,

582
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.200
whose hap shall be to have her

583
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.830
will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

584
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.830
Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive,

585
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.030
and since you do profess to be a suitor,

586
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.200
you must, as we do, gratify this gentleman

587
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.600
to whom we all--all rest generally beholding.

588
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.770
Sir, I shall not be slack.

589
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:20.900
In sign whereof,

590
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.870
please you we may contrive this afternoon

591
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.200
and quaff carouses to our mistress' health

592
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.330
and do as adversaries do in law--

593
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.700
strive mightily but eat and drink as friends.

594
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:33.570
Excellent motion.

595
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.700
Let's be gone.

596
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.430
The motion's good indeed, and be it so.

597
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.170
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

598
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.170
Um--

599
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:45.970
Ah!

600
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:48.670
Uh!

601
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.770
Cah!

602
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:50.770
Ah!

603
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:54.770
Mm.

604
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:55.770
Ha!

605
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:00.630
Mm.

606
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:03.630
Ah.

607
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.700
Uh.

608
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.700
Uh.

609
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.870
Uh.

610
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.500
Uh.

611
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.630
Good sister,

612
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.600
wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,

613
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.370
to make a bondmaid and a slave of me.

614
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:24.100
That, I disdain--

615
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.670
Ah!

616
00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:27.700
But for these other gawds,

617
00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.470
unbind my hands.

618
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.970
I'll pull them off myself,

619
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:33.700
yea, all my raiment to my petticoat,

620
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.800
or what you will command me will I do

621
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.870
so well do I know my duty to my elders.

622
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.900
Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee,

623
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.300
tell whom thou lovest best.

624
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.600
See thou dissemble not!

625
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.470
Believe me, sister, of all the men alive,

626
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.530
I never yet beheld that special face

627
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.830
which I could fancy more than any other.

628
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.530
Minion, thou liest!

629
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:53.800
Is't not Hortensio?

630
00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.900
Oh, if you affect him, sister, here I swear,

631
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.870
I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.

632
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.100
O then, belike, you fancy riches more.

633
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.670
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

634
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.930
Ah! Aha!

635
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.730
Is it for him you do envy me so?

636
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.470
Nay, then you jest,

637
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:14.830
and now, I well perceive

638
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.870
you have but jested with me all this while.

639
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:20.870
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands!

640
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.100
If that be jest, then all the rest was so!

641
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.200
You!

642
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.300
You!

643
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:32.300
Why, how now, dame!

644
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.130
Bianca!

645
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.200
Whence grows this insolence?

646
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.470
Stand aside.

647
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.000
Poor girl, she weeps.

648
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.200
Go ply thy needle.

649
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.370
Meddle not with her.

650
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.030
For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit.

651
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.330
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?

652
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.530
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

653
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.900
Her silence flouts me!

654
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.100
And I'll be revenged!

655
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.270
What, in my sight?

656
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:03.670
Bianca, get thee in.

657
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:04.770
Oh!

658
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.030
What, will you not suffer me?

659
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.530
Nay, now I see she is your treasure.

660
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.070
She must have a husband.

661
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.670
I must dance barefoot on her wedding day

662
00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.770
and for your love to her lead apes in hell!

663
00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:25.270
Oh, talk not to me!

664
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.470
I will go sit and weep

665
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:32.130
till I can find occasion of revenge.

666
00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:39.170
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

667
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:46.370
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

668
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:51.370
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

669
00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.830
Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?

670
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.430
Ahem.

671
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.730
But who comes here?

672
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.870
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.

673
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.070
Good morrow, Signior Gremio.

674
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.130
God save you, gentlemen.

675
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.400
And you, good sir.

676
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.400
Pray, have you not a daughter call'd Katharina,

677
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.000
fair and virtuous?

678
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.230
Ah!

679
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.900
I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

680
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.070
You are too blunt.

681
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:26.700
Go to it orderly.

682
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.300
You wrong me, Signior Gremio.

683
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.470
Give me leave.

684
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.770
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,

685
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.200
that, hearing of her beauty and her wit,

686
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.670
her affability and bashful modesty, her--

687
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.300
Oh, ho!

688
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.970
wondrous qualities and mild behavior,

689
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.730
am bold to show myself

690
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.000
a forward guest within your house,

691
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.370
to make mine eye the witness

692
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.500
of that report which I so oft have heard.

693
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.270
Ah, ha!

694
00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.500
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,

695
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.370
I do present you with a man of mine,

696
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.330
cunning in music and the mathematics,

697
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.500
to instruct her fully in those sciences,

698
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.670
whereof I know she is not ignorant.

699
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.430
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.

700
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.030
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

701
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.270
You're welcome, sir, and he, for your good sake,

702
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.200
but for my daughter Katharine, this I know,

703
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.330
she is not for your turn, the more my grief.

704
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.300
I see you do not mean to part with her,

705
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.900
or else you like not of my company.

706
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.030
Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.

707
00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.300
Whence are you, sir?

708
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.500
What may I call your name?

709
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.030
Petruchio is my name, Antonio's son,

710
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.930
a man well-known throughout all Italy.

711
00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.200
I know him well.

712
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.800
Oh, no.

713
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.630
You are welcome for his sake.

714
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.100
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,

715
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.730
let us that are poor petitioners speak too:

716
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.000
Baccare, you are marvellous forward.

717
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.670
O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

718
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.930
I doubt it not, sir,

719
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.630
but you will curse your wooing.

720
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.700
Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful,

721
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.030
I am sure of it.

722
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.970
To express the like kindness, myself that have been

723
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.300
more kindly beholding to you than any,

724
00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.770
freely give unto you this young scholar,

725
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.770
that hath been long studying at Rheims,

726
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.930
as cunning in Greek and Latin and other languages

727
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.770
as the other in music and mathematics.

728
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.900
His name is--

729
00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.030
Cambio.

730
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.170
Cambio.

731
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.500
Pray, accept his service.

732
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.030
A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.

733
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.230
You are welcome, good Cambio.

734
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.030
But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger.

735
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.570
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

736
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.270
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,

737
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.400
that, being a stranger in this city here,

738
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.370
do make myself a suitor to your daughter,

739
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.070
unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.

740
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.700
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me

741
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.200
in the preferment of the elder sister.

742
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.330
This liberty is all that I request:

743
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.670
that, upon knowledge of my parentage,

744
00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.570
I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo

745
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.670
and free access and favour as the rest,

746
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.230
and toward the education of your daughters,

747
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.370
I here bestow a simple instrument,

748
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.100
and this small packet of Greek and Latin books.

749
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.570
If you accept them, then their worth is great.

750
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.130
Lucentio is your name.

751
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.800
Of whence, I pray?

752
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.330
Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.

753
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.870
A mighty man of Pisa.

754
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.470
By report, I know him well.

755
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.270
You are very welcome, sir,

756
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.270
take you the lute and you the set of books.

757
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:21.130
You shall go see your pupils presently.

758
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.230
Holla, within.

759
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.430
Sirrah, lead these gentlemen to my daughters,

760
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.470
and tell them both these are their tutors.

761
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.430
Bid them use them well.

762
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.900
We will go walk a little in the orchard, and then to dinner.

763
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.130
You are passing welcome,

764
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:36.000
and so I pray you all to think yourselves.

765
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.930
Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,

766
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.500
and every day, I cannot come to woo.

767
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.530
You knew my father well, and in him me,

768
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.870
left solely heir to all his lands and goods,

769
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.370
which I have better'd rather than decreased.

770
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.000
Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,

771
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.530
what dowry shall I have with her to wife?

772
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.330
After my death, the one half of my lands

773
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.700
and in possession 20,000 crowns.

774
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.070
And for that dowry,

775
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.670
I'll assure her of her widowhood,

776
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.930
be it that she survive me,

777
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.130
in all my lands and leases whatsoever.

778
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.370
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us

779
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.330
that covenants may be kept on either hand.

780
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.970
Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd--

781
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.270
that is, her love,

782
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.600
for that is all in all.

783
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.770
Why, that is nothing,

784
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.870
for I tell you, father,

785
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.970
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded,

786
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.830
and where two raging fires meet together,

787
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.530
they do consume the thing that feeds their fury.

788
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.200
Though little fire grows great with little wind,

789
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.730
yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all.

790
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.970
So I to her, and so she yields to me,

791
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:46.930
for I am rough and woo not like a babe, hmm?

792
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.470
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed,

793
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.430
but be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

794
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.830
Ay, to the proof;

795
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.930
as mountains are for winds,

796
00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.530
that shake not though they blow perpetually.

797
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.800
Uh, uh, uh!

798
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.170
How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?

799
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.570
For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

800
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.470
What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

801
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.970
Ah, uh!

802
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.370
I think she'll sooner prove a soldier.

803
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.400
Iron may hold with her but never lutes.

804
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.530
Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

805
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.870
Why, no, for she hath broke the lute to me.

806
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.030
I did but tell her she mistook her frets

807
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.170
and bow'd her hand to teach her fingering

808
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.030
when, with a most impatient devilish spirit,

809
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.230
"Frets, call you these?" quoth she,

810
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.730
"I'll fume with them."

811
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.600
And with that word, she struck me on the head,

812
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.100
and through the instrument, my pate made way;

813
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.370
and there I stood amazed for a while,

814
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.600
as on a pillory, looking through the lute,

815
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.700
while she did call me rascal fiddler

816
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.270
and twangling Jack

817
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.300
and 20 such vile terms

818
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.900
as had she studied to misuse me so.

819
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.000
Ooh.

820
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.200
Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench.

821
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.600
I love her ten times more than ever I did.

822
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.200
O, how I long to have some chat with her.

823
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.630
Well, go with me, and be not so discomfited.

824
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.500
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter.

825
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.100
She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.

826
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.270
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us?

827
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.270
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

828
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.270
I pray you do.

829
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.900
Come.

830
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.370
I'll attend her here...

831
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:36.770
and woo her with some spirit when she comes.

832
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.670
Say that she rail.

833
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.100
Why, then, I'll tell her plain

834
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.600
she sings as sweetly as a nightingale.

835
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.270
Say that she frown.

836
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.230
I'll say she looks as clear

837
00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:00.100
as morning roses newly wash'd with dew.

838
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.400
Say she be mute and will not speak a word.

839
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.770
Then I'll commend her volubility

840
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.470
and say she uttereth piercing eloquence.

841
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500
If she do bid me pack,

842
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.000
I'll give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week.

843
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.670
If she deny to wed,

844
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.700
I'll crave the day when I shall ask the banns

845
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.430
and when be married.

846
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.700
But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak.

847
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.430
Good morrow, Kate...

848
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.870
for that's your name, I hear.

849
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:54.200
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing.

850
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.530
They call me Katharine that do talk of me.

851
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.170
You lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain Kate

852
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:07.270
and bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the cursed,

853
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.000
but Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,

854
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.900
Kate of Kate Hall,

855
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.770
my super dainty Kate,

856
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.470
for dainties are all Kates--

857
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.200
Ha, ha, ha!

858
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.730
And therefore, Kate,

859
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.630
take this of me, Kate of my consolation,

860
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.030
hearing thy mildness praised in every town,

861
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.000
thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded--

862
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.300
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs--

863
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.270
myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

864
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.630
"Moved"--in good time.

865
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.700
Let him that moved you hither remove you hence.

866
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.300
I knew you at the first you were a moveable.

867
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.330
Why, what's a moveable?

868
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.730
A join'd stool.

869
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.030
Thou hast hit it.

870
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.500
Come, sit on me.

871
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.070
Asses are made to bear,

872
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.400
and so are you.

873
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.370
Women are made to bear,

874
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.830
and so are you.

875
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.800
No such jade as you, if me you mean.

876
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.570
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee,

877
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.600
for, knowing thee to be but young and light--

878
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.900
Too light for such a swain as you to catch

879
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.970
and yet as heavy as my weight should be.

880
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.470
Should be-- should--buzz--

881
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.530
Well ta'en,

882
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.400
and like a buzzard.

883
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.700
O slow-wing'd turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?

884
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.030
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

885
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:37.470
Come, come, you wasp, i' faith, you are too angry.

886
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:42.830
If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

887
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.730
My remedy is then to pluck it out.

888
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.670
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

889
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.800
Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?

890
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.600
In his tail.

891
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.800
In his tongue.

892
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.230
Whose tongue?

893
00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.230
Yours, if you talk of tails,

894
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.470
and so farewell.

895
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.270
What, with my tongue in your tail?

896
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.830
Nay, come again, good Kate.

897
00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.270
I am a gentleman.

898
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.600
That I'll try.

899
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.130
Mm-hmm.

900
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.400
I swear I'll cuff you if you strike again.

901
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.100
So may you lose your arms.

902
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.630
If you strike me, you are no gentleman,

903
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.900
and if no gentleman, why, then, no arms.

904
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.230
A herald, Kate?

905
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.400
Ooh, put me in thy books.

906
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.630
What is your crest?

907
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.930
A coxcomb?

908
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:46.730
A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

909
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.370
No cock of mine.

910
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.870
You crow too like a craven.

911
00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:01.370
Er-bock, bock, bock, bock.

912
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.230
Nay, come, Kate, come.

913
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.530
You must not look so sour.

914
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:09.670
It is my fashion when I see a crab.

915
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.970
Why, here's no crab, and therefore look not sour.

916
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.170
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

917
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.930
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

918
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.100
Bock, bock, bock, bock.

919
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.600
Then show it me.

920
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.600
Had I a glass, I would.

921
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.930
What, you mean my face?

922
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.530
Well aim'd of such a young one.

923
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.470
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

924
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.070
Yet you are wither'd.

925
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.300
'Tis with cares.

926
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.600
I care not.

927
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.070
Nay, hear you, Kate.

928
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.800
In sooth you scape not so.

929
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.400
I chafe you if I tarry.

930
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.130
Let me go!

931
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.270
No, not a whit.

932
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.900
I find you passing gentle.

933
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.770
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,

934
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.630
and now I find report a very liar,

935
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.430
for thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,

936
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:00.670
but slow in speech

937
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.330
yet sweet as springtime flowers.

938
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.100
Ah, thou canst not frown.

939
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.170
Thou canst not look askance

940
00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.000
nor bite the lip as angry wenches will,

941
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.030
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,

942
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:17.830
but thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,

943
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.270
with gentle conference, soft and affable.

944
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:29.700
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?

945
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.430
O slanderous world.

946
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:32.900
Kate, like the hazel-twig,

947
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.470
is straight and slender and as brown in hue

948
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.730
as hazelnuts and sweeter than the kernels.

949
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:38.870
Let me see thee walk.

950
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.430
Thou dost not halt.

951
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:45.100
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

952
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.370
Did e'er Dian so become a grove as Kate

953
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.230
this chamber with her princely gait?

954
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.100
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,

955
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.130
and then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful.

956
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.770
Where did you study all this goodly speech?

957
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:09.200
It is extempore, from my mother wit.

958
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.370
A witty mother...

959
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.770
witless else her son.

960
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.930
Am I not wise?

961
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.530
Yes; keep you warm.

962
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:28.700
Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharine, in thy bed,

963
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.970
and therefore,

964
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.470
setting all this chat aside,

965
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.600
thus in plain terms.

966
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.330
Your father hath consented that you shall be my wife,

967
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.530
your dowry 'greed on,

968
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.970
and will you, nill you,

969
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.630
I will marry you.

970
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.470
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,

971
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.270
for, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty--

972
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:54.930
thy beauty that doth make me like thee well--

973
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.770
thou must be married to no man but me,

974
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.900
for I am he am born to tame you, Kate,

975
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.600
and bring you from a wild Kate

976
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.930
to a Kate conformable as other household Kates.

977
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.100
Ahem.

978
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.230
Here comes your father.

979
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.330
Never make denial,

980
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.770
I must and will have Katharine to my wife.

981
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.730
Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

982
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.230
How but well, sir? How but well?

983
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.170
It were impossible I should speed amiss.

984
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.030
Why, how now, daughter Katharine?

985
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.300
In your dumps?

986
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.500
Call you me daughter?

987
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.630
Now, I promise you, you show a tender fatherly regard

988
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.270
to wish me wed to one half lunatic,

989
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.630
a madcap ruffian, and a swearing Jack

990
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.030
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

991
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.370
Bock, bock.

992
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.330
Father, 'tis thus,

993
00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.400
yourself and all the world that talk'd of her

994
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.630
have talk'd amiss of her.

995
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.770
Bock, bock.

996
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.330
If she be cursed, it is for policy,

997
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.130
for she's not froward but modest as the dove.

998
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.270
She is not hot but temperate as the morn.

999
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.700
For patience, she will prove a second Grissel

1000
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.230
and Roman Lucrece for her chastity;

1001
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.470
and to conclude, we have agreed so well together

1002
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.900
that upon Sunday is the wedding day.

1003
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.400
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1004
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.200
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

1005
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.400
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1006
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.800
Hark, Petruchio,

1007
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.630
she says she'll see thee hang'd first.

1008
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.000
Is this your speeding?

1009
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.630
Nay, then, good night our part.

1010
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.130
Ah, ha, ha, be patient, gentlemen.

1011
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:15.700
I choose her for myself.

1012
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.870
If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?

1013
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:25.000
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,

1014
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.970
that she shall still be cursed in company.

1015
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:32.070
Oh, I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe

1016
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.170
how much she loves me.

1017
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.400
O, the kindest Kate,

1018
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.030
she hung about my neck,

1019
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.900
and, kiss on kiss, she vied so fast,

1020
00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.130
protesting oath on oath,

1021
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.700
that in a twink she won me to her love.

1022
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.770
O, you are novices.

1023
00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.470
'Tis a world to see how tame,

1024
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.930
when men and women are alone,

1025
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.800
a meacock wretch can make the cursedest shrew.

1026
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.970
Give me thy hand, Kate.

1027
00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.630
I will unto Venice to buy apparel

1028
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:54.870
'gainst the wedding day.

1029
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.070
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests.

1030
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:01.100
I will be sure my Katharine will be fine.

1031
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:03.770
I know not what to say,

1032
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.370
but give me your hands.

1033
00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1034
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.870
God send you joy, Petruchio!

1035
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:13.070
Ah, ha, ha!

1036
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.200
'Tis a match.

1037
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.330
Amen, say we.

1038
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.430
We will be witnesses.

1039
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.530
Witnesses.

1040
00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.030
Father and wife and gentlemen,

1041
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.130
adieu.

1042
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.230
I will to Venice.

1043
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.500
Sunday comes apace.

1044
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.570
We will have rings and things and fine array,

1045
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.770
and kiss me, Kate.

1046
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.000
Ha!

1047
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.430
We will be married on Sunday.

1048
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.130
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1049
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.030
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

1050
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.570
Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part

1051
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.470
and venture madly on a desperate mart.

1052
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.830
'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you.

1053
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.870
'Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas.

1054
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.600
The gain I seek is quiet in the match.

1055
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.270
No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.

1056
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.800
But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter.

1057
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.370
Now is the day we long have looked for.

1058
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.330
I am your neighbor and was suitor first.

1059
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.970
And I am one that love Bianca

1060
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.600
more than words can witness or your thoughts can guess.

1061
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.900
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

1062
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:08.900
Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

1063
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.100
But thine doth fry.

1064
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.200
Skipper, stand back.

1065
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.470
'Tis age that nourisheth.

1066
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.730
Ah, but youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

1067
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.930
Content you, gentlemen.

1068
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.300
I will compound this strife.

1069
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.070
'Tis deeds must win the prize,

1070
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.500
and he of both that can assure my daughter greatest dower

1071
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.330
shall have my Bianca's love.

1072
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.970
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1073
00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:34.530
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1074
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.730
Oh, say, Signior Gremio, what can you assure her?

1075
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.370
Oh.

1076
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.030
First, as you know,

1077
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.330
my house within the city

1078
00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.630
is richly furnished with plate and gold,

1079
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.770
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands,

1080
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.570
my hangings all of Tyrian tapestry.

1081
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.470
In ivory coffers, I have stuff'd my crowns,

1082
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.700
in cypress chests, my arras counterpoints,

1083
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.100
costly apparel, tents, and canopies,

1084
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.500
fine linen,

1085
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.870
Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,

1086
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.930
valance of Venice gold in needlework,

1087
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.730
pewter and brass and all things

1088
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.570
that belong to house or housekeeping.

1089
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.730
Ahem.

1090
00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.870
Then, at my farm,

1091
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.900
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,

1092
00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.830
sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,

1093
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.770
and all things answerable to this portion.

1094
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.130
Myself am struck in years, I must confess,

1095
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.200
and if I die tomorrow, this is hers

1096
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.300
if, whilst I live, she will be only mine.

1097
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.930
That "only" came well in.

1098
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.470
Sir, list to me.

1099
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.600
I am my father's heir and only son.

1100
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.370
If I may have your daughter to my wife,

1101
00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.530
I'll leave her houses three or four as good

1102
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:54.730
within rich Pisa's walls

1103
00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.800
as any one Old Signior Gremio has in Padua

1104
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.930
beside 2,000 ducats by the year of fruitful land,

1105
00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.200
all which shall be her jointure.

1106
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.270
What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

1107
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.100
2,000 ducats by the year of land.

1108
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.530
My land amounts not to so much in all.

1109
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:16.730
That she shall have besides an argosy

1110
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.700
that now is lying in Marseilles' road.

1111
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.430
What, have I choked you with an argosy?

1112
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.730
Gremio, 'tis known my father

1113
00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.570
hath no less than 3 great argosies

1114
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.530
beside 2 galliasses and 12 tight galleys.

1115
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.730
These I will assure her

1116
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:37.330
and twice as much whate'er thou offer'st next.

1117
00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:39.370
Nay, I have offer'd all.

1118
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.900
I have no more,

1119
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.500
and she can have no more than all I have.

1120
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.300
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

1121
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.300
Why, then the maid is mine from all the world

1122
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.430
by your firm promise.

1123
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.600
Gremio is out-vied.

1124
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.330
I must confess, your offer is the best,

1125
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.900
and let your father make her the assurance,

1126
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.070
she is your own,

1127
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.300
else, you must pardon me,

1128
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.770
if you should die before him, where's her dower?

1129
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.000
That's but a cavil.

1130
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
He is old; I, young.

1131
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.330
And may not young men die as well as old?

1132
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.030
Well, gentlemen,

1133
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.430
I am thus resolved.

1134
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.870
On Sunday next, you know my daughter Katharine

1135
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.030
is to be married.

1136
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.130
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1137
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.700
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1138
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.070
Now, on the Sunday following shall Bianca be bride to you

1139
00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.800
if you make this assurance.

1140
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.370
If not, to Signior Gremio.

1141
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:39.330
And so, I take my leave...

1142
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.600
and thank you both.

1143
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.530
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1144
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.900
Adieu, good neighbor.

1145
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.470
Now I fear thee not.

1146
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.300
Sirrah young gamester,

1147
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.530
your father were a fool to give thee all

1148
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.000
and in his waning age set foot under thy table.

1149
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.300
Tut, a toy!

1150
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.830
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

1151
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.770
A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!

1152
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.230
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.

1153
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.830
'Tis in my head to do my master good.

1154
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.100
Oh, I see no reason but supposed Lucentio

1155
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.070
must get a father call'd "supposed Vincentio,"

1156
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.330
and that's a wonder.

1157
00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.030
Fathers commonly do get their children,

1158
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.200
but in this case of wooing,

1159
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.030
a child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning.

1160
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.400
Fiddler, forbear.

1161
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.770
You grow too forward, sir.

1162
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.730
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment

1163
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.770
her sister Katharine welcomed you withal?

1164
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.130
Ooh, but, wrangling pedant,

1165
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.230
this is the patroness of heavenly harmony.

1166
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:03.100
Then give me leave to have prerogative,

1167
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.970
and when in music, we have spent an hour,

1168
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.030
your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

1169
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.170
Preposterous ass that never read so far

1170
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.170
to know the cause why music was ordain'd.

1171
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.970
Was it not to refresh the mind of man

1172
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.300
after his studies or his usual pain?

1173
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.130
Then give me leave to read philosophy,

1174
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.370
and while I pause, serve in your harmony.

1175
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.570
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

1176
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:23.300
Oh, you--

1177
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.900
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong

1178
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.200
to strive for that which resteth in my choice.

1179
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.030
I am no breeching scholar in the schools.

1180
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.000
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times

1181
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.600
but learn my lessons as I please myself.

1182
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.470
And to cut off all strife, here sit we down.

1183
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.470
Ah.

1184
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.730
Take you your instrument, and play you the whiles.

1185
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.800
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

1186
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.770
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

1187
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:55.870
That will be never.

1188
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.030
Tune your instrument.

1189
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.970
Where left we last?

1190
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.800
Here, madam:

1191
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:11.600
"Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;

1192
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.300
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis."

1193
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.370
Construe them.

1194
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.170
"Hic ibat"--

1195
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.170
As I told you before--

1196
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:26.870
"Simois"--

1197
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.500
I am Lucentio--

1198
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.730
"Hic est"--

1199
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:34.230
son unto Vincentio of Pisa--

1200
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.330
"sigeia tellus"--

1201
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:41.330
disguised thus to get your love--

1202
00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.430
"Hic steterat"--

1203
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:46.270
and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing--

1204
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.730
"Priami"--

1205
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.530
is my man Tranio--

1206
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.030
"regia"--

1207
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:54.130
bearing my port--

1208
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.670
"celsa senis."

1209
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.730
that we might beguile the old pantaloon.

1210
00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.730
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

1211
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.000
O, let's hear.

1212
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.330
O fie, the treble jars.

1213
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.130
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

1214
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.430
Tsk.

1215
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.800
Now let me see if I can construe it.

1216
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.670
"Hic ibat Simois"--

1217
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.700
I know you not.

1218
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.470
"Hic est Sigeia tellus"--

1219
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.500
I trust you not.

1220
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.470
"Hic steterat Priami"--

1221
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:29.000
Take heed he hear us not.

1222
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.270
"regia"--

1223
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:31.570
Hmm.

1224
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.900
Presume not.

1225
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.300
"celsa senis."

1226
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.600
Despair not.

1227
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.800
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

1228
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.000
All but the base.

1229
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.330
The base is right.

1230
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.600
'Tis the base knave that jars.

1231
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.970
How fiery and forward our pedant is.

1232
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.700
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.

1233
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.370
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

1234
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.500
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

1235
00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.900
Mistrust it not,

1236
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.230
for, sure, Aeacides was Ajax,

1237
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.970
call'd so from his grandfather.

1238
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.800
I must believe my master, else, I promise you,

1239
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.730
I should be arguing still upon that doubt.

1240
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.600
But let it rest.

1241
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.670
Now, Licio, to you.

1242
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.170
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,

1243
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.630
that I have been thus pleasant with you both.

1244
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.770
You may go walk and give me leave a while, hmm?

1245
00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.100
My lessons make no music in three parts.

1246
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.370
Are you so formal, sir?

1247
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:33.900
Well, I must wait and watch withal,

1248
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.430
for but I be deceived,

1249
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.100
our fine musician groweth amorous.

1250
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.500
Madam, before you touch the instrument,

1251
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.830
to learn the order of my fingering,

1252
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.170
I must begin with rudiments of art,

1253
00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:48.800
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort,

1254
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.130
more pleasant, pithy, and effectual,

1255
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.730
than hath been taught by any of my trade;

1256
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:57.430
and there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

1257
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.570
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

1258
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.530
But read the gamut of Hortensio.

1259
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.430
Read it.

1260
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:13.100
"'Gamut'-- I am the ground of all accord--

1261
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.070
"'A re'-- to plead Hortensio's passion.

1262
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:19.630
"'B mi'-- Bianca, take him for thy lord--

1263
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:24.970
"'C fa ut'-- that loves with all affection.

1264
00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:28.700
"'D sol re'-- One clef, two notes have I.

1265
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:32.200
'E la mi'-- Show pity, or I die."

1266
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.330
Call you this gamut?

1267
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:37.230
I like it not:

1268
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.770
Old fashions please me best.

1269
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.600
I am not so nice as to change true rules

1270
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.930
for old inventions.

1271
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.430
Mistress,

1272
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.400
your father prays you, leave your books

1273
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.430
and help to dress your sister's chamber up.

1274
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.730
You know tomorrow is the wedding-day.

1275
00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:04.570
Farewell, sweet masters both.

1276
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.900
I must be gone.

1277
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900
Oh.

1278
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.430
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

1279
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:26.200
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.

1280
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.470
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.

1281
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.330
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble

1282
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:35.730
to cast thy wandering eyes on any stale,

1283
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.600
seize thee that list.

1284
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.700
If once I find thee ranging,

1285
00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.000
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

1286
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.070
Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day

1287
00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.370
that Katharina and Petruchio should be married,

1288
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:11.170
and yet we hear not of our son-in-law.

1289
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.300
What will be said?

1290
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.470
What mockery will it be

1291
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.670
to want the bridegroom when the priest attends

1292
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.100
to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?

1293
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.870
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?

1294
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:21.970
No shame but mine.

1295
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.400
I must, forsooth, be forced

1296
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.270
to give my hand opposed against my heart

1297
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:27.400
unto a mad-brained rudesby full of spleen

1298
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.730
who woos in haste and means to wed at leisure.

1299
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.370
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,

1300
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.300
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior,

1301
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.800
and to be noted for a merry man,

1302
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.100
he'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,

1303
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.600
make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns,

1304
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.400
yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.

1305
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.500
Now must the world point at poor Katharine

1306
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.830
and say, "Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,

1307
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.500
if it would please him come and marry her."

1308
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.730
Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.

1309
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.730
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well

1310
00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.700
whatever fortune stays him from his word.

1311
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.800
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise.

1312
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.870
Though he be merry, yet withal, he's honest.

1313
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.900
Would Katharine had never seen him though.

1314
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.500
Go, girl.

1315
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.030
I cannot blame thee now to weep,

1316
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.000
for such an injury would vex a very saint,

1317
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.300
much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.

1318
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.230
Master, master, news,

1319
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.070
and such old news as you never heard of.

1320
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:18.170
Is it new and old too?

1321
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.370
How may that be?

1322
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.670
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?

1323
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:22.770
Is he come?

1324
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:23.870
Why, no, sir.

1325
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:24.970
What then?

1326
00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.130
He's coming.

1327
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.370
When will he be here?

1328
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:29.400
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

1329
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.700
But say, what to thine old news?

1330
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.430
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat

1331
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.000
and an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned,

1332
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.070
a pair of boots that have been candle-cases,

1333
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.470
one buckled, another laced,

1334
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:42.400
an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armory with a broken hilt

1335
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.230
and chapeless with two broken points,

1336
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:46.170
his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle

1337
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:49.300
and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders

1338
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.870
and like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampas,

1339
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.100
infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,

1340
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.970
sped with spavins, rayed with yellows,

1341
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:58.570
past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers,

1342
00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:01.600
begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten,

1343
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.830
near-legged before and with a half-checked bit

1344
00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.430
and a headstall of sheep's leather

1345
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.870
which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling,

1346
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.200
hath been often burst and now repaired with knots;

1347
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.930
one girth six-times pieced and a woman's crupper of velure

1348
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:15.630
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs

1349
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:17.700
and here and there pieced with packthread.

1350
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.070
Who comes with him?

1351
00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:21.770
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse,

1352
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.070
with a linen stock on one leg

1353
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:24.800
and a kersey boot-hose on the other,

1354
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.670
gartered with a red and blue list, yeah;

1355
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.500
an old hat and "the humor of 40 fancies"

1356
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.870
pricked in't for a feather:

1357
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:31.930
a monster, a very monster in apparel,

1358
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:33.770
and not like a Christian footboy

1359
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:35.130
or a gentleman's lackey.

1360
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.270
'Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion,

1361
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.230
yet oftentimes, he goes but mean-apparell'd.

1362
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:45.570
I am glad he's comes, howsoe'er he comes.

1363
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:46.770
Why, sir, he comes not.

1364
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.930
Oh!

1365
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.730
Oh, didst thou not say he comes?

1366
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.030
Who? That Petruchio came?

1367
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.330
Ay, that Petruchio came!

1368
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.900
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

1369
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.000
Why, that's all one.

1370
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.100
Nay, by Saint Jamy,

1371
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.270
I hold you a penny,

1372
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:00.470
a horse and a man is more than one

1373
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:02.070
and yet not many.

1374
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.370
Where be these gallants?

1375
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:04.470
Who's at home?

1376
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:05.570
Ha, ha!

1377
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:10.100
You are welcome, sir.

1378
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.200
And yet I come not well.

1379
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.670
And yet you halt not.

1380
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:15.800
Not so well apparell'd as I wish you were.

1381
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.030
Were it not better, I should rush in thus.

1382
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.200
But where is Kate?

1383
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.670
Where is my lovely bride?

1384
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.530
How does my father?

1385
00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:26.830
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1386
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:28.470
Gentles, methinks you frown,

1387
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.530
and wherefore gaze this goodly company

1388
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.670
as if they saw some wondrous monument,

1389
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:35.200
some comet, or unusual prodigy?

1390
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:39.370
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.

1391
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.900
First, we were sad, fearing you would not come,

1392
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:46.570
now sadder that you come so unprovided.

1393
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:50.200
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,

1394
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.170
an eyesore to our solemn festival.

1395
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:53.830
And tell us what occasion of import

1396
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:55.870
hath all so long detain'd you from your wife

1397
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.730
and sent you hither so unlike yourself?

1398
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.670
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.

1399
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.870
Sufficeth, I am come to keep my word,

1400
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.800
though in some part enforced to digress,

1401
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.200
which, at more leisure, I shall so explain

1402
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.230
as you shall well be satisfied withal.

1403
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.000
But where is Kate?

1404
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.170
I stay too long from her.

1405
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.270
The morning wears.

1406
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:13.570
'Tis time we were at church.

1407
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.930
See not your bride in these unreverent robes.

1408
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.200
Go--go--go to my chamber.

1409
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.570
Put on clothes of mine.

1410
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:19.770
Not I, believe me.

1411
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:20.930
Thus, I'll visit her.

1412
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.270
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

1413
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.870
Good sooth, even so.

1414
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:26.370
Therefore, ha' done with words.

1415
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:30.730
To me she's married, not unto my clothes.

1416
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:32.500
Could I repair what she will wear in me

1417
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.470
as I can change these poor accoutrements,

1418
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.400
'twere well for me and better for my Kate.

1419
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1420
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.470
But what a fool am I to chat with you

1421
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.670
when I should bid good morrow to my bride

1422
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.170
and seal the title with a lovely kiss.

1423
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.170
Ah!

1424
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:53.070
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.

1425
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.830
We will persuade him, be it possible,

1426
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:56.500
put on better ere he go to church.

1427
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.530
I'll after him and see the event of this.

1428
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.630
But to her love concerneth us to add her father's liking

1429
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.430
which, to bring to pass, as I before unparted to your worship,

1430
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:11.630
I am to get a man.

1431
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:12.830
Eh?

1432
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.500
Whate'er he be, it skills not much.

1433
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.730
We'll fit him to our turn,

1434
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:17.300
and he shall be Vincentio of Pisa

1435
00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.870
and make assurance here in Padua

1436
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.630
of greater sums than I have promised.

1437
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.400
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope

1438
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.170
and marry sweet Bianca with consent.

1439
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.030
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster

1440
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:27.900
doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,

1441
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.100
'twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,

1442
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.400
which once perform'd-- let all the world say no--

1443
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.430
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.

1444
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.330
That by degrees we mean to look into

1445
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.200
and watch our vantage in this business.

1446
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.130
We'll overreach the graybeard, Gremio,

1447
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:41.870
the narrow-prying father, Minola,

1448
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.030
the quaint musician, amorous Licio

1449
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:47.600
all for my master's sake, Lucentio.

1450
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.470
Oh, Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

1451
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:53.900
Oh, as willingly as e'er I came from school.

1452
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.670
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

1453
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:57.830
Bridegroom say you?

1454
00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.630
'Tis a groom indeed, a grumbling groom,

1455
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.100
and that the girl shall find.

1456
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.500
Curseder than she?

1457
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.670
Why, it is impossible.

1458
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:07.230
Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

1459
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:10.800
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

1460
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.670
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.

1461
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.330
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio,

1462
01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:19.000
when the priest should ask if Katharine should be his wife,

1463
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.500
"Ay, by gogs-wouns," quoth he and swore so loud

1464
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.600
that, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book,

1465
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.900
and as he stoop'd again to take it up,

1466
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.800
this mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff

1467
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.870
that down fell priest and book and book and priest.

1468
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.770
"Now take them up," quoth he, "if any list."

1469
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.600
What said the wench when he rose again?

1470
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.200
Trembled and shook, for, why, he stamp'd and swore

1471
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.200
as if the vicar meant to cozen him.

1472
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.230
But after many ceremonies done, he calls for wine.

1473
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.870
"Her health," quoth he as if he had been aboard,

1474
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:55.570
carousing to his mates after a storm,

1475
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.100
quaff'd off the muscadel

1476
01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.270
and threw the sops all in the sexton's face,

1477
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.730
having no other reason

1478
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:04.630
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly

1479
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.570
and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.

1480
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.030
This done, he took the bride about the neck

1481
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:14.130
and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack

1482
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.930
that at the parting all the church did echo,

1483
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:21.170
and, I, seeing this came thence for very shame,

1484
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.370
and after me, I know, the rout is coming.

1485
01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.230
Such a mad marriage never was before.

1486
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:28.100
Hark, hark, I hear the minstrels play.

1487
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.430
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.

1488
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:32.170
I know you think to dine with me today

1489
01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.400
and have prepared great store of wedding cheer,

1490
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.230
but so it is my haste doth call me hence,

1491
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:38.270
and therefore, here I mean to take my leave.

1492
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:40.970
Is't possible you will away tonight?

1493
01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:43.100
I must away today, before night comes.

1494
01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.200
Make it no wonder.

1495
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.330
If you knew my business,

1496
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.470
you would entreat me rather go than stay.

1497
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:49.200
And, honest company, I thank you all

1498
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.930
that have beheld me give away myself

1499
01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.170
to this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.

1500
01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.570
Dine with my father.

1501
01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:57.170
Drink a health to me, for I must hence, and farewell to you all.

1502
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:59.130
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

1503
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:00.400
It may not be.

1504
01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.630
- Let me entreat you. - It cannot be.

1505
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:04.830
- Let me entreat you. - I am content.

1506
01:02:04.830 --> 01:02:06.070
You are content to stay?

1507
01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.530
I am content you shall entreat me stay, but yet not stay.

1508
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.730
Entreat me how you can.

1509
01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:10.930
Now, if you love me, stay.

1510
01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.170
Grumio, my horse.

1511
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.400
Ay, sir, they be ready.

1512
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.900
The oats have eaten the horses.

1513
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.300
Nay, then, do what thou canst.

1514
01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.500
I will not go today,

1515
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.630
no, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself.

1516
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:21.300
The door is open, sir.

1517
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.530
There lies your way.

1518
01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.030
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green.

1519
01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:29.100
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself!

1520
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.130
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom

1521
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:33.830
that take it on you at the first so roundly.

1522
01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:35.370
O Kate, content thee.

1523
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:36.570
Prithee, be not angry.

1524
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:39.630
I will be angry!

1525
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.070
What hast thou to do?

1526
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.770
Father, be quiet!

1527
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:45.700
He shall stay my leisure.

1528
01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.670
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

1529
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.770
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.

1530
01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:52.900
I see a woman may be made a fool

1531
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.470
if she had not a spirit to resist.

1532
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.970
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.

1533
01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:59.800
Obey the bride, you that attend on her.

1534
01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.630
Go to the feast, revel, and domineer,

1535
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:04.970
carouse full measure to her maidenhead,

1536
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:07.600
be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves,

1537
01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.430
but for my bonny Kate, she must with me.

1538
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:15.470
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret.

1539
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.970
I will be master of what is mine own.

1540
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:20.070
She is my goods, my chattels.

1541
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:21.830
She is my house, my household stuff,

1542
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:22.930
my field, my barn,

1543
01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:26.770
my horse, my ox, my ass, my--oh--anything;

1544
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.270
and here she stands.

1545
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:30.400
Touch her whoever dare.

1546
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.330
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he

1547
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:37.670
that stops my way in Padua.

1548
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:39.770
Grumio, draw forth thy weapon.

1549
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:41.000
We are beset with thieves!

1550
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.800
Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man.

1551
01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.370
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate.

1552
01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:49.800
I'll buckler thee against a million.

1553
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.830
Nay, let them go.

1554
01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:58.830
A couple of quiet ones.

1555
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:08.200
Went--went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

1556
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.000
Of all mad matches, never was the like.

1557
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.200
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

1558
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:19.400
Oh, that being mad herself, she's madly mated.

1559
01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.870
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

1560
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:31.500
Ho, neighbours and friends,

1561
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.170
though bride and bridegroom wants

1562
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:35.100
for to supply the places at the table,

1563
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:40.400
you know there want no junkets at the feast.

1564
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.530
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place,

1565
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:46.900
and let Bianca take her sister's room.

1566
01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:50.030
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

1567
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.800
She shall, Lucentio.

1568
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.730
Gentlemen, let's go.

1569
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:27.200
Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters,

1570
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.870
and all foul ways.

1571
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.800
Was ever a man so beaten?

1572
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.270
Was ever man so rayed?

1573
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:36.370
Was ever man so weary?

1574
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.170
I am sent before to make a fire,

1575
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:41.770
and they are coming after to warm them,

1576
01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:44.500
but I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself,

1577
01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.130
for considering the weather,

1578
01:05:46.130 --> 01:05:48.530
a taller man than I will take cold.

1579
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:56.730
Holla.

1580
01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200
Ho.

1581
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.270
Curtis!

1582
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:05.470
Who is that calls so coldly?

1583
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:07.000
A piece of ice.

1584
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.370
A fire, good Curtis.

1585
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.300
Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

1586
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.900
Ay, Curtis, ay, and therefore fire, fire.

1587
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.500
Cast on no water.

1588
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.000
Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?

1589
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.530
She was, good Curtis, before this frost,

1590
01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:20.870
but wilt thou make a fire,

1591
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.830
or shall I complain on thee to our mistress

1592
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:24.800
for being slow in thy hot office?

1593
01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.200
I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

1594
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.470
A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine,

1595
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:32.730
and therefore, fire.

1596
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.130
Do thy duty, and have thy duty,

1597
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:36.630
for my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

1598
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.230
There's fire ready.

1599
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.900
Therefore, good Grumio, the news.

1600
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.270
Why, "Jack, boy; ho, boy," and as much news as I wilt.

1601
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.200
Come, you are so full of cony-catching.

1602
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.700
And therefore fire, for I have caught extreme cold.

1603
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.870
Where's the cook?

1604
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:57.630
Is supper ready, the house trimmed,

1605
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.930
rushes strewed, cobwebs swept?

1606
01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:01.870
Carpets laid, and everything in order?

1607
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:03.030
All ready.

1608
01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:05.730
Therefore, good Grumio, I pray thee, the news.

1609
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.930
First, know my horse is tired,

1610
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.000
my master and mistress fallen out.

1611
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.230
How?

1612
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:13.900
Out of their saddles into the dirt.

1613
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.530
Thereby hangs a tale.

1614
01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.930
Let's hear it, good Grumio.

1615
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.270
Lend thine ear.

1616
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:20.370
Here.

1617
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.600
There.

1618
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.470
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

1619
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:25.500
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale,

1620
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.370
and this cuff was but to knock at your ear

1621
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.630
and beseech it listening.

1622
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:30.030
Now I begin.

1623
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:33.100
Imprimis, we came down a foul hill,

1624
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.330
my master riding behind my mistress--

1625
01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:36.500
Both of one horse?

1626
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.670
What's that to thee?

1627
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.070
Why, a horse.

1628
01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:43.470
Tell thou the tale, but hadst thou not crossed me,

1629
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:45.530
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell,

1630
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.170
and she under her horse.

1631
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.930
Thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place,

1632
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.170
how she was bemoiled,

1633
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.200
how he left her with the horse upon her,

1634
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.170
how he beat me because her horse stumbled,

1635
01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:58.100
how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me,

1636
01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.270
how he swore, how she prayed that never prayed before,

1637
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:04.170
how I cried, how the horses ran away,

1638
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:05.730
how her bridle was burst,

1639
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.570
how I lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory

1640
01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.770
which now shall die in oblivion

1641
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:13.370
and thou return unexperienced to the grave.

1642
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:15.600
By this reckoning, he is more shrew than she.

1643
01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.670
Ay, and that thou and the proudest of you all

1644
01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:19.970
shall find when he comes home,

1645
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.970
but what talk I of this?

1646
01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:27.430
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,

1647
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.200
Walter, Sugarsop, and the rest.

1648
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.400
Are they ready?

1649
01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.530
They are.

1650
01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:32.730
Call them forth.

1651
01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:33.930
Do you hear, ho?

1652
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.330
You must meet my master to countenance my mistress.

1653
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:37.500
She has a face of her own.

1654
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.730
Who knows not that?

1655
01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:41.430
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.

1656
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:42.900
I call them forth to credit her.

1657
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.630
She comes to borrow nothing of them.

1658
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:46.330
Welcome home, Grumio.

1659
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.430
How now, Grumio.

1660
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:48.530
What, Grumio.

1661
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:49.700
How now, old lad?

1662
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:54.700
Welcome, you--how now, you-- what, you--fellow, you--

1663
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:56.070
and thus much for greeting.

1664
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.200
Now, my spruce companions,

1665
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.870
is all ready and all things neat?

1666
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:09.100
All things is ready.

1667
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:10.300
How near is our master?

1668
01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.030
E'en at hand, and therefore be not--

1669
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:13.270
cock's passion, silence!

1670
01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:14.570
I hear my master.

1671
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:17.170
What, no man at door to hold my stirrup nor to take my horse?

1672
01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:19.170
- Where is Nathaniel? - Here, sir.

1673
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.170
- Gregory? - Here, sir.

1674
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:23.400
- Philip? - Here, sir.

1675
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.500
Here, sir; here, sir; here, sir; here, sir!

1676
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.800
You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms.

1677
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:34.130
What, no attendance?

1678
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:35.430
No regard?

1679
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.330
No duty?

1680
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.130
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

1681
01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:50.230
Here, sir, as foolish as I was before.

1682
01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:55.270
You peasant swain, you whoreson malt-horse drudge!

1683
01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.870
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park

1684
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.070
and bring along these rascal knaves with thee?

1685
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:04.100
Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made.

1686
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.300
Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel,

1687
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.330
and there was no link to colour Peter's hat,

1688
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.630
and Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing.

1689
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.930
There was none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory.

1690
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:15.530
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly, yet as they are,

1691
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.100
here are they come to meet you, sir!

1692
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:22.830
Shh!

1693
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.970
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.

1694
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.700
Where is the life that late I led--

1695
01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.030
Where are those--

1696
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:37.300
Sit down, Kate, and welcome.

1697
01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:38.500
Food!

1698
01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.170
Food, food, food!

1699
01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:42.730
Why, when, I say?

1700
01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.700
Er-bock, bock, bock, bock.

1701
01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.400
Er-bock, bock, bock.

1702
01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.600
Bock, bock, bock.

1703
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.430
Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.

1704
01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:00.300
Off with my boots, you rogues!

1705
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.430
You villains, when?

1706
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:04.770
It was the friar of orders gray,

1707
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:08.130
an he forth walked on his way.

1708
01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.330
Ouch, you rogue,

1709
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.830
you pluck my foot awry.

1710
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:16.170
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.

1711
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:17.270
Be merry, Kate.

1712
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.370
Some water, here; what, ho.

1713
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:23.100
Where's my spaniel Troilus?

1714
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.130
Sirrah, get you hence,

1715
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:31.870
and bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither--

1716
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:34.970
one, Kate, that you must kiss and be acquainted with.

1717
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.730
Where are my slippers?

1718
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.030
Shall I have some water?

1719
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.030
Ugh.

1720
01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:53.300
Come, Kate, and wash and welcome heart--oh!

1721
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.800
Whoreson villain!

1722
01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.970
Will you let it fall?

1723
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:57.230
Patience, I pray you.

1724
01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:58.430
'Twas a fault unwilling.

1725
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:03.430
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave.

1726
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:05.670
Come, Kate, sit down.

1727
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:06.830
I know you have a stomach.

1728
01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.530
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate?

1729
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.670
Or else shall I?

1730
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:15.700
What's this?

1731
01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.700
Mutton?

1732
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.630
Ay.

1733
01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:20.800
Who brought it?

1734
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.930
I.

1735
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.170
'Tis burnt--

1736
01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:24.370
Ah, ah!

1737
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.370
And so is all the meat.

1738
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:31.830
What dogs are these?

1739
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.300
Where is the rascal cook?

1740
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.070
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,

1741
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:42.300
and serve it thus to me that love it not?

1742
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.630
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all...

1743
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.570
you heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves.

1744
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:54.830
Do you grumble?

1745
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.570
I'll be with you straight.

1746
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:59.130
I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet.

1747
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.170
The meat was well if you were so contented.

1748
01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:04.200
I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt!

1749
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.530
Ah, ha, hoo, hoo!

1750
01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:06.830
Shh!

1751
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:10.170
And dried away, and I expressly am forbid to touch it,

1752
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:14.130
for it engenders choler, planteth anger,

1753
01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:16.970
and better 'twere that both of us did fast--

1754
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.200
since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric--

1755
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.830
than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.

1756
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:24.900
Uck.

1757
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.170
Be patient.

1758
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:28.100
Tomorrow 't shall be mended,

1759
01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:32.600
and for this night, we'll fast for company.

1760
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:38.300
Yeeearghhh!

1761
01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:43.200
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

1762
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.300
Didst ever see the like?

1763
01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.930
He kills her in her own humor.

1764
01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.670
Where is he?

1765
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:33.970
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her

1766
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:38.570
and rails and swears and rates that she, poor soul,

1767
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:41.400
knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,

1768
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.500
and sits as one new-risen from a dream.

1769
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.300
Away, away, for he is coming hither.

1770
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.330
Thus have I politicly begun my reign...

1771
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:25.270
and 'tis my hope to end successfully.

1772
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:36.200
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty...

1773
01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:41.030
until she stoop, she must not be full-gorged,

1774
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:44.000
for then she never looks upon her lure.

1775
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:51.470
Another way I have to man my haggard,

1776
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:55.130
to make her come and know her keeper's call--

1777
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:59.170
that is, to watch her as we watch these kites

1778
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:04.130
that bate and beat and will not be obedient.

1779
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.630
She eat no meat today nor none shall eat.

1780
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:15.400
Last night, she slept not nor tonight she shall not.

1781
01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:20.470
As with the meat,

1782
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:28.270
some undeserved fault I'll find about the making of the bed,

1783
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:31.970
and here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,

1784
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:34.600
this way the coverlet, another way the sheets.

1785
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.770
Ay, and amid this hurly, I intend that all is done

1786
01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:42.970
in reverend care of her,

1787
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:47.300
and in conclusion, she shall watch all night,

1788
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:54.700
and if she chance to nod, I'll rail and brawl

1789
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.530
and with the clamor keep her still awake.

1790
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.970
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness,

1791
01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:11.430
and thus, I'll curb her mad and headstrong humor.

1792
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.670
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,

1793
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:21.100
now let him speak.

1794
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:25.500
'Tis charity to show.

1795
01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:31.200
Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca

1796
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.030
doth fancy any other but Lucentio?

1797
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:35.470
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

1798
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.430
Sir, to satisfy you in what I said,

1799
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.400
stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

1800
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:51.600
Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

1801
01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.970
What, sir, read you?

1802
01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.230
First resolve me that.

1803
01:18:55.230 --> 01:19:00.300
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

1804
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.430
And may you prove, sir, master of your art.

1805
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:07.830
While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart.

1806
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:22.570
Quick proceeders, marry.

1807
01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:24.270
Now, tell me, I pray,

1808
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:26.470
you that durst swear at your mistress Bianca

1809
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.530
loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.

1810
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:31.770
Despiteful love, unconstant womankind.

1811
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:34.070
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

1812
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.400
Mistake no more.

1813
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.230
I am not Licio nor a musician as I seem to be

1814
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:40.300
but one that scorn to live in this disguise

1815
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.030
for such a one as leaves a gentleman

1816
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:43.630
and makes a god of such a cullion.

1817
01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:45.730
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

1818
01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:49.130
Signior Hortensio, I have often heard

1819
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.400
of your entire affection to Bianca,

1820
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.700
and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,

1821
01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.230
I will with you if you be so contented

1822
01:19:56.230 --> 01:20:00.130
forswear Bianca and her love forever.

1823
01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.500
O, see how they kiss and court.

1824
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.470
Signior Lucentio, here is my hand,

1825
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:05.800
and here I firmly vow

1826
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.700
never to woo her no more but do forswear her

1827
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.530
as one unworthy all the former favors

1828
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:12.500
that I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

1829
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.700
And here I take the unfeigned oath

1830
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.470
never to marry with her though she would entreat.

1831
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.000
Fie on her.

1832
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.070
O, see how beastly she doth court him.

1833
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:24.470
O, would all the world but he had quite forsworn.

1834
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:27.970
For me, that I may surely keep my vow,

1835
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:30.030
I will be married to a wealthy widow

1836
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:32.770
ere three days pass that hath as long loved me

1837
01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:35.600
as I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.

1838
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.970
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.

1839
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:40.230
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,

1840
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:41.530
shall win my love,

1841
01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:45.200
and so I take my leave in resolution as I swore before.

1842
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.330
Resolution-- resolution--

1843
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:52.630
Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace

1844
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:54.470
as 'longeth to a lover's blessed case.

1845
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.870
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,

1846
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.300
and have forsworn you with Hortensio.

1847
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.530
Tranio, you jest.

1848
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:03.370
What, have you both forsworn me?

1849
01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:04.800
Mistress, we have.

1850
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.070
Then we are rid of Licio.

1851
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:07.830
I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now

1852
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.670
that shall be wooed and wedded in a day.

1853
01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:10.770
God give him joy.

1854
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:11.870
Ay, and he'll tame her.

1855
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:13.030
He says so, Tranio.

1856
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.970
Faith, he is gone unto the taming school.

1857
01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.200
The taming school?

1858
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.470
Is there such a place?

1859
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.430
Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master

1860
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:21.100
that teacheth tricks 11 and 20 long

1861
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.330
to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

1862
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:25.170
Master, master, I have watch'd so long

1863
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:26.570
that I am dog-weary, ain' I?

1864
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:27.770
But at last I spied

1865
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:30.730
an ancient angel coming down the hill will serve a turn.

1866
01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.130
What is he, Biondello?

1867
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.430
Master, a mercatante or a pedant, I know not what,

1868
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:36.670
but formal in apparel, in gait, and countenance

1869
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:37.930
surely like a father.

1870
01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:39.100
What of him, Tranio?

1871
01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.270
If he be credulous and trust my tale,

1872
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:43.930
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio

1873
01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.930
and give assurance to Baptista Minola

1874
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:47.570
as if he were the right Vincentio.

1875
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.430
Take in your love, and then let me alone.

1876
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.570
Look, Tranio.

1877
01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:56.670
God save you, sir.

1878
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.030
Ah, and you, sir.

1879
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:59.200
You are welcome.

1880
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.800
Travel you far on?

1881
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.170
Or are you at the farthest?

1882
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:05.500
Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,

1883
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.430
but then up farther, and as far as Rome,

1884
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:13.500
and so to Tripoli if God lend me life.

1885
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.300
What countryman, I pray?

1886
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.500
Ah, of Mantua.

1887
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.770
Mantua, sir?

1888
01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:22.130
Marry, God forbid.

1889
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:24.230
And come to Padua careless of your life?

1890
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:25.600
My life, sir?

1891
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.800
How, I pray? For that goes hard.

1892
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800
Ha, ha, ha.

1893
01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:34.800
'Tis death for anyone in Mantua to come to Padua.

1894
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.000
Oh.

1895
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.200
Know you not the cause?

1896
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.370
Oh, ah, ah--

1897
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.500
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,

1898
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.630
for private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,

1899
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.600
hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly.

1900
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.730
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,

1901
01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:48.930
you might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

1902
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.670
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,

1903
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:52.430
for I have bills for money by exchange

1904
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:54.400
from Florence and must here deliver them.

1905
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.470
Well, sir, to do you courtesy,

1906
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.630
this will I do, and this I will advise you--

1907
01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:02.130
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

1908
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:03.870
Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,

1909
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.100
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

1910
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.430
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1911
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.800
Among them know you one Vincentio?

1912
01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.470
I know him not, but I have heard of him,

1913
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:16.130
a merchant of incomparable wealth.

1914
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:19.370
He is my father, sir, and sooth to say

1915
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.470
in countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

1916
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:23.530
As much as an apple doth an oyster and all one.

1917
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:25.400
To save your life in this extremity,

1918
01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.230
This favor will I do you for his sake,

1919
01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:29.930
and think it not the worst of all your fortunes

1920
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:31.730
that you are like to Sir Vincentio.

1921
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:38.100
His name and credit shall you undertake,

1922
01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.270
and in my house, you shall be friendly lodged.

1923
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:42.430
Look that you take upon you as you should.

1924
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:43.800
You understand me, sir?

1925
01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:44.900
Ah, ah, well--

1926
01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.070
So shall you stay

1927
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:48.130
till you have done your business in the city.

1928
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:50.800
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

1929
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.570
O sir, I do and will repute you ever

1930
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:55.770
the patron of my life and liberty.

1931
01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:57.600
Then go with me to make the matter good.

1932
01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.570
This, by the way, I let you understand:

1933
01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:01.830
my father is here look'd for every day

1934
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:04.130
to pass assurance of a dower in marriage

1935
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:06.200
'twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here.

1936
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.970
In all these circumstances, I'll instruct you.

1937
01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:11.870
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

1938
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:13.730
Yeah, yeah, well-- ha, ha, ha, ha.

1939
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:21.830
Come away.

1940
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:22.830
Oh.

1941
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:33.730
No, no, I dare not for my life.

1942
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:38.330
The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.

1943
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:40.630
What, did he marry me to famish me?

1944
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:45.000
Beggars that come unto my father's door

1945
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.570
upon entreaty have a present alms.

1946
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:51.170
If not, elsewhere, they meet with charity,

1947
01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:55.170
but I, who never knew how to entreat

1948
01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:58.230
nor never needed that I should entreat,

1949
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:03.270
am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,

1950
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:06.770
with oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed,

1951
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:11.400
and that which spites me more than all these wrongs,

1952
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.970
he does it under name of perfect love

1953
01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:16.900
as who should say if I should sleep or eat

1954
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.100
'twere deadly sickness or else present death.

1955
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.530
Oh.

1956
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:27.170
I prithee, go, and get me some repast.

1957
01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:31.630
I care not what so it be wholesome food.

1958
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:36.400
What say you to a neat's foot?

1959
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.530
'Tis passing good.

1960
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:41.800
I prithee, let me have it.

1961
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.030
I fear it is too choleric a meat.

1962
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:50.800
How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

1963
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.000
I like it well.

1964
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.830
Good Grumio, fetch it me.

1965
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:57.070
I cannot tell.

1966
01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:00.400
I fear it is choleric.

1967
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.470
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

1968
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.800
A dish that I do love to feed upon.

1969
01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.800
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

1970
01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.000
Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

1971
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.430
Ah, now, that you shall not.

1972
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:15.070
You shall have the mustard, or you get no beef of Grumio.

1973
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:17.500
Then both, or one, or anything thou wilt.

1974
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.100
Why then, the mustard without the beef.

1975
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:25.700
Go, get thee gone, thou false, deluding slave,

1976
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.970
that feed'st me with the very name of meat!

1977
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:31.970
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you

1978
01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:35.130
that triumph thus upon my misery!

1979
01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:40.630
Go, get thee gone, I say!

1980
01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:42.600
How fares my Kate?

1981
01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.830
What, sweeting, all amort?

1982
01:26:44.830 --> 01:26:46.600
Mistress, what cheer?

1983
01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.430
Faith, as cold as can be.

1984
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:50.670
Pluck up thy spirits.

1985
01:26:50.670 --> 01:26:51.970
Look cheerfully upon me.

1986
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:54.400
Here, love, thou see'st how diligent I am

1987
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.430
to dress thy meat myself and bring it thee?

1988
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:59.130
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.

1989
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:04.970
What, not a word?

1990
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.030
Nay, then thou lovest it not,

1991
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:09.270
and all my pains is sorted to no proof.

1992
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:10.630
Here, take away this dish.

1993
01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:13.600
I pray you, let it stand.

1994
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:15.630
The poorest service is repaid with thanks,

1995
01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:18.200
and so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

1996
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.500
I thank you, sir.

1997
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.570
Signior Petruchio, fie.

1998
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:24.730
You are to blame.

1999
01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:27.100
Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

2000
01:27:31.230 --> 01:27:34.870
Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.

2001
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:36.930
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart.

2002
01:27:36.930 --> 01:27:39.770
Kate, eat apace, and now, my honey love,

2003
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:41.700
will we return unto thy father's house

2004
01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.900
and revel it as bravely as the best

2005
01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:47.400
with silken coats and caps and golden rings

2006
01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.170
and ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things

2007
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:55.900
and scarfs and fans and double change of bravery

2008
01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:59.000
and amber bracelets, beads, and all this knavery.

2009
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.070
What?

2010
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:24.370
Hast thou dined?

2011
01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.500
The tailor stays thy leisure

2012
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:29.300
to deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.

2013
01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.270
Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments.

2014
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:32.270
Lay forth the gown.

2015
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.500
Ah, what news with you, sir?

2016
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.200
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

2017
01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.000
Why, this was molded on a porringer,

2018
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.600
a velvet dish.

2019
01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.700
Tsk, tsk.

2020
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:53.770
'Tis lewd and filthy.

2021
01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:56.830
Why, 'tis a walnut or a cockleshell,

2022
01:28:56.830 --> 01:29:00.770
a knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap.

2023
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:02.800
Away with it.

2024
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.170
Come, let me have a bigger.

2025
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.800
I'll have no bigger.

2026
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.900
This doth fit the time,

2027
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.830
and gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

2028
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:10.800
When you are gentle, you shall have one too

2029
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.900
and not till then, hmm?

2030
01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.200
That will not be in haste.

2031
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.300
Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,

2032
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.470
and speak I will!

2033
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:18.200
I am no child, no babe!

2034
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.130
Your betters have endured me say my mind,

2035
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:22.100
and if you cannot, best you stop your ears.

2036
01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.170
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,

2037
01:29:24.170 --> 01:29:26.130
or else my heart concealing it will break,

2038
01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:27.730
and rather than it shall,

2039
01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.570
I will be free even to the uttermost

2040
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:33.070
as I please in words!

2041
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:34.600
Why, thou say'st true!

2042
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.430
It is a paltry cap,

2043
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:40.470
a custard coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.

2044
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.030
I love thee well in that thou likest it not.

2045
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:47.200
Love me or love me not, I like the cap,

2046
01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.530
and it I will have, or I will have none!

2047
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.770
Thy gown?

2048
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:53.970
Why, ay.

2049
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:55.970
Come, tailor, let us see't.

2050
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.600
Oh.

2051
01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.170
O mercy, God.

2052
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:07.630
What masquing stuff is here?

2053
01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:08.930
What's this?

2054
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:10.700
A sleeve?

2055
01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.570
'Tis like a demi-cannon.

2056
01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:16.230
What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?

2057
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.430
Here's snip and nip and cut and stitch and slash

2058
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:21.270
like to a censer in a barber's shop.

2059
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:24.700
Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

2060
01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:27.070
I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.

2061
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:28.670
You bid me make it orderly and well

2062
01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:30.500
according to the fashion and the time.

2063
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.200
Marry, and did, but if you be remember'd,

2064
01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.800
I did not bid you mar it to the time.

2065
01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.470
Go, hop me over every kennel home,

2066
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:39.400
for you shall hop without my custom, sir.

2067
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.600
I'll none of it.

2068
01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.900
Hence, make your best of it.

2069
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:43.670
I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,

2070
01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:47.430
more quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.

2071
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:49.670
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

2072
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:52.500
Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.

2073
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.770
She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.

2074
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:58.570
Monstrous arrogance.

2075
01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:02.070
Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,

2076
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:04.730
thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail,

2077
01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:09.330
flea, thou nit, thou winter cricket, thou.

2078
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:13.030
Braved in my own house with a skein of thread?

2079
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.530
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,

2080
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:18.370
or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard

2081
01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:20.700
as thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest.

2082
01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.870
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.

2083
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.200
Your worship is deceived.

2084
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.530
The gown is made just as my master made direction.

2085
01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:28.400
Grumio gave order how it should be done.

2086
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.270
I gave him no order. I gave him the stuff.

2087
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:32.130
But how did you desire it should be made?

2088
01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:33.800
Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

2089
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.600
But did you not request to have it cut?

2090
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.530
Thou hast faced many things. Face not me.

2091
01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:39.400
Thou hast braved many men. Brave not me.

2092
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.170
I will neither be faced nor braved.

2093
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:43.400
I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown,

2094
01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.130
but I did not bid him cut it to pieces.

2095
01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:46.770
Ergo, thou liest.

2096
01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:49.000
Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.

2097
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.200
Read it.

2098
01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.270
The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

2099
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:54.000
"Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown"--

2100
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.970
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown,

2101
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:57.200
sew me in the skirts of it,

2102
01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.430
and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread.

2103
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:00.730
I said a gown.

2104
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:01.930
Proceed.

2105
01:32:01.930 --> 01:32:04.500
- "with a small-compassed cape"-- - I confess the cape.

2106
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.830
- "with a trunk sleeve"-- - I confess two sleeves.

2107
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:08.230
"the sleeves curiously cut."

2108
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.470
Ay, there's the villainy.

2109
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:10.770
Error i' the bill, sir.

2110
01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:13.430
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sewn up again,

2111
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:14.830
and that, I'll prove upon thee

2112
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:17.030
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.

2113
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:18.230
This is true that I say,

2114
01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:21.000
an I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it.

2115
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.730
Take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.

2116
01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:26.200
God-a-mercy, Grumio, then shall he have no odds.

2117
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.900
Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

2118
01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.230
You are i' the right, sir.

2119
01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:32.530
It is for my mistress.

2120
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:34.270
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

2121
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:35.670
Villain, not for thy life.

2122
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:37.930
Take up my mistress' gown for thy master's use.

2123
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:39.770
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

2124
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:42.130
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for.

2125
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:45.170
Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use.

2126
01:32:45.170 --> 01:32:48.200
Ha, ha, ha.

2127
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.100
Hortensio...

2128
01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:54.200
say thou wilt see the tailor paid.

2129
01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.300
Go take it hence, begone, and say no more!

2130
01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.970
Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow.

2131
01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.170
Take no unkindness of his hasty words.

2132
01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:02.470
Ah, ah, ah--

2133
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:03.700
Away, I say.

2134
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.170
Um, uh--

2135
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:07.400
Commend me to thy master.

2136
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:11.970
Well, come, my Kate.

2137
01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:13.200
We will unto your father's

2138
01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.730
even in these honest, mean habiliments.

2139
01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:20.730
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor...

2140
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:34.030
for 'tis the mind that makes the body rich.

2141
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:36.400
As the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,

2142
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.370
so honour peereth in the meanest habit.

2143
01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:42.430
What, is the jay more precious than the lark

2144
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:44.370
because his fathers are more beautiful?

2145
01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:46.470
Or is the adder better than the eel

2146
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:50.600
because his painted skin contents the eye?

2147
01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.270
O, no, good Kate, neither art thou the worse

2148
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:55.970
for this poor furniture and mean array.

2149
01:33:55.970 --> 01:34:02.300
If thou account'st it shame, lay it on me,

2150
01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.270
and therefore, frolic.

2151
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:05.530
We will hence forthwith

2152
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:07.570
to feast and sport us at thy father's house.

2153
01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:09.930
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him,

2154
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:11.870
and bring our horses unto Long-lane end.

2155
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:14.700
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.

2156
01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.570
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,

2157
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:19.530
and well we may come there by dinnertime.

2158
01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:22.170
I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two.

2159
01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:24.770
It 'twill be supper time ere you come there.

2160
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:28.200
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.

2161
01:34:30.930 --> 01:34:37.000
Look, what I speak or do or think to do,

2162
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.230
you are still crossing it.

2163
01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:41.070
Sirs, let't alone.

2164
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:44.230
I will not go today, and ere I do,

2165
01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:46.500
it shall be what o'clock I say it is.

2166
01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:15.130
Sir, this is the house.

2167
01:35:15.130 --> 01:35:16.600
Please it you that I call?

2168
01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.700
Ay, sir, what else?

2169
01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:20.170
And but I be deceived,

2170
01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:24.500
Signior Baptista may remember me, near 20 years ago in Genoa

2171
01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.800
where we were lodger sat the Pegasus.

2172
01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.500
'Tis well, and hold your own in any case

2173
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.700
with such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

2174
01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:30.900
I warrant you.

2175
01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:32.700
But, sir, here comes your boy.

2176
01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.930
'Twere good he were school'd.

2177
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:35.100
Fear you not him.

2178
01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.100
Sirrah Biondello,

2179
01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:37.230
now do your duty throughly, I advise you.

2180
01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:39.030
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

2181
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:40.370
Tut, fear not me.

2182
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:42.330
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

2183
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:44.200
I told him that your father was at Venice

2184
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.300
and that you look'd for him this day in Padua.

2185
01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.570
Thou'rt a tall fellow.

2186
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:49.270
Hold thee that to drink.

2187
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.130
Here comes Baptista.

2188
01:35:53.130 --> 01:35:54.600
Set your countenance, sir.

2189
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.100
Signior Baptista, you are happily met.

2190
01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.970
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.

2191
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:03.800
I pray you, stand good father to me now.

2192
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.900
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

2193
01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.170
Soft son.

2194
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:08.630
Sir, by your leave,

2195
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:12.700
uh, ah, having come to Padua to gather in some debts,

2196
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.030
my son Lucentio made me acquainted

2197
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:19.830
with a weighty cause of love between your daughter and himself,

2198
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:22.230
and for the good report I hear of you

2199
01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:25.000
and for the love he beareth to your daughter--

2200
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.970
and she to him--

2201
01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:30.100
to stay him not too long,

2202
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.000
I am content in a good father's care,

2203
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.830
to have him match'd,

2204
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:36.530
and if you please to like no worse than I,

2205
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:41.670
upon some agreement, me shall you find ready and willing

2206
01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:43.830
with one consent to have her so bestow'd,

2207
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:45.670
for curious I cannot be with you,

2208
01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:48.330
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

2209
01:36:50.770 --> 01:36:54.470
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say.

2210
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:56.800
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.

2211
01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.030
Right true it is,

2212
01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:00.170
your son Lucentio here doth love my daughter

2213
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:01.400
and she loveth him,

2214
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.930
or both dissemble deeply their affections--

2215
01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:05.730
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2216
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:07.770
And therefore, if you say no more than this,

2217
01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:09.630
that like a father you will deal with him

2218
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:11.570
and pass my daughter a sufficient dower,

2219
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.170
the match is made, and all is done.

2220
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:16.530
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

2221
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.700
Ah, well--

2222
01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.270
I thank you, sir.

2223
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:20.900
Where then do you know best

2224
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.870
we be affied and such assurance ta'en

2225
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.000
as shall with either part's agreement stand?

2226
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.730
Not in my house, Lucentio, for, you know,

2227
01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:29.900
pitchers have ears, and I have many servants.

2228
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.870
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still,

2229
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:33.700
and happily, we might be interrupted.

2230
01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.430
Then at my lodging,

2231
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:37.770
an it like you, there doth my father lie,

2232
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.030
and there, this night,

2233
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:42.300
we'll pass the business privately and well.

2234
01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.800
Send for your daughter by your servant here.

2235
01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.900
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.

2236
01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.130
Ay.

2237
01:37:48.130 --> 01:37:50.270
The worst is this, that at so slender warning,

2238
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:52.970
you are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

2239
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.300
It likes me well.

2240
01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.570
Cambio, get you home,

2241
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.430
and bid Bianca make her ready straight,

2242
01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.430
and if you will, tell what hath happened.

2243
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:03.170
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua

2244
01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:07.030
and how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

2245
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:08.900
I pray the gods she may with all my heart.

2246
01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.600
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.

2247
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.070
Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?

2248
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.200
Welcome.

2249
01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.200
One mess is like to be your cheer.

2250
01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.130
Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.

2251
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:24.600
I'll follow you.

2252
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:38.900
Cambio.

2253
01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:40.330
What sayest thou, Biondello?

2254
01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:42.270
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

2255
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:43.470
Biondello, what of that?

2256
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:45.430
Faith, nothing but has left me here behind

2257
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:48.000
to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

2258
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.300
I pray thee, moralize them.

2259
01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.500
Then thus.

2260
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.630
Baptista is safe,

2261
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:54.100
talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.

2262
01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:55.400
And what of him?

2263
01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.700
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

2264
01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:58.830
And then?

2265
01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:00.670
The old priest of Saint Luke's church

2266
01:39:00.670 --> 01:39:02.130
is at your command at all hours.

2267
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:03.400
And what of all this?

2268
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.630
I cannot tell,

2269
01:39:04.630 --> 01:39:07.200
expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance.

2270
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.500
Take you assurance of her--

2271
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.900
"Cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum"--in't, eh?

2272
01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:14.430
To the church, take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.

2273
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:17.270
Now, if this be not that you look for, I have no more to say,

2274
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:19.230
but bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.

2275
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:20.470
Hearest thou, Biondello?

2276
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:21.570
I cannot tarry.

2277
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:23.330
I knew a wench married in an afternoon

2278
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.830
as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit,

2279
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:27.670
and so may you, sir, and so, adieu, sir.

2280
01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:29.970
My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke's,

2281
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:31.930
to bid the priest be ready to come against

2282
01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:33.300
you come with your appendix.

2283
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.070
I may, and will if she be so contented.

2284
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:36.970
She will be pleased.

2285
01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.430
Then wherefore should I doubt?

2286
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:41.400
Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her.

2287
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.070
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

2288
01:39:53.130 --> 01:39:56.270
Come on, i' God's name, once more toward our father's.

2289
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:59.570
Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon.

2290
01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:03.230
"The moon"--the sun: it is not moonlight now.

2291
01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.170
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

2292
01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:07.730
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

2293
01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:10.370
By my mother's son, and that's myself,

2294
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:13.370
it shall be moon or star or what I list,

2295
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:15.330
or ere I journey to your father's house.

2296
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:17.170
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.

2297
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:20.500
Evermore cross'd and cross'd, nothing but cross'd.

2298
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.630
Say as he says, or we shall never go.

2299
01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:26.470
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,

2300
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:30.100
and be it moon or sun or what you please,

2301
01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:32.170
an if you please to call it a rush-candle,

2302
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:34.870
henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

2303
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:36.470
I say it is the moon.

2304
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:38.430
I know it is the moon.

2305
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.670
Nay, then you lie.

2306
01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:40.930
It is the blessed sun.

2307
01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:44.770
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun,

2308
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:47.330
but sun it is not if you say it is not,

2309
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:49.430
and the moon changes even as your mind.

2310
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:52.100
What you will have it named, even that it is,

2311
01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:55.070
and so it shall be so for Katharine.

2312
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:57.430
Petruchio, go thy ways.

2313
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:58.570
The field is won.

2314
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:00.730
Well, forward, forward.

2315
01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:02.870
Thus the bowl should run

2316
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:05.000
and not unluckily against the bias.

2317
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.070
But, soft.

2318
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:08.470
Company is coming here.

2319
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:10.570
Good morrow, gentle mistress.

2320
01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:11.730
Where away?

2321
01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:14.970
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,

2322
01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:17.700
hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman

2323
01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:20.870
such war of white and red within her cheeks?

2324
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:23.900
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty

2325
01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.800
as those two eyes become that heavenly face?

2326
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.870
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.

2327
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:33.570
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.

2328
01:41:33.570 --> 01:41:35.730
A' will make the man mad to make a woman of him.

2329
01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:46.530
Young, budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,

2330
01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:51.170
whither away, or where is thy abode?

2331
01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:56.600
Happy the parents of so fair a child,

2332
01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.030
happier the man whom favorable stars

2333
01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:02.400
allots thee for his lovely bedfellow.

2334
01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:04.070
Why, how now, Kate.

2335
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:05.970
I hope thou art not mad.

2336
01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:09.830
This is a man...

2337
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:13.300
old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,

2338
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:17.830
and not a maiden as thou say'st he is.

2339
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:21.030
Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes

2340
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:24.830
that have been so bedazzled with the sun

2341
01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:29.630
that everything I look on seemeth green.

2342
01:42:29.630 --> 01:42:32.000
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father.

2343
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.900
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

2344
01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.200
Do, good old grandsire,

2345
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.500
and withal make known which way thou travellest.

2346
01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.830
If along with us, we shall be joyful of thy company.

2347
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:45.900
Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,

2348
01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:49.530
that with your strange encounter much amazed me,

2349
01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.900
my name is call'd Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,

2350
01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:53.900
and bound I am to Padua,

2351
01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.700
there to visit a son of mine which long I have not seen.

2352
01:42:56.700 --> 01:42:58.430
What is his name?

2353
01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:00.430
Lucentio, gentle sir.

2354
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:03.830
Happily met, the happier for thy son.

2355
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:06.200
And now by law as well as reverend age,

2356
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.400
I may entitle thee my loving father.

2357
01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:10.600
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,

2358
01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:12.670
thy son by this hath married.

2359
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:14.470
Wonder not nor be not grieved.

2360
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:15.600
She is of good esteem,

2361
01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:17.600
her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth.

2362
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.270
Beside, so qualified as may beseem

2363
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:20.930
the spouse of any noble gentleman.

2364
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:23.130
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,

2365
01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:25.230
and wander we to see thy honest son

2366
01:43:25.230 --> 01:43:27.770
who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

2367
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:29.370
But is this true?

2368
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:32.800
Or is it else your pleasure, like pleasant travellers,

2369
01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.030
to break a jest upon the company you overtake?

2370
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:37.300
I do assure thee, father, so it is.

2371
01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.230
Come, go along, and see the truth hereof,

2372
01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:41.900
for our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

2373
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:48.330
Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.

2374
01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:51.730
Have to my widow, and if she be froward,

2375
01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:55.030
now hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

2376
01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.770
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

2377
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:03.970
Sir, here's the door.

2378
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:05.200
This is Lucentio's house.

2379
01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.630
My father's lies more toward the marketplace.

2380
01:44:07.630 --> 01:44:09.770
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

2381
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:12.730
You shall not choose but drink before you go.

2382
01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:14.700
I think I shall command your welcome here,

2383
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:17.600
and by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

2384
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.330
They're busy within.

2385
01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:23.270
You were best knock louder.

2386
01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.270
What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

2387
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:35.870
Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

2388
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:39.100
He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

2389
01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.900
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two

2390
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.930
to make merry withal?

2391
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:46.900
You can keep your hundred pounds to yourself.

2392
01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:49.900
He shall need none so long as I live.

2393
01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:53.100
Nay, I told you your son was well-beloved in Padua.

2394
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.570
Do you hear, sir?

2395
01:44:54.570 --> 01:44:57.830
To leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you,

2396
01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:00.100
tell Signior Lucentio that his father

2397
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.230
is come from Pisa and is here at the door to speak with him.

2398
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.370
Thou liest.

2399
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:06.570
His father is come from Padua

2400
01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:09.470
and here looking out at the window.

2401
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.770
Art thou his father?

2402
01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:14.470
Ay, sir, so his mother says if I may believe her.

2403
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:15.830
Why, how now, gentleman.

2404
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:18.630
Why, this is flat knavery to take upon you another man's name.

2405
01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:20.170
Lay hands on the villain.

2406
01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:23.000
I believe a' means to cozen somebody in this city

2407
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.300
under my countenance.

2408
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.330
I have seen them in the church together.

2409
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:27.730
God send 'em good shipping.

2410
01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:28.830
Ah!

2411
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:30.300
Ay that; who's here?

2412
01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:32.230
Mine old master Vincentio.

2413
01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:34.470
Now we are undone and brought to nothing.

2414
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:36.830
Come hither, crack-hemp.

2415
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.300
Hope I may choose, sir.

2416
01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:45.030
Come hither, you rogue.

2417
01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.870
What, have you forgot me?

2418
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:50.000
Forgot you?

2419
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.170
Oh, no, sir, I could not forget you, sir.

2420
01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:53.900
I never saw you before in all my life.

2421
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.700
What, you notorious villain,

2422
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.300
didst thou never see thy master's father, Vincentio?

2423
01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.600
What, my old worshipful old master?

2424
01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.870
Oh, marry, sir, yes.

2425
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:04.900
See where he looks out of the window.

2426
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.900
Is't so, indeed.

2427
01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.530
Help, help, help!

2428
01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:12.470
Here's a madman will murder me.

2429
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:14.770
Help, son. Help, Signior Baptista!

2430
01:46:14.770 --> 01:46:16.330
Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside

2431
01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:18.200
and see the end of this controversy.

2432
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:22.570
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

2433
01:46:22.570 --> 01:46:23.900
Ah!

2434
01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:25.000
What am I, sir?

2435
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
Nay, what are you, sir?

2436
01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.470
O immortal gods, O fine villain,

2437
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:34.200
a silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak,

2438
01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:36.370
and a copatain hat.

2439
01:46:36.370 --> 01:46:37.670
O, I am undone. I am undone.

2440
01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:39.430
While I play the good husband at home,

2441
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:43.500
my son and my servant spend all at the university.

2442
01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:46.170
How now, what's the matter?

2443
01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.700
Why, is the man lunatic?

2444
01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:50.970
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit,

2445
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:54.070
but your words show you a madman.

2446
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:57.170
Why, sir, what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold?

2447
01:46:57.170 --> 01:47:00.130
I thank my good father I am able to maintain it.

2448
01:47:00.130 --> 01:47:01.570
Thy father?

2449
01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:04.930
O villain, he is a sail maker in Bergamo.

2450
01:47:04.930 --> 01:47:06.030
You mistake, sir.

2451
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:07.270
You mistake, sir.

2452
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:09.100
Pray, what do you think is his name?

2453
01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.730
His name? As if I knew not his name.

2454
01:47:10.730 --> 01:47:13.230
I have brought him up ever since he was three years old,

2455
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:15.000
and his name is Tranio.

2456
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.130
Away, away, mad ass!

2457
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:18.970
His name is Lucentio.

2458
01:47:18.970 --> 01:47:20.200
He is mine only son

2459
01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.330
and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

2460
01:47:24.330 --> 01:47:25.730
Lucentio.

2461
01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:27.700
O, he hath murdered his master.

2462
01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:31.730
Lay hold on him, I charge you, in the duke's name.

2463
01:47:31.730 --> 01:47:33.200
O, my son, my son.

2464
01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.470
Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

2465
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:38.030
Call forth an officer.

2466
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:40.870
Carry this mad knave to the jail.

2467
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:43.500
Father Baptista, I charge you, see he be forthcoming.

2468
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:44.770
Carry me to the jail?

2469
01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:46.700
Stay, officer, he shall not go to prison.

2470
01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:48.400
Talk not, Signior Gremio.

2471
01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.930
I say he shall go to prison.

2472
01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:51.470
Take heed, Signior Baptista,

2473
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:53.500
lest you be cony-catched in this business.

2474
01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.700
I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.

2475
01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:57.400
Swear, if thou darest, hmm?

2476
01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.800
Nay, I dare not swear it.

2477
01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.570
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

2478
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:05.670
Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

2479
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:07.530
Away with the dotard.

2480
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:09.000
To the jail with him.

2481
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.270
Thus strangers may be hailed and abused!

2482
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:12.470
O monstrous villain!

2483
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:16.070
O, we are spoiled, and yonder, he is.

2484
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:18.400
Deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.

2485
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:32.670
Pardon, sweet father.

2486
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:34.970
Lives my sweet son?

2487
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:36.600
Pardon, dear father.

2488
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.100
How hast thou offended?

2489
01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:40.070
Where is Lucentio?

2490
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:42.970
Here's Lucentio,

2491
01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:46.400
right son to the right Vincentio

2492
01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.830
that have by marriage made thy daughter mine

2493
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:52.500
while counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

2494
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.730
Here's packing,

2495
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:56.530
with a witness to deceive us all.

2496
01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:58.270
Where is that damned villain Tranio

2497
01:48:58.270 --> 01:49:00.430
that faced and braved me in this matter so?

2498
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:02.400
Why, tell me, is this not my Cambio?

2499
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:07.170
Cambio has changed into Lucentio.

2500
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:10.930
Love wrought these miracles.

2501
01:49:10.930 --> 01:49:13.530
Bianca's love made me exchange my state with Tranio

2502
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.600
while he did bear my countenance in the town,

2503
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.030
and happily, I have arrived at the last

2504
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:20.670
unto the wished haven of my bliss.

2505
01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:21.870
But, I--

2506
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:24.300
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to.

2507
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.500
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

2508
01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.430
I'll slit the villain's nose

2509
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:30.130
that would have sent me to the jail.

2510
01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:31.530
But do you hear, sir?

2511
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:35.130
Have you married my daughter without asking my good will?

2512
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:37.330
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you, go to,

2513
01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:39.730
but I will in to be revenged for this villainy.

2514
01:49:39.730 --> 01:49:42.700
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

2515
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:46.930
Look not pale, Bianca.

2516
01:49:46.930 --> 01:49:48.200
Thy father will not frown.

2517
01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:54.930
My cake is dough,

2518
01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:57.100
but I'll in among the rest

2519
01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:01.100
out of hope of all but my share of the feast.

2520
01:50:04.730 --> 01:50:08.070
Husband, let's follow to see the end of this ado.

2521
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:09.770
First, kiss me, Kate, and we will.

2522
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.300
What, here?

2523
01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:13.830
In the midst of the street?

2524
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:15.630
What, art thou ashamed of me?

2525
01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:20.730
No, sir, God forbid, but ashamed to kiss.

2526
01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:23.730
Why, then, let's home again.

2527
01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:24.970
Come, sirrah, let's away.

2528
01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:28.630
Nay, I will give thee a kiss.

2529
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:49.700
Now, pray thee, love, stay.

2530
01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:52.370
Is this not well?

2531
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:56.470
Come, my sweet Kate.

2532
01:50:58.370 --> 01:51:02.600
Better once than never, for never too late.

2533
01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:35.400
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree,

2534
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.600
and time it is when raging war is done

2535
01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:43.700
to smile at scapes and perils overblown.

2536
01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:48.100
My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome

2537
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:52.200
while I with self-same kindness welcome thine.

2538
01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:57.370
Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,

2539
01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:02.470
and thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,

2540
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:05.570
feast with the best, and welcome to my house.

2541
01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:10.370
Now, then--

2542
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:18.370
Pray you, sit down,

2543
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:22.900
for now we sit to chat as well as eat.

2544
01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.800
Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat.

2545
01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.070
Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

2546
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:32.100
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

2547
01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:33.370
Here, here. Here, here.

2548
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:35.900
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.

2549
01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.400
Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

2550
01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.230
Never trust me if I be afeard.

2551
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:43.530
You are very sensible, and yet, you miss my sense.

2552
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:45.670
I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

2553
01:52:45.670 --> 01:52:49.230
He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

2554
01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:51.670
Roundly replied.

2555
01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:53.370
Mistress, how mean you that?

2556
01:52:53.370 --> 01:52:55.000
Thus I conceive by him.

2557
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.270
Conceives by me.

2558
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:58.630
How likes Hortensio that?

2559
01:52:58.630 --> 01:53:02.170
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

2560
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:09.670
Very well mended.

2561
01:53:09.670 --> 01:53:11.330
Kiss him for that, good widow.

2562
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:18.930
"He that is giddy thinks the world turns round."

2563
01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:21.970
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.

2564
01:53:21.970 --> 01:53:24.570
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew--

2565
01:53:24.570 --> 01:53:25.970
Ooh--

2566
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:29.000
measures my husband's sorrow by his woe,

2567
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.830
and now you know my meaning.

2568
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:33.000
A very mean meaning.

2569
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.330
Right, I mean you.

2570
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:39.030
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

2571
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:40.270
To her, Kate.

2572
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:41.370
To her, widow.

2573
01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:43.500
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

2574
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.630
That's my office.

2575
01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:47.830
Spoke like an officer.

2576
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:48.930
Ha' to thee, lad.

2577
01:53:48.930 --> 01:53:51.070
How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

2578
01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:53.830
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

2579
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:56.200
A head and butt-- an hasty-witted body

2580
01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.930
would say your head and butt were head and horn.

2581
01:53:58.930 --> 01:54:01.970
Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

2582
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:03.270
Ay, but not frighted me.

2583
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:04.900
Therefore, I'll sleep again.

2584
01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:06.100
Nay, that you shall not.

2585
01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.200
Since you have begun,

2586
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.130
have at you for a bitter jest or two.

2587
01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:11.270
Am I your bird?

2588
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:13.370
Then, I mean to shift my bush,

2589
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:16.770
and then pursue me as you draw your bow.

2590
01:54:16.770 --> 01:54:18.830
You are welcome, all.

2591
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.270
She hath prevented me.

2592
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:25.570
Here, Signior Tranio.

2593
01:54:25.570 --> 01:54:27.730
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not.

2594
01:54:27.730 --> 01:54:29.970
Therefore, a health to all that shot and miss'd.

2595
01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:31.200
Shot and missed!

2596
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.870
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound

2597
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:36.530
which runs himself and catches for his master.

2598
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:39.300
A good swift simile, but something currish.

2599
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.470
Oh!

2600
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:42.770
'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself.

2601
01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:45.270
'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

2602
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:48.000
O ho, Petruchio.

2603
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.870
I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

2604
01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:52.000
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

2605
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.100
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess,

2606
01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:56.670
and as the jest did glance away from me,

2607
01:54:56.670 --> 01:55:00.130
'tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

2608
01:55:00.130 --> 01:55:02.500
Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,

2609
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:06.130
I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

2610
01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:11.000
Well, I say no, and therefore, for assurance,

2611
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.370
let's each one send unto his wife,

2612
01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:16.170
and he whose wife is most obedient

2613
01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:18.200
to come at first when he doth send for her

2614
01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.600
shall win the wager which we will propose.

2615
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.970
Content. What is the wager?

2616
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:23.170
20 crowns.

2617
01:55:23.170 --> 01:55:24.570
20 crowns?

2618
01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:26.430
I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound

2619
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:28.000
but 20 times so much upon my wife.

2620
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.170
A hundred then.

2621
01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:30.270
Content.

2622
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:31.400
A match; 'tis done.

2623
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.570
Who shall begin?

2624
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:34.070
That will I.

2625
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:36.170
Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

2626
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:37.430
I go.

2627
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.970
Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.

2628
01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:41.430
I'll have no halves.

2629
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:44.330
I'll bear it all myself.

2630
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:45.570
How now, what news?

2631
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:47.370
Sir, my mistress sends you word

2632
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:50.130
that she is busy, and she cannot come.

2633
01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:55.230
How, she is busy, and she cannot come.

2634
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:57.700
I-Is that an answer?

2635
01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:59.870
Ay, and a kind one too.

2636
01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:02.600
Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

2637
01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.730
I hope better.

2638
01:56:03.730 --> 01:56:05.730
Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife

2639
01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:06.930
to come to me forthwith.

2640
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:08.030
O, ho, entreat her.

2641
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:10.700
Nay, then she must needs come.

2642
01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:12.070
Sir, I am afraid,

2643
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:14.170
do what you can, yours will not be entreated.

2644
01:56:14.170 --> 01:56:16.170
Now, where's my wife?

2645
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:18.970
Ah, she says you have some goodly jest in hand.

2646
01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:20.300
She will not come.

2647
01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.430
She bids you come to her.

2648
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:22.670
Whoa!

2649
01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:24.600
Worse and worse; she will not come.

2650
01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.400
O vile, intolerable, not to be endured.

2651
01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.770
Sirrah Grumio,

2652
01:56:29.770 --> 01:56:31.370
go to your mistress.

2653
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:35.000
Say I command her come to me.

2654
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.370
I know her answer.

2655
01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:37.600
What?

2656
01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:38.700
She will not.

2657
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:40.600
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

2658
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:55.200
Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina.

2659
01:57:04.330 --> 01:57:07.130
What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

2660
01:57:07.130 --> 01:57:11.400
Where is your sister and Hortensio's wife?

2661
01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.900
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

2662
01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:15.330
Go fetch them hither.

2663
01:57:15.330 --> 01:57:16.770
If they deny to come,

2664
01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:20.270
swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.

2665
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:23.300
Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

2666
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:39.000
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

2667
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.230
And so it is.

2668
01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:41.500
I wonder what it bodes.

2669
01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.730
Marry,

2670
01:57:42.730 --> 01:57:44.600
peace it bodes

2671
01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:48.770
and love and quiet life

2672
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:52.800
and awful rule and right supremacy

2673
01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.570
and, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy?

2674
01:57:56.570 --> 01:58:00.970
Now, fair befall thee, good Petruchio,

2675
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:02.170
the wager thou hast won,

2676
01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.300
and I will add unto their losses 20,000 crowns,

2677
01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:08.670
another dowry to another daughter,

2678
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:13.170
for she is changed as she has never been.

2679
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.470
Nay, I will win my wager better yet

2680
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:21.830
and show more sign of her obedience,

2681
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:24.630
her new-built virtue and obedience.

2682
01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:28.900
See where she comes and brings your froward wives

2683
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:31.430
as prisoners to her womanly persuasion.

2684
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.900
Katharine...

2685
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.400
that cap of yours becomes you not.

2686
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.330
Off with that bauble.

2687
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:46.000
Throw it underfoot.

2688
01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.130
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh

2689
01:59:01.130 --> 01:59:04.530
till I be brought to such a silly pass.

2690
01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:09.830
Fie, what foolish duty call you this?

2691
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:12.930
I would your duty were as foolish too.

2692
01:59:12.930 --> 01:59:14.700
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,

2693
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.470
hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper time.

2694
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:20.370
The more fool you for laying on my duty.

2695
01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:23.700
Katharine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women

2696
01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:26.630
what duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

2697
01:59:26.630 --> 01:59:28.230
Come, come, you're mocking.

2698
01:59:28.230 --> 01:59:29.770
We will have no telling.

2699
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:32.000
Come on, I say, and first begin with her.

2700
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.900
She shall not.

2701
01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.100
I say she shall!

2702
01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.270
Ooh!

2703
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:39.500
And first, begin with her.

2704
01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:41.200
Fie, fie.

2705
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.370
Unknit that threatening, unkind brow,

2706
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:47.170
and dart not scornful glances from those eyes

2707
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:50.670
to wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.

2708
01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:54.830
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,

2709
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:57.730
confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,

2710
01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:00.870
and in no sense is meet or amiable.

2711
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.470
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled--

2712
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:11.370
muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty--

2713
02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:13.970
and while it is so, none so dry or thirsty

2714
02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:18.430
will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.

2715
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:22.470
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,

2716
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:27.570
thy head, thy sovereign, one that cares for thee,

2717
02:00:27.570 --> 02:00:29.600
and for thy maintenance commits his body

2718
02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.000
to painful labor both by sea and land

2719
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.670
to watch the night in storms, the day in cold,

2720
02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:39.870
whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe,

2721
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:42.400
that craves no other tribute from thy hands

2722
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.030
but love, fair looks, and true obedience--

2723
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:50.830
too little payment for so great a debt.

2724
02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:58.800
Such duty as the subject owes the prince

2725
02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.970
even such a woman oweth to her husband,

2726
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:08.370
and when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,

2727
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:10.900
and not obedient to his honest will,

2728
02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:13.900
what is she but a foul contending rebel

2729
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:18.170
and graceless traitor to her loving lord?

2730
02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:22.000
I am ashamed that women are so simple

2731
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.170
to offer war where they should kneel for peace,

2732
02:01:26.170 --> 02:01:29.230
to seek for rule, supremacy, and sway

2733
02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:35.770
when they are bound to serve, love, and obey.

2734
02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:39.470
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,

2735
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:41.500
unapt to toil and trouble in the world

2736
02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:45.000
but that our soft conditions and our hearts

2737
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.700
should well agree with our external parts?

2738
02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:55.200
Come, come, you froward and unable worms.

2739
02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.270
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,

2740
02:01:57.270 --> 02:02:01.830
my heart as great, my reason haply more,

2741
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:05.230
to bandy word for word and frown for frown,

2742
02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:10.200
but now I see our lances are but straws,

2743
02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:14.870
our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,

2744
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:21.230
that seeming to be most which we indeed least are.

2745
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:26.570
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,

2746
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:32.130
and place your hands below your husband's foot.

2747
02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:37.070
In token of which duty, if he please,

2748
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:39.430
my hand is ready.

2749
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:41.670
May it do him ease.

2750
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.600
Why, there's a wench.

2751
02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:55.900
Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

2752
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:08.900
Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha't.

2753
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:11.570
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward--

2754
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:14.800
But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

2755
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:20.500
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.

2756
02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:24.570
We three are married, but you two are sped.

2757
02:03:24.570 --> 02:03:27.670
Now, go thy ways.

2758
02:03:27.670 --> 02:03:31.700
Thou hast tamed a cursed shrew.

2759
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:35.330
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

2760
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:45.900
Hmmm.

2761
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:47.600
Hmmm.

2762
02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:51.630
Hmmm.

2763
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:58.830
How blessed is he that fears the Lord

2764
02:03:58.830 --> 02:04:03.300
and walketh, walketh in his ways.

2765
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.500
Thy love, thy labor, thy love, thy labor,

2766
02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.630
thou shalt ever eat

2767
02:04:09.630 --> 02:04:14.500
and happy be always.

2768
02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:18.870
Thy wife shall as a fruitful vine

2769
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:23.400
by thy house sides, house sides be found.

2770
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.330
Thy child, thy child,

2771
02:04:25.330 --> 02:04:29.370
thy children like the olive branches green

2772
02:04:29.370 --> 02:04:34.400
about thy table round.

2773
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.770
Behold, the man that fears the Lord.

2774
02:04:38.770 --> 02:04:43.400
Most blessed, blessed shall he be.

2775
02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.270
The Lord, the Lord,

2776
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:49.300
the Lord shall in satiety give

2777
02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:54.100
his blessing unto thee.

2778
02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:58.400
Thou shalt Jerusalem's good behold

2779
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:02.900
whilst thou on earth dost dwell.

2780
02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:05.770
Thou shalt, thou shalt, thou shalt,

2781
02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:09.400
thou shalt thy children's children see

2782
02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:15.000
and peace on Israel.
