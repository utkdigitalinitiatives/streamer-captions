00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.700
Tranio,

3
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.170
since for the great desireI had

4
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.830
to see fair Padua, nurseryof arts,

5
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.170
I am arrived for fruitfulLombardy, the pleasantgarden of great Italy;

6
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.100
and by my father's loveand leave am arm'd

7
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.970
with his good will and thygood company,

8
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.930
my trusty servant,well-approved in all,

9
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.800
here let us breathe andhaply institute

10
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.870
a course of learning andingenious studies.

11
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.430
Pisa renown'd for gravecitizens

12
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.170
gave me my being and myfather first,

13
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.370
a merchant of greattraffic through the world,

14
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.970
Vincetino come ofBentivolii.

15
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.900
Vincetino's son brought upin Florence,

16
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.030
it shall become to serveall hopes conceived,

17
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.100
to deck his fortune withhis virtuous deeds.

18
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.170
And therefore, Tranio, forthe time I study,

19
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.830
virtue and that part ofphilosophy

20
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.200
will I apply that treatsof happiness by virtuespecially to be achieved.

21
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
Well, tell me thy mind,

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.230
for I have Pisa left andam to Padua come

23
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.830
as he that leaves ashallow plash to plungehim in the deep

24
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.900
and with satiety seeks toquench his thirst.

25
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Mi perdonato, gentlemaster mine,

26
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.870
I am in all affected asyourself,

27
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.870
glad that you thus resolve

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.000
to suck the sweets ofsweet philosophy.

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.200
Only, good master, whilewe do admire

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.500
this virtue and this moraldiscipline,

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.800
let's be no stoics nor nostocks, I pray,

32
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.830
or so devote toAristotle's cheques

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.600
as Ovid be an outcastquite abjured.

34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.030
Balk logic withacquaintance that you have

35
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.300
and practise rhetoric inyour common talk.

36
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.470
Music and poesy use toquicken you.

37
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.070
The mathematics andmetaphysics,

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.670
fall to them as you findyour stomach serves you.

39
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.630
No profit grows where isno pleasure ta'en.

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.830
In brief, sir, study whatyou most affect.

41
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.600
Gramercies, Tranio, welldost thou advise.

42
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930
If, Biondello, thou wertcome ashore,

43
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.700
we could at once put us inreadiness--

44
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.800
ow--

45
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500
and take a lodging fit toentertain

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.670
such friends as time inPadua shall beget.

47
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.770
But stay a while.

48
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:31.900
What company is this?

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.330
Master, some show towelcome us to town.

50
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.630
Gentlemen, importune me nofarther,

51
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.970
for how I firmly amresolved you know;

52
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.830
that is, not bestow myyoungest daughter

53
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.730
before I have a husbandfor the elder.

54
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.530
If either of you both loveKatharina,

55
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.470
because I know you welland love you well,

56
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.800
leave shall you have tocourt her at your pleasure.

57
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900
To cart her rather.

58
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.370
She's too rough for me.

59
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.570
There, there, Hortensio,will you any wife?

60
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.770
I pray you, sir, is ityour will

61
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.500
to make a stale of meamongst these mates?

62
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.630
Mates, maid, how mean youthat?

63
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.800
No mates for you

64
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.170
unless you were ofgentler, milder mold.

65
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.470
I' faith, sir, you shallnever need to fear.

66
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.000
I wis it is not halfway toher heart,

67
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.900
but if it were, doubt nother care should be

68
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.730
to comb your noddle with athree-legg'd stool

69
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.730
and paint your face anduse you like a fool.

70
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.400
From all such devils, goodLord deliver us.

71
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.930
And me too, good Lord.

72
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.630
Hush, master.

73
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.230
Here's some good pastimetoward.

74
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.700
That wench is stark mad orwonderful froward.

75
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.970
But in the other's silence

76
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.070
do I see maid's mildbehavior and sobriety.

77
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.430
Peace, Tranio.

78
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.200
Gentlemen, that I may soonmake good what I have said--

79
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.870
Bianca, get you in,

80
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.630
and let it not displeasethee, good Bianca,

81
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.670
for I will love thee ne'erthe less, my girl.

82
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.300
A pretty peat.

83
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.130
It is best put finger inthe eye,

84
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.230
an she knew why.

85
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.070
Sister, content you in mydiscontent.

86
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.230
Sir, to your pleasurehumbly I subscribe.

87
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.870
My books and instrumentsshall be my company,

88
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.570
on them to look andpractise by myself.

89
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.300
Hark, Tranio, thou may'sthear Minerva speak.

90
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.570
Signior Baptista, will yoube so strange?

91
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570
Sorry am I that our goodwill effects Bianca's grief.

92
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.770
Why will you mew her up,Signior Baptista,

93
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.000
for this fiend of hell,

94
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.500
and make her bear thepenance of her tongue?

95
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.330
Gentlemen, content ye.

96
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.070
I am resolved.

97
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.530
Go in, Bianca.

98
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.300
And for I know she takethmost delight

99
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.800
in music, instruments, andpoetry,

100
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.100
schoolmasters will I havewithin my house,

101
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.070
fit to instruct her youth.

102
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.270
If you, Hortensio, or,Signior Gremio, you,

103
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.670
know any such, prefer themhither,

104
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.000
for to cunning men I willbe very kind

105
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.170
and liberal to mine ownchildren in good bringing up.

106
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.200
And so farewell.

107
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.370
Katharina, you may stay,

108
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.970
for I have more to communewith Bianca.

109
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.930
Why, and I trust I may gotoo, may I not?

110
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.530
What?

111
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.700
Shall I be appointedhours?

112
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.000
As though, belike,

113
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.530
I knew not what to takeand what to leave?

114
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.530
Ooh.

115
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.470
Ha!

116
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.370
Oh.

117
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.470
Phew.

118
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.730
You may go to the devil'sdam.

119
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.700
Your gifts are so good,here's none will hold you.

120
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.070
Their love is not sogreat, Hortensio,

121
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.670
but we may blow our nailstogether

122
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.870
and fast it fairly out.

123
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.270
Our cakes dough on bothsides.

124
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.800
Farewell.

125
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.930
And yet for the love Ibear my sweet Bianca,

126
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.100
if I can by any meanslight on a fit man

127
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.970
to teach her that whereinshe delights,

128
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.330
I will wish him to herfather.

129
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.570
So will I, Signior Gremio,

130
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.000
but a word, I pray.

131
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.870
Though the nature of ourquarrel yet never brookedparle,

132
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.500
know now, upon advice,

133
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.800
it touches us both

134
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.570
that we may yet again haveaccess

135
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.530
to our fair mistress andbe happy rivals

136
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.700
in Bianco's love,

137
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.430
to labor and effect onething specially.

138
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.630
What's that, I pray?

139
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.030
Marry, sir, to get ahusband for her sister.

140
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.130
A husband? A devil.

141
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.230
I say a husband.

142
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.500
I say a devil.

143
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.570
Thinkest thou, Hortensio,though her father be very rich,

144
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.770
any man is so very a foolto be married to hell?

145
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.030
Tush, Gremio, though itpass your patience and mine

146
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.470
to endure her loudalarums,

147
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.530
why, man, there be goodfellows in the world,

148
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.900
an a man should light onthem,

149
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.200
would take her with allfaults, and money enough.

150
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.400
I cannot tell,

151
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.730
but I had as lief take herdowry with this condition

152
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.870
to be whipped at the highcross every morning.

153
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.800
Faith, as you say, there'ssmall choice in rotten apples,

154
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.030
but come;

155
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.700
since this bar in lawmakes us friends,

156
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.530
it shall be so far forthfriendly maintained

157
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
till by helping Baptista'seldest daughter to a husband

158
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.500
we set his youngest freefor a husband

159
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.530
and then have to't afresh, hmm?

160
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.700
Sweet Bianca.

161
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.400
Happy man be his dole.

162
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.100
He that runs fastest getsthe ring.

163
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.470
How say you, SigniorGremio?

164
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.870
I am agreed,

165
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.500
and would I had given himthe best horse in Padua

166
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.800
to begin his wooing

167
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.370
that would thoroughly wooher, wed her and bed her,

168
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.970
and rid the house of her.

169
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.970
Come on.

170
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.900
I pray, sir, tell me, isit possible

171
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.270
that love should of asudden take such hold?

172
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.870
Tranio, till I found it tobe true,

173
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.630
I never thought itpossible or likely;

174
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.470
But see, while idly Istood looking on,

175
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.270
I found the effect of lovein idleness

176
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.130
and now in plainness doconfess to thee,

177
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.730
that art to me as secretand as dear

178
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.470
as Anna to the queen ofCarthage was,

179
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.630
Tranio, I burn, I pine, Iperish, Tranio,

180
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.600
if I achieve not thisyoung, modest girl.

181
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.930
Well, counsel me, Tranio,for I know thou canst.

182
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.800
Assist me, Tranio, for Iknow thou wilt.

183
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.900
Master, it is no time tochide you now.

184
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.500
Affection is not ratedfrom the heart.

185
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.700
If love have touch'd you,nought remains but so--

186
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.970
"Redime te captum quamqueas minimo."

187
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.100
Gramercies, lad, goforward; this contents:

188
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.300
the rest will comfort forthy counsel's sound.

189
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.230
Master, you look'd solongly on the maid,

190
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.370
perhaps you mark'd notwhat's the pith of all.

191
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.070
O yes, I saw sweet beautyin her face

192
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.670
such as the daughter ofAgenor had

193
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.730
that made great Jove tohumble him to her hand

194
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.970
when with his knees hekiss'd the Cretan strand.

195
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.070
Saw you no more?

196
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.430
Mark'd you not how hersister

197
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.330
began to scold and raiseup such a storm

198
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.470
that mortal ears mighthardly endure the din?

199
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.970
Tranio, I saw her corallips to move,

200
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.230
and with her breath, shedid perfume the air.

201
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.330
Sacred and sweet was all Isaw in her.

202
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.570
Nay, then, 'tis time tostir him from his trance.

203
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.430
I pray, awake, sir.

204
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.730
If you love the maid,

205
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.270
bend thoughts and wits toachieve her.

206
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.770
Thus it stands.

207
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.700
Her eldest sister is socursed and shrewd

208
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.670
that till the father ridhis hands of her,

209
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.900
Master, your love mustlive a maid at home.

210
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.870
Therefore has he closelymew'd her up,

211
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.030
because she will not beannoy'd with suitors.

212
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.930
Oh, Tranio, what a cruelfather's he.

213
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.130
But art thou not advised,

214
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.470
he took some care to gether cunning schoolmasters

215
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.000
to instruct her?

216
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.970
Ay, marry, am I, sir, andnow 'tis plotted.

217
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.300
I have it, Tranio.

218
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.970
Master, for my hand, bothour inventions meet andjump in one.

219
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.300
Well, tell me thine first.

220
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.170
You will be schoolmasterand undertake the teachingof the maid.

221
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.200
- That's your device. - Itis; may it be done?

222
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.230
Not possible, for whoshall bear your part,

223
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.000
and be in Padua hereVincentio's son,

224
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.300
keep house and ply hisbook, welcome his friends,

225
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.270
visit his countrymen andbanquet them?

226
00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.470
Basta; content thee, for Ihave it full.

227
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.270
We have not yet been seenin any house,

228
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:08.830
nor can we liedistinguish'd by our facesfor man or master.

229
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.030
Then it follows thus,

230
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.300
thou shalt be master,Tranio, in my stead,

231
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.370
keep house and port andservants as I should.

232
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.200
I will some other be, someFlorentine,

233
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.130
some Neapolitan, or ameaner man of Pisa.

234
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.600
'Tis hatch'd and shall beso.

235
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.270
Tranio, at once, uncasethee.

236
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.870
Take my color'd hat andcloak.

237
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.100
When Biondello comes, hewaits on thee,

238
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.270
but I will charm him firstto keep his tongue.

239
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.800
So had you need.

240
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.730
In brief, sir, sith ityour pleasure is,

241
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.270
and I am tied to beobedient,

242
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.100
for so your father chargedme at our parting.

243
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.800
"Be serviceable to myson," quoth he,

244
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.800
although I think 'twas inanother sense.

245
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.830
I am content to beLucentio, because so wellI love Lucentio.

246
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.770
Tranio, be so, becauseLucentio loves,

247
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.630
and let me be a slave toachieve that maid

248
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.030
whose sudden sight haththrall'd my wounded eye.

249
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.330
Here comes the rogue.

250
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.730
Sirrah, where have youbeen?

251
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:00.930
Where have I been?

252
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.300
Nay, how now. Where areyou?

253
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.870
Dear Master, has my fellowTranio stolen your clothes?

254
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.070
Or you stolen his?

255
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.570
Or both? Pray, what's thenews?

256
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.900
Sirrah, come hither.

257
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.730
'Tis no time to jest, and feignyour manners to the time.

258
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.670
Your fellow Tranio here,to save my life,

259
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.500
puts my apparel and mycountenance on,

260
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.230
for in a quarrel since Icame ashore,

261
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.000
I kill'd a man and fear Iwas descried.

262
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.930
Wait you on him, I chargeyou, as becomes,

263
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.900
while I make way fromhence to save my life.

264
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.000
You understand me?

265
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.100
I, sir? Ne'er a whit.

266
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.770
And not a jot of Tranio inyour mouth.

267
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.330
Tranio is changed intoLucentio.

268
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.530
Yeah, the better for him.

269
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.870
Would I were so too.

270
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.370
So could I, faith, boy, tohave the next wish after,

271
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.030
that Lucentio indeed hadBaptista's youngest daughter.

272
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.230
But, sirrah, not for mysake but your master's,

273
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.270
I advise you use yourmanners discreetly in allkind of companies.

274
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.070
When I am alone, why, thenI am Tranio;

275
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.200
but in all places else,your master Lucentio.

276
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.000
Tranio, let's go.

277
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.070
One thing more rests thatthyself execute--

278
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.570
to make one among thesewooers--

279
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.970
if thou ask me why,sufficeth,

280
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.130
my reasons are both goodand weighty.

281
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.370
Verona, for a while, Itake my leave,

282
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.400
to see my friends inPadua,

283
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.000
but of all--

284
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.230
oh--

285
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:22.370
my best beloved andapproved friend, Hortensio;

286
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.770
and I trow this is hishouse.

287
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.830
Here, sirrah Grumio,knock, I say.

288
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:26.930
Knock, sir?

289
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.100
Whom should I knock?

290
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.500
Is there any man hasabused your worship?

291
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.630
Villain, I say, knock mehere soundly.

292
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.900
Knock you here, sir?

293
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.330
Why, what am I, sir, that Ishould knock you here, sir?

294
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.070
Villain, I say, knock meat this gate

295
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.300
and rap me well, or I'llknock your knave's pate.

296
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:41.800
My master is grownquarrelsome.

297
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.000
I should knock you first,

298
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.870
then I know after whocomes by the worst.

299
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.030
Will it not be?

300
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.130
Faith, sirrah,

301
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.730
an you'll not knock, I'llring it.

302
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.600
I'll try how you can sol,fa, and sing it.

303
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.430
Help, masters, help! Mymaster is mad!

304
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.400
Now, knock when I bid you,sirrah villain!

305
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.730
How now, what's thematter?

306
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:59.200
My old friend Grumio...

307
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.930
And my good friendPetruchio!

308
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.700
How do you all at Verona?

309
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.130
Signior Hortensio, comeyou to part the fray?

310
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.700
"Con tutto il cuore, bentrovato," may I say.

311
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.730
Ooh, um, "Alla nostra casaben venuto,

312
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.470
molto honorato signor mioPetruchio."

313
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:23.570
Rise, Grumio, rise.

314
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.700
Up, up, up, up.

315
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.170
We will compound thisquarrel.

316
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.470
Nay, sir, 'tis no matter,what he 'leges in Latin.

317
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.070
If this be not a lawful causefor me to leave his service,

318
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.730
look you, sir, he bid meknock him and rap himsoundly, sir.

319
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.030
Well, was it fit for aservant to use his master so,

320
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.330
being perhaps, for aught Isee, 2 and 30, a pip out,

321
00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.170
whom to God I had wellknock'd at first,

322
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.930
then had not Grumio comeby the worst?

323
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.130
A senseless villain.

324
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.530
Good Hortensio, I bade therascal knock upon yourgate

325
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:47.470
and could not get him formy heart to do it.

326
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.270
Knock at the gate? Oheavens, spake you notthese words plain,

327
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.600
"Sirrah, knock me here, rapme here, knock me well,

328
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.700
knock me soundly"?

329
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.670
And come you now with,"Knock at the gate"?

330
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.630
Sirrah, be gone, or talknot, I advise you.

331
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.870
Petruchio, patience; I amGrumio's pledge.

332
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.470
Why, this's a heavy chance'twixt him and you,

333
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.270
your ancient, pleasant,trusty servant Grumio.

334
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.730
And tell me now, sweetfriend,

335
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.770
what happy gale blows you toPadua here from old Verona?

336
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.900
Oh, such wind as scattersyoung men through the world

337
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.970
to seek their fortunefarther than at home

338
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.430
where small experiencegrows.

339
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.370
But in a few, SigniorHortensio, thus it standswith me.

340
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:26.930
Antonio, my father, isdeceased,

341
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.130
Oh.

342
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.330
Oh.

343
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.430
And I have thrust myselfinto this maze,

344
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.500
haply to wive and thriveas best I may.

345
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.930
Crowns in my purse I haveand goods at home,

346
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.330
and so am come abroad tosee the world.

347
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.000
Petruchio, shall I thencome roundly to thee

348
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.300
and wish thee to a shrewdill-favor'd wife?

349
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.500
Thou'ldst thank me but alittle for my counsel,

350
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:49.000
and yet I promise you, sheshall be rich, and very rich.

351
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.470
Yet thou'rt too much myfriend,

352
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.830
and I'll not wish thee toher.

353
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.030
Signior Hortensio, 'twixtsuch friends as we,

354
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.200
few words suffice;

355
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.230
and therefore, if thouknow one rich enough

356
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.500
to be Petruchio's wife,

357
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.400
as wealth is burden of mywooing dance,

358
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.300
be she as foul as wasFlorentius' love,

359
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.430
as old as Sibyl,

360
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.000
and as cursed and shrewdas Socrates' Xanthippe--

361
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.070
or a worse-- she moves menot,

362
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.000
or not removes, at least,affection's edge in me,

363
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.470
were she as rough as arethe Adriatic seas:

364
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.400
I come to wive itwealthily in Padua.

365
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.170
If wealthily, then happilyin Padua.

366
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.730
Nay, look you, sir, hetells you flatly what hismind is.

367
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.970
Why, give him gold enough,marry him to a puppet oran aglet-baby

368
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.170
or an old trot with ne'era tooth in her head,

369
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.730
though she have as manydiseases as 2 and 50 horses,

370
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.700
nothing comes amiss somoney comes withal.

371
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.530
But, Petruchio, since weare stepp'd thus far in,

372
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.570
I will continue that Ibroach'd in jest.

373
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.270
I can, Petruchio, helpthee to a wife

374
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.930
with wealth enough andyoung and beauteous,

375
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.930
brought up as best becomesa gentlewoman.

376
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.530
Her only fault, and thatis faults enough,

377
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.770
is that she is intolerablecursed and shrewd andfroward,

378
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.330
so beyond all measurethat,

379
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.300
were my state far worserthan it is,

380
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.300
I would not wed her for amine of gold.

381
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.570
Hortensio, peace.

382
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.070
Thou know'st not gold'seffect.

383
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.100
Tell me her father's name,and 'tis enough,

384
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.470
for I will board her,

385
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.470
though she chide as loudas thunder when the cloudsin autumn crack.

386
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.170
Her father is BaptistaMinola, an affable andcourteous gentleman.

387
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.330
Her name is KatharinaMinola,

388
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.870
renown'd in Padua for herscolding tongue.

389
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.370
I know her father, thoughI know not her.

390
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.670
He knew my deceased fatherwell.

391
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.730
I will not sleep,Hortensio, till I see her;

392
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.700
and therefore, let me bethus bold with you

393
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.630
to give you over at thisfirst encounter,

394
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.470
unless you will accompanyme thither.

395
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.770
I pray you, sir, let himgo while the humour lasts.

396
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.630
O' my word, an she knewhim as well as I do,

397
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.200
she would think scolding woulddo little good upon him.

398
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.500
She may perhaps call himhalf a score knaves or so.

399
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.430
That's nothing, an hebegin once, he'll rail inhis rope tricks.

400
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.870
I'll tell you what sir, anshe stand him but alittle,

401
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.530
he'll throw a figure inher face, so disfigure herwith it,

402
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.870
she shall have no more eyesto see withal than a cat.

403
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.130
You know him not, sir.

404
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.970
Tarry, Petruchio, I mustgo with thee,

405
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.800
for in Baptista's keep, mytreasure is.

406
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.230
He hath the jewel of mylife in hold--

407
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.500
his youngest daughter,beautiful Bianca--

408
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.970
and her withholds from meand other more,

409
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.930
suitors to her and rivalsin my love,

410
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.430
supposing it a thingimpossible

411
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.130
for those defects I havebefore rehearsed

412
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.430
that ever Katharina shallbe woo'd.

413
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.170
Therefore, this order hathBaptista ta'en

414
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.830
that none shall haveaccess unto Bianca

415
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.100
till Katharine the cursedhave got a husband.

416
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.170
Katharine the cursed, atitle for a maid, of alltitles the worst.

417
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:24.300
Now shall my friendPetruchio do me grace

418
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.700
and offer me disguised insober robes

419
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.900
to old Baptista as aschoolmaster

420
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.030
well seen in music toinstruct Bianca

421
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.400
that so I may by thisdevice

422
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.700
at least have leave andleisure to make love to her

423
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.630
and, unsuspected, courther by herself.

424
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.830
Here's no knavery.

425
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.230
See, to beguile the oldfolks,

426
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.370
how the young folks laytheir heads together.

427
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.770
Master, master, look aboutyou. Who goes there, ha?

428
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.030
Oh, oh, peace, Grumio.

429
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.230
It is the rival of mylove.

430
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.670
Petruchio, stand by awhile.

431
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.230
O, very well.

432
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.100
I have perused the note.

433
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.400
Hark you, sir,

434
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.530
I'll have them very fairlybound:

435
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.100
all books of love, seethat at any hand;

436
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.400
and see you read no otherlectures to her,

437
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.330
you understand me.

438
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.370
Over and beside SigniorBaptista's liberality,

439
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.430
I'll mend it with alargess.

440
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.830
Take your paper too,

441
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.770
and let me have them verywell perfumed,

442
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.770
for she is sweeter thanperfume itself

443
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.870
to whom they go to.

444
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.970
Mm.

445
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.470
Nay, what will you read toher?

446
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.400
Whate'er I read to her,I'll plead for you

447
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.230
as for my patron, standyou so assured,

448
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:26.230
as firmly as yourself werestill in place.

449
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.800
Yea, and perhaps with moresuccessful words than you--

450
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.900
Hmm?

451
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.370
Unless you were a scholar,sir.

452
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.700
O this learning, what athing it is.

453
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.300
O this woodcock, what anass it is.

454
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.470
Grumio, mum.

455
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:37.900
God save you, SigniorGremio.

456
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.170
And you are well met,Signior Hortensio.

457
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.500
Trow you whither I amgoing?

458
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.830
To Baptista Minola.

459
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.530
I promised to inquirecarefully

460
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.500
about a schoolmaster forthe fair Bianca,

461
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.770
and by good fortune,

462
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.730
I have lighted well onthis young man,

463
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.400

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.970
so shall I no whit be behindin duty to fair Bianca,

469
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.170

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.270
Beloved of me, and that mydeeds shall prove.

471
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:10.670
And that his bags shallprove.

472
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:14.300
Gremio, 'tis now no timeto vent our love.

473
00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.730
Listen to me, and if youspeak me fair,

474
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.200
I'll tell you newsindifferent good for either.

475
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.770
Here is a gentleman bychance I met,

476
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:25.030

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.970
will undertake to woocursed Katharine.

478
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.070
Huh?

479
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.300
Yea, and to marry her

480
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.270
if her dowry please.

481
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.930
So said, so done, is well.

482
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.530
Hortensio, have you toldhim all her faults?

483
00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.600
I know she is an irksome,brawling scold.

484
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.430
If that be all, masters, Ihear no harm.

485
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.300
No, say'st me so, friend?

486
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.500
What countryman?

487
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.670
Born in Verona, oldAntonio's son.

488
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:47.770
My father dead--

489
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.870
Oh.

490
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.070
my fortune lives for me,

491
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.170
and I do hope good daysand long to see.

492
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.030
O sir, such a life, withsuch a wife, were strange,

493
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.270
but if you have a stomach,to't i' God's name.

494
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.970
You shall have meassisting you in all.

495
00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:03.100
But will you woo thiswildcat?

496
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.200
Will I live?

497
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.330
Will he woo her? Aye, orI'll hang her.

498
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.070
Why came I hither but tothat intent?

499
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.870
Think you a little din candaunt mine ears?

500
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.300
Have I not in my timeheard lions roar?

501
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.630
Have I not heard the sea,puff'd up with winds,

502
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.770
rage like an angry boarchafed with sweat?

503
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.930
Have I not heard greatordnance in the field,

504
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.570
and heaven's artillerythunder in the skies?

505
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.770
Have I not, in a pitchedbattle, heard

506
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.930
loud 'larums, neighingsteeds, and trumpets' clang?

507
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.530
And do you tell me of awoman's tongue

508
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.100
that gives not half sogreat a blow to hear

509
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.900
as will a chestnut in afarmer's fire?

510
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.930
Tush, tush. Fear boys withbugs.

511
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.800
For he fears none.

512
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.270
Hortensio, hark,

513
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.170
this gentleman is happilyarrived,

514
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.200
my mind presumes, for hisown good and ours.

515
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.230
Mm, I promised we would becontributors

516
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.330
and bear his charge ofwooing, whatsoe'er.

517
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.500
And so we will, providedthat he win her.

518
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.800
I would I were as sure ofa good dinner.

519
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.430
Gentlemen, God save you.

520
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.500
If I may be bold, tell me,I beseech you,

521
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.770
which is the readiest way

522
00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:04.770
to the house of SigniorBaptista Minola?

523
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.430
He that has the two fairdaughters?

524
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.530
Is't he you mean?

525
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.630
Even he, Biondello.

526
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.630
Hark you, sir, you meannot her to--

527
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.870
Perhaps, him and her, sir.

528
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.100
What have you to do?

529
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.770
Not her that chides, sir,at any hand, I pray.

530
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.330
I love no chiders, sir.

531
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.670
Biondello, let's away.

532
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.800
Well begun, Tranio.

533
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.470
Sir, a word ere you go.

534
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.330
Are you a suitor to themaid you talk of,

535
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.430
yea or no?

536
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.500
And if I be, sir, is itany offence?

537
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.530
No, if without more wordsyou will get you hence.

538
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:31.600
Why, sir, I pray, are notthe streets as free

539
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.330
for me as for you?

540
00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:34.670
But so is not she.

541
00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.270
For what reason, I beseechyou?

542
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.830
For this reason, if you'llknow,

543
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.970
that she's the choice loveof Signior Gremio.

544
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.070
That she's the chosen ofSignior Hortensio.

545
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.700
Softly, my masters.

546
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.230
If you be gentlemen, do methis right.

547
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.870
Hear me with patience.

548
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:50.830
Baptista is a noblegentleman

549
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.400
to whom my father is notall unknown,

550
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.700
and were his daughterfairer than she is,

551
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.230
she may more suitors haveand me for one.

552
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.730
Fair Leda's daughter had athousand wooers.

553
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.870
Then well one more mayfair Bianca have,

554
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.070
and so she shall.

555
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.500
Lucentio shall make one,

556
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.130
though Paris came in hopeto speed alone.

557
00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.170
What, this gentleman willout-talk us all.

558
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.300
Sir, give him head.

559
00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.630
I know he'll prove a jade.

560
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.730
Hortensio, to what end areall these words?

561
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.370
Sir, let me be so bold asask you,

562
00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.300
did you yet ever seeBaptista's daughter?

563
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.430
No, sir, but hear I dothat he hath two,

564
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.470
the one as famous for ascolding tongue

565
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.330
as is the other forbeauteous modesty.

566
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.700
Sir, sir, the first's forme.

567
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.830
Let her go by.

568
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.430
Yea, leave that labor togreat Hercules,

569
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.570
and let it be more thanAlcides' 12.

570
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.970
Sir, understand you thisof me in sooth.

571
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.800
The youngest daughter,whom you hearken for,

572
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.030
her father keeps from allaccess of suitors

573
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.500
and will not promise herto any man

574
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.700
until the elder sisterfirst be wed.

575
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.100
The younger then is freeand not before.

576
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.470
If it be so, sir,

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:56.370
that you are the man muststead us all--

578
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.700
and me amongst the rest--

579
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.100
and if you break the iceand do this feat,

580
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.200
achieve the elder,

581
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.530
and set the younger freefor our access,

582
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:05.200
whose hap shall be to haveher

583
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.830
will not so graceless beto be ingrate.

584
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.830
Sir, you say well, andwell you do conceive,

585
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.030
and since you do professto be a suitor,

586
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.200

Why dost thou wrong herthat did ne'er wrong thee?

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.800
Oh, no.

713
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.630
You are welcome for hissake.

714
00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.100

but you will curse yourwooing.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.030

To express the like kindness,myself that have been

as cunning in Greek andLatin and other languages

727
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.770
as the other in music andmathematics.

728
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.900

But, gentle sir, methinksyou walk like a stranger.

735
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.570
May I be so bold to knowthe cause of your coming?

736
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.270
Pardon me, sir, theboldness is mine own,

737
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.400
that, being a stranger inthis city here,

738

Nor is your firm resolveunknown to me

741
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.200
in the preferment of theelder sister.

742
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.330

Holla, within.

Sirrah, lead thesegentlemen to my daughters,

760
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.470
and tell them both theseare their tutors.

761
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:28.430
Bid them use them well.

762
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.900
We will go walk a littlein the orchard, and thento dinner.

763
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.130
You are passing welcome,

764

and so I pray you all tothink yourselves.

765
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.930
Signior Baptista, mybusiness asketh haste,

766
00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.500
and every day, I cannotcome to woo.

767
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.530
You knew my father well,and in him me,

768
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.870
left solely heir to allhis lands and goods,

769
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.370
which I have better'drather than decreased.

770
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.000
Then tell me, if I getyour daughter's love,

771
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.530
what dowry shall I havewith her to wife?

772
00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:58.330
After my death, the onehalf of my lands

773
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.700
and in possession 20,000crowns.

774
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.070
And for that dowry,

775
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.670
I'll assure her of herwidowhood,

776
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.930
be it that she survive me,

777
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.130
in all my lands and leaseswhatsoever.

778
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:14.370
Let specialties betherefore drawn between us

779
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.330
that covenants may be kepton either hand.

780
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:19.970
Ay, when the special thingis well obtain'd--

781
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.270
that is, her love,

782
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.600
for that is all in all.

783
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.770
Why, that is nothing,

784
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.870
for I tell you, father,

785
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:27.970
I am as peremptory as sheproud-minded,

786
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.830
and where two raging firesmeet together,

787
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.530
they do consume the thingthat feeds their fury.

788
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.200
Though little fire growsgreat with little wind,

789
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.730
yet extreme gusts willblow out fire and all.

790
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.970
So I to her, and so sheyields to me,

791
00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:46.930
for I am rough and woo notlike a babe, hmm?

792
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.470
Well mayst thou woo, andhappy be thy speed,

793
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.430
but be thou arm'd for someunhappy words.

794
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:55.830
Ay, to the proof;

795
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.930
as mountains are forwinds,

796
00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.530
that shake not though theyblow perpetually.

797
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.800
Uh, uh, uh!

798
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.170
How now, my friend, whydost thou look so pale?

799
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:08.570
For fear, I promise you,if I look pale.

800
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.470
What, will my daughterprove a good musician?

801
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.970
Ah, uh!

802
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.370
I think she'll soonerprove a soldier.

803
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.400
Iron may hold with her butnever lutes.

804
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.530
Why, then thou canst notbreak her to the lute?

805
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.870
Why, no, for she hathbroke the lute to me.

806
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.030
I did but tell her shemistook her frets

807
00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.170
and bow'd her hand toteach her fingering

808
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.030
when, with a mostimpatient devilish spirit,

809
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.230
"Frets, call you these?"quoth she,

810
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.730
"I'll fume with them."

811
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.600
And with that word, shestruck me on the head,

812
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.100
and through the instrument,my pate made way;

813
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.370
and there I stood amazedfor a while,

814
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.600
as on a pillory, lookingthrough the lute,

815
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.700
while she did call merascal fiddler

816
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.270
and twangling Jack

817
00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:54.300
and 20 such vile terms

818
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.900
as had she studied tomisuse me so.

819
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.000
Ooh.

820
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.200
Now, by the world, it is alusty wench.

821
00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.600
I love her ten times morethan ever I did.

822
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.200
O, how I long to have somechat with her.

823
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:10.630
Well, go with me, and benot so discomfited.

824
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.500
Proceed in practise withmy younger daughter.

825
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.100
She's apt to learn andthankful for good turns.

826
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.270
Signior Petruchio, willyou go with us?

827
00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.270
Or shall I send mydaughter Kate to you?

828
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.270
I pray you do.

829
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.900
Come.

830
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:29.370
I'll attend her here...

831
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:36.770
and woo her with somespirit when she comes.

832
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.670
Say that she rail.

833
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.100
Why, then, I'll tell herplain

834
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.600
she sings as sweetly as anightingale.

835
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.270
Say that she frown.

836
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.230
I'll say she looks asclear

837
00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:00.100
as morning roses newlywash'd with dew.

838
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.400
Say she be mute and willnot speak a word.

839
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.770
Then I'll commend hervolubility

840
00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:15.470
and say she utterethpiercing eloquence.

841
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:19.500
If she do bid me pack,

842
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:24.000
I'll give her thanks asthough she bid me stay byher a week.

843
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.670
If she deny to wed,

844
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.700
I'll crave the day when Ishall ask the banns

845
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.430
and when be married.

846
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:38.700
But here she comes, andnow, Petruchio, speak.

847
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.430
Good morrow, Kate...

848
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.870
for that's your name, Ihear.

849
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:54.200
Well have you heard, butsomething hard of hearing.

850
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.530
They call me Katharinethat do talk of me.

851
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.170
You lie, in faith, for youare call'd plain Kate

852
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:07.270
and bonny Kate andsometimes Kate the cursed,

853
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.000
but Kate, the prettiestKate in Christendom,

854
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.900
Kate of Kate Hall,

855
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:13.770
my super dainty Kate,

856
00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.470
for dainties are allKates--

857
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:17.200
Ha, ha, ha!

858
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.730
And therefore, Kate,

859
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.630
take this of me, Kate ofmy consolation,

860
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.030
hearing thy mildnesspraised in every town,

861
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.000
thy virtues spoke of, andthy beauty sounded--

862
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.300
yet not so deeply as tothee belongs--

863
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.270
myself am moved to woothee for my wife.

864
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.630
"Moved"--in good time.

865
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:42.700
Let him that moved youhither remove you hence.

866
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:45.300
I knew you at the firstyou were a moveable.

867
00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.330
Why, what's a moveable?

868
00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.730
A join'd stool.

869
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.030
Thou hast hit it.

870
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.500
Come, sit on me.

871
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:59.070
Asses are made to bear,

872
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.400
and so are you.

873
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.370
Women are made to bear,

874
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.830
and so are you.

875
00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.800
No such jade as you, if meyou mean.

876
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.570
Alas, good Kate, I willnot burden thee,

877
00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.600
for, knowing thee to bebut young and light--

878
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.900
Too light for such a swainas you to catch

879
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.970
and yet as heavy as myweight should be.

880
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.470
Should be-- should--buzz--

881
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.530
Well ta'en,

882
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.400
and like a buzzard.

883
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.700
O slow-wing'd turtle,shall a buzzard take thee?

884
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.030
Ay, for a turtle, as hetakes a buzzard.

885
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:37.470
Come, come, you wasp, i'faith, you are too angry.

886
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:42.830
If I be waspish, bestbeware my sting.

887
00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.730
My remedy is then to pluckit out.

888
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.670
Ay, if the fool could findit where it lies.

889
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.800
Who knows not where a waspdoes wear his sting?

890
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.600
In his tail.

891
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.800
In his tongue.

892
00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.230
Whose tongue?

893
00:35:57.230 --> 00:36:00.230
Yours, if you talk oftails,

894
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.470
and so farewell.

895
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.270
What, with my tongue inyour tail?

896
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.830
Nay, come again, goodKate.

897
00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.270
I am a gentleman.

898
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:11.600
That I'll try.

899
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.130
Mm-hmm.

900
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:22.400
I swear I'll cuff you ifyou strike again.

901
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.100
So may you lose your arms.

902
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.630
If you strike me, you areno gentleman,

903
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:34.900
and if no gentleman, why,then, no arms.

904
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:36.230
A herald, Kate?

905
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.400
Ooh, put me in thy books.

906
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.630
What is your crest?

907
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.930
A coxcomb?

908
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:46.730
A combless cock, so Katewill be my hen.

909
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:48.370
No cock of mine.

910
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.870
You crow too like acraven.

911
00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:01.370
Er-bock, bock, bock, bock.

912
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.230
Nay, come, Kate, come.

913
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.530
You must not look so sour.

914
00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:09.670
It is my fashion when Isee a crab.

915
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:11.970
Why, here's no crab, andtherefore look not sour.

916
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.170
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

917
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.930
Oh, ho, ho, there is.

918
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.100
Bock, bock, bock, bock.

919
00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.600
Then show it me.

920
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.600
Had I a glass, I would.

921
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.930
What, you mean my face?

922
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.530
Well aim'd of such a youngone.

923
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.470
Now, by Saint George, I amtoo young for you.

924
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.070
Yet you are wither'd.

925
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:37.300
'Tis with cares.

926
00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.600
I care not.

927
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.070
Nay, hear you, Kate.

928
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.800
In sooth you scape not so.

929
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.400
I chafe you if I tarry.

930
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.130
Let me go!

931
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.270
No, not a whit.

932
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.900
I find you passing gentle.

933
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.770
'Twas told me you wererough and coy and sullen,

934
00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.630
and now I find report avery liar,

935
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.430
for thou are pleasant,gamesome, passing courteous,

936
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:00.670
but slow in speech

937
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.330
yet sweet as springtimeflowers.

938
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:06.100
Ah, thou canst not frown.

939
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.170
Thou canst not lookaskance

940
00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.000
nor bite the lip as angrywenches will,

941
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.030
nor hast thou pleasure tobe cross in talk,

942
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:17.830
but thou with mildnessentertain'st thy wooers,

943
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:21.270
with gentle conference,soft and affable.

944
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:29.700
Why does the world reportthat Kate doth limp?

945
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.430
O slanderous world.

946
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:32.900
Kate, like the hazel-twig,

947
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.470
is straight and slenderand as brown in hue

948
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.730
as hazelnuts and sweeterthan the kernels.

949
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:38.870
Let me see thee walk.

950
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:40.430
Thou dost not halt.

951
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:45.100
Go, fool, and whom thoukeep'st command.

952
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.370
Did e'er Dian so become agrove as Kate

953
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.230
this chamber with herprincely gait?

954
00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.100
O, be thou Dian, and lether be Kate,

955
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.130
and then let Kate bechaste and Dian sportful.

956
00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.770
Where did you study allthis goodly speech?

957
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:09.200
It is extempore, from mymother wit.

958
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.370
A witty mother...

959
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:15.770
witless else her son.

960
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:16.930
Am I not wise?

961
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.530
Yes; keep you warm.

962
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:28.700
Marry, so I mean, sweetKatharine, in thy bed,

963
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.970
and therefore,

964
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.470
setting all this chataside,

965
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.600
thus in plain terms.

966
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.330
Your father hath consentedthat you shall be my wife,

967
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.530

968
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.970

Now, Kate, I am a husbandfor your turn,

971

973
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.770
thou must be married to noman but me,

974
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.900
for I am he am born totame you, Kate,

975
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.600
and bring you from a wildKate

976
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.930
to a Kate conformable asother household Kates.

977
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.100
Ahem.

978
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.230
Here comes your father.

979
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:06.330
Never make denial,

980
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.770
I must and will haveKatharine to my wife.

981
00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.730
Now, Signior Petruchio, howspeed you with my daughter?

982
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.230
How but well, sir? How butwell?

983
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:15.170
It were impossible Ishould speed amiss.

984
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.030
Why, how now, daughterKatharine?

985
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.300
In your dumps?

986
00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.500
Call you me daughter?

987
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.630
Now, I promise you, you showa tender fatherly regard

988
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.270
to wish me wed to one halflunatic,

989
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:29.630
a madcap ruffian, and aswearing Jack

990
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:32.030
that thinks with oaths toface the matter out.

991
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.370
Bock, bock.

992
00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.330
Father, 'tis thus,

993
00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.400
yourself and all the worldthat talk'd of her

994
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.630
have talk'd amiss of her.

995
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.770
Bock, bock.

996
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.330
If she be cursed, it isfor policy,

997
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.130
for she's not froward butmodest as the dove.

998
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.270
She is not hot buttemperate as the morn.

999
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.700
For patience, she willprove a second Grissel

1000
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.230
and Roman Lucrece for herchastity;

1001
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.470
and to conclude, we haveagreed so well together

1002
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.900
that upon Sunday is thewedding day.

1003
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.400
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,ho.

1004
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.200
I'll see thee hang'd onSunday first.

1005
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.400
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1006
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.800
Hark, Petruchio,

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.630
she says she'll see theehang'd first.

1008
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:10.000
Is this your speeding?

1009

I choose her for myself.

1012
00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.870
If she and I be pleased,what's that to you?

1013
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:25.000
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt ustwain, being alone,

that she shall still becursed in company.

1015

Oh, I tell you, 'tisincredible to believe

1016
00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:33.170
how much she loves me.

1017
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:34.400
O, the kindest Kate,

'Tis age that nourisheth.

1066
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.730
Ah, but youth in ladies'eyes that flourisheth.

1067
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.930
Content you, gentlemen.

1068
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:17.300
I will compound thisstrife.

1069
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.070
'Tis deeds must win theprize,

1070
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:22.500
and he of both that canassure my daughtergreatest dower

1071
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.330
shall have my Bianca'slove.

1072
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:32.970
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1073
00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:34.530
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1074
00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.730
Oh, say, Signior Gremio,what can you assure her?

1075
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:42.370
Oh.

1076
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:45.030
First, as you know,

1077
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.330
my house within the city

1078
00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.630
is richly furnished withplate and gold,

1079
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.770
basins and ewers to laveher dainty hands,

1080
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.570
my hangings all of Tyriantapestry.

1081
00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.470
In ivory coffers, I havestuff'd my crowns,

1082
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.700
in cypress chests, myarras counterpoints,

1083
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:06.100
costly apparel, tents, andcanopies,

1084
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.500
fine linen,

1085
00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.870
Turkey cushions boss'dwith pearl,

1086
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.930
valance of Venice gold inneedlework,

1087
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:14.730
pewter and brass and allthings

1088
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.570
that belong to house orhousekeeping.

1089
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.730
Ahem.

1090
00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.870
Then, at my farm,

1091
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.900
I have a hundredmilch-kine to the pail,

1092
00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:28.830
sixscore fat oxen standingin my stalls,

1093
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.770
and all things answerableto this portion.

1094
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.130
Myself am struck in years,I must confess,

1095
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.200
and if I die tomorrow,this is hers

1096
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.300
if, whilst I live, shewill be only mine.

1097
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:43.930
That "only" came well in.

1098
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.470
Sir, list to me.

1099
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.600
I am my father's heir andonly son.

1100
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:51.370
If I may have yourdaughter to my wife,

1101
00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.530
I'll leave her housesthree or four as good

1102
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:54.730
within rich Pisa's walls

1103
00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.800
as any one Old SigniorGremio has in Padua

1104
00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.930
beside 2,000 ducats by theyear of fruitful land,

1105
00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.200
all which shall be herjointure.

1106
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.270
What, have I pinch'd you,Signior Gremio?

1107
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:10.100
2,000 ducats by the yearof land.

1108
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.530
My land amounts not to somuch in all.

1109
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:16.730
That she shall havebesides an argosy

1110
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.700
that now is lying inMarseilles' road.

1111
00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.430
What, have I choked youwith an argosy?

1112
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.730
Gremio, 'tis known myfather

1113
00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.570
hath no less than 3 greatargosies

1114
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.530
beside 2 galliasses and 12tight galleys.

1115
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:33.730
These I will assure her

1116
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:37.330
and twice as much whate'erthou offer'st next.

1117
00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:39.370
Nay, I have offer'd all.

1118
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.900
I have no more,

1119
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.500
and she can have no morethan all I have.

1120
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:47.300
If you like me, she shallhave me and mine.

1121
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.300
Why, then the maid is minefrom all the world

1122
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.430
by your firm promise.

1123
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.600
Gremio is out-vied.

1124
00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.330
I must confess, your offeris the best,

1125
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.900
and let your father makeher the assurance,

1126
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.070
she is your own,

1127
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.300
else, you must pardon me,

1128
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.770
if you should die beforehim, where's her dower?

1129
00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.000
That's but a cavil.

1130
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
He is old; I, young.

1131
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.330
And may not young men dieas well as old?

1132
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.030
Well, gentlemen,

1133
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.430
I am thus resolved.

1134
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.870
On Sunday next, you knowmy daughter Katharine

1135
00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:21.030
is to be married.

1136
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.130
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1137
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:23.700
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

1138
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.070
Now, on the Sundayfollowing shall Bianca bebride to you

1139
00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.800
if you make thisassurance.

1140
00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:34.370
If not, to Signior Gremio.

1141
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:39.330
And so, I take my leave...

1142
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.600
and thank you both.

1143
00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.530
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,ha, ha, ha.

1144
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.900
Adieu, good neighbor.

1145
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.470
Now I fear thee not.

1146
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.300
Sirrah young gamester,

1147
00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.530
your father were a fool togive thee all

1148
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:02.000
and in his waning age setfoot under thy table.

1149
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.300
Tut, a toy!

1150
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.830
An old Italian fox is notso kind, my boy.

1151
00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.770
A vengeance on your craftywither'd hide!

1152
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.230
Yet I have faced it with acard of ten.

1153
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.830
'Tis in my head to do mymaster good.

1154
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.100
Oh, I see no reason butsupposed Lucentio

1155
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.070
must get a father call'd"supposed Vincentio,"

1156
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.330
and that's a wonder.

1157
00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.030
Fathers commonly do gettheir children,

1158
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.200
but in this case ofwooing,

1159
00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.030
a child shall get a sire ifI fail not of my cunning.

1160
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.400
Fiddler, forbear.

1161
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.770
You grow too forward, sir.

1162
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.730
Have you so soon forgotthe entertainment

1163
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.770
her sister Katharinewelcomed you withal?

1164
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.130
Ooh, but, wranglingpedant,

1165
00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.230
this is the patroness ofheavenly harmony.

1166
00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:03.100
Then give me leave to haveprerogative,

1167
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.970
and when in music, we havespent an hour,

1168
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:07.030
your lecture shall haveleisure for as much.

1169
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.170
Preposterous ass thatnever read so far

1170
00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.170
to know the cause whymusic was ordain'd.

1171
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.970
Was it not to refresh themind of man

1172
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.300
after his studies or hisusual pain?

1173
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.130
Then give me leave to readphilosophy,

1174
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.370
and while I pause, servein your harmony.

1175
00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.570
Sirrah, I will not bearthese braves of thine.

1176
00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:23.300
Oh, you--

1177
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.900
Why, gentlemen, you do medouble wrong

1178
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.200
to strive for that whichresteth in my choice.

1179
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.030
I am no breeching scholarin the schools.

1180
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.000
I'll not be tied to hoursnor 'pointed times

1181
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.600
but learn my lessons as Iplease myself.

1182
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.470
And to cut off all strife,here sit we down.

1183
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:45.470
Ah.

1184
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.730
Take you your instrument,and play you the whiles.

1185
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.800
His lecture will be doneere you have tuned.

1186
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.770
You'll leave his lecturewhen I am in tune?

1187
00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:55.870
That will be never.

1188
00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:57.030
Tune your instrument.

1189
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.970
Where left we last?

1190
00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.800
Here, madam:

1191
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:11.600
"Hic ibat Simois; hic estSigeia tellus;

1192
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.300
Hic steterat Priami regiacelsa senis."

1193
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.370
Construe them.

1194
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.170
"Hic ibat"--

1195
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:25.170
As I told you before--

1196
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:26.870
"Simois"--

1197
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:29.500
I am Lucentio--

1198
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.730
"Hic est"--

1199
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:34.230
son unto Vincentio ofPisa--

1200
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.330
"sigeia tellus"--

1201
00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:41.330
disguised thus to get yourlove--

1202
00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.430
"Hic steterat"--

1203
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:46.270
and that Lucentio thatcomes a-wooing--

1204
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.730
"Priami"--

1205
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.530
is my man Tranio--

1206
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.030
"regia"--

1207
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:54.130
bearing my port--

1208
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:55.670
"celsa senis."

1209
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.730
that we might beguile theold pantaloon.

1210
00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.730
Madam, my instrument's intune.

1211
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.000
O, let's hear.

1212
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.330
O fie, the treble jars.

1213
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.130
Spit in the hole, man, andtune again.

1214
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.430
Tsk.

1215
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.800
Now let me see if I canconstrue it.

1216
00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.670
"Hic ibat Simois"--

1217
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.700
I know you not.

1218
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.470
"Hic est Sigeia tellus"--

1219
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.500
I trust you not.

1220
00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.470
"Hic steterat Priami"--

1221
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:29.000
Take heed he hear us not.

1222
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.270
"regia"--

1223
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:31.570
Hmm.

1224
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.900
Presume not.

1225
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.300
"celsa senis."

1226
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.600
Despair not.

1227
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.800
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

1228
00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.000
All but the base.

1229
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.330
The base is right.

1230
00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:45.600
'Tis the base knave thatjars.

1231
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.970
How fiery and forward ourpedant is.

1232
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.700
Now, for my life, theknave doth court my love.

1233
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.370
Pedascule, I'll watch youbetter yet.

1234
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.500
In time I may believe, yetI mistrust.

1235
00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.900
Mistrust it not,

1236
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.230
for, sure, Aeacides wasAjax,

1237
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.970
call'd so from hisgrandfather.

1238
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:07.800
I must believe my master,else, I promise you,

1239
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.730
I should be arguing stillupon that doubt.

1240
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.600
But let it rest.

1241
00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.670
Now, Licio, to you.

1242
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.170
Good master, take it notunkindly, pray,

1243
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:20.630
that I have been thuspleasant with you both.

1244
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:23.770
You may go walk and giveme leave a while, hmm?

1245
00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.100
My lessons make no musicin three parts.

1246
00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.370
Are you so formal, sir?

1247
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:33.900
Well, I must wait andwatch withal,

1248
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.430
for but I be deceived,

1249
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:38.100
our fine musician growethamorous.

1250
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.500
Madam, before you touchthe instrument,

1251
00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.830
to learn the order of myfingering,

1252
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.170
I must begin withrudiments of art,

1253
00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:48.800
to teach you gamut in abriefer sort,

1254
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.130
more pleasant, pithy, andeffectual,

1255
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.730
than hath been taught byany of my trade;

1256
00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:57.430
and there it is inwriting, fairly drawn.

1257
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.570
Why, I am past my gamutlong ago.

1258
00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:03.530
But read the gamut ofHortensio.

1259
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.430
Read it.

1260
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:13.100
"'Gamut'-- I am the groundof all accord--

1261
00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:16.070
"'A re'-- to pleadHortensio's passion.

1262
00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:19.630
"'B mi'-- Bianca, take himfor thy lord--

1263
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:24.970
"'C fa ut'-- that loveswith all affection.

1264
00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:28.700
"'D sol re'-- One clef,two notes have I.

1265
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:32.200
'E la mi'-- Show pity, orI die."

1266
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:35.330
Call you this gamut?

1267
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:37.230
I like it not:

1268
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.770
Old fashions please mebest.

1269
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.600
I am not so nice as tochange true rules

1270
00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.930
for old inventions.

1271
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.430
Mistress,

1272
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.400
your father prays you,leave your books

1273
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.430
and help to dress yoursister's chamber up.

1274
00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:56.730
You know tomorrow is thewedding-day.

1275
00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:04.570
Farewell, sweet mastersboth.

1276
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.900
I must be gone.

1277
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:07.900
Oh.

1278
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.430
Faith, mistress, then Ihave no cause to stay.

1279
00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:26.200
But I have cause to pryinto this pedant.

1280
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.470
Methinks he looks asthough he were in love.

1281
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.330
Yet if thy thoughts,Bianca, be so humble

1282
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:35.730
to cast thy wandering eyeson any stale,

1283
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.600
seize thee that list.

1284
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.700
If once I find theeranging,

1285
00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.000
Hortensio will be quitwith thee by changing.

1286
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.070
Signior Lucentio, this isthe 'pointed day

1287
00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.370
that Katharina and Petruchioshould be married,

1288
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:11.170
and yet we hear not of ourson-in-law.

1289
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.300
What will be said?

1290
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:13.470
What mockery will it be

1291
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.670
to want the bridegroomwhen the priest attends

1292
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.100
to speak the ceremonialrites of marriage?

1293
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.870
What says Lucentio to thisshame of ours?

1294
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:21.970
No shame but mine.

1295
00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:23.400
I must, forsooth, be forced

1296
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.270
to give my hand opposedagainst my heart

1297
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:27.400
unto a mad-brained rudesbyfull of spleen

1298
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.730
who woos in haste andmeans to wed at leisure.

1299
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.370
I told you, I, he was afrantic fool,

1300
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.300
hiding his bitter jests inblunt behavior,

1301
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.800
and to be noted for amerry man,

1302
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:40.100
he'll woo a thousand,'point the day of marriage,

1303
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.600
make feasts, invite friends,and proclaim the banns,

1304
00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.400
yet never means to wedwhere he hath woo'd.

1305
00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.500
Now must the world pointat poor Katharine

1306
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.830
and say, "Lo, there is madPetruchio's wife,

1307
00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.500
if it would please himcome and marry her."

1308
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.730
Patience, good Katharine,and Baptista too.

1309
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:57.730
Upon my life, Petruchiomeans but well

1310
00:54:57.730 --> 00:54:59.700
whatever fortune stays himfrom his word.

1311
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:01.800
Though he be blunt, I knowhim passing wise.

1312
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.870
Though he be merry, yetwithal, he's honest.

1313
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:05.900
Would Katharine had neverseen him though.

1314
00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.500
Go, girl.

1315
00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.030
I cannot blame thee now toweep,

1316
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.000
for such an injury wouldvex a very saint,

1317
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.300
much more a shrew of thyimpatient humor.

1318
00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:15.230
Master, master, news,

1319
00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:17.070
and such old news as younever heard of.

1320
00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:18.170
Is it new and old too?

1321
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.370
How may that be?

1322
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.670
Why, is it not news to hearof Petruchio's coming?

1323
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:22.770
Is he come?

1324
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:23.870
Why, no, sir.

1325
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:24.970
What then?

1326
00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.130
He's coming.

1327
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.370
When will he be here?

1328
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:29.400
When he stands where I amand sees you there.

1329
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.700
But say, what to thine oldnews?

1330
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.430
Why, Petruchio is comingin a new hat

1331
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:36.000
and an old jerkin, a pair ofold breeches thrice turned,

1332
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.070
a pair of boots that havebeen candle-cases,

1333
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:39.470
one buckled, another laced,

1334
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:42.400
an old rusty sword ta'enout of the town armorywith a broken hilt

1335
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.230
and chapeless with twobroken points,

1336
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:46.170
his horse hipped with anold mothy saddle

1337
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:49.300
and stirrups of no kindred;besides, possessed with theglanders

1338
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.870
and like to mose in the chine,troubled with the lampas,

1339
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:54.100
infected with the fashions,full of windgalls,

1340
00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.970
sped with spavins, rayedwith yellows,

1341
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:58.570
past cure of the fives, starkspoiled with the staggers,

1342
00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:01.600
begnawn with the bots,swayed in the back andshoulder-shotten,

1343
00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.830
near-legged before andwith a half-checked bit

1344
00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:05.430
and a headstall of sheep'sleather

1345
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.870
which, being restrained tokeep him from stumbling,

1346
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.200
hath been often burst andnow repaired with knots;

1347
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.930
one girth six-times pieced anda woman's crupper of velure

1348
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:15.630
which hath two letters forher name fairly set downin studs

1349
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:17.700
and here and there piecedwith packthread.

1350
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.070
Who comes with him?

1351
00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:21.770
O, sir, his lackey, forall the world caparisonedlike the horse,

1352
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.070
with a linen stock on one leg

1353
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:24.800
and a kersey boot-hose onthe other,

1354
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.670
gartered with a red andblue list, yeah;

1355
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.500
an old hat and "the humorof 40 fancies"

1356
00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:29.870
pricked in't for a feather:

1357
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:31.930
a monster, a very monsterin apparel,

1358
00:56:31.930 --> 00:56:33.770
and not like a Christianfootboy

1359
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:35.130
or a gentleman's lackey.

1360
00:56:35.130 --> 00:56:38.270
'Tis some odd humor prickshim to this fashion,

1361
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.230
yet oftentimes, he goesbut mean-apparell'd.

1362
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:45.570
I am glad he's comes,howsoe'er he comes.

1363
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:46.770
Why, sir, he comes not.

1364
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.930
Oh!

1365
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.730
Oh, didst thou not say hecomes?

1366
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:51.030
Who? That Petruchio came?

1367
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.330
Ay, that Petruchio came!

1368
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:54.900
No, sir, I say his horsecomes, with him on his back.

1369
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.000
Why, that's all one.

1370
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.100
Nay, by Saint Jamy,

1371
00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:58.270
I hold you a penny,

1372
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:00.470
a horse and a man is morethan one

1373
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:02.070
and yet not many.

1374
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.370
Where be these gallants?

1375
00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:04.470
Who's at home?

1376
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:05.570
Ha, ha!

1377
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:10.100
You are welcome, sir.

1378
00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.200
And yet I come not well.

1379
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.670
And yet you halt not.

1380
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:15.800
Not so well apparell'd asI wish you were.

1381
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:18.030
Were it not better, Ishould rush in thus.

1382
00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:19.200
But where is Kate?

1383
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.670
Where is my lovely bride?

1384
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.530
How does my father?

1385
00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:26.830
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1386
00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:28.470
Gentles, methinks youfrown,

1387
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.530
and wherefore gaze thisgoodly company

1388
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.670
as if they saw somewondrous monument,

1389
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:35.200
some comet, or unusualprodigy?

1390
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:39.370
Why, sir, you know this isyour wedding day.

1391
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.900
First, we were sad, fearingyou would not come,

1392
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:46.570
now sadder that you comeso unprovided.

1393
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:50.200
Fie, doff this habit,shame to your estate,

1394
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.170
an eyesore to our solemnfestival.

1395
00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:53.830
And tell us what occasionof import

1396
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:55.870
hath all so long detain'dyou from your wife

1397
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.730
and sent you hither sounlike yourself?

1398
00:57:57.730 --> 00:57:59.670
Tedious it were to telland harsh to hear.

1399
00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:01.870
Sufficeth, I am come tokeep my word,

1400
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:03.800
though in some partenforced to digress,

1401
00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.200
which, at more leisure, Ishall so explain

1402
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.230
as you shall well besatisfied withal.

1403
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:10.000
But where is Kate?

1404
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.170
I stay too long from her.

1405
00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.270
The morning wears.

1406
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:13.570
'Tis time we were atchurch.

1407
00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.930
See not your bride inthese unreverent robes.

1408
00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.200
Go--go--go to my chamber.

1409
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:18.570
Put on clothes of mine.

1410
00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:19.770
Not I, believe me.

1411
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:20.930
Thus, I'll visit her.

1412
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.270
But thus, I trust, youwill not marry her.

1413
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.870
Good sooth, even so.

1414
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:26.370
Therefore, ha' done withwords.

1415
00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:30.730
To me she's married, notunto my clothes.

1416
00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:32.500
Could I repair what shewill wear in me

1417
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:34.470
as I can change these pooraccoutrements,

1418
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.400
'twere well for me andbetter for my Kate.

1419
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1420
00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.470
But what a fool am I tochat with you

1421
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:41.670
when I should bid goodmorrow to my bride

1422
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.170
and seal the title with alovely kiss.

1423
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:46.170
Ah!

1424
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:53.070
He hath some meaning inhis mad attire.

1425
00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.830
We will persuade him, beit possible,

1426
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:56.500
put on better ere he go tochurch.

1427
00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.530
I'll after him and see theevent of this.

1428
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.630
But to her love concerneth usto add her father's liking

1429
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:10.430
which, to bring to pass,as I before unparted toyour worship,

1430
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:11.630
I am to get a man.

1431
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:12.830
Eh?

1432
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:14.500
Whate'er he be, it skillsnot much.

1433
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.730
We'll fit him to our turn,

1434
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:17.300
and he shall be Vincentioof Pisa

1435
00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:18.870
and make assurance here inPadua

1436
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.630
of greater sums than Ihave promised.

1437
00:59:20.630 --> 00:59:22.400
So shall you quietly enjoyyour hope

1438
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.170
and marry sweet Biancawith consent.

1439
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:26.030
Were it not that my fellowschoolmaster

1440
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:27.900
doth watch Bianca's stepsso narrowly,

1441
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.100
'twere good, methinks, tosteal our marriage,

1442
00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.400
which once perform'd-- letall the world say no--

1443
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.430
I'll keep mine own despiteof all the world.

1444
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:36.330
That by degrees we mean tolook into

1445
00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:38.200
and watch our vantage inthis business.

1446
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.130
We'll overreach thegraybeard, Gremio,

1447
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:41.870
the narrow-prying father,Minola,

1448
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.030
the quaint musician,amorous Licio

1449
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:47.600
all for my master's sake,Lucentio.

1450
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.470
Oh, Signior Gremio, cameyou from the church?

1451
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:53.900
Oh, as willingly as e'er Icame from school.

1452
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.670
And is the bride andbridegroom coming home?

1453
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:57.830
Bridegroom say you?

1454
00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.630
'Tis a groom indeed, agrumbling groom,

1455
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.100
and that the girl shallfind.

1456
01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.500
Curseder than she?

1457
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:04.670
Why, it is impossible.

1458
01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:07.230
Why, he's a devil, adevil, a very fiend.

1459
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:10.800
Why, she's a devil, adevil, the devil's dam.

1460
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.670
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove,a fool to him.

1461
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.330
I'll tell you, SirLucentio,

1462
01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:19.000
when the priest should ask ifKatharine should be his wife,

1463
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.500
"Ay, by gogs-wouns," quothhe and swore so loud

1464
01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.600
that, all-amazed, thepriest let fall the book,

1465
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.900
and as he stoop'd again totake it up,

1466
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.800
this mad-brain'd bridegroomtook him such a cuff

1467
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.870
that down fell priest andbook and book and priest.

1468
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:36.770
"Now take them up," quothhe, "if any list."

1469
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.600
What said the wench whenhe rose again?

1470
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:43.200
Trembled and shook, for,why, he stamp'd and swore

1471
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.200
as if the vicar meant tocozen him.

1472
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:50.230
But after many ceremoniesdone, he calls for wine.

1473
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.870
"Her health," quoth he asif he had been aboard,

1474
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:55.570
carousing to his matesafter a storm,

1475
01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.100
quaff'd off the muscadel

1476
01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.270
and threw the sops all inthe sexton's face,

1477
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.730
having no other reason

1478
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:04.630
but that his beard grewthin and hungerly

1479
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.570
and seem'd to ask him sopsas he was drinking.

1480
01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.030
This done, he took thebride about the neck

1481
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:14.130
and kiss'd her lips withsuch a clamorous smack

1482
01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:16.930
that at the parting allthe church did echo,

1483
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:21.170
and, I, seeing this camethence for very shame,

1484
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:23.370
and after me, I know, therout is coming.

1485
01:01:23.370 --> 01:01:26.230
Such a mad marriage neverwas before.

1486
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:28.100
Hark, hark, I hear theminstrels play.

1487
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.430

Ay, sir, they be ready.

1512
01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.900
The oats have eaten thehorses.

1513
01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:16.300
Nay, then, do what thoucanst.

1514

O Kate, content thee.

Prithee, be not angry.

1524
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:39.630
I will be angry!

1525
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.070
What hast thou to do?

1526
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.770
Father, be quiet!

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.470
if she had not a spirit toresist.

1532
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:57.970
They shall go forward,Kate, at thy command.

1533

I will be master of whatis mine own.

She is my goods, mychattels.

Touch her whoever dare.

Grumio, draw forth thyweapon.

Rescue thy mistress ifthou be a man.

Nay, let them go.

1554
01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:58.830
A couple of quiet ones.

Went--went they not quickly,I should die with laughing.

1556
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.000
Of all mad matches, neverwas the like.

1557
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.200
Mistress, what's youropinion of your sister?

1558

Oh, that being mad herself,she's madly mated.

Fie, fie on all tiredjades, on all mad masters,

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.870
and all foul ways.

1571
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:31.800
Was ever a man so beaten?

1572
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.270
Was ever man so rayed?

1573
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:36.370
Was ever man so weary?

1574
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.170

Who is that calls socoldly?

1583
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:07.000
A piece of ice.

1584
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.370
A fire, good Curtis.

1585
01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.300
Is my master and his wifecoming, Grumio?

1586

Ay, Curtis, ay, andtherefore fire, fire.

1587
01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.500
Cast on no water.

1588
01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:17.000
Is she so hot a shrew asshe's reported?

1589
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.530
She was, good Curtis,before this frost,

1590
01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:20.870
but wilt thou make a fire,

1591
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.830
or shall I complain onthee to our mistress

1592
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:24.800
for being slow in thy hotoffice?

1593
01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.200
I prithee, good Grumio, tellme, how goes the world?

1594
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.470
A cold world, Curtis, inevery office but thine,

1595
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:32.730
and therefore, fire.

1596
01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:34.130
Do thy duty, and have thyduty,

1597
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:36.630
for my master and mistressare almost frozen to death.

1598
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.230
There's fire ready.

1599
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.900
Therefore, good Grumio,the news.

1600
01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.270
Why, "Jack, boy; ho, boy,"and as much news as I wilt.

1601
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:46.200
Come, you are so full ofcony-catching.

1602
01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.700
And therefore fire, for Ihave caught extreme cold.

1603
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:54.870
Where's the cook?

1604
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:57.630
Is supper ready, the housetrimmed,

1605
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:59.930
rushes strewed, cobwebsswept?

1606
01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:01.870
Carpets laid, andeverything in order?

1607
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:03.030
All ready.

1608
01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:05.730
Therefore, good Grumio, Ipray thee, the news.

1609
01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.930
First, know my horse istired,

1610
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.000
my master and mistressfallen out.

1611
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.230
How?

1612
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:13.900
Out of their saddles intothe dirt.

1613
01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:15.530
Thereby hangs a tale.

1614
01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.930
Let's hear it, goodGrumio.

1615
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:19.270
Lend thine ear.

1616
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:20.370
Here.

1617
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.600
There.

1618
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.470
This is to feel a tale,not to hear a tale.

1619
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:25.500
And therefore 'tis calleda sensible tale,

1620
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.370
and this cuff was but toknock at your ear

1621
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.630
and beseech it listening.

1622
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:30.030
Now I begin.

1623
01:07:30.030 --> 01:07:33.100
Imprimis, we came down afoul hill,

1624
01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.330
my master riding behind mymistress--

1625
01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:36.500
Both of one horse?

1626
01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.670
What's that to thee?

1627
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:40.070
Why, a horse.

1628
01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:43.470
Tell thou the tale, buthadst thou not crossed me,

1629
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:45.530
thou shouldst have heardhow her horse fell,

1630
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.170
and she under her horse.

1631
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.930
Thou shouldst have heardin how miry a place,

1632
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:51.170
how she was bemoiled,

1633
01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.200
how he left her with thehorse upon her,

1634
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.170
how he beat me because herhorse stumbled,

1635
01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:58.100
how she waded through thedirt to pluck him off me,

1636
01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.270
how he swore, how she prayedthat never prayed before,

1637
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:04.170
how I cried, how thehorses ran away,

1638
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:05.730
how her bridle was burst,

1639
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.570
how I lost my crupper withmany things of worthy memory

1640
01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.770
which now shall die inoblivion

1641
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:13.370
and thou returnunexperienced to the grave.

1642
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:15.600
By this reckoning, he ismore shrew than she.

1643
01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:17.670
Ay, and that thou and theproudest of you all

1644
01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:19.970
shall find when he comeshome,

1645
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.970
but what talk I of this?

1646
01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:27.430
Call forth Nathaniel,Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,

1647
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.200
Walter, Sugarsop, and therest.

1648
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.400
Are they ready?

1649
01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.530
They are.

1650
01:08:31.530 --> 01:08:32.730
Call them forth.

1651
01:08:32.730 --> 01:08:33.930
Do you hear, ho?

1652
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:36.330
You must meet my master tocountenance my mistress.

1653
01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:37.500
She has a face of her own.

1654
01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.730
Who knows not that?

1655
01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:41.430
Thou, it seems, that calls forcompany to countenance her.

1656
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:42.900
I call them forth tocredit her.

1657
01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.630
She comes to borrownothing of them.

1658
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:46.330
Welcome home, Grumio.

1659
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:47.430

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:48.530

01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:49.700
How now, old lad?

1662
01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:54.700
Welcome, you--how now, you--what, you--fellow, you--

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:06.200

E'en at hand, andtherefore be not--

cock's passion, silence!

1670
01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:14.570
I hear my master.

1671
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:17.170
What, no man at door tohold my stirrup nor totake my horse?

1672
01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:19.170
- Where is Nathaniel? -Here, sir.

1673
01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.170
- Gregory? - Here, sir.

1674
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:23.400
- Philip? - Here, sir.

1675
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.500
Here, sir; here, sir;here, sir; here, sir!

1676
01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.800
You logger-headed andunpolish'd grooms.

1677
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:34.130
What, no attendance?

1678
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:35.430
No regard?

1679
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.330
No duty?

1680
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:48.130
Where is the foolish knaveI sent before?

1681
01:09:48.130 --> 01:09:50.230
Here, sir, as foolish as Iwas before.

1682
01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:55.270
You peasant swain, youwhoreson malt-horse drudge!

1683
01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.870
Did I not bid thee meet mein the park

1684
01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.070
and bring along theserascal knaves with thee?

1685
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:04.100
Nathaniel's coat, sir, wasnot fully made.

1686
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.300
Gabriel's pumps were allunpink'd i' the heel,

1687
01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.330
and there was no link tocolour Peter's hat,

1688
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:10.630
and Walter's dagger wasnot come from sheathing.

1689
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.930
There was none fine butAdam, Ralph, and Gregory.

1690
01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:15.530
The rest were ragged, old, andbeggarly, yet as they are,

1691
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:17.100
here are they come to meetyou, sir!

1692
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:22.830
Shh!

Go, rascals, go, and fetchmy supper in.

1694
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.700
Where is the life thatlate I led--

1695
01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:34.030
Where are those--

1696
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:37.300
Sit down, Kate, andwelcome.

Food, food, food!

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.600

1705

You villains, when?

1706
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:04.770
It was the friar of ordersgray,

1707
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:08.130
an he forth walked on hisway.

1708
01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:09.330
Ouch, you rogue,

1709
01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.830
you pluck my foot awry.

1710
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:16.170
Take that, and mend theplucking off the other.

1711
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:17.270
Be merry, Kate.

1717
01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:43.730
Where are my slippers?

1718
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.030
Shall I have some water?

1719
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:48.030
Ugh.

Come, Kate, and wash andwelcome heart--oh!

1721
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.800
Whoreson villain!

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.970
Will you let it fall?

1723
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:57.230
Patience, I pray you.

1724
01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:58.430
'Twas a fault unwilling.

1725
01:11:58.430 --> 01:12:03.430
A whoreson beetle-headed,flap-ear'd knave.

1726
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:05.670
Come, Kate, sit down.

1727
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:06.830
I know you have a stomach.

1728
01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:13.530
Will you give thanks,sweet Kate?

1729
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.670
Or else shall I?

1730
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:15.700
What's this?

1731
01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.700
Mutton?

1732
01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.630
Ay.

1733
01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:20.800
Who brought it?

1734
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.930
I.

1735
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.170
'Tis burnt--

1736
01:13:23.170 --> 01:13:24.370
Ah, ah!

1737
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.370
And so is all the meat.

1738
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:31.830
What dogs are these?

1739
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.300
Where is the rascal cook?

1740
01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:38.070
How durst you, villains,bring it from the dresser,

1741
01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:42.300
and serve it thus to methat love it not?

1742
01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:46.630
Theretake it to you,trenchers, cups, and all...

1743
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.570
you heedless joltheads andunmanner'd slaves.

1744
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:54.830
Do you grumble?

1745
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.570
I'll be with you straight.

1746
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:59.130
I pray you, husband, benot so disquiet.

1747
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.170

And dried away, and I expresslyam forbid to touch it,

1752
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:14.130
for it engenders choler,planteth anger,

1753
01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:16.970
and better 'twere thatboth of us did fast--

1754
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:19.200
since, of ourselves,ourselves are choleric--

1755
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.830
than feed it with suchover-roasted flesh.

1756
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:24.900
Uck.

1757
01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:26.170

Come, I will bring thee tothy bridal chamber.

1762
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:17.300
Didst ever see the like?

1763
01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:18.930
He kills her in her ownhumor.

1764
01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.670
Where is he?

1765
01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:33.970
In her chamber, making asermon of continency to her

1766
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:38.570
and rails and swears andrates that she, poor soul,

1767
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:41.400
knows not which way tostand, to look, to speak,

1768
01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.500
and sits as one new-risenfrom a dream.

1769
01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.300
Away, away, for he iscoming hither.

1770
01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.330
Thus have I politiclybegun my reign...

1771
01:16:22.130 --> 01:16:25.270
and 'tis my hope to endsuccessfully.

1772
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:36.200
My falcon now is sharp andpassing empty...

1773
01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:41.030
until she stoop, she mustnot be full-gorged,

1774
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:44.000
for then she never looksupon her lure.

1775
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:51.470
Another way I have to manmy haggard,

1776
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:55.130
to make her come and knowher keeper's call--

1777
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:59.170
that is, to watch her aswe watch these kites

1778
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:04.130
that bate and beat andwill not be obedient.

1779
01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.630
She eat no meat today nornone shall eat.

1780
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:15.400
Last night, she slept notnor tonight she shall not.

1781
01:17:18.970 --> 01:17:20.470
As with the meat,

1782
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:28.270
some undeserved fault I'll findabout the making of the bed,

1783
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:31.970
and here I'll fling thepillow, there the bolster,

1784
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:34.600
this way the coverlet,another way the sheets.

1785
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:38.770
Ay, and amid this hurly, Iintend that all is done

1786
01:17:38.770 --> 01:17:42.970
in reverend care of her,

1787
01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:47.300
and in conclusion, sheshall watch all night,

1788
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:54.700
and if she chance to nod,I'll rail and brawl

1789
01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.530
and with the clamor keepher still awake.

1790
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:03.970
This is a way to kill awife with kindness,

1791
01:18:03.970 --> 01:18:11.430
and thus, I'll curb hermad and headstrong humor.

1792
01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.670
He that knows better howto tame a shrew,

1793
01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:21.100
now let him speak.

1794
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:25.500
'Tis charity to show.

1795
01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:31.200
Is't possible, friendLicio, that Mistress Bianca

1796
01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.030
doth fancy any other butLucentio?

1797
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:35.470
I tell you, sir, she bearsme fair in hand.

1798
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.430
Sir, to satisfy you inwhat I said,

1799
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.400
stand by and mark themanner of his teaching.

1800
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:51.600
Now, mistress, profit youin what you read?

1801
01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.970
What, sir, read you?

1802
01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.230
First resolve me that.

1803
01:18:55.230 --> 01:19:00.300
I read that I profess, theArt to Love.

1804
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.430
And may you prove, sir,master of your art.

1805
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:07.830
While you, sweet dear,prove mistress of my heart.

1806
01:19:20.670 --> 01:19:22.570
Quick proceeders, marry.

1807
01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:24.270
Now, tell me, I pray,

1808
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:26.470
you that durst swear atyour mistress Bianca

1809
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.530
loved none in the world sowell as Lucentio.

1810
01:19:28.530 --> 01:19:31.770
Despiteful love,unconstant womankind.

1811
01:19:31.770 --> 01:19:34.070
I tell thee, Licio, thisis wonderful.

1812
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:35.400
Mistake no more.

1813
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.230
I am not Licio nor amusician as I seem to be

1814
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:40.300
but one that scorn to livein this disguise

1815
01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.030
for such a one as leaves agentleman

1816
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:43.630
and makes a god of such acullion.

1817
01:19:43.630 --> 01:19:45.730
Know, sir, that I amcall'd Hortensio.

1818
01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:49.130
Signior Hortensio, I haveoften heard

1819
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.400
of your entire affectionto Bianca,

1820
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:53.700
and since mine eyes arewitness of her lightness,

1821
01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:56.230
I will with you if you beso contented

1822
01:19:56.230 --> 01:20:00.130
forswear Bianca and herlove forever.

1823
01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:02.500
O, see how they kiss andcourt.

1824
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.470
Signior Lucentio, here ismy hand,

1825
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:05.800
and here I firmly vow

1826
01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.700
never to woo her no morebut do forswear her

1827
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.530
as one unworthy all theformer favors

1828
01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:12.500
that I have fondlyflatter'd her withal.

1829
01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.700
And here I take theunfeigned oath

1830
01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.470
never to marry with herthough she would entreat.

1831
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:19.000
Fie on her.

1832
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.070
O, see how beastly shedoth court him.

1833
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:24.470
O, would all the world buthe had quite forsworn.

1834
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:27.970
For me, that I may surelykeep my vow,

1835
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:30.030
I will be married to awealthy widow

1836
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:32.770
ere three days pass thathath as long loved me

1837
01:20:32.770 --> 01:20:35.600
as I have loved this prouddisdainful haggard.

1838
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.970
And so farewell, SigniorLucentio.

1839
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:40.230
Kindness in women, nottheir beauteous looks,

1840
01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:41.530
shall win my love,

1841
01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:45.200
and so I take my leave inresolution as I swore before.

1842
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.330
Resolution-- resolution--

1843
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:52.630
Mistress Bianca, bless youwith such grace

1844
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:54.470
as 'longeth to a lover'sblessed case.

1845
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.870
Nay, I have ta'en younapping, gentle love,

1846
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.300
and have forsworn you withHortensio.

1847
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.530
Tranio, you jest.

1848
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:03.370
What, have you bothforsworn me?

1849
01:21:03.370 --> 01:21:04.800
Mistress, we have.

1850
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.070
Then we are rid of Licio.

1851
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:07.830
I' faith, he'll have alusty widow now

1852
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.670
that shall be wooed andwedded in a day.

1853
01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:10.770
God give him joy.

1854
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:11.870
Ay, and he'll tame her.

1855
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:13.030
He says so, Tranio.

1856
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:14.970
Faith, he is gone unto thetaming school.

1857
01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.200
The taming school?

1858
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.470
Is there such a place?

1859
01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:19.430
Ay, mistress, andPetruchio is the master

1860
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:21.100
that teacheth tricks 11and 20 long

1861
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.330
to tame a shrew and charmher chattering tongue.

1862
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:25.170
Master, master, I havewatch'd so long

1863
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:26.570
that I am dog-weary, ain'I?

1864
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:27.770
But at last I spied

1865
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:30.730
an ancient angel coming downthe hill will serve a turn.

1866
01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:32.130
What is he, Biondello?

1867
01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:34.430
Master, a mercatante or apedant, I know not what,

1868
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:36.670
but formal in apparel, ingait, and countenance

1869
01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:37.930
surely like a father.

1870
01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:39.100
What of him, Tranio?

1871
01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.270
If he be credulous andtrust my tale,

1872
01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:43.930
I'll make him glad to seemVincentio

1873
01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:45.930
and give assurance toBaptista Minola

1874
01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:47.570
as if he were the rightVincentio.

1875
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.430
Take in your love, andthen let me alone.

1876
01:21:54.330 --> 01:21:55.570
Look, Tranio.

1877
01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:56.670
God save you, sir.

1878
01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.030
Ah, and you, sir.

1879
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:59.200
You are welcome.

1880
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.800
Travel you far on?

1881
01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.170
Or are you at thefarthest?

1882
01:22:02.170 --> 01:22:05.500
Sir, at the farthest for aweek or two,

1883
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.430
but then up farther, andas far as Rome,

1884
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:13.500
and so to Tripoli if Godlend me life.

1885
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:15.300
What countryman, I pray?

1886
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.500
Ah, of Mantua.

1887
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.770
Mantua, sir?

1888
01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:22.130
Marry, God forbid.

1889
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:24.230
And come to Padua carelessof your life?

1890
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:25.600
My life, sir?

1891
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.800
How, I pray? For that goeshard.

1892
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:28.800
Ha, ha, ha.

1893
01:22:31.730 --> 01:22:34.800
'Tis death for anyone inMantua to come to Padua.

1894
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.000
Oh.

1895
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.200
Know you not the cause?

1896
01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.370
Oh, ah, ah--

1897
01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.500
Your ships are stay'd atVenice, and the duke,

1898
01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.630
for private quarrel 'twixtyour duke and him,

1899
01:22:42.630 --> 01:22:44.600
hath publish'd andproclaim'd it openly.

1900
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.730
'Tis, marvel, but that youare but newly come,

1901
01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:48.930
you might have heard itelse proclaim'd about.

1902
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.670
Alas, sir, it is worse forme than so,

1903
01:22:50.670 --> 01:22:52.430
for I have bills for moneyby exchange

1904
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:54.400
from Florence and musthere deliver them.

1905
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.470
Well, sir, to do youcourtesy,

1906
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:58.630
this will I do, and this Iwill advise you--

1907
01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:02.130
First, tell me, have youever been at Pisa?

1908
01:23:02.130 --> 01:23:03.870
Ay, sir, in Pisa have Ioften been,

1909
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:06.100
Pisa renowned for gravecitizens.

1910
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.430
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1911
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:09.800
Among them know you oneVincentio?

1912
01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.470
I know him not, but I haveheard of him,

1913
01:23:13.470 --> 01:23:16.130
a merchant of incomparablewealth.

1914
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:19.370
He is my father, sir, andsooth to say

1915
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:21.470
in countenance somewhatdoth resemble you.

1916
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:23.530
As much as an apple dothan oyster and all one.

1917
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:25.400
To save your life in thisextremity,

1918

This favor will I do youfor his sake,

1919
01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:29.930
and think it not the worstof all your fortunes

1920

that you are like to SirVincentio.

1921
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:38.100

and in my house, you shallbe friendly lodged.

1923

Look that you take uponyou as you should.

You understand me, sir?

1925

Ah, ah, well--

1926
01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.070
So shall you stay

1927
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:48.130

1928
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:50.800
If this be courtesy, sir,accept of it.

Then go with me to makethe matter good.

This, by the way, I letyou understand:

1933

my father is here look'dfor every day

1934
01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:04.130
to pass assurance of adower in marriage

1935
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:06.200
'twixt me and oneBaptista's daughter here.

1936
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.970
In all these circumstances,I'll instruct you.

1937
01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:11.870
Go with me to clothe youas becomes you.

1938
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:13.730
Yeah, yeah, well-- ha, ha,ha, ha.

1939
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:21.830
Come away.

1940
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:22.830
Oh.

1941
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:33.730
No, no, I dare not for mylife.

1942
01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:38.330
The more my wrong, themore his spite appears.

1943
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:40.630
What, did he marry me tofamish me?

1944
01:24:42.970 --> 01:24:45.000
Beggars that come unto myfather's door

1945
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.570
upon entreaty have apresent alms.

1946
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:51.170
If not, elsewhere, theymeet with charity,

1947
01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:55.170
but I, who never knew howto entreat

1948
01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:58.230
nor never needed that Ishould entreat,

1949
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:03.270
am starved for meat, giddyfor lack of sleep,

1950
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:06.770
with oaths kept waking,and with brawling fed,

1951
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:11.400
and that which spites memore than all these wrongs,

1952
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.970
he does it under name ofperfect love

1953
01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:16.900
as who should say if Ishould sleep or eat

1954
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.100
'twere deadly sickness orelse present death.

1955
01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.530
Oh.

1956
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:27.170
I prithee, go, and get mesome repast.

1957
01:25:27.170 --> 01:25:31.630
I care not what so it bewholesome food.

1958
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:36.400
What say you to a neat'sfoot?

1959
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.530
'Tis passing good.

1960
01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:41.800
I prithee, let me have it.

1961
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.030
I fear it is too cholerica meat.

1962
01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:50.800
How say you to a fat tripefinely broil'd?

1963
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.000
I like it well.

1964
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.830
Good Grumio, fetch it me.

1965
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:57.070
I cannot tell.

1966
01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:00.400
I fear it is choleric.

1967
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.470
What say you to a piece ofbeef and mustard?

1968
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:05.800
A dish that I do love tofeed upon.

1969
01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.800
Ay, but the mustard is toohot a little.

1970
01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:11.000
Why then, the beef, andlet the mustard rest.

1971
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.430
Ah, now, that you shallnot.

1972
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:15.070
You shall have themustard, or you get nobeef of Grumio.

1973
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:17.500
Then both, or one, oranything thou wilt.

1974
01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.100
Why then, the mustardwithout the beef.

1975
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:25.700
Go, get thee gone, thoufalse, deluding slave,

1976
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.970

Go, get thee gone, I say!

Ah, what news with you,sir?

2016
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.200
Here is the cap yourworship did bespeak.

2017
01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.000
Why, this was molded on aporringer,

2018
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.600
a velvet dish.

2019
01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.700
Tsk, tsk.

2020
01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:53.770
'Tis lewd and filthy.

2021
01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:56.830
Why, 'tis a walnut or acockleshell,

2022
01:28:56.830 --> 01:29:00.770
a knack, a toy, a trick, ababy's cap.

2023
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:02.800
Away with it.

2024
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:04.170
Come, let me have abigger.

2025
01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:05.800
I'll have no bigger.

2026
01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.900
This doth fit the time,

2027
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.830
and gentlewomen wear suchcaps as these.

2028
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:10.800
When you are gentle, youshall have one too

2029
01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.900
and not till then, hmm?

2030
01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.200
That will not be in haste.

2031
01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.300
Why, sir, I trust I mayhave leave to speak,

2032
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.470
and speak I will!

2033
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:18.200
I am no child, no babe!

2034
01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.130
Your betters have enduredme say my mind,

2035
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:22.100
and if you cannot, bestyou stop your ears.

2036
01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:24.170
My tongue will tell theanger of my heart,

2037
01:29:24.170 --> 01:29:26.130
or else my heartconcealing it will break,

2038
01:29:26.130 --> 01:29:27.730
and rather than it shall,

2039
01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.570
I will be free even to theuttermost

2040
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:33.070
as I please in words!

2041
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:34.600
Why, thou say'st true!

2042
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.430
It is a paltry cap,

2043
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:40.470
a custard coffin, abauble, a silken pie.

2044
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.030
I love thee well in thatthou likest it not.

2045
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:47.200
Love me or love me not, Ilike the cap,

2046
01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:51.530
and it I will have, or Iwill have none!

2047
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:52.770
Thy gown?

2048
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:53.970
Why, ay.

2049
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:55.970
Come, tailor, let ussee't.

2050
01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:02.600
Oh.

2051
01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:06.170
O mercy, God.

2052
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:07.630
What masquing stuff ishere?

2053
01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:08.930
What's this?

2054
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:10.700
A sleeve?

2055
01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.570
'Tis like a demi-cannon.

2056
01:30:12.570 --> 01:30:16.230
What, up and down, carvedlike an apple tart?

2057
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.430
Here's snip and nip andcut and stitch and slash

2058
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:21.270
like to a censer in abarber's shop.

2059
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:24.700
Why, what, i' devil's name,tailor, call'st thou this?

2060
01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:27.070
I see she's like to haveneither cap nor gown.

2061
01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:28.670
You bid me make it orderlyand well

2062
01:30:28.670 --> 01:30:30.500
according to the fashionand the time.

2063
01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:33.200
Marry, and did, but if yoube remember'd,

2064
01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.800
I did not bid you mar itto the time.

2065
01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.470
Go, hop me over everykennel home,

2066
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:39.400
for you shall hop withoutmy custom, sir.

2067
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.600
I'll none of it.

2068
01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.900
Hence, make your best ofit.

2069
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:43.670
I never saw abetter-fashion'd gown,

2070
01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:47.430
more quaint, more pleasing,nor more commendable.

2071
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:49.670
Belike you mean to make apuppet of me.

2072
01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:52.500
Why, true, he means tomake a puppet of thee.

2073
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.770
She says your worship meansto make a puppet of her.

2074
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:58.570
Monstrous arrogance.

2075
01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:02.070
Thou liest, thou thread,thou thimble,

2076
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:04.730
thou yard, three-quarters,half-yard, quarter, nail,

2077
01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:09.330
flea, thou nit, thouwinter cricket, thou.

2078
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:13.030
Braved in my own housewith a skein of thread?

2079
01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.530
Away, thou rag, thouquantity, thou remnant,

2080
01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:18.370
or I shall so be-mete theewith thy yard

2081
01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:20.700
as thou shalt think onprating whilst thou livest.

2082
01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:22.870
I tell thee, I, that thouhast marr'd her gown.

2083
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.200
Your worship is deceived.

2084
01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:26.530
The gown is made just asmy master made direction.

2085
01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:28.400
Grumio gave order how itshould be done.

2086
01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.270
I gave him no order. Igave him the stuff.

2087
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:32.130
But how did you desire itshould be made?

2088
01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:33.800
Marry, sir, with needleand thread.

2089
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.600
But did you not request tohave it cut?

2090
01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:37.530
Thou hast faced manythings. Face not me.

2091
01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:39.400
Thou hast braved many men.Brave not me.

2092
01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:41.170
I will neither be facednor braved.

2093
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:43.400
I say unto thee, I bid thymaster cut out the gown,

2094
01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.130
but I did not bid him cutit to pieces.

2095
01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:46.770
Ergo, thou liest.

2096
01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:49.000
Why, here is the note ofthe fashion to testify.

2097
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.200
Read it.

2098
01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:52.270
The note lies in's throat,if he say I said so.

2099
01:31:52.270 --> 01:31:54.000
"Imprimis, a loose-bodiedgown"--

2100
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.970
Master, if ever I saidloose-bodied gown,

2101
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:57.200
sew me in the skirts ofit,

2102
01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.430
and beat me to death witha bottom of brown bread.

2103
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:00.730
I said a gown.

2104
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:01.930
Proceed.

2105
01:32:01.930 --> 01:32:04.500
- "with a small-compassedcape"-- - I confess the cape.

2106
01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.830
- "with a trunk sleeve"--- I confess two sleeves.

2107
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:08.230
"the sleeves curiouslycut."

2108
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.470
Ay, there's the villainy.

2109
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:10.770
Error i' the bill, sir.

2110
01:32:10.770 --> 01:32:13.430
I commanded the sleevesshould be cut out and sewnup again,

2111
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:14.830
and that, I'll prove uponthee

2112
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:17.030
though thy little fingerbe armed in a thimble.

2113
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:18.230
This is true that I say,

2114
01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:21.000
an I had thee in place wherethou shouldst know it.

2115
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.730
Take thou the bill, giveme thy mete-yard, andspare not me.

2116
01:32:23.730 --> 01:32:26.200
God-a-mercy, Grumio, thenshall he have no odds.

2117
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.900
Well, sir, in brief, thegown is not for me.

2118
01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.230
You are i' the right, sir.

2119
01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:32.530
It is for my mistress.

2120
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:34.270
Go, take it up unto thymaster's use.

2121
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:35.670
Villain, not for thy life.

2122
01:32:35.670 --> 01:32:37.930
Take up my mistress' gownfor thy master's use.

2123
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:39.770
Why, sir, what's yourconceit in that?

2124
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:42.130
O, sir, the conceit isdeeper than you think for.

2125
01:32:42.130 --> 01:32:45.170
Take up my mistress' gownto his master's use.

2126
01:32:45.170 --> 01:32:48.200
Ha, ha, ha.

2127
01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:52.100
Hortensio...

say thou wilt see thetailor paid.

2129
01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.300
Go take it hence, begone,and say no more!

2130
01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:58.970
Tailor, I'll pay thee forthy gown tomorrow.

2131
01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.170
Take no unkindness of hishasty words.

2132
01:33:01.170 --> 01:33:02.470
Ah, ah, ah--

2133
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:03.700
Away, I say.

2134
01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:05.170
Um, uh--

2135
01:33:05.170 --> 01:33:07.400
Commend me to thy master.

2136
01:33:08.770 --> 01:33:11.970
Well, come, my Kate.

2137
01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:13.200
We will unto your father's

2138
01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.730
even in these honest, meanhabiliments.

2139
01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:20.730
Our purses shall be proud,our garments poor...

2140
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:34.030
for 'tis the mind thatmakes the body rich.

2141
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:36.400
As the sun breaks throughthe darkest clouds,

2142
01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:38.370
so honour peereth in themeanest habit.

2143
01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:42.430
What, is the jay moreprecious than the lark

2144
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:44.370
because his fathers aremore beautiful?

2145
01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:46.470
Or is the adder betterthan the eel

2146
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:50.600
because his painted skincontents the eye?

2147
01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:53.270
O, no, good Kate, neitherart thou the worse

2148
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:55.970
for this poor furnitureand mean array.

2149
01:33:55.970 --> 01:34:02.300
If thou account'st itshame, lay it on me,

2150
01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:04.270
and therefore, frolic.

2151
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:05.530
We will hence forthwith

2152
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:07.570
to feast and sport us atthy father's house.

2153
01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:09.930
Go, call my men, and letus straight to him,

2154
01:34:09.930 --> 01:34:11.870
and bring our horses untoLong-lane end.

2155
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:14.700
There will we mount, andthither walk on foot.

2156
01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:17.570
Let's see; I think 'tisnow some seven o'clock,

2157
01:34:17.570 --> 01:34:19.530

01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:24.770
It 'twill be supper timeere you come there.

2160
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:28.200
It shall be seven ere I goto horse.

2161
01:34:30.930 --> 01:34:37.000
Look, what I speak or door think to do,

2162
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.230
you are still crossing it.

2163
01:34:39.230 --> 01:34:41.070
Sirs, let't alone.

2164
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:44.230
I will not go today, andere I do,

2165
01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:46.500
it shall be what o'clock Isay it is.

2166
01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:15.130
Sir, this is the house.

2167
01:35:15.130 --> 01:35:16.600
Please it you that I call?

2168
01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.700
Ay, sir, what else?

2169
01:35:17.700 --> 01:35:20.170
And but I be deceived,

2170
01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:24.500
Signior Baptista mayremember me, near 20 yearsago in Genoa

2171
01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.800
where we were lodger satthe Pegasus.

2172
01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.500
'Tis well, and hold yourown in any case

2173
01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.700
with such austerity as'longeth to a father.

2174
01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:30.900
I warrant you.

2175
01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:32.700
But, sir, here comes yourboy.

2176
01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:33.930
'Twere good he wereschool'd.

2177
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:35.100
Fear you not him.

2178
01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.100
Sirrah Biondello,

2179
01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:37.230

01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:40.370
Tut, fear not me.

2182
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:42.330
But hast thou done thyerrand to Baptista?

2183
01:35:42.330 --> 01:35:44.200
I told him that yourfather was at Venice

2184
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.300
and that you look'd forhim this day in Padua.

2185
01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.570
Thou'rt a tall fellow.

2186
01:35:47.570 --> 01:35:49.270
Hold thee that to drink.

2187
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.130
Here comes Baptista.

2188
01:35:53.130 --> 01:35:54.600
Set your countenance, sir.

2189
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.100
Signior Baptista, you arehappily met.

2190
01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.970
Sir, this is the gentlemanI told you of.

2191
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:03.800
I pray you, stand goodfather to me now.

2192
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:05.900
Give me Bianca for mypatrimony.

2193
01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:07.170
Soft son.

2194
01:36:07.170 --> 01:36:08.630
Sir, by your leave,

2195
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:12.700
uh, ah, having come to Paduato gather in some debts,

2196
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.030
my son Lucentio made meacquainted

2197
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:19.830
with a weighty cause oflove between your daughterand himself,

2198
01:36:19.830 --> 01:36:22.230
and for the good report Ihear of you

2199
01:36:22.230 --> 01:36:25.000
and for the love hebeareth to your daughter--

2200
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.970
and she to him--

2201
01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:30.100
to stay him not too long,

2202
01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:32.000
I am content in a goodfather's care,

2203
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.830
to have him match'd,

2204
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:36.530
and if you please to likeno worse than I,

2205
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:41.670
upon some agreement, me shallyou find ready and willing

2206
01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:43.830
with one consent to haveher so bestow'd,

2207
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:45.670
for curious I cannot bewith you,

2208
01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:48.330
Signior Baptista, of whomI hear so well.

2209
01:36:50.770 --> 01:36:54.470
Sir, pardon me in what Ihave to say.

2210
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:56.800
Your plainness and yourshortness please me well.

2211
01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.030
Right true it is,

2212
01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:00.170
your son Lucentio heredoth love my daughter

2213
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:01.400
and she loveth him,

2214
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:03.930
or both dissemble deeplytheir affections--

2215
01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:05.730
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2216
01:37:05.730 --> 01:37:07.770
And therefore, if you sayno more than this,

2217
01:37:07.770 --> 01:37:09.630
that like a father youwill deal with him

2218
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:11.570
and pass my daughter asufficient dower,

2219
01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:13.170
the match is made, and allis done.

2220
01:37:13.170 --> 01:37:16.530
Your son shall have mydaughter with consent.

2221
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.700
Ah, well--

2222
01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:19.270
I thank you, sir.

2223
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:20.900
Where then do you knowbest

2224
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.870

2225
01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.000
as shall with eitherpart's agreement stand?

2226
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.730
Not in my house, Lucentio,for, you know,

2227
01:37:27.730 --> 01:37:29.900
pitchers have ears, and Ihave many servants.

2228
01:37:29.900 --> 01:37:31.870
Besides, old Gremio ishearkening still,

2229
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:33.700
and happily, we might beinterrupted.

2230
01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:35.430
Then at my lodging,

2231
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:37.770
an it like you, there dothmy father lie,

2232
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:39.030
and there, this night,

2233
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:42.300
we'll pass the businessprivately and well.

2234
01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:44.800
Send for your daughter byyour servant here.

2235
01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:46.900
My boy shall fetch thescrivener presently.

2236
01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:48.130
Ay.

2237
01:37:48.130 --> 01:37:50.270
The worst is this, that atso slender warning,

2238
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:52.970
you are like to have athin and slender pittance.

2239
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:54.300
It likes me well.

2240
01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.570
Cambio, get you home,

2241
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:58.430
and bid Bianca make herready straight,

2242
01:37:58.430 --> 01:38:00.430
and if you will, tell whathath happened.

2243

Lucentio's father isarrived in Padua

2244
01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:07.030
and how she's like to beLucentio's wife.

2245
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:08.900
I pray the gods she maywith all my heart.

2246
01:38:08.900 --> 01:38:11.600
Dally not with the gods,but get thee gone.

2247
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.070
Signior Baptista, shall Ilead the way?

2248
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:15.200
Welcome.

2249
01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.200
One mess is like to beyour cheer.

2250
01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:20.130
Come, sir, we will betterit in Pisa.

2251
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:24.600
I'll follow you.

2252
01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:38.900
Cambio.

2253
01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:40.330
What sayest thou,Biondello?

2254
01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:42.270
You saw my master wink andlaugh upon you?

2255
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:43.470
Biondello, what of that?

2256
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:45.430
Faith, nothing but hasleft me here behind

2257
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:48.000
to expound the meaning ormoral of his signs and tokens.

2258
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.300
I pray thee, moralizethem.

2259
01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:50.500
Then thus.

2260
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:51.630
Baptista is safe,

2261
01:38:51.630 --> 01:38:54.100
talking with the deceivingfather of a deceitful son.

2262
01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:55.400
And what of him?

2263
01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.700
His daughter is to be broughtby you to the supper.

2264
01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:58.830
And then?

2265
01:38:58.830 --> 01:39:00.670
The old priest of SaintLuke's church

2266
01:39:00.670 --> 01:39:02.130
is at your command at allhours.

2267
01:39:02.130 --> 01:39:03.400
And what of all this?

2268
01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.630
I cannot tell,

2269
01:39:04.630 --> 01:39:07.200
expect they are busied abouta counterfeit assurance.

2270
01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:08.500
Take you assurance ofher--

2271
01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.900
"Cum privilegio adimprimendum solum"--in't, eh?

2272
01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:14.430
To the church, take thepriest, clerk, and somesufficient honest witnesses.

2273
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:17.270
Now, if this be not thatyou look for, I have nomore to say,

2274
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:19.230
but bid Bianca farewellforever and a day.

2275
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:20.470
Hearest thou, Biondello?

2276
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:21.570
I cannot tarry.

2277
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:23.330
I knew a wench married inan afternoon

2278
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:25.830
as she went to the garden forparsley to stuff a rabbit,

2279
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:27.670
and so may you, sir, andso, adieu, sir.

2280
01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:29.970
My master hath appointedme to go to Saint Luke's,

2281
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:31.930
to bid the priest be readyto come against

2282
01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:33.300
you come with yourappendix.

2283
01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.070
I may, and will if she beso contented.

2284
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:36.970
She will be pleased.

2285
01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.430
Then wherefore should Idoubt?

2286
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:41.400
Hap what hap may, I'llroundly go about her.

2287
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.070
It shall go hard if Cambiogo without her.

2288
01:39:53.130 --> 01:39:56.270
Come on, i' God's name, oncemore toward our father's.

2289
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:59.570
Good Lord, how bright andgoodly shines the moon.

2290
01:39:59.570 --> 01:40:03.230
"The moon"--the sun: it isnot moonlight now.

2291
01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.170
I say it is the moon thatshines so bright.

2292
01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:07.730
I know it is the sun thatshines so bright.

2293
01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:10.370
By my mother's son, andthat's myself,

2294
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:13.370
it shall be moon or staror what I list,

2295
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:15.330
or ere I journey to yourfather's house.

2296
01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:17.170
Go on, and fetch ourhorses back again.

2297
01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:20.500
Evermore cross'd and cross'd,nothing but cross'd.

2298
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:23.630
Say as he says, or weshall never go.

2299
01:40:23.630 --> 01:40:26.470
Forward, I pray, since wehave come so far,

2300
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:30.100
and be it moon or sun orwhat you please,

2301
01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:32.170
an if you please to callit a rush-candle,

2302
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:34.870
henceforth I vow it shallbe so for me.

2303
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:36.470
I say it is the moon.

2304
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:38.430
I know it is the moon.

2305
01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:39.670
Nay, then you lie.

2306
01:40:39.670 --> 01:40:40.930
It is the blessed sun.

2307
01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:44.770
Then, God be bless'd, itis the blessed sun,

2308
01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:47.330
but sun it is not if yousay it is not,

2309
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:49.430
and the moon changes evenas your mind.

2310
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:52.100
What you will have itnamed, even that it is,

2311
01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:55.070
and so it shall be so forKatharine.

2312
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:57.430
Petruchio, go thy ways.

2313
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:58.570
The field is won.

2314
01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:00.730
Well, forward, forward.

2315
01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:02.870
Thus the bowl should run

2316
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:05.000
and not unluckily againstthe bias.

2317
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.070
But, soft.

2318
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:08.470
Company is coming here.

2319
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:10.570
Good morrow, gentlemistress.

2320
01:41:10.570 --> 01:41:11.730
Where away?

2321
01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:14.970

such war of white and redwithin her cheeks?

2324
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:23.900
What stars do spangleheaven with such beauty

2325
01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:26.800
as those two eyes becomethat heavenly face?

2326
01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.870
Fair lovely maid, oncemore good day to thee.

2327
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:33.570
Sweet Kate, embrace herfor her beauty's sake.

A' will make the man madto make a woman of him.

01:41:40.170 --> 01:41:46.530
Young, budding virgin,fair and fresh and sweet,

01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:51.170

Why, how now, Kate.

I hope thou art not mad.

2336
01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:09.830
This is a man...

2337
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:13.300
old, wrinkled, faded,wither'd,

2338
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:17.830
and not a maiden as thousay'st he is.

2339
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:21.030
Pardon, old father, mymistaking eyes

2340

that have been sobedazzled with the sun

2341

that everything I look onseemeth green.

2342

Now I perceive thou art areverend father.

2343

Happily met, the happierfor thy son.

And now by law as well asreverend age,

The sister to my wife,this gentlewoman,

thy son by this hathmarried.

2359

Wonder not nor be notgrieved.

2362
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:19.270
Beside, so qualified asmay beseem

2363
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:20.930
the spouse of any noblegentleman.

2364
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:23.130
Let me embrace with oldVincentio,

2367
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:29.370
But is this true?

2368
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:32.800
Or is it else yourpleasure, like pleasanttravellers,

2369
01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.030
to break a jest upon thecompany you overtake?

2370
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:37.300
I do assure thee, father,so it is.

2371
01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:39.230
Come, go along, and seethe truth hereof,

2372
01:43:39.230 --> 01:43:41.900
for our first merrimenthath made thee jealous.

2373
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:48.330
Well, Petruchio, this hasput me in heart.

2374
01:43:48.330 --> 01:43:51.730
Have to my widow, and ifshe be froward,

2375
01:43:51.730 --> 01:43:55.030
now hast thou taughtHortensio to be untoward.

2376
01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.770
I marvel Cambio comes notall this while.

2377
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:03.970
Sir, here's the door.

2378
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:05.200
This is Lucentio's house.

2379
01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.630
My father's lies moretoward the marketplace.

2380
01:44:07.630 --> 01:44:09.770
Thither must I, and here Ileave you, sir.

2381
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:12.730
You shall not choose butdrink before you go.

2382
01:44:12.730 --> 01:44:14.700
I think I shall commandyour welcome here,

2383
01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:17.600
and by all likelihood,some cheer is toward.

2384
01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.330
They're busy within.

2385
01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:23.270
You were best knocklouder.

2386
01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:34.270
What's he that knocks as hewould beat down the gate?

2387
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:35.870
Is Signior Lucentiowithin, sir?

2388
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:39.100
He's within, sir, but notto be spoken withal.

2389
01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.900
What if a man bring him ahundred pound or two

2390
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.930
to make merry withal?

2391
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:46.900
You can keep your hundredpounds to yourself.

2392
01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:49.900
He shall need none so longas I live.

2393
01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:53.100
Nay, I told you your sonwas well-beloved in Padua.

2394
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.570
Do you hear, sir?

2395
01:44:54.570 --> 01:44:57.830
To leave frivolouscircumstances, I pray you,

2396
01:44:57.830 --> 01:45:00.100
tell Signior Lucentio thathis father

2397
01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.230
is come from Pisa and is hereat the door to speak with him.

2398
01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.370
Thou liest.

2399
01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:06.570
His father is come fromPadua

2400
01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:09.470
and here looking out atthe window.

2401
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.770
Art thou his father?

2402
01:45:10.770 --> 01:45:14.470
Ay, sir, so his mothersays if I may believe her.

2403
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:15.830
Why, how now, gentleman.

2404
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:18.630
Why, this is flat knaveryto take upon you anotherman's name.

2405
01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:20.170
Lay hands on the villain.

2406
01:45:20.170 --> 01:45:23.000
I believe a' means to cozensomebody in this city

2407
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.300
under my countenance.

2408
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.330
I have seen them in thechurch together.

2409
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:27.730
God send 'em goodshipping.

2410
01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:28.830
Ah!

2411
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:30.300
Ay that; who's here?

2412
01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:32.230
Mine old master Vincentio.

2413
01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:34.470
Now we are undone andbrought to nothing.

2414
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:36.830
Come hither, crack-hemp.

2415
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.300
Hope I may choose, sir.

2416
01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:45.030
Come hither, you rogue.

2417
01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:48.870
What, have you forgot me?

2418
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:50.000

2419
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.170
Oh, no, sir, I could notforget you, sir.

2420
01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:53.900
I never saw you before inall my life.

2421
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.700
What, you notoriousvillain,

2422
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.300

What, my old worshipfulold master?

2424
01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.870
Oh, marry, sir, yes.

See where he looks out ofthe window.

2426
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.900
Is't so, indeed.

2427
01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.530
Help, help, help!

2428
01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:12.470
Here's a madman willmurder me.

01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:14.770
Help, son. Help, SigniorBaptista!

2430
01:46:14.770 --> 01:46:16.330

Why, is the man lunatic?

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:50.970
Sir, you seem a sober ancientgentleman by your habit,

2445
01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:54.070

You mistake, sir.

2451
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:07.270
You mistake, sir.

2452
01:47:07.270 --> 01:47:09.100
Pray, what do you think ishis name?

2453
01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.730
His name? As if I knew nothis name.

2454
01:47:10.730 --> 01:47:13.230
I have brought him up eversince he was three years old,

2455
01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:15.000
and his name is Tranio.

2456
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.130
Away, away, mad ass!

2457
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:18.970
His name is Lucentio.

2458
01:47:18.970 --> 01:47:20.200
He is mine only son

2459
01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.330
and heir to the lands ofme, Signior Vincentio.

2460
01:47:24.330 --> 01:47:25.730
Lucentio.

2461
01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:27.700
O, he hath murdered hismaster.

2462
01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:31.730
Lay hold on him, I chargeyou, in the duke's name.

2463
01:47:31.730 --> 01:47:33.200
O, my son, my son.

2464
01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.470
Tell me, thou villain,where is my son Lucentio?

2465
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:38.030
Call forth an officer.

2466
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:40.870
Carry this mad knave tothe jail.

2467
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:43.500
Father Baptista, I chargeyou, see he be forthcoming.

2468
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:44.770
Carry me to the jail?

2469
01:47:44.770 --> 01:47:46.700
Stay, officer, he shallnot go to prison.

2470
01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:48.400
Talk not, Signior Gremio.

2471
01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.930
I say he shall go toprison.

2472
01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:51.470
Take heed, SigniorBaptista,

2473
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:53.500
lest you be cony-catchedin this business.

2474
01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.700
I dare swear this is theright Vincentio.

2475
01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:57.400
Swear, if thou darest,hmm?

2476
01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:59.800
Nay, I dare not swear it.

2477
01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.570
Then thou wert best saythat I am not Lucentio.

2478
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:05.670
Yes, I know thee to beSignior Lucentio.

2479
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:07.530
Away with the dotard.

2480
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:09.000
To the jail with him.

2481
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.270
Thus strangers may behailed and abused!

2482
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:12.470
O monstrous villain!

2483
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:16.070
O, we are spoiled, andyonder, he is.

2484
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:18.400
Deny him, forswear him, orelse we are all undone.

2485
01:48:31.330 --> 01:48:32.670
Pardon, sweet father.

2486
01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:34.970
Lives my sweet son?

2487
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:36.600
Pardon, dear father.

2488
01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.100
How hast thou offended?

2489
01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:40.070
Where is Lucentio?

2490
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:42.970
Here's Lucentio,

2491
01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:46.400
right son to the rightVincentio

2492
01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:48.830
that have by marriage madethy daughter mine

2493
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:52.500
while counterfeit supposesbleared thine eyne.

2494
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:53.730
Here's packing,

2495
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:56.530
with a witness to deceiveus all.

2496
01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:58.270
Where is that damnedvillain Tranio

2497
01:48:58.270 --> 01:49:00.430
that faced and braved mein this matter so?

2498
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:02.400
Why, tell me, is this notmy Cambio?

2499
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:07.170
Cambio has changed intoLucentio.

2500
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:10.930
Love wrought thesemiracles.

2501
01:49:10.930 --> 01:49:13.530
Bianca's love made meexchange my state with Tranio

2502
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.600
while he did bear mycountenance in the town,

2503
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.030
and happily, I havearrived at the last

2504
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:20.670
unto the wished haven ofmy bliss.

2505
01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:21.870
But, I--

2506
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:24.300
What Tranio did, myselfenforced him to.

2507
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.500
Then pardon him, sweetfather, for my sake.

2508
01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:28.430
I'll slit the villain'snose

2509
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:30.130
that would have sent me tothe jail.

2510
01:49:30.130 --> 01:49:31.530
But do you hear, sir?

2511
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:35.130
Have you married mydaughter without asking mygood will?

2512
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:37.330
Fear not, Baptista, wewill content you, go to,

2513
01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:39.730
but I will in to berevenged for this villainy.

2514
01:49:39.730 --> 01:49:42.700
And I, to sound the depthof this knavery.

2515
01:49:44.930 --> 01:49:46.930
Look not pale, Bianca.

2516
01:49:46.930 --> 01:49:48.200
Thy father will not frown.

2517
01:49:51.670 --> 01:49:54.930
My cake is dough,

2518
01:49:54.930 --> 01:49:57.100
but I'll in among the rest

2519
01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:01.100
out of hope of all but myshare of the feast.

2520
01:50:04.730 --> 01:50:08.070
Husband, let's follow tosee the end of this ado.

2521
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:09.770
First, kiss me, Kate, andwe will.

2522
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.300
What, here?

2523
01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:13.830
In the midst of thestreet?

2524
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:15.630
What, art thou ashamed ofme?

2525
01:50:15.630 --> 01:50:20.730
No, sir, God forbid, butashamed to kiss.

2526
01:50:22.170 --> 01:50:23.730
Why, then, let's homeagain.

2527
01:50:23.730 --> 01:50:24.970
Come, sirrah, let's away.

2528
01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:28.630
Nay, I will give thee akiss.

2529
01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:49.700
Now, pray thee, love,stay.

2530
01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:52.370
Is this not well?

2531
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:56.470
Come, my sweet Kate.

2532
01:50:58.370 --> 01:51:02.600
Better once than never,for never too late.

2533
01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:35.400
At last, though long, ourjarring notes agree,

2534
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.600
and time it is when ragingwar is done

2535
01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:43.700
to smile at scapes andperils overblown.

2536
01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:48.100
My fair Bianca, bid myfather welcome

2537
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:52.200
while I with self-samekindness welcome thine.

2538
01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:57.370
Brother Petruchio, sisterKatharina,

2539
01:51:57.370 --> 01:52:02.470
and thou, Hortensio, withthy loving widow,

2540
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:05.570
feast with the best, andwelcome to my house.

2541
01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:10.370
Now, then--

2542
01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:18.370
Pray you, sit down,

2543
01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:22.900
for now we sit to chat aswell as eat.

2544
01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:26.800
Nothing but sit and sitand eat and eat.

2545
01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:30.070
Padua affords thiskindness, son Petruchio.

2546
01:52:30.070 --> 01:52:32.100
Padua affords nothing butwhat is kind.

2547
01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:33.370
Here, here. Here, here.

2548
01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:35.900
For both our sakes, Iwould that word were true.

2549
01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:39.400
Now, for my life,Hortensio fears his widow.

2550
01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:41.230
Never trust me if I beafeard.

2551
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:43.530
You are very sensible, andyet, you miss my sense.

2552
01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:45.670
I mean, Hortensio isafeard of you.

2553
01:52:45.670 --> 01:52:49.230
He that is giddy thinksthe world turns round.

2554
01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:51.670
Roundly replied.

2555
01:52:51.670 --> 01:52:53.370
Mistress, how mean youthat?

2556
01:52:53.370 --> 01:52:55.000
Thus I conceive by him.

2557
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.270
Conceives by me.

2558
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:58.630
How likes Hortensio that?

2559
01:52:58.630 --> 01:53:02.170
My widow says, thus sheconceives her tale.

2560
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:09.670
Very well mended.

2561
01:53:09.670 --> 01:53:11.330
Kiss him for that, goodwidow.

2562
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:18.930
"He that is giddy thinksthe world turns round."

2563
01:53:18.930 --> 01:53:21.970
I pray you, tell me whatyou meant by that.

2564
01:53:21.970 --> 01:53:24.570
Your husband, beingtroubled with a shrew--

2565
01:53:24.570 --> 01:53:25.970
Ooh--

2566
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:29.000
measures my husband'ssorrow by his woe,

2567
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.830
and now you know mymeaning.

2568
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:33.000
A very mean meaning.

2569
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.330
Right, I mean you.

2570
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:39.030
And I am mean indeed,respecting you.

2571
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:40.270
To her, Kate.

2572
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:41.370
To her, widow.

2573
01:53:41.370 --> 01:53:43.500
A hundred marks, my Katedoes put her down.

2574
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.630
That's my office.

2575
01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:47.830
Spoke like an officer.

2576
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:48.930
Ha' to thee, lad.

2577
01:53:48.930 --> 01:53:51.070
How likes Gremio thesequick-witted folks?

2578
01:53:51.070 --> 01:53:53.830
Believe me, sir, they butttogether well.

2579
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:56.200
A head and butt-- anhasty-witted body

2580
01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.930
would say your head andbutt were head and horn.

2581
01:53:58.930 --> 01:54:01.970
Ay, mistress bride, haththat awaken'd you?

2582
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:03.270
Ay, but not frighted me.

2583
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:04.900
Therefore, I'll sleepagain.

2584
01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:06.100
Nay, that you shall not.

2585
01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.200
Since you have begun,

2586
01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:09.130
have at you for a bitterjest or two.

2587
01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:11.270
Am I your bird?

2588
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:13.370
Then, I mean to shift mybush,

2589
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:16.770
and then pursue me as youdraw your bow.

2590
01:54:16.770 --> 01:54:18.830
You are welcome, all.

2591
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.270
She hath prevented me.

2592
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:25.570
Here, Signior Tranio.

2593
01:54:25.570 --> 01:54:27.730
This bird you aim'd at,though you hit her not.

2594
01:54:27.730 --> 01:54:29.970
Therefore, a health to allthat shot and miss'd.

2595
01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:31.200
Shot and missed!

2596
01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.870
O, sir, Lucentio slipp'dme like his greyhound

2597
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:36.530
which runs himself andcatches for his master.

2598
01:54:36.530 --> 01:54:39.300
A good swift simile, butsomething currish.

2599
01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:40.470
Oh!

2600
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:42.770
'Tis well, sir, that youhunted for yourself.

2601
01:54:42.770 --> 01:54:45.270
'Tis thought your deerdoes hold you at a bay.

2602
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:48.000
O ho, Petruchio.

2603
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.870
I thank thee for thatgird, good Tranio.

2604
01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:52.000
Confess, confess, hath henot hit you here?

2605
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.100
A' has a little gall'd me,I confess,

2606
01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:56.670
and as the jest did glanceaway from me,

2607
01:54:56.670 --> 01:55:00.130
'tis ten to one it maim'dyou two outright.

2608
01:55:00.130 --> 01:55:02.500
Now, in good sadness, sonPetruchio,

2609
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:06.130
I think thou hast theveriest shrew of all.

2610
01:55:06.130 --> 01:55:11.000
Well, I say no, andtherefore, for assurance,

2611
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:14.370
let's each one send untohis wife,

2612
01:55:14.370 --> 01:55:16.170
and he whose wife is mostobedient

2613
01:55:16.170 --> 01:55:18.200
to come at first when hedoth send for her

2614
01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:20.600
shall win the wager whichwe will propose.

2615
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.970
Content. What is thewager?

2616
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:23.170
20 crowns.

2617
01:55:23.170 --> 01:55:24.570
20 crowns?

2618
01:55:24.570 --> 01:55:26.430
I'll venture so much of myhawk or hound

2619
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:28.000
but 20 times so much uponmy wife.

2620
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.170
A hundred then.

2621
01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:30.270
Content.

2622
01:55:30.270 --> 01:55:31.400
A match; 'tis done.

2623
01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:32.570
Who shall begin?

2624
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:34.070
That will I.

2625
01:55:34.070 --> 01:55:36.170
Go, Biondello, bid yourmistress come to me.

2626
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:37.430
I go.

2627
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.970
Son, I'll be your half,Bianca comes.

2628
01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:41.430
I'll have no halves.

2629
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:44.330
I'll bear it all myself.

2630
01:55:44.330 --> 01:55:45.570
How now, what news?

2631
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:47.370
Sir, my mistress sends youword

2632
01:55:47.370 --> 01:55:50.130
that she is busy, and shecannot come.

2633
01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:55.230
How, she is busy, and shecannot come.

2634
01:55:55.230 --> 01:55:57.700
I-Is that an answer?

2635
01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:59.870
Ay, and a kind one too.

2636
01:55:59.870 --> 01:56:02.600
Pray God, sir, your wifesend you not a worse.

2637
01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:03.730
I hope better.

2638
01:56:03.730 --> 01:56:05.730
Sirrah Biondello, go andentreat my wife

2639
01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:06.930
to come to me forthwith.

2640
01:56:06.930 --> 01:56:08.030
O, ho, entreat her.

2641
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:10.700
Nay, then she must needscome.

2642
01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:12.070
Sir, I am afraid,

2643
01:56:12.070 --> 01:56:14.170
do what you can, yourswill not be entreated.

2644
01:56:14.170 --> 01:56:16.170
Now, where's my wife?

2645
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:18.970
Ah, she says you have somegoodly jest in hand.

2646
01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:20.300
She will not come.

2647
01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.430
She bids you come to her.

2648
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:22.670
Whoa!

2649
01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:24.600
Worse and worse; she willnot come.

2650
01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:28.400
O vile, intolerable, notto be endured.

2651
01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:29.770
Sirrah Grumio,

2652
01:56:29.770 --> 01:56:31.370
go to your mistress.

2653
01:56:31.370 --> 01:56:35.000
Say I command her come tome.

2654
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:36.370
I know her answer.

2655
01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:37.600
What?

2656
01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:38.700
She will not.

2657
01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:40.600
The fouler fortune mine,and there an end.

2658
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:55.200
Now, by my holidame, herecomes Katharina.

2659
01:57:04.330 --> 01:57:07.130
What is your will, sir,that you send for me?

2660
01:57:07.130 --> 01:57:11.400
Where is your sister andHortensio's wife?

2661
01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.900
They sit conferring by theparlor fire.

2662
01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:15.330
Go fetch them hither.

2663
01:57:15.330 --> 01:57:16.770
If they deny to come,

2664
01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:20.270
swinge me them soundlyforth unto their husbands.

2665
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:23.300
Away, I say, and bringthem hither straight.

2666
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:39.000
Here is a wonder, if youtalk of a wonder.

2667
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.230
And so it is.

2668
01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:41.500
I wonder what it bodes.

2669
01:57:41.500 --> 01:57:42.730
Marry,

2670
01:57:42.730 --> 01:57:44.600
peace it bodes

2671
01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:48.770
and love and quiet life

2672
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:52.800
and awful rule and rightsupremacy

2673
01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.570
and, to be short, what notthat's sweet and happy?

2674
01:57:56.570 --> 01:58:00.970
Now, fair befall thee,good Petruchio,

2675
01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:02.170
the wager thou hast won,

2676
01:58:02.170 --> 01:58:05.300
and I will add unto theirlosses 20,000 crowns,

2677
01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:08.670
another dowry to anotherdaughter,

2678
01:58:08.670 --> 01:58:13.170
for she is changed as shehas never been.

2679
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.470
Nay, I will win my wagerbetter yet

2680
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:21.830
and show more sign of herobedience,

2681
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:24.630
her new-built virtue andobedience.

2682
01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:28.900
See where she comes andbrings your froward wives

2683
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:31.430
as prisoners to herwomanly persuasion.

2684
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.900
Katharine...

2685
01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:42.400
that cap of yours becomesyou not.

2686
01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.330
Off with that bauble.

2687
01:58:44.330 --> 01:58:46.000
Throw it underfoot.

2688
01:58:58.100 --> 01:59:01.130
Lord, let me never have acause to sigh

2689
01:59:01.130 --> 01:59:04.530
till I be brought to sucha silly pass.

2690
01:59:04.530 --> 01:59:09.830
Fie, what foolish dutycall you this?

2691
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:12.930
I would your duty were asfoolish too.

2692
01:59:12.930 --> 01:59:14.700
The wisdom of your duty,fair Bianca,

2693
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.470
hath cost me an hundredcrowns since supper time.

2694
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:20.370
The more fool you forlaying on my duty.

2695
01:59:20.370 --> 01:59:23.700
Katharine, I charge thee,tell these headstrong women

2696
01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:26.630
what duty they do owetheir lords and husbands.

2697
01:59:26.630 --> 01:59:28.230
Come, come, you'remocking.

2698
01:59:28.230 --> 01:59:29.770
We will have no telling.

2699
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:32.000
Come on, I say, and firstbegin with her.

2700
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.900
She shall not.

2701
01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.100
I say she shall!

2702
01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:37.270
Ooh!

2703
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:39.500
And first, begin with her.

2704
01:59:39.500 --> 01:59:41.200
Fie, fie.

2705
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.370
Unknit that threatening,unkind brow,

2706
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:47.170
and dart not scornfulglances from those eyes

2707
01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:50.670
to wound thy lord, thyking, thy governor.

2708
01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:54.830
It blots thy beauty asfrosts do bite the meads,

2709
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:57.730
confounds thy fame aswhirlwinds shake fair buds,

2710
01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:00.870
and in no sense is meet oramiable.

2711
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.470
A woman moved is like afountain troubled--

2712
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:11.370
muddy, ill-seeming, thick,bereft of beauty--

2713
02:00:11.370 --> 02:00:13.970
and while it is so, noneso dry or thirsty

2714
02:00:13.970 --> 02:00:18.430
will deign to sip or touchone drop of it.

2715
02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:22.470
Thy husband is thy lord,thy life, thy keeper,

2716
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:27.570
thy head, thy sovereign,one that cares for thee,

2717
02:00:27.570 --> 02:00:29.600
and for thy maintenancecommits his body

2718
02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.000
to painful labor both bysea and land

2719
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.670
to watch the night instorms, the day in cold,

2720
02:00:35.670 --> 02:00:39.870
whilst thou liest warm athome, secure and safe,

2721
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:42.400
that craves no othertribute from thy hands

2722
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:48.030
but love, fair looks, andtrue obedience--

2723
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:50.830
too little payment for sogreat a debt.

2724
02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:58.800
Such duty as the subjectowes the prince

2725
02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.970
even such a woman oweth toher husband,

2726
02:01:01.970 --> 02:01:08.370
and when she's froward,peevish, sullen, sour,

2727
02:01:08.370 --> 02:01:10.900
and not obedient to hishonest will,

2728
02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:13.900
what is she but a foulcontending rebel

2729
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:18.170
and graceless traitor toher loving lord?

2730
02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:22.000
I am ashamed that womenare so simple

2731
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.170
to offer war where theyshould kneel for peace,

2732
02:01:26.170 --> 02:01:29.230
to seek for rule,supremacy, and sway

2733
02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:35.770
when they are bound toserve, love, and obey.

2734
02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:39.470
Why are our bodies softand weak and smooth,

2735
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:41.500
unapt to toil and troublein the world

2736
02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:45.000
but that our softconditions and our hearts

2737
02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.700
should well agree with ourexternal parts?

2738
02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:55.200
Come, come, you frowardand unable worms.

2739
02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:57.270
My mind hath been as bigas one of yours,

2740
02:01:57.270 --> 02:02:01.830
my heart as great, myreason haply more,

2741
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:05.230
to bandy word for word andfrown for frown,

2742
02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:10.200
but now I see our lancesare but straws,

2743
02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:14.870
our strength as weak, ourweakness past compare,

2744
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:21.230
that seeming to be mostwhich we indeed least are.

2745
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:26.570
Then vail your stomachs,for it is no boot,

2746
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:32.130
and place your hands belowyour husband's foot.

2747
02:02:32.130 --> 02:02:37.070
In token of which duty, ifhe please,

2748
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:39.430
my hand is ready.

2749
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:41.670
May it do him ease.

2750
02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.600
Why, there's a wench.

2751
02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:55.900
Come on, and kiss me,Kate.

2752
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:08.900
Well, go thy ways, oldlad, for thou shalt ha't.

2753
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:11.570
'Tis a good hearing whenchildren are toward--

2754
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:14.800
But a harsh hearing whenwomen are froward.

2755
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:20.500
Come, Kate, we'll to bed.

2756
02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:24.570
We three are married, butyou two are sped.

2757
02:03:24.570 --> 02:03:27.670
Now, go thy ways.

2758
02:03:27.670 --> 02:03:31.700
Thou hast tamed a cursedshrew.

2759
02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:35.330
'Tis a wonder, by yourleave, she will be tamed so.

2760
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:45.900
Hmmm.

2761
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:47.600
Hmmm.

2762
02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:51.630
Hmmm.

2763
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:58.830
How blessed is he thatfears the Lord

2764
02:03:58.830 --> 02:04:03.300
and walketh, walketh inhis ways.

2765
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.500
Thy love, thy labor, thylove, thy labor,

2766
02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.630
thou shalt ever eat

2767
02:04:09.630 --> 02:04:14.500
and happy be always.

2768
02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:18.870
Thy wife shall as afruitful vine

2769
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:23.400
by thy house sides, housesides be found.

2770
02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.330
Thy child, thy child,

2771
02:04:25.330 --> 02:04:29.370
thy children like theolive branches green

2772
02:04:29.370 --> 02:04:34.400
about thy table round.

2773
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:38.770
Behold, the man that fearsthe Lord.

2774
02:04:38.770 --> 02:04:43.400
Most blessed, blessedshall he be.

2775
02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.270
The Lord, the Lord,

2776
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:49.300
the Lord shall in satietygive

2777
02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:54.100
his blessing unto thee.

2778
02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:58.400
Thou shalt Jerusalem'sgood behold

2779
02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:02.900
whilst thou on earth dostdwell.

2780
02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:05.770
Thou shalt, thou shalt,thou shalt,

2781
02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:09.400
thou shalt thy children'schildren see

2782
02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:15.000
and peace on Israel.
