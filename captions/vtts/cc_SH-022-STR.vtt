00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.430
His valour, coin andpeople, in the wars?

87
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.170
Did he so often lodge inopen field,

88
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.030
In winter's cold andsummer's parching heat,

89
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.830

With all the learnedcouncil of the realm,

Studied so long,

sat in the council-house Earlyand late, debating to and fro

97
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.230
How France and Frenchmenmight be kept in awe,

98
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:11.030
And shall these laboursand these honours die?

99
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.370
O peers of England,shameful is this league!

100
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.300
Fatal this marriage,cancelling your fame,

101
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.970
Blotting your names frombooks of memory,

102
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.700
Razing the characters ofyour renown,

103
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.400
Defacing monuments ofconquer'd France,

104
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.170
Undoing all, as all hadnever been!

105
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.830
Nephew, what means thispassionate discourse,

106
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.300
This peroration with suchcircumstance?

107
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.370
For France, 'tis ours; andwe will keep it still.

108
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.630
Ay, we will keepit, if we can;

109
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.700
But now it is impossiblewe should:

110
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.630
Suffolk, the new-made dukethat rules the roast,

111
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.700
Hath given the duchy ofAnjou and Maine

112
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.000
Unto the poor King Reignier,

113
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.730
whose large style Agrees notwith the leanness of his purse.

114
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.500
By the death of Himthat died for all,

115
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.870
These counties were thekeys of Normandy.

116
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.030
(Crying)

117
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.000
But wherefore weepsWarwick, my valiant son?

118
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.500
For grief that they arepast recovery:

119
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.270
For, were there hope toconquer them again,

120
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:41.300
My sword should shed hotblood, mine eyes no tears.

121
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.470
Anjou and Maine! myselfdid win them both;

122
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.370
Those provinces these armsof mine did conquer:

123
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.170
And are the cities, that Igot with wounds,

124
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.170
Delivered up again withpeaceful words?

125
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.270
Mort Dieu!

126
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.000
For Suffolk's duke, may hebe suffocate,

127
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.200
That dims the honour ofthis warlike isle!

128
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.770
France should have tornand rent my very heart,

129
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.330
Before I would haveyielded to this league.

130
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.400
I never read butEngland's kings

131
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.470
have had Large sums of goldand dowries with their wives:

132
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.170
And our King Henrygives away his own,

133
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.670
To match with her thatbrings no vantages.

134
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.600
She should have stayed inFrance and starved

135
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.330
in France.

136
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.270
My Lord of Gloucester, nowye grow too hot:

137
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.070
It was the pleasure of mylord the King.

138
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.300
My Lord of Winchester, Iknow your mind;

139
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.170
'Tis not my speeches thatyou do mislike,

140
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.870
But 'tis my presence thatdoth trouble ye.

141
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.700
Rancour will out:proud prelate,

142
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.370
in thy face I see thyfury: if I longer stay,

143
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.770
We shall begin our ancientbickerings.

144
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:04.570
Lordings, farewell; andsay, when I am gone,

145
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.330
I prophesied France willbe lost ere long.

146
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:18.300
So, there goes ourprotector in a rage.

147
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.870
'Tis known to you he ismine enemy,

148
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.100
Nay, more, an enemy untoyou all,

149
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.400
And no great friend, Ifear me, to the king.

150
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.300
Consider, lords, he is thenext of blood,

151
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.800
And heir apparent to theEnglish crown:

152
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.230
Had Henry got an empire byhis marriage,

153
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.230
With all the wealthykingdoms of the west,

154
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.930
There's reason he shouldbe displeased at it.

155
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.000
Look to it, lords!

156
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.470
let not his smoothing wordsbewitch your hearts;

157
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.470
be wise and circumspect.

158
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.230
What though the commonpeople favour him,

159
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.330
Calling him 'Humphrey, thegood Duke of Gloucester,'

160
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.870
Clapping their hands, andcrying with loud voice,

161
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.870
'Jesu maintain your royalexcellence!'

162
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.870
With 'God preserve thegood Duke Humphrey!'

163
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.800
I fear me, lords, for allthis flattering gloss,

164
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.030
He will be found adangerous protector.

165
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.030
Why should he, then,protect our sovereign,

166
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:25.600
He being of age to governof himself?

167
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.230
Cousin of Somerset, joinyou with me,

168
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.170
And all together, with theDuke of Suffolk,

169
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:38.030
We'll quickly hoise DukeHumphrey from his seat.

170
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.600
This weighty business willnot brook delay:

171
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.000
I'll to the Duke ofSuffolk presently.

172
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.370
Cousin of Buckingham,

173
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.370
though Humphrey's pride

174
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.870
and greatness of hisplace be grief to us,

175
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.530
Yet let us watch thehaughty cardinal:

176
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.970
His insolence is moreintolerable

177
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.330
Than all the princes inthe land beside:

178
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.900
If Gloucester be displaced,he'll be protector.

179
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.100
Or thou or I, Somerset,will be protector,

180
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.300
Despite Duke Humphrey orthe cardinal.

181
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.530
Pride went before,ambition follows him.

182
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.070
While these do labour fortheir own preferment,

183
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.070
Behoves it us to labourfor the realm.

184
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.730
I never saw but HumphreyDuke of Gloucester

185
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.430
Did bear him like a noblegentleman.

186
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.000
Oft have I seen thehaughty cardinal,

187
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.730
More like a soldier than aman o' the church,

188
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.270
As stout and proud as hewere lord of all,

189
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.100
Swear like a ruffian anddemean himself

190
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.370
Unlike the ruler of acommonweal.

191
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.130
Warwick, my son, thecomfort of my age,

192
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.670
Thy deeds, thy plainnessand thy housekeeping,

193
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.670
Hath won the greatestfavour of the commons,

194
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.800
Excepting none but goodDuke Humphrey:

195
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.000
And, cousin York, thyacts in Ireland,

196
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.830
In bringing them to civildiscipline,

197
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.330
Thy late exploits done inthe heart of France,

198
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.800
When thou wert regent forour sovereign,

199
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.430
Have made thee fear'd andhonour'd of the people:

200
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.430
The reverence of mineage and Nevelle's name

201
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.030
is of no littleforce if I command.

202
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.970
Join we together, for thepublic good,

203
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.730
In what we can, to bridleand suppress

204
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.600
The pride of Suffolk andthe cardinal,

205
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.930
With Somerset's andBuckingham's ambition;

206
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.570
And, as we may, cherishDuke Humphrey's deeds,

207
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.070
While they do tend theprofit of the land.

208
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.370
So God help Warwick, as heloves the land,

209
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.530
And common profit of hiscountry!

210
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.600
And so says York, for hehath greatest cause.

211
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.900
Then let's make haste away,and look unto the main.

212
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.300
Unto the main! O father,Maine is lost;

213
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.370
That Maine which by mainforce Warwick did win,

214
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.200
And would have kept solong as breath did last!

215
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.170
Main chance, father, youmeant; but I meant Maine,

216
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:17.000
Which I will win fromFrance, or else be slain,

217
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.570
Anjou and Maine are givento the French;

218
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.830
Paris is lost; the stateof Normandy

219
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.730
Stands on a tickle point,now they are gone:

220
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.930
Suffolk concluded on thearticles,

221
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:42.430
The peers agreed, and Henrywas well pleased to change

222
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:49.930
two dukedoms for aduke's fair daughter.

223
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:56.200
I cannot blame them all:what is't to them?

224
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.900
'Tis thine they give away,and not their own.

225
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.470
Pirates may make cheappennyworths of their pillage

226
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.170
And purchase friends andgive to courtezans,

227
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.130
Still revelling like lordstill all be gone;

228
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:21.400
While as the silly owner ofthe goods weeps over them

229
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.800
and wrings his hapless hands

230
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.000
And shakes his head andtrembling stands aloof,

231
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.300
While all is shared andall is borne away,

232
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.330
Ready to starve and darenot touch his own:

233
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.600
So York must sit and fretand bite his tongue,

234
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.270
While his own lands arebargain'd for and sold.

235
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.430
Anjou and Maine both givenunto the French!

236
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.870
Cold news for me, for Ihad hope of France,

237
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.630
Even as I have of fertileEngland's soil.

238
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.570
A day will come when Yorkshall claim his own;

239
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:12.200
And therefore I will takethe Nevils' parts

240
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.230
And make a show of love toproud Duke Humphrey,

241
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.630
And, when I spy advantage,claim the crown,

242
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.330
For that's the golden markI seek to hit:

243
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.030
Nor shall proud Lancasterusurp my right,

244
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.030
Nor hold the sceptre inhis childish fist,

245
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.900
Nor wear the diadem uponhis head,

246
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.200
Whose church-like humoursfits not for a crown.

247
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:44.570
Then, York, be stillawhile, till time do serve:

248
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:49.500
Watch thou and wake whenothers be asleep,

249
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500
To pry into the secrets ofthe state;

250
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.700
Till Henry, surfeiting injoys of love,

251
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.830
With his new bride andEngland's dear-bought queen,

252
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.700
And Humphrey with thepeers be fall'n at jars:

253
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:13.670
Then will I raise aloftthe milk-white rose,

254
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.670
With whose sweet smell theair shall be perfumed;

255
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.000
And in my standard, bearthe arms of York

256
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.300
To grapple with the houseof Lancaster;

257
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.230
And, force perforce, I'llmake him yield the crown,

258
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.800
Whose bookish rule hathpull'd fair England down.

259
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.700
Why droops my lord, likeover-ripen'd corn,

260
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.470
Hanging the head at Ceres'plenteous load?

261
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.430
Why are thine eyes fixedto the sullen earth,

262
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.370
Gazing on that which seemsto dim thy sight?

263
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.300
What seest thou there?King Henry's diadem,

264
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.700
Enchased with all thehonours of the world?

265
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.230
If so, gaze on, and grovelon thy face,

266
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.070
Until thy head be circledwith the same.

267
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:15.570
Put forth thy hand, reachat the glorious gold.

268
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.870
What, is't too short? I'lllengthen it with mine:

269
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.930
And, having both togetherheaved it up,

270
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.170
We'll both together liftour heads to heaven,

271
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.430
And never more abase oursight so low

272
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.230
As to vouchsafe one glanceunto the ground.

273
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.900
O Nell, sweet Nell, ifthou dost love thy lord,

274
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.730
Banish the canker ofambitious thoughts.

275
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.870
And may that hour, when Iimagine ill against my king

276
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.900
and nephew, virtuous Henry,

277
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:50.600
Be my last breathing inthis mortal world!

278
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.670
My troublous dream thisnight doth make me sad.

279
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.600
What dream'd my lord? tellme, and I'll requite it

280
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.470
with sweet rehearsal ofmy morning's dream.

281
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:08.470
Methought this staff, mineoffice-badge in court,

282
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.030
Was broke in twain; bywhom I have forgot,

283
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.530
But, as I think, it was bythe cardinal;

284
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.570
And on the pieces of thebroken wand

285
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:24.600
Were placed the heads ofEdmund Duke of Somerset,

286
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.130
And William de la Pole,first duke of Suffolk.

287
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.870
This was my dream: what itdoth bode, God knows.

288
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.370
Tut, this was nothing butan argument

289
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.600
That he that breaks a stickof Gloucester's grove

290
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.530
Shall lose his head forhis presumption.

291
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:49.770
But list to me, myHumphrey, my sweet duke:

292
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.370
Methought I sat in seat ofmajesty

293
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.430
In the cathedral church ofWestminster,

294
00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:00.200
And in that chair where kingsand queens are crown'd;

295
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.500
Where Henry and dameMargaret kneel'd to me

296
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.600
And on my head did set thediadem.

297
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.830
Art thou not second womanin the realm,

298
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.830
And the protector's wife,beloved of him?

299
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.930
Hast thou not worldlypleasure at command,

300
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.900
Above the reach or compassof thy thought?

301
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.170
And wilt thou still behammering treachery,

302
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.700
To tumble down thy husbandand thyself

303
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.100
From top of honour todisgrace's feet?

304
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.170
Away from me, and let mehear no more!

305
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.400
What, what, my lord! are youso choleric with Eleanor,

306
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.000
for telling but her dream?

307
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.500
Next time I'll keep mydreams unto myself,

308
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.330
And not be cheque'd.

309
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.530
Nay, be not angry; I ampleased again.

310
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.600
My lord protector,

311
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.400
'tis his highness'pleasure you do prepare

312
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.130
to ride unto Saint Alban's,

313
00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.130
Where as the king andqueen do mean to hawk.

314
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:10.600
I go. Come, Nell, thouwilt ride with us?

315
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.270
Yes, my good lord, I'llfollow presently.

316
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.730
Follow I must; I cannot gobefore,

317
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.870
While Gloucester bearsthis base and humble mind.

318
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:34.830
Were I a man, a duke, andnext of blood,

319
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.600
I would remove thesetedious stumbling-blocks

320
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.230
And smooth my way upontheir headless necks;

321
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.870
And, being a woman, I willnot be slack

322
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:49.530
To play my part inFortune's pageant.

323
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:55.570
Where are you there? SirJohn! nay, fear not, man,

324
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.700
We are alone; here's nonebut thee and I.

325
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.400
Jesus preserve your royalmajesty!

326
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.070
What say'st thou? majesty!I am but grace.

327
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.500
But, by the grace of God,and Hume's advice,

328
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.570
Your grace's titles shallbe multiplied.

329
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.730
What say'st thou, man?

330
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.300
hast thou as yet conferr'dWith Margery Jourdain,

331
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.670
the witch of I,With Bolingbroke,

332
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.130
the cunning conjurer? And willthey undertake to do me good?

333
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.630
This they have promised me,to show your highness

334
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.300
A spirit raised from depthof under-ground,

335
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.870
That shall make answer tosuch questions

336
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.900
As by your grace shall bepropounded him.

337
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.670
It is enough; I'll thinkupon the questions:

338
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.730
When from St. Alban's wedo make return,

339
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.630
We'll see these thingseffected to the full.

340
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.770
Here, Hume, take thisreward; make merry, man,

341
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.870
With thy confederates inthis weighty cause.

342
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.170
Hume must make merry withthe duchess' gold;

343
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.100
(Laughing)

344
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.830
Marry, and shall. But hownow, Sir John Hume!

345
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.370
Seal up your lips, andgive no words but mum:

346
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.600
The business asketh silentsecrecy.

347
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.900
Dame Eleanor gives gold tobring the witch:

348
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.330
Gold cannot come amiss,were she a devil.

349
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.670
Yet have I gold flies fromanother coast;

350
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.770
I dare not say, from therich cardinal

351
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.800
And from the great andnew-made Duke of Suffolk,

352
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.270
Yet I do find it so; forto be plain,

353
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.900
They, knowing DameEleanor's aspiring humour,

354
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.170
Have hired me to underminethe duchess

355
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.170
And buz these conjurationsin her brain.

356
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.230
They say 'A crafty knavedoes need no broker;'

357
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.130
Yet am I Suffolk and thecardinal's broker.

358
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.870
Hume, if you take not heed,

359
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.130
you shall go nearto call them both

360
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.930
a pair of crafty knaves.

361
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:22.000
Well, so it stands;and thus, I fear,

362
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.930
at last Hume's knavery willbe the duchess' wreck,

363
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.770
And her attainture will beHumphrey's fall:

364
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:38.130
Sort how it will, I willhave gold for all.

365
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.400
(Laughing)

366
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.530
My masters, let's stand close:

367
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.630
my lord protector willcome this way by and by,

368
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.500
and then we may deliver oursupplications in the quill.

369
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.930
Marry, the Lord protecthim, for he's a good man!

370
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.130
Jesu bless him!

371
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:16.400
Here a' comes, methinks,and the queen with him.

372
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.570
I'll be the first, sure.

373
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.070
Come back, fool; this isthe Duke of Suffolk,

374
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.130
and not my lord protector.

375
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.270
How now, fellow! would'stanything with me?

376
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.230
Pardon me my lord; I tookye for my lord protector.

377
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.930
'To my Lord Protector!' Are yoursupplications to his lordship?

378
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:32.700
Let me see them:

379
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.970
what is thine?

380
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.970
Pardon me maam. Mine is,an't please your grace,

381
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.570
against John Goodman, mylord cardinal's man,

382
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.000
for keeping my house, and lands,and wife and all, from me.

383
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.230
Thy wife, too! that'ssome wrong, indeed.

384
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:55.230
What's yours? What's here!

385
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.400
'Against the Duke ofSuffolk, for enclosing the

386
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.930
commons of Long Melford.' Hownow, sir knave!

387
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.000
Alas, sir,

388
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.170
I am but a poor petitionerof our whole township.

389
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.230
Against my master,Thomas Horner,

390
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.370
for saying that the Dukeof York was rightful

391
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.800
heir to the crown.

392
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.700
What sayst thou? did the Dukeof York say he was rightful

393
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.570
heir to the crown?

394
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.070
That my master was? no,forsooth: my master said

395
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:30.200
that he was, and that theking was an userer.

396
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.830
A usurper, thou would'st say.

397
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.000
Ay usurper user

398
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.800
Who is there?

399
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.930
Take this fellow in,

400
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.200
and send for his master witha presently: we'll hear

401
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.270
more of your matter beforethe King.

402
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.970
And as for you, that loveto be protected

403
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.300
Under the wings of ourprotector's grace,

404
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.600
Begin your suits anew, andsue to him.

405
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.170
Away, base cullions!Suffolk, let him go.

406
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.870
Come, let's be gone.

407
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:19.830
My Lord of Suffolk, say,is this the guise,

408
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.400
Is this the fashion in thecourt of England?

409
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.170
Is this the government ofBritain's isle,

410
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.070
And this the royalty ofAlbion's king?

411
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.500
What shall King Henry be apupil still

412
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.830
Under the surlyGloucester's governance?

413
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.600
Am I a queen in title andin style,

414
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.700
And must be made a subjectto a duke?

415
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.800
I tell thee, Pole, when inthe city Tours

416
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.030
Thou ran'st a tilt inhonour of my love

417
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.170
And stolest away theladies' hearts of France,

418
00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.870
I thought King Henry hadresembled thee in courage,

419
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:59.570
courtship and proportion:

420
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.700
But all his mind isbent to holiness,

421
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.500
To number Ave-Maries onhis beads;

422
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.400
His champions are theprophets and apostles,

423
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.500
His weapons holy saws ofsacred writ,

424
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.700
His study is histilt-yard, and his loves

425
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.170
Are brazen images ofcanonized saints.

426
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.500
I would the college of thecardinals

427
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.300
Would choose him pope, andcarry him to Rome,

428
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.070
And set the triple crownupon his head:

429
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.800
That were a state fit forhis holiness.

430
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.770
Madam, be patient: as Iwas cause

431
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.100
Your highness came to England,

432
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.070
so will I In England workyour grace's full content.

433
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.130
Beside the haughty protector,have we Beaufort,

434
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:42.670
The imperious churchman,Somerset, Buckingham,

435
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.530
And grumbling York: andnot the least of these

436
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.070
But can do more in Englandthan the king.

437
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.570
And he of these that cando most of all

438
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.730
Cannot do more in Englandthan the Nevils:

439
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.870
Salisbury and Warwick areno simple peers.

440
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.100
Not all these lords do vexme half so much

441
00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:02.500
As that proud dame, thelord protector's wife.

442
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.330
She sweeps it through thecourt with troops of ladies,

443
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.800
More like an empress thanDuke Humphrey's wife:

444
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.170
Strangers in court do takeher for the queen:

445
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.370
She bears a duke'srevenues on her back,

446
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.530
And in her heart shescorns our poverty:

447
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.330
Shall I not live to beavenged on her?

448
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.600
Contemptuous base-borncallet as she is,

449
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.530
She vaunted 'mongst herminions t'other day,

450
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.200
The very train of herworst wearing gown

451
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.970
Was better worth than allmy father's lands,

452
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.370
Till Suffolk gave twodukedoms for his daughter.

453
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.470
Madam, myself have limed abush for her,

454
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.930
And placed a quire of suchenticing birds,

455
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.230
That she will light tolisten to the lays,

456
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.230
And never mount to troubleyou again.

457
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.000
So, let her rest: and,madam, list to me;

458
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.470
For I am bold to counselyou in this.

459
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.630
Although we fancy not thecardinal,

460
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.570
Yet must we join with himand with the lords,

461
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.870
Till we have brought DukeHumphrey in disgrace.

462
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.770
As for the Duke of York,this late complaint

463
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.030
Will make but little forhis benefit.

464
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:25.700
So, one by one, we'll weedthem all at last,

465
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.670
And you yourself shallsteer the happy helm.

466
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.930
For my part, noble lords,I care not which;

467
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.530
Or Somerset or York, all'sone to me.

468
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.370
(Bugles play)

469
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.130
If York have ill demean'dhimself in France,

470
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.430
Then let him be denay'dthe regentship.

471
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.870
If Somerset be unworthy ofthe place,

472
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.030
Let York be regent; I willyield to him.

473
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.770
Whether your grace beworthy, yea or no,

474
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.770
Dispute not that: York isthe worthier.

475
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.400
Ambitious Warwick, let thybetters speak.

476
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.600
The cardinal's not mybetter in the field.

477
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.970
All in this presence arethy betters, Warwick.

478
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.730
Warwick may live to be thebest of all.

479
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.870
Peace, son! and show somereason, Buckingham,

480
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.570
Why Somerset should bepreferred in this.

481
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:07.700
Because the king,forsooth, will have it so.

482
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.170
Madam, the king is old enoughhimself to give his censure:

483
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.700
these are no women's matters.

484
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.270
If he be old enough,what needs your grace

485
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.570
To be protector of hisexcellence?

486
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.130
Madam, I am protector ofthe realm;

487
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.730
And, at his pleasure, willresign my place.

488
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.000
Resign it then and leavethine insolence.

489
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.230
Since thou wert king--aswho is king but thou?--

490
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.930
The commonwealth hathdaily run to wreck;

491
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.070
The Dauphin hath prevail'dbeyond the seas;

492
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.170
And all the peers andnobles of the realm

493
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.170
Have been as bondmen tothy sovereignty.

494
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.970
The commons hast thou rack'd;

495
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.170
the clergy's bags Are lank andlean with thy extortions.

496
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.830
Thy sumptuous buildingsand thy wife's attire

497
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.300
Have cost a mass of publictreasury.

498
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.330
Thy cruelty in execution

499
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.400
Upon offenders, hathexceeded law,

500
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.930
And left thee to the mercyof the law.

501
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.930
They sale of offices andtowns in France,

502
00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.030
If they were known, as thesuspect is great,

503
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.470
Would make thee quicklyhop without thy head.

504
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:17.400
Give me my fan: what,minion! can ye not?

505
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.070
I cry you mercy, madam;was it you?

506
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:25.630
Was't I! yea, I it was,proud Frenchwoman:

507
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.670
Could I come near yourbeauty with my nails,

508
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.900
I'd set my tencommandments in your face.

509
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.070
Sweet aunt, be quiet;'twas against her will.

510
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.200
Against her will! goodking, look to't in time;

511
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.330
She'll hamper thee, anddandle thee like a baby:

512
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.870
Though in this place mostmaster wear no breeches,

513
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.600
She shall not strike DameEleanor unrevenged.

514
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.470
Lord cardinal, I willfollow Eleanor,

515
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.430
And listen after Humphrey,how he proceeds:

516
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.530
She's tickled now; herfury needs no spurs,

517
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.870
She'll gallop far enoughto her destruction.

518
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:07.570
Now, lords, my cholerbeing over-blown

519
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.470
With walking once aboutthe quadrangle,

520
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.470
I come to talk ofcommonwealth affairs.

521
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:17.170
As for your spiteful falseobjections,

522
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.830
Prove them, and I lie opento the law:

523
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.930
But God in mercy so dealwith my soul,

524
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.500
As I in duty love my kingand country!

525
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.000
But, to the matter that wehave in hand:

526
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.070
I say, my sovereign, Yorkis meetest man

527
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.230
To be your regent in therealm of France.

528
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.530
Before we make election,

529
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.870
give me leave to show somereason, of no little force,

530
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.170
That York is most unmeetof any man.

531
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.730
I'll tell thee, Suffolk,why I am unmeet:

532
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.070
First, for I cannotflatter thee in pride;

533
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.130
Next, if I be appointedfor the place,

534
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.830
My Lord of Somerset willkeep me here,

535
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.330
Without discharge, money,or furniture,

536
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.500
Till France be won intothe Dauphin's hands:

537
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.870
Last time, I dancedattendance on his will

538
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.830
Till Paris was besieged,famish'd, and lost.

539
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.830
That can I witness; and afouler fact

540
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.470
Did never traitor in theland commit.

541
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.500
Peace, headstrong Warwick!

542
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.170
Image of pride, why shouldI hold my peace?

543
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.000
Because here is a manaccused of treason:

544
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.470
Pray God the Duke of Yorkexcuse himself!

545
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:33.330
Doth any one accuse Yorkfor a traitor?

546
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.570
What mean'st thou, Suffolk;tell me, what are these?

547
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.330
Please it your majesty,this is the man

548
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.630
That doth accuse hismaster of high treason:

549
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.600
His words were these: thatRichard, Duke of York,

550
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.670
Was rightful heir unto theEnglish crown

551
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.100
And that your majesty wasa usurper.

552
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.530
Say, man, were these thywords?

553
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.330
An't shall please your majesty,

554
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.470
I never said nor thoughtany such matter:

555
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.430
God is my witness, I am falselyaccused by the villain.

556
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.630
By these ten bones, my lords,he did speak them to me

557
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.570
in the garret one night,as we were scouring my

558
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.830
Lord of York's armour.

559
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.570
Base dunghill villain andmechanical,

560
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.330
I'll have thy head forthis thy traitor's speech.

561
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.900
I do beseech your royalmajesty,

562
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.800
Let him have all the rigorof the law.

563
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.370
Alas, my lord, hang me, ifever I spake the words.

564
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.230
My accuser is my 'prentice;and when I did correct

565
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.800
him for his fault the otherday, he did vow upon his knees

566
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.830
he would be even with me: Ihave good witness of this:

567
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.670
therefore I beseechyour majesty,

568
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:38.670
do not cast away an honest manfor a villain's accusation.

569
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.970
Uncle, what shall wesay to this in law?

570
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.970
This doom, my lord, if Imay judge my case:

571
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.100
Let Somerset be regentover the French,

572
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.400
Because in York thisbreeds suspicion:

573
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.670
And let these have a dayappointed them

574
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.270
For single combat inconvenient place,

575
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.770
For he hath witness of hisservant's malice:

576
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:16.130
This is the law, and thisDuke Humphrey's doom.

577
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.770
I humbly thank your royalmajesty.

578
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.930
And I accept the combatwillingly.

579
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:27.670
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight;for God's sake, pity my case.

580
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.800
The spite of manprevaileth against me.

581
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.600
O Lord, have mercy upon me!

582
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.200
I shall never be able to fighta blow. O Lord, my heart!

583
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.730
Sirrah, or you must fight,or else be hang'd.

584
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.570
Away with them to prison;and the day of combat

585
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:45.570
shall be the lastof the next month.

586
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.700
Come, Somerset, we'llsee thee sent away.

587
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:25.570
(Cymbals clanging)

588
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.430
Come master Bolingbroke;the duchess, I tell you,

589
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.830
expects performanceof your promises.

590
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.100
Master Hume, we aretherefore provided:

591
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.070
will her ladyship beholdand hear our exorcisms?

592
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.200
Ay, what else? fearyou not her courage.

593
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.270
I have heard her reported to be

594
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.100
a woman of anexceptional spirit:

595
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:50.970
but it shall be convenient,

596
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.670
Master Hume, that yoube by her aloft,

597
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.670
while we be busy below; and so,I pray you, go, in God's name,

598
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.700
and leave us.

599
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.600
Mother Jourdain,

600
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.930
be you prostrate and grovel onthe earth; John Southwell,

601
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:13.830
read you; and let us toour work.

602
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.370
Well said, my masters;

603
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.200
To this gear thesooner the better.

604
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.030
Patience, good lady;wizards know their times:

605
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.600
(drumming)

606
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:41.530
Deep night, dark night,the silent of the night,

607
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.370
The time of night whenTroy was set on fire;

608
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.970
The time when screech-owlscry and ban-dogs howl,

609
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:56.030
And spirits walk and ghostsbreak up their graves,

610
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.970
That time best fits thework we have in hand.

611
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:04.430
Madam, stay you and fearnot: whom we raise,

612
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:08.230
We will make fast within ahallow'd verge.

613
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:20.630
(chanting magic spell)

614
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:41.600
(chanting magic spell)

615
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:55.130
Adsum,

616
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.230
Asmath,

617
00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.430
By the eternal God, whosename and power

618
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:05.170
Thou tremblest at, answerthat I shall ask;

619
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.730
For, till thou speak, thoushalt not pass from hence.

620
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:17.370
Ask what thou wilt. That Ihad said and done!

621
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:23.530
'First of the king: whatshall of him become?'

622
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:30.800
The duke yet lives thatHenry shall depose;

623
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.870
Yet him outlive, and die aviolent death.

624
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:44.930
Tell me 'What fate awaits theDuke of Suffolk?'

625
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:50.270
By water shall he die, andtake his end.

626
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.200
'What shall betide theDuke of Somerset?'

627
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.500
Let him shun castles;

628
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.830
Safer shall he be upon thesandy plains

629
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:05.970
Than where castles mountedstand.

630
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:11.930
Have done, for more Ihardly can endure.

631
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:17.470
Descend to darkness andthe burning lake!

632
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:21.470
False fiend, avoid!

633
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:31.500
Lay hands upon thesetraitors and their trash.

634
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.530
Lay hands upon thesetraitors and their trash.

635
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:42.870
Beldam, I think we watch'dyou at an inch.

636
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:47.670
What, madam, are you there?the king and commonweal

637
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.930
Are deeply indebted forthis piece of pains:

638
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.530
My lord protector will, Idoubt it not,

639
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.870
See you well guerdon'd forthese good deserts.

640
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.900
Not half so bad as thineto England's king,

641
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.130
Injurious duke, thatthreatest where's no cause.

642
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:13.730
True, madam, none at all:what call you this?

643
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.600
Away with them! let thembe clapp'd up close.

644
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.770
And kept asunder. You,madam, shall with us.

645
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:21.030
take her to thee.

646
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.630
We'll see your trinketshere all forthcoming.

647
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.470
All, away!

648
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.170
Lord Buckingham, methinks,you watch'd her well:

649
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:51.170
A pretty plot, well chosento build upon!

650
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.930
Now, pray, my lord, let'ssee the devil's writ.

651
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.070
What have we here?

652
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.070
'The duke yet lives, thatHenry shall depose;

653
00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:17.070
But him outlive, anddie a violent death.'

654
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:27.730
'Tell me what fate awaitsthe Duke of Suffolk?

655
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:31.800
By water shall he die, andtake his end.

656
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.070
What shall betide the Dukeof Somerset?

657
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.500
Let him shun castles;

658
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.200
Safer shall he be upon thesandy plains

659
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.600
Than where castles mountedstand.'

660
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.730
(Laughing) Come, come, my lords;

661
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.930
These oracles are hardlyattain'd,

662
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:01.930
And hardly understood.

663
00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.570
The king is now in progresstowards Saint Alban's,

664
00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.330
With him the husbandof this lovely lady:

665
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:13.400
Thither go these news, as fastas horse can carry them:

666
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.130
A sorry breakfast for mylord protector.

667
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.470
Your grace shall give meleave, my Lord of York,

668
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.230
To be the post, in hope ofhis reward.

669
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:26.030
At your pleasure, my good lord.

670
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.700
Within there, ho!

671
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.000
Invite my Lords ofSalisbury and Warwick

672
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.470
To sup with me to-morrownight. Away!

673
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:59.100
(cheering and horns)

674
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.630
Believe me, lords, forflying at the brook,

675
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.500
I saw not better sportthese seven years' day:

676
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.400
But what a point, my lord,your falcon made,

677
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.700
And what a pitch she flewabove the rest!

678
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.270
To see how God in all hiscreatures works!

679
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.470
Yea, man and birds arefain of climbing high.

680
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.830
No marvel, an it like yourmajesty,

681
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:22.170
My lord protector's hawksdo tower so well;

682
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.100
They know their masterloves to be aloft,

683
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.170
And bears his thoughtsabove his falcon's pitch.

684
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.030
My lord, 'tis but a baseignoble mind

685
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.070
That mounts no higher thana bird can soar.

686
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:37.970
I thought as much; hewould be above the clouds.

687
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.000
Ay, my lord cardinal? howthink you by that?

688
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.600
Were it not good yourgrace could fly to heaven?

689
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.600
The treasury ofeverlasting joy.

690
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.300
Thy heaven is on earth;thine eyes and thoughts

691
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.130
Beat on a crown, thetreasure of thy heart;

692
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.970
Pernicious protector,dangerous peer,

693
00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.630
That smooth'st it so withking and commonweal!

694
00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:02.370
Churchmen so hot? Gooduncle, can you do it?

695
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.600
To hide such malice withsuch holiness?

696
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.070
No malice, sir; no morethan well becomes

697
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:13.800
So good a quarrel and sobad a peer.

698
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.630
As who, my lord?

699
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.300
Why, as yourself, my lord,

700
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.600
An't like your lordlylord-protectorship.

701
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.770
Why, Suffolk, Englandknows thine insolence.

702
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.030
And thy ambition,Gloucester.

703
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.970
I prithee, peace, goodqueen,

704
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.530
And whet not on thesefurious peers;

705
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.900
For blessed are thepeacemakers on earth.

706
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.770
Let me be blessed for thepeace I make,

707
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:39.170
Against this proudprotector, with my sword!

708
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.230
Faith, holy uncle,

709
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.500
would 'twere come to that!

710
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.370
Marry, when thou darest.

711
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.330
Dare? Until thee priest,

712
00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:50.600
plantagenets couldnever brook the dare.

713
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.730
I am plantagenet as well asthou.

714
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.200
And son to John of Gaunt.

715
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.400
In bastardy.

716
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.630
I scorn thy words.

717
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.600
Make up no factiousnumbers for the matter;

718
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.200
In thine own person answerthy abuse.

719
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.230
Ay, where thou darest not peep:

720
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.530
an if thou darest,

721
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.030
This evening, on theeast side of the grove.

722
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.800
How now, my lords!

723
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.800
Believe me, cousinGloucester,

724
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.200
Had not your man put upthe fowl so suddenly,

725
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.730
We had had more sport.

726
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.730
Come with thy two-handsword.

727
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.170
True, uncle.

728
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.500
Are ye well advised?

729
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.900
The east side of the grove?

730
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.030
I am with you.

731
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.900
Why, how now, uncleGloucester!

732
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.600
Talking of hawking;nothing else, my lord.

733
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.930
Now, by God's mother, priest,I'll shave your crown for this,

734
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.230
Protector, see to't well,protect thyself.

735
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.500
The winds grow high; so doyour stomachs, lords.

736
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.830
How irksome is this musicto my heart!

737
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.100
When such strings jar,what hope of harmony?

738
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.400
I pray, my lords, let mecompound this strife.

739
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.600
(commotion in background)

740
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:56.470
What noise is this?

741
00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:01.800
Fellow, what miracle dostthou proclaim?

742
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.870
A miracle! a miracle!

743
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.370
Come to the king and tellhim what miracle.

744
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.500
Forsooth, a blind man atSaint Alban's shrine,

745
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.930
Within this half-hour,hath received his sight;

746
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.570
A man that ne'er saw inhis life before.

747
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.370
Now, God be praised, thatto believing souls

748
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:22.070
Gives light in darkness,comfort in despair!

749
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.430
(crowd chanting)

750
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.000
Here comes the townsmen onprocession,

751
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.530
To present your highnesswith the man.

752
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.670
Great is his comfort inthis earthly vale,

753
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.530
Although by his sight hissin be multiplied.

754
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:41.900
(men singing) A miracle! Amiracle!

755
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.770
Stand by, my masters:bring him near the king;

756
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:55.500
His highness' pleasure isto talk with him.

757
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.970
Good fellow, tell us herethe circumstance,

758
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.270
That we for thee mayglorify the Lord.

759
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:05.730
What, hast thou been longblind and now restored?

760
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:07.170
Born blind, an't pleaseyour grace.

761
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.170
Ay, indeed, was he.

762
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:10.230
What woman is this?

763
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.970
His wife, an't like yourworship.

764
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:16.630
Hadst thou been his mother,thou couldst have better told.

765
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.030
Where wert thou born?

766
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.900
At Berwick in the north,an't like your grace.

767
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.470
Poor soul, God's goodnesshath been great to thee:

768
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.170
Let never day nor nightunhallow'd pass,

769
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.570
But still remember whatthe Lord hath done.

770
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:32.170
Tell me, good fellow,camest thou here by chance,

771
00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.330
Or of devotion, to thisholy shrine?

772
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.770
God knows, of puredevotion; being call'd

773
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.970
A hundred times andoftener, in my sleep,

774
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.570
By good Saint Alban; whosaid, 'Saunder, come,

775
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.800
Come, offer at my shrine,and I will help thee.'

776
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.900
Most true, forsooth; andmany time and oft

777
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.700
Myself have heard a voiceto call him so.

778
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.070
What, art thou lame?

779
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.400
Ay, God Almighty help me!

780
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.870
How camest thou so?

781
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.430
A fall off of a tree.

782
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:02.470
A plum-tree, master.

783
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.570
How long hast thou beenblind?

784
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.170
Born so, master.

785
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.430
What, and wouldst climb atree?

786
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.130
But that in all my life,when I was a youth.

787
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.870
Too true; and bought hisclimbing very dear.

788
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:18.200
Mass, thou lovedst plums well,that wouldst venture so.

789
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.270
Alas, good master, my wifedesired some damsons,

790
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.800
And made me climb, withdanger of my life.

791
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.270
A subtle knave! but yet itshall not serve.

792
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:38.000
Let me see thine eyes:wink now: now open them:

793
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.530
In my opinion yet thouseest not well.

794
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.930
Yes, master, clear as day, Ithank God and Saint Alban.

795
00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:49.100
Say'st thou me so? Whatcolour is this cloak of?

796
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.770
Red, master; red as blood.

797
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.870
Why, that's well said.What colour is this gown of?

798
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.670
Black, forsooth:coal-black as jet.

799
00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.830
Why, then, thou know'stwhat colour jet is of?

800
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:03.000
And yet, I think, jet didhe never see.

801
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.270
But cloaks and gowns,before this day, a many.

802
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.800
Never, before this day, inall his life.

803
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.530
Tell me, sirrah, what's myname?

804
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.170
Alas, master, I know not.

805
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.270
What's his name?

806
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.130
I know not.

807
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.170
Nor his?

808
00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.000
No, indeed, master.

809
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.400
What's thine own name?

810
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.230
Saunder Simpcox, an if itplease you, master.

811
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:29.200
Then, Saunder, sit there, thelyingest knave in Christendom.

812
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.070
If thou hadst been born blind,

813
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.100
thou mightest as well haveknown all our names as thus to

814
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.230
name the severalcolours we do wear.

815
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.100
Sight may distinguishof colours,

816
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.270
but suddenly to nominatethem all, it is impossible.

817
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:45.700
Saint Alban here hathdone a miracle;

818
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.170
and might ye not thinkhis cunning to be great,

819
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.500
that could restore thiscripple to his legs?

820
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.430
O master, that you could!

821
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:53.770
My masters of Saint Alban's,

822
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.900
have you not a beadle in yourtown, and things called whips?

823
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.200
Yes, my lord.

824
00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.530
Send for onepresently.

825
00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.070
Sirrah, go fetch thebeadle hither straight.

826
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:06.600
Now fetch me a stool hitherby and by. Now, sirrah,

827
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.670
if you mean to saveyourself from whipping,

828
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.800
leap me over thisstool and run.

829
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.900
Alas, master, I am notable to stand alone:

830
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.000
You go about to torture mein vain.

831
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.100
Well we must haveyou find your legs.

832
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.530
Whip him till heleap over that same stool.

833
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.900
Come on, sirrah; off withyour doublet quickly.

834
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.400
Alas, master, what shall Ido? I am not able to stand.

835
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:39.130
(Man screams. Crowd chants) Amiracle!!

836
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.630
O God, seest Thou this,and bearest so long?

837
00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:47.500
It made me laugh to seethe villain run.

838
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.400
Follow the knave; and takethis drab away.

839
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.300
Alas, sir, we did it forpure need.

840
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.730
Let them be whipped throughevery market-town,

841
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.600
till they come to Berwick,from whence they came.

842
00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.430
Duke Humphrey has done amiracle to-day.

843
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:08.670
True; made the lame toleap and fly away.

844
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.200
But you have done moremiracles than I;

845
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.770
You made in a day, mylord, whole towns to fly.

846
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:20.470
What tidings with ourcousin Buckingham?

847
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.970
Such as my heart dothtremble to unfold.

848
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.400
A sort of naughty persons,lewdly bent,

849
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.430
Under the countenance andconfederacy of Lady Eleanor,

850
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:30.370
the protector's wife,

851
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:33.330
The ringleader and head ofall this rout,

852
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.130
Have practised dangerouslyagainst your state,

853
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.370
Dealing with witches andwith conjurers:

854
00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.830
Whom we have apprehendedin the fact;

855
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:44.470
Raising up wicked spiritsfrom under ground,

856
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.930
Demanding of King Henry'slife and death,

857
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:50.300
And other of yourhighness' privy-council;

858
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.270
As more at large yourgrace shall understand.

859
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.430
O God, what mischiefs workthe wicked ones,

860
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:59.230
Heaping confusion on theirown heads thereby!

861
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:02.300
Gloucester, see here thetainture of thy nest.

862
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.800
And look thyself befaultless, thou wert best.

863
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.800
Madam, for myself, toheaven I do appeal,

864
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.700
How I have loved my kingand commonweal:

865
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:22.170
And, for my wife, I knownot how it stands;

866
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:26.030
Sorry I am to hear what Ihave heard:

867
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:31.300
Noble she is, but if shehave forgot

868
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.800
Honour and virtue andconversed with such

869
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.400
As, like to pitch, defilenobility,

870
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.930
I banish her my bed andcompany

871
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:47.000
And give her as a prey tolaw and shame,

872
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.400
That hath dishonour'dGloucester's honest name.

873
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:57.730
Well, for this night wewill repose us here:

874
00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:59.230
To-morrow toward Londonback again,

875
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.670
To look into this businessthoroughly

876
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:04.100
And call these fouloffenders to their answers

877
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.830
And poise the cause injustice' equal scales,

878
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.870
Whose beam stands sure, whoserightful cause prevails.

879
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:39.700
Now, my good Lords ofSalisbury and Warwick,

880
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.030
Our simple supper ended,give me leave

881
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.930
In this close walk tosatisfy myself,

882
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.330
In craving your opinion ofmy title,

883
00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:53.100
Which is infallible, toEngland's crown.

884
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.370
My lord, I long to hear itat full.

885
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:58.800
Sweet York, begin: and ifthy claim be good,

886
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.800
The Nevils are thysubjects to command.

887
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.800
Then thus:

888
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.330
Edward the Third, mylords, had seven sons:

889
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:17.000
The first, the Black Princedied before his father

890
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.870
and left behind him,Richard, his only son.

891
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:24.270
Who after Edward the Third'sdeath reign'd as king;

892
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.770
Till Henry Bolingbroke, The sonand heir of John of Gaunt,

893
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.900
the fourth of Edward's sons

894
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.330
Seized on the realm,deposed the rightful king,

895
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.000
Sent his poor queen toFrance, from whence she came,

896
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.130
And him to Pomfret; where,as all you know,

897
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:43.630
Harmless Richard wasmurder'd traitorously.

898
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:47.300
Father, the duke of York hathtold the truth:

899
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:49.800
Thus got the house ofLancaster the crown.

900
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.930
Which now they hold byforce and not by right;

901
00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:01.430
For Richard, the firstson's heir, being dead,

902
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.730
The issue of the next sonshould have reign'd.

903
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.500
But William of Hatfielddied without an heir.

904
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.500
The third son, Duke ofClarence, from whose line

905
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.670
I claimed the crown, hadissue, Philippe, a daughter,

906
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:17.630
Who married EdmundMortimer, Earl of March:

907
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:20.730
Edmund had issue, RogerEarl of March;

908
00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.870
Roger had issue, Edmund,Anne and Eleanor.

909
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.330
This Edmund, in the reignof Bolingbroke,

910
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.400
As I have read, laid claimunto the crown;

911
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:36.630
And therefore was kept captivetil he died

912
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:38.300
But to the rest.

913
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.730
His eldest sister, Anne,

914
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:43.970
My mother, being heir untothe crown

915
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.800
Married RichardEarl of Cambridge;

916
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.170
who was son to Edmund Langley,Edward the Third's fifth son.

917
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:56.070
By her I claim the kingdom:

918
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:59.500
she was heir To Roger Earlof March, who was the son

919
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.770
Of Edmund Mortimer, whomarried Philippe,

920
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:06.270
Sole daughter unto LionelDuke of Clarence:

921
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:12.000
So, if the issue of the elderson succeed before the younger,

922
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.670
I am king.

923
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.470
What plain proceeding ismore plain than this?

924
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.270
Henry doth claim the crownfrom John of Gaunt,

925
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:22.970
The fourth son; Yorkclaims it from the third.

926
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.930
Till Lionel's issue fails,his should not reign:

927
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:28.430
It fails not yet, butflourishes in thee

928
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:33.730
And in thy sons, fairslips of such a stock.

929
00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:37.770
Then, father Salisbury,kneel we together;

930
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.900
And in this private plotbe we the first

931
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.030
That shall salute ourrightful sovereign

932
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:45.700
With honour of hisbirthright to the crown.

933
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:01.630
Long live our sovereignRichard, England's king!

934
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:09.630
We thank you, lords. But Iam not your king

935
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:13.130
Till I be crown'd and thatmy sword be stain'd

936
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.970
With heart-blood of thehouse of Lancaster;

937
01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:19.000
And that's not suddenly tobe perform'd,

938
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.570
But with advice and silentsecrecy.

939
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.370
Do you as I do in thesedangerous days:

940
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.930
Wink at the Duke ofSuffolk's insolence,

941
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:35.470
At Beaufort's pride, atSomerset's ambition,

942
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.700
At Buckingham and all thecrew of them,

943
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.770
Till they have snared theshepherd of the flock,

944
01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.930
That virtuous prince, thegood Duke Humphrey:

945
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.570
'Tis that they seek, andthey in seeking that

946
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.470
Shall find their deaths,if York can prophesy.

947
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:56.900
My lord, break we off; weknow your mind at full.

948
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.770
My heart assures me thatthe Earl of Warwick

949
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:07.530
Shall one day make theDuke of York a king.

950
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.530
And, Nevil, this I doassure myself:

951
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:13.770
Richard shall live to makethe Earl of Warwick

952
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:18.970
The greatest man inEngland but the king.

953
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.270
Stand forth, Dame EleanorCobham, Gloucester's wife:

954
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.970
In sight of God and us,your guilt is great:

955
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.870
Receive the sentence ofthe law for sins

956
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:03.400
Such as by God's book areadjudged to death.

957
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.000
You four, from hence toprison back again;

958
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.330
From thence unto the placeof execution:

959
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.430
The witch in Smithfieldshall be burn'd to ashes,

960
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.700
And you three shall bestrangled on the gallows.

961
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.130
You, madam, for you aremore nobly born,

962
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.130
Despoiled of your honourin your life,

963
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.870
Shall, after three days'open penance done,

964
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.670
Live in your country herein banishment,

965
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:26.670
With Sir John Stanley, inthe Isle of Man.

966
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:32.630
Welcome is banishment;welcome were my death.

967
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:38.730
Eleanor, the law, thousee'st, hath judged thee:

968
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:43.400
I cannot justify whom thelaw condemns.

969
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:54.630
(old woman laughs)

970
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.870
I beseech your majesty,give me leave to go;

971
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.930
Sorrow would solace andmine age would ease.

972
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.230
Stay, Humphrey Duke ofGloucester: ere thou go,

973
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:29.130
Give up thy staff: Henry willto himself protector be;

974
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:30.170
and God shall be my hope,

975
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:34.600
My stay, my guide andlantern to my feet:

976
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.070
And go in peace, Humphrey,no less beloved

977
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.330
Than when thou wertprotector to thy King.

978
01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:42.600
I see no reason why a kingof years

979
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.070
Should be to be protectedlike a child.

980
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:48.870
God and King Henry governEngland's realm.

981
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.070
Give up your staff, sir,and the king his realm.

982
01:03:53.070 --> 01:04:01.870
My staff? here, nobleHenry, is my staff:

983
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:04.730
As willingly do I the sameresign

984
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:09.330
As e'er thy father Henrymade it mine;

985
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:14.830
And even as willingly atthy feet I leave it

986
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:20.970
As others wouldambitiously receive it.

987
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:26.270
Farewell, good king: whenI am dead and gone,

988
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:30.870
May honourable peaceattend thy throne!

989
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:53.970
Why, now is Henry king,and Margaret queen;

990
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:58.130
And Humphrey Duke ofGloucester scarce himself,

991
01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:02.670
That bears so shrewd amaim; two pulls at once;

992
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:07.800
His lady banish'd, and alimb lopp'd off.

993
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:15.900
This staff of honourraught, there let it stand

994
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:21.100
Where it best fits to be,in Henry's hand.

995
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.200
Thus droops this loftypine and hangs his sprays;

996
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.200
Thus Eleanor's pride diesin her youngest days.

997
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:36.200
Lords, let him go. Pleaseit your majesty,

998
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.800
This is the day appointedfor the combat;

999
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.330
And ready are theappellant and defendant,

1000
01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:44.430
The armourer and his man,to enter the lists,

1001
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:47.770
So please your highness tobehold the fight.

1002
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.870
Ay, good my lord; forpurposely therefore

1003
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:54.370
Left I the court, to seethis quarrel tried.

1004
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.100
O God's name, see thelists and all things fit:

1005
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.670
Here let them end it; andGod defend the right!

1006
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.570
Here, neighbour Horner, I drinkto you in a cup of sack:

1007
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:26.100
and fear not, neighbour,you shall do well enough.

1008
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:32.370
And here, neighbour,here's a cup of charneco.

1009
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:35.830
And here's a pot of gooddouble beer, neighbour:

1010
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.400
drink, and fear not yourman.

1011
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:50.400
Let it come, i' faith,and I'll pledge you all;

1012
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.870
and a fig for Peter!

1013
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.130
First 'Prentice Here,Peter, I drink to thee:

1014
01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:55.600
and be not afraid.

1015
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.500
Second 'Prentice Be merry,Peter, and fear not thy master:

1016
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.900

I thank you all: drink, andpray for me, I pray you;

1018
01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:08.930
for I think I have taken mylast draught in this world.

1019
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:14.830
Here, Robin, an if I die,I give thee my apron:

1020
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.070
and, Will, thou shalthave my hammer:

1021
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:22.470
and here, Tom, take allthe money that I have.

1022
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:25.970
O Lord bless me! I pray God!for I am never able to deal

1023
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:29.400
with my master, he hath learntme so much fence already.

1024
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.300
Come, leave your drinking,and fall to blows.

1025
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.900
Sirrah, what's thy name?

1026
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.300
Peter, forsooth.

1027
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.530
Peter! what more?

1028
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:38.670
Thump.

1029
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:44.470
Thump! then see thou thumpthy master well.

1030
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:51.200
Masters, I am comehither, as it were,

1031
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.670
at my man's instigation,

1032
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:59.530
to prove him a knave andmyself an honest man:

1033
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:03.230
and touching the Duke of York,

1034
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:07.000
I will take my death, Inever meant him any ill,

1035
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.570
nor the king, nor thequeen: and therefore,

1036
01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.830
Peter, have at theewith a downright blow!

1037
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:19.330
Dispatch: this knave'stongue begins to double.

1038
01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:21.630
Sound, trumpets, alarum tothe combatants!

1039
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.170
(trumpets sound)

1040
01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:15.600
Hold, Peter, hold! Iconfess, I confess treason.

1041
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:26.970
Take away his weapon.Fellow, thank God,

1042
01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:36.270
Take away his weapon.Fellow, thank God,

1043
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:40.200
and the good wine inthy master's way.

1044
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:53.670
O God, have I overcome mineenemy in this presence?

1045
01:09:56.330 --> 01:10:01.400
O Peter, thou hastprevailed in right!

1046
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.770
Go, take hence thattraitor from our sight;

1047
01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:08.030
For by his death we doperceive his guilt:

1048
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.970
And God in justice hathrevealed to us

1049
01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:12.630
The truth and innocence ofthis poor fellow,

1050
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:15.870
Which he had thought tohave murder'd wrongfully.

1051
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.270
Come, fellow, follow usfor thy reward.

1052
01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:36.600
Thus sometimes hath thebrightest day a cloud;

1053
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.030
And after summer evermoresucceeds barren winter,

1054
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:44.170
with his wrathful nipping cold:

1055
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:50.100
So cares and joys abound,as seasons fleet.

1056
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:50.930
Sirs, what's o'clock?

1057
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:52.500
Ten, my lord.

1058
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.570
Ten is the hour that wasappointed me

1059
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:59.700
To watch the coming of mypunish'd duchess:

1060
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:05.330
Uneath may she endure theflinty streets,

1061
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:08.770
To tread them with hertender-feeling feet.

1062
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:15.730
Soft! I think shecomes; and I'll prepare

1063
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.930
My tear-stain'd eyes tosee her miseries.

1064
01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.830
So please your grace, we'lltake her from the sheriff.

1065
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:29.870
No, stir not, for yourlives; let her pass by.

1066
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:34.800
Come you, my lord, to seemy open shame?

1067
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.100
Now thou dost penance too.Look how they gaze!

1068
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.300
See how the giddymultitude do point,

1069
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:45.300
And nod their heads, andthrow their eyes on thee!

1070
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.530
Ah, Gloucester, hide theefrom their hateful looks,

1071
01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.830
And, in thy closet pentup, rue my shame,

1072
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.200
And ban thine enemies,both mine and thine!

1073
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.900
Be patient, gentle Nell;forget this grief.

1074
01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.200
Ah, Gloucester, teach meto forget myself!

1075
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.630
Trow'st thou that e'erI'll look upon the world,

1076
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:06.500
Or count them happy thatenjoy the sun?

1077
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.970
No; dark shall be my lightand night my day;

1078
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:14.100
To think upon my pompshall be my hell.

1079
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:18.570
Sometime I'll say, I amDuke Humphrey's wife,

1080
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:21.730
And he a prince and rulerof the land:

1081
01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:24.970
Yet so he ruled and such aprince he was

1082
01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:27.830
As he stood by whilst I,his forlorn duchess,

1083
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:29.870
Was made a wonder and apointing-stock

1084
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:33.300
To every idle rascalfollower.

1085
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.700
But be thou mild and blushnot at my shame,

1086
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.830
Nor stir at nothing tillthe axe of death

1087
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:43.670
Hang over thee, as, sure,it shortly will;

1088
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:46.570
For Suffolk, he that cando all in all

1089
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.070
With her that hateth theeand hates us all,

1090
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.330
And York and impiousBeaufort, that false priest,

1091
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:55.570
Have all limed bushes tobetray thy wings,

1092
01:12:55.570 --> 01:13:00.330
And, fly thou how thoucanst, they'll tangle thee:

1093
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:04.000
But fear not thou, untilthy foot be snared,

1094
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.900
Nor never seek preventionof thy foes.

1095
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:09.400
Ah, Nell, forbear! thouaimest all awry;

1096
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.430
I must offend before I beattainted;

1097
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:17.100
And had I twenty times somany foes,

1098
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.070
And each of them hadtwenty times their power,

1099
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:23.370
All these could notprocure me any scathe,

1100
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:27.830
So long as I am loyal,true and crimeless.

1101
01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.100
Wouldst have me rescuethee from this reproach?

1102
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.470
Why, yet thy scandal werenot wiped away

1103
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:45.170
But I in danger for thebreach of law.

1104
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:51.500
Thy greatest help isquiet, gentle Nell:

1105
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.830
I pray thee, sort thyheart to patience;

1106
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.730
These few days' wonderwill be quickly worn.

1107
01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:01.000
I summon your grace to hismajesty's parliament,

1108
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.570
Holden at Bury the firstof this next month.

1109
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:12.270
And my consent ne'er ask'dherein before!

1110
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:20.900
This is close dealing.Well, I will be there.

1111
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:32.770
My Nell, I take my leave:and, master sheriff,

1112
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:35.900
Let not her penance exceedthe king's commission.

1113
01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.200
An't please your grace,here my commission stays,

1114
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.030
And Sir John Stanley isappointed now

1115
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:44.730
To take her with him tothe Isle of Man.

1116
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:48.130
Must you, Sir John,protect my lady here?

1117
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:53.300
So am I given in charge,may't please your grace.

1118
01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.500
Entreat her not the worse inthat I pray you use her well:

1119
01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.570
the world may laugh again;

1120
01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:05.070
And I may live to do youkindness if you do it her:

1121
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.230
and so, Sir John, farewell!

1122
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:14.000
What, gone, my lord, andbid me not farewell!

1123
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.730
Witness my tears, I cannotstay to speak.

1124
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:30.370
Art thou gone too? allcomfort go with thee!

1125
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:37.770
For none abides with me:my joy is death;

1126
01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:39.270
Death, at whose name I ofthave been afear'd,

1127
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:44.600
Because I wish'd thisworld's eternity.

1128
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.030
Stanley, I prithee, go,and take me hence;

1129
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.370
I care not whither, for Ibeg no favour,

1130
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:52.570
Only convey me where thouart commanded.

1131
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:57.970
Sheriff, farewell, andbetter than I fare,

1132
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:01.170
Although thou hast beenconduct of my shame.

1133
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:04.870
It is my office; and,madam, pardon me.

1134
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:10.330
Ay, ay, farewell; thyoffice is discharged.

1135
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:12.430
Come, Stanley, shall wego?

1136
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:17.630
Madam, your penance done,throw off this sheet,

1137
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.770
And go we to attire youfor our journey.

1138
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:24.530
My shame will not beshifted with my sheet:

1139
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:27.630
No, it will hang upon myrichest robes

1140
01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:32.430
And show itself, attire mehow I can.

1141
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:39.230
Go, lead the way; I longto see my prison.

1142
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.470
I muse my Lord ofGloucester is not come:

1143
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.870
'Tis not his wont to bethe hindmost man,

1144
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:13.600
Whate'er occasion keepshim from us now.

1145
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.000
Can you not see? or willye not observe

1146
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.470
The strangeness of hisalter'd countenance?

1147
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:22.500
With what a majesty heholds himself,

1148
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.000
How insolent of late he isbecome,

1149
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.530
How proud, how peremptory,and unlike himself?

1150
01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:32.030
We know the time since hewas mild and affable,

1151
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.030
And if we did but glance afar-off look,

1152
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:36.930
Immediately he was uponhis knee,

1153
01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:40.130
That all the court admiredhim for submission:

1154
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.300
But meet him now, and, beit in the morn,

1155
01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.300
When every one will givethe time of day,

1156
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.500
He knits his brow andshows an angry eye,

1157
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.570
And passeth by with stiffunbowed knee,

1158
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:54.500
Disdaining duty that to usbelongs.

1159
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.670
Small curs are notregarded when they grin;

1160
01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:02.870
But great men tremble whenthe lion roars;

1161
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:06.900
And Humphrey is no littleman in England.

1162
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.500
First note that he is nearyou in descent,

1163
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.600
And should you fall, he asthe next will mount.

1164
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.230
Me seemeth then it is nopolicy,

1165
01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:19.830
Respecting what arancorous mind he bears

1166
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:23.230
And his advantagefollowing your decease,

1167
01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.070
That he should come aboutyour royal person

1168
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:28.400
Or be admitted to yourhighness' council.

1169
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.670
By flattery hath he wonthe commons' hearts,

1170
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:34.200
And when he please to makecommotion,

1171
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.930
'Tis to be fear'd they allwill follow him.

1172
01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:42.800
Now 'tis the spring, andweeds are shallow-rooted;

1173
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.630
Suffer them now, andthey'll o'ergrow the garden

1174
01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:48.870
And choke the herbs forwant of husbandry.

1175
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:51.800
The reverent care I bearunto my lord

1176
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.730
Made me collect thesedangers in the duke.

1177
01:18:55.730 --> 01:19:00.330
If it be fond, call it awoman's fear;

1178
01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:05.100
Which fear if betterreasons can supplant,

1179
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.900
I will subscribe and say Iwrong'd the duke.

1180
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.400
My Lord of Suffolk,Buckingham, and York,

1181
01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.670
Reprove my allegation, ifyou can;

1182
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:23.230
Or else conclude my wordseffectual.

1183
01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:26.030
Well hath your highnessseen into this duke;

1184
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.930
And, had I first been putto speak my mind,

1185
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:31.000
I think I should have toldyour grace's tale.

1186
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.230
The duchess, by hissubornation,

1187
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:36.070
Upon my life, began herdevilish practises:

1188
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.630
Smooth runs the waterwhere the brook is deep;

1189
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:41.470
And in his simple show heharbours treason.

1190
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:43.730
The fox barks not when hewould steal the lamb.

1191
01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:45.430
No, no, my sovereign;Gloucester is a man

1192
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:48.070
Unsounded yet and full ofdeep deceit.

1193
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:50.700
Did he not, contrary toform of law,

1194
01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:54.800
Devise strange deaths forsmall offences done?

1195
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.030
And did he not, in hisprotectorship,

1196
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:59.970
Levy great sums of moneythrough the realm

1197
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:03.200
For soldiers' pay inFrance, and never sent it?

1198
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.600
By means whereof the townseach day revolted.

1199
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.200
Tut, these are pettyfaults to faults unknown.

1200
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.030
Which time will bring tolight in smooth

1201
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:14.400
Duke Humphrey.

1202
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.730
My lords, at once: thecare you have of us,

1203
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.930
To mow down thorns thatwould annoy our foot,

1204
01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:23.600
Is worthy praise: but, shallI speak my conscience,

1205
01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.130
Our kinsman Gloucester isas innocent

1206
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:28.630
From meaning treason toour royal person

1207
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.830
As is the sucking lamb orharmless dove:

1208
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:34.970
The duke is virtuous, mildand too well given

1209
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:37.300
To dream on evil or towork my downfall.

1210
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.100
Ah, what's more dangerousthan this fond affiance!

1211
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:45.530
Seems he a dove? hisfeathers are but borrowed,

1212
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:48.300
For he's disposed as thehateful raven:

1213
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.100
Is he a lamb? his skin issurely lent him,

1214
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.870
For he's inclined as isthe ravenous wolves.

1215
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:59.600
Take heed, my lord; thewelfare of us all

1216
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.130
Hangs on the cutting shortthat fraudful man.

1217
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:06.230
All health unto mygracious sovereign!

1218
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:09.070
Welcome, Lord Somerset.What news from France?

1219
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.670
That all your interest inthose territories

1220
01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:16.130
Is utterly bereft you; allis lost.

1221
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:20.970
Cold news, Lord Somerset:but God's will be done!

1222
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:28.830
Cold news for me; for Ihad hope of France

1223
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:31.900
As firmly as I hope forfertile England.

1224
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:35.530
Thus are my blossomsblasted in the bud

1225
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:39.700
And caterpillars eat myleaves away;

1226
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.770
But I will remedy thisgear ere long,

1227
01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:45.230
Or sell my title for aglorious grave.

1228
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:49.700
All happiness unto my lordthe king!

1229
01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:54.600
Pardon, my liege, that Ihave stay'd so long.

1230
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.100
Nay, Gloucester, know thatthou art come too soon,

1231
01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.630
Unless thou wert moreloyal than thou art:

1232
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.600
I do arrest thee of hightreason here.

1233
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.830
Well, Suffolk's Duke, thou shaltnot see me blush

1234
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:21.370
Nor change my countenancefor this arrest:

1235
01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:25.700
The purest spring is notso free from mud

1236
01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:29.270
As I am clear from treasonto my sovereign:

1237
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:35.000
Who can accuse me? whereinam I guilty?

1238
01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:41.370
'Tis thought, my lord, thatyou took bribes of France,

1239
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:45.030
And, being protector,stayed the soldiers' pay;

1240
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:50.900
By means whereof hishighness hath lost France.

1241
01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.330
Is it but thought so? whatare they that think it?

1242
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:58.100
I never robb'd thesoldiers of their pay,

1243
01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:00.330
Nor ever had one pennybribe from France.

1244
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:04.230
No; many a pound of mineown proper store,

1245
01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.330
Because I would not taxthe needy commons,

1246
01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:08.070
Have I disbursed to thegarrisons,

1247
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:10.670
And never ask'd forrestitution.

1248
01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:14.970
It serves you well, mylord, to say so much.

1249
01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:19.100
I say no more than truth,so help me God!

1250
01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.730
In your protectorship youdid devise

1251
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:26.370
Strange tortures foroffenders never heard of,

1252
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:29.400
That England was defamedby tyranny.

1253
01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.170
Why, 'tis well known that,whiles I was protector,

1254
01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.400
Pity was all the faultthat was in me;

1255
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.270
For I should melt at anoffender's tears,

1256
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:41.330
And lowly words wereransom for their fault.

1257
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:43.030
My lord, these faults areeasy, quickly answered:

1258
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:45.730
But mightier crimes arelaid unto your charge,

1259
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:47.630
Whereof you cannot easilypurge yourself.

1260
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:49.930
I do arrest you in hishighness' name;

1261
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.530
And here commit you to mylord cardinal

1262
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:54.370
To keep, until yourfurther time of trial.

1263
01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.770
My lord of Gloucester,'tis my special hope

1264
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.830
That you will clearyourself from all suspense:

1265
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:13.570
My conscience tells me youare innocent.

1266
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:21.170
Ah, gracious lord, thesedays are dangerous:

1267
01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:26.600
Virtue is choked with foulambition

1268
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.200
And charity chased henceby rancour's hand;

1269
01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.930
Foul subornation ispredominant

1270
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:37.970
And equity exiled yourhighness' land.

1271
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:41.370
I know their complot is tohave my life,

1272
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:44.200
And if my death might makethis island happy,

1273
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.330
And prove the period oftheir tyranny,

1274
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.270
I would expend it with allwillingness:

1275
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:52.970
But mine is made theprologue to their play;

1276
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:55.700
For thousands more, thatyet suspect no peril,

1277
01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:00.870
Will not conclude theirplotted tragedy.

1278
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:06.100
Beaufort's red sparkling eyesblab his heart's malice,

1279
01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:10.030
And Suffolk's cloudy browhis stormy hate;

1280
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:13.000
Sharp Buckinghamunburthens with his tongue

1281
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.470
The envious load that liesupon his heart;

1282
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:21.570
And dogged York, thatreaches at the moon,

1283
01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:24.530
Whose overweening arm Ihave pluck'd back,

1284
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:27.530
By false accuse doth levelat my life:

1285
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:34.700
And you, my sovereignlady, with the rest,

1286
01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:38.600
Causeless have laiddisgraces on my head,

1287
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.700
And with your bestendeavour have stirr'd up

1288
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:47.270
My liefest liege to bemine enemy:

1289
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:51.030
Ay, all you have laid yourheads together--

1290
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:53.900
Myself had notice of yourconventicles--

1291
01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:59.130
And all to make away myguiltless life.

1292
01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:01.630
I shall not want falsewitness to accuse me,

1293
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:05.000
Nor store of treasons toaugment my guilt;

1294
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.230
The ancient proverb willbe well effected:

1295
01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:11.470
'A staff is quickly foundto beat a dog.'

1296
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.730
My liege, his raging isintolerable:

1297
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:15.600
He'll wrest the sense andhold us here all day:

1298
01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.370
Lord cardinal, he is yourprisoner.

1299
01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:22.530
Sirs, take away the duke,and guard him sure.

1300
01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:28.730
Ah! thus King Henry throwsaway his crutch

1301
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:33.400
Before his legs be firm tobear his body.

1302
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.900
Thus is the shepherdbeaten from thy side,

1303
01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:44.470
And wolves are gnarlingwho shall gnaw thee first.

1304
01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:53.800
Ah, that my fear werefalse! ah, that it were!

1305
01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:01.600
For, good King Henry, thydecay I fear.

1306
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.700
My lords, what to yourwisdoms seemeth best,

1307
01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.530
Do or undo, as if ourselfwere here.

1308
01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:20.100
What, will your highnessleave the parliament?

1309
01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.270
Ay, Margaret; my heart isdrown'd with grief,

1310
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:25.930
Whose flood begins to flowwithin mine eyes,

1311
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:27.600
My body round engirt withmisery,

1312
01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.830
For what's more miserablethan discontent?

1313
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.500
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thyface I see

1314
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.200
The map of honour, truthand loyalty:

1315
01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.000
What louring star nowenvies thy estate,

1316
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.400
That these great lords andMargaret our queen

1317
01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.730
Do seek subversion of thyharmless life?

1318
01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:50.100
Thou never didst themwrong, nor no man wrong;

1319
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.570
And as the butcher takesaway the calf

1320
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:55.600
And binds the wretch, andbeats it when it strays,

1321
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.930
Bearing it to the bloodyslaughter-house,

1322
01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:02.430
Even so remorseless havethey borne him hence;

1323
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:03.900
And as the dam runs lowingup and down,

1324
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.570
Looking the way herharmless young one went,

1325
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:08.430
And can do nought but wailher darling's loss,

1326
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:11.100
Even so myself bewailsgood Gloucester's case

1327
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.600
With sad unhelpful tears,and with dimm'd eyes

1328
01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.370
Look after him and cannotdo him good,

1329
01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:19.500
So mighty are his vowedenemies.

1330
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.430
His fortunes I will weep;and, 'twixt each groan

1331
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:25.770
Say 'Who's a traitor?Gloucester he is none.'

1332
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:46.100
Free lords, cold snow meltswith the sun's hot beams.

1333
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.530
Henry my lord is cold ingreat affairs,

1334
01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:53.730
Too full of foolish pity,and Gloucester's show

1335
01:28:53.730 --> 01:28:56.800
Beguiles him as themournful crocodile

1336
01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.770
With sorrow snaresrelenting passengers,

1337
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:06.070
Believe me, lords, werenone more wise than I--

1338
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:10.530
And yet herein I judgemine own wit good--

1339
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:13.700
This Gloucester should bequickly rid the world,

1340
01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.270
To rid us of the fear wehave of him.

1341
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:20.030
That he should die isworthy policy;

1342
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:23.870
But yet we want a colourfor his death:

1343
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:27.570
'Tis meet he be condemn'dby course of law.

1344
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.830
But, in my mind, that wereno policy:

1345
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:32.400
The king will labour stillto save his life,

1346
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.330
The commons haply rise, tosave his life;

1347
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:36.670
And yet we have buttrivial argument,

1348
01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:41.500
More than mistrust, thatshows him worthy death.

1349
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.900
So that, by this, youwould not have him die.

1350
01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:51.900
Ah, York, no man alive sofain as I!

1351
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.770
'Tis York that hath morereason for his death.

1352
01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:59.930
But, my lord cardinal, andyou, my Lord of Suffolk,

1353
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:03.100
Say as you think, andspeak it from your souls,

1354
01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.300
Were't not all one, anempty eagle were set

1355
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.700
To guard the chicken froma kite,

1356
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.570
As place Duke Humphrey forthe king's protector?

1357
01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:18.670
So the poor chicken shouldbe sure of death.

1358
01:30:18.670 --> 01:30:23.070
Madam, 'tis true; andwere't not madness, then,

1359
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:27.230
To make the fox surveyorof the fold?

1360
01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.070
No; let him die, in thathe is a fox,

1361
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.530
By nature proved an enemyto the flock,

1362
01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:35.870
And do not stand onquillets how to slay him:

1363
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:38.770
Be it by gins, by snares,by subtlety,

1364
01:30:38.770 --> 01:30:40.270
Sleeping or waking, 'tisno matter how,

1365
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:42.900
So he be dead; for that isgood deceit

1366
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.400
Which mates him first thatfirst intends deceit.

1367
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.830
Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tisresolutely spoke.

1368
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:52.100
Not resolute, except somuch were done;

1369
01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.630
For things are often spokeand seldom meant:

1370
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:57.800
But that my heartaccordeth with my tongue,

1371
01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.700
Seeing the deed ismeritorious,

1372
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.730
And to preserve mysovereign from his foe,

1373
01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:08.100
Say but the word, and Iwill be his priest.

1374
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.630
But I would have him dead,my Lord of Suffolk,

1375
01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:15.130
Ere you can take dueorders for a priest:

1376
01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:17.770
Say you consent andcensure well the deed,

1377
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:22.170
And I'll provide hisexecutioner,

1378
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:25.970
I tender so the safety ofmy liege.

1379
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:30.170
Here is my hand, the deedis worthy doing.

1380
01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:32.600
And so say I.

1381
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.830
And I and now we threehave spoke it,

1382
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:40.470
It skills not greatly whoimpugns our doom.

1383
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:42.800


1384
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.470
From Irelandam I come amain,

1385
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:46.170
To signify that rebelsthere are up

1386
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:49.270
And put the Englishmenunto the sword:

1387
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.730
Send succors, lords, andstop the rage betime,

1388
01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:54.070
Before the wound do growuncurable;

1389
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:55.730
For, being green, there isgreat hope of help.

1390
01:31:55.730 --> 01:31:59.430
A breach that craves aquick expedient stop!

1391
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:02.830
What counsel give you inthis weighty cause?

1392
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:07.900
That Somerset be sent asregent thither:

1393
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:11.930
'Tis meet that lucky rulerbe employ'd;

1394
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:16.500
Witness the fortune hehath had in France.

1395
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.930
If York, with all hisfar-fet policy,

1396
01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:20.670
Had been the regent thereinstead of me,

1397
01:32:20.670 --> 01:32:23.030
He never would have stay'din France so long.

1398
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:26.200
No, not to lose it all, asthou hast done:

1399
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.230
I rather would have lostmy life betimes

1400
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.270
Than bring a burthen ofdishonour home

1401
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:37.100
By staying there so longtill all were lost.

1402
01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:42.370
Show me one scarcharacter'd on thy skin:

1403
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:46.230
Men's flesh preserved sowhole do seldom win.

1404
01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:50.970
Nay, then, this spark willprove a raging fire,

1405
01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:52.900
If wind and fuel bebrought to feed it with:

1406
01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:56.400
No more, good York; sweetSomerset, be still:

1407
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.430
Thy fortune, York, hadstthou been regent there,

1408
01:32:59.430 --> 01:33:02.300
Might happily have provedfar worse than his.

1409
01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:06.100
What, worse than nought?nay, then, a shame take all!

1410
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.770
And, in the number, theethat wishest shame!

1411
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:14.970
My Lord of York, try whatyour fortune is.

1412
01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:18.270
The uncivil kerns ofIreland are in arms

1413
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:20.430
And temper clay with bloodof Englishmen:

1414
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:22.400
To Ireland will you lead aband of men,

1415
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.570
Collected choicely, fromeach county some,

1416
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:30.670
And try your hap againstthe Irishmen?

1417
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:34.170
I will, my lord, so pleasehis majesty.

1418
01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:36.830
Why, our authority is hisconsent,

1419
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:39.600
And what we do establishhe confirms:

1420
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.600
Then, noble York, takethou this task in hand.

1421
01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.630
I am content: provide mesoldiers, lords,

1422
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:48.870
Whiles I take order formine own affairs.

1423
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:51.430
A charge, Lord York, thatI will see perform'd.

1424
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:54.870
But now return we to thefalse Duke Humphrey.

1425
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.900
No more of him; for I willdeal with him

1426
01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.330
That henceforth he shalltrouble us no more.

1427
01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:04.100
And so break off; the dayis almost spent:

1428
01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.200
Lord, you and Imust talk of that event.

1429
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.470
My Lord of Suffolk, withinfourteen days

1430
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:13.030
At Bristol I expect mysoldiers;

1431
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:15.630
For there I'll ship themall for Ireland.

1432
01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:18.500
I'll see it truly done, myLord of York.

1433
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:30.770
Now, York, or never, steelthy fearful thoughts,

1434
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:34.030
And change misdoubt intoresolution:

1435
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:38.770
Be that thou hopest to be, orwhat thou art resign to death;

1436
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:42.300
it is not worth the enjoying:

1437
01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:47.130
Let pale-faced fear keepwith the mean-born man,

1438
01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:53.670
And find no harbour in aroyal heart.

1439
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:57.270
Faster than spring-time showerscomes thought on thought,

1440
01:34:57.270 --> 01:35:03.270
And not a thought butthinks on dignity.

1441
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:07.870
My brain more busy thanthe labouring spider

1442
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:12.100
Weaves tedious snares totrap mine enemies.

1443
01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:16.970
Well, nobles, well, 'tispoliticly done,

1444
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:20.570
To send me packing with anhost of men:

1445
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:25.100
I fear me you but warm thestarved snake,

1446
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.670
Who, cherish'd in your breasts,will sting your hearts.

1447
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:34.500
'Twas men I lack'd and youwill give them me:

1448
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:39.070
I take it kindly; and yetbe well assured

1449
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:44.930
You put sharp weapons in amadman's hands.

1450
01:35:57.130 --> 01:36:02.200
Whiles I in Irelandnourish a mighty band,

1451
01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.270
I will stir up in Englandsome black storm

1452
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:10.530
Shall blow ten thousandsouls to heaven or hell;

1453
01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:14.070
And this fell tempestshall not cease to rage

1454
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:16.130
Until the golden circuiton my head,

1455
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:18.800
Like to the glorious sun'stransparent beams,

1456
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:26.470
Do calm the fury of thismad-bred flaw.

1457
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:29.870
And, for a minister of myintent,

1458
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:33.470
I have seduced aheadstrong Kentishman,

1459
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:35.730
John Cade of Ashford,

1460
01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:39.000
To make commotion, as fullwell he can,

1461
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.770
Under the title of JohnMortimer.

1462
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:45.870
That devil here shall bemy substitute;

1463
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:49.370
For that John Mortimer,which now is dead,

1464
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:52.200
In face, in gait, inspeech, he doth resemble:

1465
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.970
By this I shall perceivethe commons' mind,

1466
01:36:56.970 --> 01:37:02.530
How they affect the houseand claim of York.

1467
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:06.300
Say that he be taken, rack'dand tortured,

1468
01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.730
I know no pain they caninflict upon him

1469
01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:11.200
Will make him say I movedhim to these arms.

1470
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.830
Say that he thrive, as'tis great like he will,

1471
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:20.630
Why, then from Irelandcome I with my strength

1472
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:23.400
And reap the harvest whichthat rascal sow'd;

1473
01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.330
For Humphrey being dead,as he shall be,

1474
01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:37.630
And Henry put apart, thenext for me.

1475
01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:48.070
Run to my Lord of Suffolk;let him know

1476
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:49.900
We have dispatch'd theduke, as he commanded.

1477
01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:52.370
O that it were to do! Whathave we done?

1478
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.800
Didst ever hear a man sopenitent?

1479
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.300
Here comes my lord.

1480
01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.970
Now, sirs, have youdispatch'd this thing?

1481
01:37:57.970 --> 01:37:59.530
Ay, my good lord, he'sdead.

1482
01:37:59.530 --> 01:38:01.470
Why, that's well said. Go,get you to my house;

1483
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:02.900
I will reward you for thisventurous deed.

1484
01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.170
The king and all the peersare here at hand.

1485
01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:07.730
Have you laid fair thebed? Is all things well,

1486
01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:08.800
According as I gavedirections?

1487
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.070
'Tis handsome, my lord.

1488
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:11.170
Away! be gone.

1489
01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:19.870
(trumpets playing)

1490
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:26.970
Go, call our uncle to ourpresence straight;

1491
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:28.830
Say we intend to try hisgrace to-day.

1492
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:31.000
If he be guilty, as 'tispublished.

1493
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.400
I'll call him presently,my noble lord.

1494
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.730
Lords, take your places;and, I pray you all,

1495
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:38.170
Proceed no straiter 'gainstour uncle Gloucester

1496
01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:40.470
Than from true evidence ofgood esteem

1497
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:43.470
He be approved in practiseculpable.

1498
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:45.570
God forbid any maliceshould prevail,

1499
01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:47.830
That faultless may condemna nobleman!

1500
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:51.900
Pray God he may acquit himof suspicion!

1501
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.000
I thank thee, Meg; thesewords content me much.

1502
01:38:57.730 --> 01:39:03.400
How now! why look'st thoupale? why tremblest thou?

1503
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.570
Where is our uncle? what'sthe matter, Suffolk?

1504
01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.400
Dead in his bed, my lord;Gloucester is dead.

1505
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.270
Marry, God forfend!

1506
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:21.870
God's secret judgment: Idid dream to-night

1507
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.400
The duke was dumb andcould not speak a word.

1508
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.530
How fares my lord? Help,lords! the king is dead.

1509
01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:33.530
Rear up his body; wringhim by the nose.

1510
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:39.470
Go, run, help, help! OHenry, ope thine eyes!

1511
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:41.470
He doth revive again:madam, be patient.

1512
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:43.130
O heavenly God!

1513
01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:44.800
How fares my gracious lord?

1514
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.070
Comfort, my sovereign!gracious Henry, comfort!

1515
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:51.070
What, doth my Lord ofSuffolk comfort me?

1516
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:53.430
Came he right now to singa raven's note,

1517
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:56.330
Whose dismal tune bereftmy vital powers;

1518
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:58.170
And thinks he that thechirping of a wren,

1519
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:00.200
By crying comfort from ahollow breast,

1520
01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.570
Can chase away thefirst-conceived sound?

1521
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:06.530
Hide not thy poison withsuch sugar'd words;

1522
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.000
Lay not thy hands on me;forbear, I say;

1523
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.730
Their touch affrights meas a serpent's sting.

1524
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:15.200
Thou baleful messenger,out of my sight!

1525
01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.200
Look not upon me, forthine eyes are wounding:

1526
01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.500
Yet do not go: come,basilisk,

1527
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.770
And kill the innocentgazer with thy sight;

1528
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.970
For in the shade of deathI shall find joy;

1529
01:40:24.970 --> 01:40:27.630
In life but double death,now Gloucester's dead.

1530
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:33.330
Why do you rate my Lord ofSuffolk thus?

1531
01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:35.730
Although the duke wasenemy to him,

1532
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:40.070
Yet he most Christian-likelaments his death:

1533
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:43.430
And for myself, foe as hewas to me,

1534
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:48.500
Might liquid tears orheart-offending groans

1535
01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:51.370
Or blood-consuming sighsrecall his life,

1536
01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:55.770
I would be blind withweeping, sick with groans,

1537
01:40:55.770 --> 01:41:00.330
Look pale as primrose withblood-drinking sighs,

1538
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:03.630
And all to have the nobleduke alive.

1539
01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:06.730
What know I how the worldmay deem of me?

1540
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:09.470
For it is known we werebut hollow friends:

1541
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:13.230
It may be judged I madethe duke away;

1542
01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:16.700
So shall my name withslander's tongue be wounded,

1543
01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.500
And princes' courts befill'd with my reproach.

1544
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.700
This get I by his death:ay me, unhappy!

1545
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:27.630
To be a queen, and crown'dwith infamy!

1546
01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:31.530
Ah, woe is me forGloucester, wretched man!

1547
01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:33.900
Be woe for me, morewretched than he is.

1548
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.700
What, dost thou turn awayand hide thy face?

1549
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:42.870
I am no loathsome leper;look on me.

1550
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:45.970
What! art thou, like theadder, waxen deaf?

1551
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:50.870
Be poisonous too and killthy forlorn queen.

1552
01:41:53.500 --> 01:42:00.270
Is all thy comfort shut inGloucester's tomb?

1553
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:03.500
Why, then, dame Margaretwas ne'er thy joy.

1554
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.670
Erect his statue andworship it,

1555
01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:10.500
And make my image but analehouse sign.

1556
01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:15.400
Was I for this nighwreck'd upon the sea

1557
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.070
And twice by awkward windfrom England's bank

1558
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:22.900
Drove back again unto mynative clime?

1559
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:27.070
What boded this, but wellforewarning wind

1560
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:31.670
Did seem to say 'Seek nota scorpion's nest,

1561
01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:36.730
Nor set no footing on thisunkind shore'?

1562
01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:40.400
What did I then, butcursed the gentle gusts

1563
01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.470
And he that loosed themforth their brazen caves:

1564
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:49.770
And bid them blow towardsEngland's blessed shore,

1565
01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:52.700
Or turn our stern upon adreadful rock

1566
01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.370
Yet AEolus would not be amurderer,

1567
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:58.470
But left that hatefuloffice unto thee:

1568
01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:02.030
The pretty-vaulting searefused to drown me,

1569
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:04.870
Knowing that thou wouldsthave me drown'd on shore,

1570
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:10.000
With tears as salt as sea,through thy unkindness:

1571
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.270
The splitting rocks cower'din the sinking sands

1572
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:17.200
And would not dash me withtheir ragged sides,

1573
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.600
Because thy flinty heart,more hard than they,

1574
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.930
Might in thy palace perishMargaret.

1575
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:30.930
As far as I could ken thychalky shores,

1576
01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:35.100
When from thy shore thetempest beat us back,

1577
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:38.630
I stood upon the hatchesin the storm,

1578
01:43:38.630 --> 01:43:41.900
And when the dusky skybegan to rob

1579
01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:47.130
My earnest-gaping sight ofthy land's view,

1580
01:43:47.130 --> 01:43:50.770
I took a costly jewel frommy neck,

1581
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:53.400
A heart it was, bound inwith diamonds,

1582
01:43:53.400 --> 01:44:00.130
And threw it towards thyshore: the sea received it,

1583
01:44:00.130 --> 01:44:05.170
And so I wish'd thy bodymight my heart:

1584
01:44:05.170 --> 01:44:11.000
And even with this I lostfair England's view

1585
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.200
And bid mine eyes bepacking with my heart

1586
01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.730
And call'd them blind anddusky spectacles,

1587
01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:24.370
For losing ken of Albion'swished coast.

1588
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:27.500
How often have I temptedSuffolk's tongue,

1589
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.970
The agent of thy foulinconstancy,

1590
01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:34.600
To sit and witch me, asAscanius did

1591
01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:37.030
When he to madding Didowould unfold

1592
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:41.900
His father's actscommenced in burning Troy!

1593
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:48.400
Am I not witch'd like her?or thou not false like him?

1594
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:56.470
Ay me, I can no more! die,Margaret!

1595
01:44:56.470 --> 01:45:03.430
For Henry weeps that thoudost live so long.

1596
01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:11.670
(angry crowd makes noiseoutside)

1597
01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:19.400
It is reported, mightysovereign,

1598
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:22.500
That good Duke Humphreytraitorously is murder'd

1599
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.430
By Suffolk and theCardinal Beaufort's means.

1600
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:25.930
(crowd) Ay!

1601
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:32.070
The commons, like an angryhive of bees

1602
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:34.370
That want their leader,scatter up and down

1603
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:38.470
And care not who theysting in his revenge.

1604
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:41.200
Myself have calm'd theirspleenful mutiny,

1605
01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.500
Until they hear the orderof his death.

1606
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.600
That he is dead, goodWarwick, 'tis too true;

1607
01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.900
But how he died God knows,not Henry:

1608
01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:53.230
his chamber, view hisbreathless corpse,

1609
01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:56.500
And comment then upon hissudden death.

1610
01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.430
That shall I do, my liege.Stay, Salisbury,

1611
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:05.730
With the rude multitudetill I return.

1612
01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.370
O Thou that judgest allthings, stay my thoughts,

1613
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:14.370
My thoughts, that labourto persuade my soul

1614
01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:17.130
Some violent hands werelaid on Humphrey's life!

1615
01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:20.330
If my suspect be false,forgive me God,

1616
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:22.870
For judgment only dothbelong to thee.

1617
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:30.670
Come hither, gracioussovereign, view this body.

1618
01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:41.670
That is to see how deep mygrave is made;

1619
01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:44.900
For with his soul fled allmy worldly solace,

1620
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.170
For seeing him I see mylife in death.

1621
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.330
As surely as my soul intendsto live with that dread King

1622
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:14.270
that took our state upon him

1623
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:17.870
To free us from hisfather's wrathful curse,

1624
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:20.400
I do believe that violenthands were laid

1625
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.900
Upon the life of thisthrice-famed duke.

1626
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:29.430
A dreadful oath, swornwith a solemn tongue!

1627
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:32.730
What instance gives LordWarwick for his vow?

1628
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:44.100
See how his face is black andfull of blood.

1629
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.370
His eye-balls further outthan when he lived,

1630
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:50.170
Staring full ghastly likea strangled man;

1631
01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:56.170
His hair uprear'd, his nostrilsstretched with struggling;

1632
01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:59.170
His hands abroad display'd,as one that grasp'd

1633
01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:04.670
And tugg'd for life andwas by strength subdued:

1634
01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:13.830
Look, on the sheets hishair you see, is sticking;

1635
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:17.070
His well-proportion'd beardmade rough and rugged,

1636
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:20.500
Like to the summer's cornby tempest lodged.

1637
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:25.770
It cannot be but he wasmurder'd here;

1638
01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:29.370
The least of all thesesigns were probable.

1639
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:32.970
Why, Warwick, who shoulddo the duke to death?

1640
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:35.700
Myself and Beaufort hadhim in protection;

1641
01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.530
And we, I hope, sir, areno murderers.

1642
01:48:37.530 --> 01:48:40.770
But both of you were vow'dDuke Humphrey's foes,

1643
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:43.600
And you, forsooth, had thegood duke to keep:

1644
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:46.500
'Tis like you would notfeast him like a friend;

1645
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.630
And 'tis well seen hefound an enemy.

1646
01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:52.170
Then you, belike, suspectthese noblemen

1647
01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:56.170
As guilty of DukeHumphrey's timeless death.

1648
01:48:56.170 --> 01:49:00.300
Who finds the heifer deadand bleeding fresh

1649
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.070
And sees fast by a butcherwith an axe,

1650
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:06.930
But will suspect 'twas hethat made the slaughter?

1651
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:10.800
Who finds the partridge inthe puttock's nest,

1652
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.300
But may imagine how thebird was dead,

1653
01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.170
Although the kite soarwith unbloodied beak?

1654
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:20.030
Are you the butcher,Suffolk? Where's your knife?

1655
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:23.670
Is Beaufort term'd a kite?Where are his talons?

1656
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:27.170
I wear no knife toslaughter sleeping men;

1657
01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:29.700
But here's a vengefulsword, rusted with ease,

1658
01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.230
That shall be scoured inhis rancorous heart

1659
01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:35.030
That slanders me withmurder's crimson badge.

1660
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:38.000
Say, if thou darest, proudLord of Warwick-shire,

1661
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.100
That I am faulty in DukeHumphrey's death.

1662
01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.570
What dares not Warwick, iffalse Suffolk dare him?

1663
01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:45.200
He dares not calm hiscontumelious spirit

1664
01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:47.770
Nor cease to be anarrogant controller,

1665
01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:50.900
Though Suffolk dare himtwenty thousand times.

1666
01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:57.070
Madam, be still; withreverence may I say;

1667
01:49:57.070 --> 01:50:00.430
For every word you speakin his behalf

1668
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:03.700
Is slander to your royaldignity.

1669
01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:07.630
Blunt-witted lord, ignoblein demeanor!

1670
01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:09.600
If ever lady wrong'd herlord so much,

1671
01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.170
Thy mother took into herblameful bed

1672
01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:16.100
Some stern untutor'dchurl, and noble stock

1673
01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:19.470
Was graft with crab-treeslip; whose fruit thou art,

1674
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:20.830
And never of the Nevils'noble race.

1675
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:23.970
But that the guilt ofmurder bucklers thee

1676
01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:25.870
And I should rob thedeathsman of his fee,

1677
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:28.730
Quitting thee thereby often thousand shames,

1678
01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:31.830
And that my sovereign'spresence makes me mild,

1679
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:36.800
I would, false murderouscoward, on thy knee

1680
01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:39.900
Make thee beg pardon forthy passed speech,

1681
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:43.270
And say it was thy motherthat thou meant'st

1682
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:46.900
That thou thyself was bornin bastardy;

1683
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.170
And after all this fearfulhomage done,

1684
01:50:49.170 --> 01:50:53.270
Give thee thy hire andsend thy soul to hell,

1685
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:56.230
Pernicious blood-sucker ofsleeping men!

1686
01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:58.900
Thou shall be waking wellI shed thy blood,

1687
01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.900
If from this presence thoudarest go with me.

1688
01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.630
Away even now, or I willdrag thee hence:

1689
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:08.300
Unworthy though thou art,I'll cope with thee

1690
01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:12.270
And do some service toDuke Humphrey's ghost.

1691
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:20.030
What stronger breastplatethan a heart untainted!

1692
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:23.670
Thrice is he armed thathath his quarrel just,

1693
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:26.170
And he but naked, thoughlock'd up in steel

1694
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:28.730
Whose conscience withinjustice is corrupted.

1695
01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:31.400
(crowd makes noise inbackground)

1696
01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.970
What noise is this?

1697
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.230
Why, how now, lords!

1698
01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:45.670
Your wrathful weapons drawnHere in our presence!

1699
01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:46.630
Dare you be so bold?

1700
01:51:46.630 --> 01:51:47.730
The traitorous Warwickwith the men of Bury

1701
01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:50.170
Set all upon me, mightysovereign.

1702
01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:53.830
[To the Commons, entering]Sirs, stand apart;

1703
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:56.200
The king shall know yourmind.

1704
01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.070
Dread lord, the commonssend you word by me,

1705
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:05.130
Unless false Suffolkstraight be done to death,

1706
01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:08.230
Or banished fair England'sterritories,

1707
01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:10.770
They will by violence tearhim from your palace

1708
01:52:10.770 --> 01:52:14.400
And torture him withgrievous lingering death.

1709
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.100
They say, by him the goodDuke Humphrey died;

1710
01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:22.100
They say, in him they fearyour highness' death;

1711
01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:23.900
And mere instinct of loveand loyalty,

1712
01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:27.300
Makes them thus forward inhis banishment.

1713
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:30.500
They say, in care of yourmost royal person,

1714
01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.500
That if your highnessshould intend to sleep

1715
01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:35.400
And charge that no manshould disturb your rest

1716
01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:37.770
In pain of your dislike orpain of death,

1717
01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:40.700
Yet, notwithstanding sucha strait edict,

1718
01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:43.000
Were there a serpent seen,with forked tongue,

1719
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.800
That slily glided towardsyour majesty,

1720
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.870
It were but necessary youwere waked,

1721
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:50.900
And therefore do they cry,though you forbid,

1722
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.030
That they will guard you,whether you will or no,

1723
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:56.330
From such fell serpents asfalse Suffolk is,

1724
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:58.230
With whose envenomed andfatal sting,

1725
01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:02.170
Your loving uncle, twentytimes his worth,

1726
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:05.900
They say, is shamefullybereft of life.

1727
01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:10.500
(crowd chants) An answer fromthe king, my Lord of Salisbury!

1728
01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.730
'Tis like the commons,rude unpolish'd hinds,

1729
01:53:13.730 --> 01:53:17.000
Could send such message totheir sovereign:

1730
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.130
But you, my lord, wereglad to be employ'd,

1731
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:21.770
To show how quaint anorator you are:

1732
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:24.730
But all the honourSalisbury hath won

1733
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:26.370
Is that he was the lordambassador

1734
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:28.970
Sent from a sort oftinkers to the king.

1735
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:30.870
(crowd chants) Ananswer from the king,

1736
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:33.300
or we will all break in!

1737
01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:35.670
Go, Salisbury, and tellthem all from me.

1738
01:53:35.670 --> 01:53:38.600
I thank them for theirtender loving care;

1739
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.430
And had I not been citedso by them,

1740
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.430
Yet did I purpose as theydo entreat;

1741
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.070
For, sure, my thoughts dohourly prophesy

1742
01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:50.470
Mischance unto my state bySuffolk's means:

1743
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:52.470
And therefore, by Hismajesty I swear,

1744
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:55.270
Whose far unworthy deputyI am,

1745
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:57.170
He shall not breatheinfection in this air

1746
01:53:57.170 --> 01:54:01.000
But three days longer, onthe pain of death.

1747
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
O Henry, let me plead forgentle Suffolk!

1748
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.430
Ungentle queen, to callhim gentle Suffolk!

1749
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:12.900
No more, I say: if thoudost plead for him,

1750
01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.700
Thou wilt but add increaseunto my wrath.

1751
01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:16.600
Had I but said, I wouldhave kept my word,

1752
01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.430
But when I swear, it isirrevocable.

1753
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:22.130
If, after three days' space,thou here be'st found

1754
01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:24.730
On any ground that I amruler of,

1755
01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:28.430
The world shall not beransom for thy life.

1756
01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:35.430
Come, Warwick, come, goodWarwick, go with me;

1757
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:38.730
I have great matters toimpart to thee.

1758
01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:44.600
Mischance and sorrow goalong with thee!

1759
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.370
Heart's discontent andsour affliction

1760
01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:51.230
Be playfellows to keep youcompany!

1761
01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:55.530
There's two of you; thedevil make a third!

1762
01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:59.930
And threefold vengeancetend upon your steps!

1763
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:02.930
Cease, gentle queen, theseexecrations,

1764
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.130
And let thy Suffolk takehis heavy leave.

1765
01:55:05.130 --> 01:55:08.700
Fie, coward woman andsoft-hearted wretch!

1766
01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.970
Hast thou not spirit tocurse thine enemy?

1767
01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:15.900
A plague upon them! whereforeshould I curse them?

1768
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.470
Would curses kill, as doththe mandrake's groan,

1769
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:23.430
I would invent asbitter-searching terms,

1770
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:27.330
As curst, as harsh andhorrible to hear,

1771
01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:29.300
Deliver'd strongly throughmy fixed teeth,

1772
01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:31.870
With full as many signs ofdeadly hate,

1773
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:36.330
As lean-faced Envy in herloathsome cave:

1774
01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:38.970
My tongue should stumblein mine earnest words;

1775
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:42.500
Mine eyes should sparklelike the beaten flint;

1776
01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:46.870
Mine hair be fixed on end,as one distract;

1777
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:51.600
Ay, every joint shouldseem to curse and ban:

1778
01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.000
And even now my burthen'dheart would break,

1779
01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.330
Should I not curse them.Poison be their drink!

1780
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:05.300
Gall, worse than gall, thedaintiest that they taste!

1781
01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:11.070
Their softest shade agrove of cypress trees!

1782
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:15.630
Their chiefest prospectmurdering basilisks!

1783
01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:18.970
Their softest touch assmart as lizards' sting!

1784
01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:22.870
Their music frightful asthe serpent's hiss,

1785
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:27.600
And boding screech-owlsmake the concert full!

1786
01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:31.170
All the foul terrors indark-seated hell--

1787
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:35.170
Enough, sweet Suffolk;thou torment'st thyself;

1788
01:56:35.170 --> 01:56:37.570
And these dread curses, likethe sun 'gainst glass,

1789
01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:39.930
Or like an overchargedgun, recoil,

1790
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:42.000
And turn the force of themupon thyself.

1791
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.270
You bade me ban, and willyou bid me leave?

1792
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:53.270
Ay entreat theecease. O give me thy hand,

1793
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:58.070
That I may dew it with mymournful tears;

1794
01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:06.930
O, could this kiss beprinted in thy hand,

1795
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:11.530
That thou mightst thinkupon these by the seal,

1796
01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:18.400
Through whom a thousandsighs are breathed for thee!

1797
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:26.000
So, get thee gone, that Imay know my grief;

1798
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.470
'Tis but surmised whilesthou art standing by,

1799
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:34.470
I will repeal thee, or, bewell assured,

1800
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:38.470
Adventure to be banishedmyself:

1801
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:41.630
And banished I am, if butfrom thee.

1802
01:57:41.630 --> 01:57:48.600
No; speak not to me; evennow be gone.

1803
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.870
No. O' go not yet!

1804
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:12.730
And yet farewell; andfarewell life with thee!

1805
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:18.030
Thus is poor Suffolk tentimes banished;

1806
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:21.870
Once by the king, and threetimes thrice by thee.

1807
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:26.900
'Tis not the land I carefor, wert thou thence;

1808
01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.500
A wilderness is populousenough,

1809
01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.030
So Suffolk had thyheavenly company:

1810
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:35.800
For where thou art, thereis the world itself,

1811
01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:39.770
With every severalpleasure in the world,

1812
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:44.630
And where thou art not,desolation.

1813
01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:53.970
I can no more: live thouto joy thy life;

1814
01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:58.570
Myself no joy in noughtbut that thou livest.

1815
01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:07.830
Wither goes Vaux so fast?what news, I prithee?

1816
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:08.830
To signify unto hismajesty

1817
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:11.030
That Cardinal Beaufort isat point of death;

1818
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:13.100
For suddenly a grievoussickness took him,

1819
01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:17.800
That makes him gasp andstare and grasp the air,

1820
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:20.970
Blaspheming God andcursing men on earth.

1821
01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:22.870
Sometimes he talks as ifDuke Humphrey's ghost

1822
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:25.770
Were by his side; sometimehe calls the king,

1823
01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:27.630
And whispers to hispillow, as to him,

1824
01:59:27.630 --> 01:59:29.770
The secrets of hisovercharged soul;

1825
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:30.970
And I am sent to tell hismajesty

1826
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:33.430
That even now he criesaloud for him.

1827
01:59:35.070 --> 01:59:39.170
Go tell this heavy messageto the king.

1828
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:53.070
Ay me! what is this world!what news are these!

1829
01:59:57.170 --> 01:59:59.970
Now get thee hence: the king,thou know'st, is coming;

1830
01:59:59.970 --> 02:00:02.100
If thou be found by me,thou art but dead.

1831
02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:04.500
If I depart from thee, Icannot live;

1832
02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.970
And in thy sight to die,what were it else

1833
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:09.600
But like a pleasantslumber in thy lap?

1834
02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:13.370
Here could I breathe mysoul into the air,

1835
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:17.000
As mild and gentle as thecradle-babe

1836
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.500
Dying with mother's dugbetween its lips:

1837
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:24.870
To die by thee were but todie in jest;

1838
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:30.130
From thee to die weretorture more than death:

1839
02:00:30.130 --> 02:00:36.200
O, let me stay, befallwhat may befall!

1840
02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.070
Away! though parting be afretful corrosive,

1841
02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:43.800
It is applied to adeathful wound.

1842
02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.830
To France, sweet Suffolk:let me hear from thee;

1843
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:50.000
For wheresoe'er thou artin this world's globe,

1844
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.030
I'll have an Iris thatshall find thee out. Away!

1845
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:58.300
I go.

1846
02:00:58.300 --> 02:00:59.900
And take my heart withthee.

1847
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:10.270
A jewel, lock'd into thewofull'st cask

1848
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:13.900
That ever did contain athing of worth.

1849
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:19.030
Even as a splitted bark,so sunder we

1850
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:22.670
This way fall I to death.

1851
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:27.030
This way for me.

1852
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:31.870
(horns sounding)

1853
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.970
How fares my lord? speak,Beaufort, to thy sovereign.

1854
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:57.000
If thou be'st death, I'll givethee England's treasure,

1855
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.100
Enough to purchase suchanother island,

1856
02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:09.830
So thou wilt let me live,and feel no pain.

1857
02:02:11.670 --> 02:02:13.630
Ah, what a sign it is ofevil life,

1858
02:02:13.630 --> 02:02:16.130
Where death's approach isseen so terrible!

1859
02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:27.070
Beaufort, it is thysovereign speaks to thee.

1860
02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:34.000
Bring me unto my trialwhen thou will.

1861
02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:39.330
Died he not in his bed?where should he die?

1862
02:02:39.330 --> 02:02:46.500
Can I make men live,whether they will or not?

1863
02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:54.500
O, torture me no more! Iwill confess.

1864
02:02:58.530 --> 02:03:05.230
Alive again? then show mewhere he is:

1865
02:03:05.230 --> 02:03:13.800
I'll give a thousand poundto look upon him.

1866
02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:28.030
He hath no eyes, the dusthath blinded them.

1867
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:34.270
Comb down his hair; look,look! it stands upright,

1868
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:42.270
Like lime-twigs set tocatch my winged soul.

1869
02:03:45.730 --> 02:03:55.770
Give me some drink; andbid the apothecary

1870
02:03:58.270 --> 02:04:12.770
Bring the strong poisonthat I bought of him.

1871
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.930
O thou eternal Mover ofthe heavens.

1872
02:04:16.930 --> 02:04:19.070
Look with a gentle eyeupon this wretch!

1873
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:21.130
O, beat away the busymeddling fiend

1874
02:04:21.130 --> 02:04:23.600
That lays strong siegeunto this wretch's soul.

1875
02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:26.630
And from his bosom purgethis black despair!

1876
02:04:26.630 --> 02:04:29.200
See, how the pangs ofdeath do make him grin!

1877
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.970
Disturb him not; let himpass peaceably.

1878
02:04:32.970 --> 02:04:37.700
Peace to his soul, ifGod's good pleasure be!

1879
02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:40.730
Lord cardinal, if thouthink'st on heaven's bliss,

1880
02:04:40.730 --> 02:04:44.470
Hold up thy hand, makesignal of thy hope.

1881
02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:56.870
He dies, and makes nosign. O God, forgive him!

1882
02:04:56.870 --> 02:05:00.530
So bad a death argues amonstrous life.

1883
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:05.430
Forbear to judge, for weare sinners all.

1884
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:09.000
Close up his eyes and drawthe curtain close;

1885
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.370
And let us all tomeditation.

1886
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.570
The gaudy, blabbing andremorseful day

1887
02:05:25.570 --> 02:05:28.470
Is crept into the bosom ofthe sea;

1888
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:34.000
And now loud-howlingwolves arouse the jades

1889
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
That drag the tragicmelancholy night;

1890
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.070
Who, with their drowsy,slow and flagging wings,

1891
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:48.830
Clip dead men's graves andfrom their misty jaws

1892
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:57.830
Breathe foul contagiousdarkness in the air.

1893
02:05:57.830 --> 02:06:05.470
Therefore bring forth thesoldiers of our prize;

1894
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:08.070
For, whilst our pinnaceanchors in the Downs,

1895
02:06:08.070 --> 02:06:13.800
Here shall they make theirransom on the sand,

1896
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.670
Or with their blood stainthis discolour'd shore.

1897
02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:18.470
Master, this prisonerfreely give I thee;

1898
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.700
And thou that art hismate, make boot of this;

1899
02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:25.900
The other, WalterWhitmore, is thy share.

1900
02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:31.200
What is my ransom, master?Let me know.

1901
02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:41.230
A thousand crowns, or elselay down your head.

1902
02:06:41.230 --> 02:06:46.770
(Master's-Mate)And so much shallyou give, or off goes yours.

1903
02:06:46.770 --> 02:06:52.500
What, think you much topay two thousand crowns,

1904
02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:57.570
And bear the name and portof gentlemen?

1905
02:06:57.570 --> 02:07:00.670
Cut both the villains'throats; for die you shall:

1906
02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:02.400
The lives of those whichwe have lost in fight

1907
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.330
Be counterpoised with sucha petty sum!

1908
02:07:04.330 --> 02:07:09.230
I'll give it, sir; andtherefore spare my life.

1909
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:11.930
And so will I and writehome for it straight.

1910
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:15.800
I lost mine eye in layingthe prize aboard,

1911
02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:19.700
And therefore to revengeit, shalt thou die;

1912
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:22.430
And so should these, if Imight have my will.

1913
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:27.430
Be not so rash; takeransom, let him live.

1914
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:32.400
Look on my George; I am agentleman:

1915
02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.100
Rate me at what thou wilt,thou shalt be paid.

1916
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.830
And so am I; my name isWalter Whitmore.

1917
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:45.900
How now! why start'st thou?what, doth death affright?

1918
02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:52.100
Thy name affrights me, inwhose sound is death.

1919
02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:54.170
A cunning man didcalculate my birth

1920
02:07:54.170 --> 02:07:59.670
And told me that by waterI should die:

1921
02:07:59.670 --> 02:08:03.600
Yet let not this make theebe bloody-minded;

1922
02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.270
Never yet did basedishonour blur our name,

1923
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:10.400
But with our sword wewiped away the blot;

1924
02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:13.630
Therefore, when merchant-likeI sell revenge,

1925
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:17.370
Broke be my sword, my armstorn and defaced,

1926
02:08:17.370 --> 02:08:19.030
And I proclaim'd a cowardthrough the world!

1927
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:22.870
Stay, Whitmore; for thyprisoner is a prince,

1928
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:26.470
The Duke of Suffolk,William de la Pole.

1929
02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:36.000
The Duke of Suffolkmuffled up in rags!

1930
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.970
Ay, but these rags are nopart of the duke:

1931
02:08:38.970 --> 02:08:42.830
Jove sometimes wentdisguised, and why not I?

1932
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:51.700
But Jove was never slain,as thou shalt be.

1933
02:08:54.070 --> 02:08:59.570
Obscure and lowly swain,King Henry's blood,

1934
02:08:59.570 --> 02:09:02.270
The honourable blood ofLancaster,

1935
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:06.700
Must not be shed by such ajaded groom.

1936
02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:11.300
Hast thou not kiss'd thyhand and held my stirrup?

1937
02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:14.500
Bare-headed plodded by myfoot-cloth mule

1938
02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.900
And thought thee happywhen I shook my head?

1939
02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.730
How often hast thou waitedat my cup,

1940
02:09:19.730 --> 02:09:23.430
Fed from my trencher,kneel'd down at the board.

1941
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:27.070
When I have feasted withQueen Margaret?

1942
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:31.130
Remember it and let itmake thee crest-fall'n,

1943
02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:33.730
Ay, and allay this thyabortive pride;

1944
02:09:33.730 --> 02:09:39.270
Speak, captain, shall Istab the forlorn swain?

1945
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:49.100
First let my words stabhim, as he hath me.

1946
02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:55.930
Base slave, thy words areblunt and so art thou.

1947
02:09:55.930 --> 02:10:02.770
Convey him hence and onour longboat's side

1948
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:04.370
Strike off his head.

1949
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:05.630
Thou darest not, for thyown.

1950
02:10:05.630 --> 02:10:06.070
Pole!

1951
02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:08.030
Pole!

1952
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:17.770
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink;

1953
02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:22.730
whose filth Troubles the silverspring where England drinks.

1954
02:10:22.730 --> 02:10:29.870
Now will I dam up this thyyawning mouth

1955
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:32.130
For swallowing thetreasure of the realm:

1956
02:10:32.130 --> 02:10:36.930
Thy lips that kiss'd thequeen shall sweep the ground;

1957
02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:41.270
And thou that smiledst atgood Duke Humphrey's death,

1958
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:44.630
Against the senselesswinds shalt grin in vain,

1959
02:10:44.630 --> 02:10:47.570
Who in contempt shall hissat thee again:

1960
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:50.400
And wedded be thou to thehags of hell,

1961
02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:52.630
For daring to affy amighty lord

1962
02:10:52.630 --> 02:10:56.470
Unto the daughter of aworthless king,

1963
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:05.900
By thee Anjou and Mainewere sold to France,

1964
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.570
The false revoltingNormans thorough thee

1965
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:11.370
Disdain to call us lord,and Picardy

1966
02:11:11.370 --> 02:11:15.000
Hath slain their governors,surprised our forts,

1967
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And sent the raggedwounded soldiers home.

1968
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.430
The princely Warwick, andthe Nevils all,

1969
02:11:20.430 --> 02:11:22.600
Whose dreadful swords werenever drawn in vain,

1970
02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.630
As hating thee, are risingup in arms:

1971
02:11:25.630 --> 02:11:29.070
And now the house of York,thrust from the crown

1972
02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:32.330
By shameful murder of aguiltless king

1973
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:36.230
Burns with revenging fire;

1974
02:11:36.230 --> 02:11:39.930
The commons here in Kentare up in arms:

1975
02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:45.200
And, to conclude, reproachand beggary

1976
02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:48.370
Is crept into the palaceof our king.

1977
02:11:48.370 --> 02:11:55.070
And all by thee. Away!convey him hence.

1978
02:11:55.070 --> 02:12:02.070
O that I were a god, toshoot forth thunder

1979
02:12:02.070 --> 02:12:09.130
Upon these paltry,servile, abject drudges!

1980
02:12:09.130 --> 02:12:12.800
It is impossible that Ishould die

1981
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.500
By such a lowly vassal asthyself.

1982
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.370
Thy words move rage andnot remorse in me:

1983
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:22.900
Ay but thy deeds shall stay thyfury soon

1984
02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.630
I go of message from thequeen to France;

1985
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:32.370
I charge thee waft mesafely cross the Channel.

1986
02:12:32.370 --> 02:12:39.570
Come, Suffolk, I must waftthee to thy death.

1987
02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:42.300
'tis thee I fear.

1988
02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:48.000
Thou shalt have cause tofear before I leave thee.

1989
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.130
What, are ye daunted now?now will ye stoop?

1990
02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:56.730
My gracious lord, entreathim, speak him fair.

1991
02:12:56.730 --> 02:13:01.130
Suffolk's imperial tongueis stern and rough,

1992
02:13:01.130 --> 02:13:06.400
Used to command, untaughtto plead for favour.

1993
02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.000
Far be it we should honoursuch as these

1994
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.570
With humble suit: no,rather let my head

1995
02:13:12.570 --> 02:13:15.500
Stoop to the block thanthese knees bow to any

1996
02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:18.670
Save to the God ofheaven and to my king;

1997
02:13:18.670 --> 02:13:20.970
And sooner dance upon abloody pole

1998
02:13:20.970 --> 02:13:27.100
Than stand uncover'd tothe vulgar groom.

1999
02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:32.100
True nobility is exemptfrom fear:

2000
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.830
More can I bear than youdare execute.

2001
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:40.830
Hale him away, and let himtalk no more.

2002
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:46.030
Come, soldiers, show whatcruelty ye can,

2003
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:51.370
That this my death maynever be forgot!

2004
02:13:51.370 --> 02:13:55.030
Great men oft die by vilebezonians:

2005
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:57.200
A Roman sworder andbanditto slave

2006
02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:01.000
Murder'd sweet Tully;Brutus' bastard hand

2007
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.900
Stabb'd Julius Caesar;savage islanders

2008
02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:09.900
Pompey the Great; andSuffolk...(sound of beheading)

2009
02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:14.470
...dies by pirates.

2010
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:18.270
And as for those whoseransom we have set,

2011
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:21.670
It is our pleasure one ofthem depart;

2012
02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:25.130
So come you with usand let him go.

2013
02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:38.970
There let his head andlifeless body lie,

2014
02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:44.070
Until the queen hismistress bury it.

2015
02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:53.630
O barbarous and bloodyspectacle!

2016
02:14:53.630 --> 02:14:56.900
His body will I bear untothe king:

2017
02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:05.070
If he revenge it not, yetwill his friends;

2018
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:11.370
So will the queen, thatliving held him dear.

2019
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.970
Come, and get thee a sword,though made of a lath;

2020
02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:18.000
they have been up thesetwo days.

2021
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
They have the more need tosleep now, then.

2022
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.130
I tell thee, Jack Cade theclothier means to dress

2023
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:26.170
the commonwealth, and turn it,and set a new nap upon it.

2024
02:15:26.170 --> 02:15:29.770
So he had need, for'tis threadbare.

2025
02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:34.100
Well, I say it was nevermerry world in England

2026
02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:35.830
since gentlemen came up.

2027
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:39.270
O miserable age! virtue is notregarded in handicrafts-men.

2028
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:42.200
The nobility think scornto go in leather aprons.

2029
02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:45.070
Nay, more, the king'scouncil are no good workmen.

2030
02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:50.930
True; and yet it is said,labour in thy vocation;

2031
02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:52.530
which is as much to say as,

2032
02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:55.130
let the magistratesbe labouring men;

2033
02:15:55.130 --> 02:15:56.270
and therefore shouldwe be magistrates.

2034
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:58.770
Thou hast hit it; forthere's no better sign of a

2035
02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:01.870
brave mind than a hardhand.

2036
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:06.970
I see them! I see them!

2037
02:16:06.970 --> 02:16:08.630
There's Best's son,tanner of Wingham,--

2038
02:16:08.630 --> 02:16:10.030
He shall have theskin of our enemies,

2039
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:11.030
to make dog's-leather of.

2040
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:12.270
And Dick the Butcher,--

2041
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:14.270
Then is sin struckdown like an ox,

2042
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:15.670
and iniquity's throatcut like a calf.

2043
02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:17.770
And Smith the weaver,--

2044
02:16:17.770 --> 02:16:19.530
Argo, their thread of lifeis spun.

2045
02:16:19.530 --> 02:16:21.730
Come, come, let's fall inwith them.

2046
02:16:23.570 --> 02:16:32.630
(men chanting) John Cade!!

2047
02:16:51.170 --> 02:16:55.430
We John Cade, so termed ofour supposed father,--

2048
02:16:55.430 --> 02:16:57.900
Or rather, of stealing acade of herrings.

2049
02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:03.630
For our enemies shall fallbefore us, inspired with

2050
02:17:03.630 --> 02:17:06.900
the spirit of putting downkings and princes,

2051
02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:10.400
--Command silence.

2052
02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.400
Silence!

My father was aMortimer,--

2054
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.700
He was an honest man,and a good bricklayer.

My wife descended of theLacies,--

2058
02:17:25.130 --> 02:17:27.000
She was, indeed, apedler's daughter,

2059

2063
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:38.670

and more than that,he can speak French;

2165
02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:52.930

02:23:52.930 --> 02:23:55.330
O gross and miserableignorance!

02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:57.000
Nay, answer, if you can:the Frenchmen are our

2169
02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:05.000
can he that speaks withthe tongue of an enemy

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.630

02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:04.300
Ruled, like a wanderingplanet, over me,

2225
02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.570
And could it not enforcethem to relent,

2226
02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:09.430
That were unworthy tobehold the same?

2227
02:29:09.430 --> 02:29:12.400
Lord Say, Jack Cade hathsworn to have thy head.

2228
02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:15.370
Ay, but I hope yourhighness shall have his.

2229
02:29:15.370 --> 02:29:17.830
How, madam!

2230
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:20.830
Still lamenting Suffolk's death?

2231
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:22.600
I fear me, love, if that Ihad been dead,

2232
02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:25.900
Thou wouldst not havemourn'd so much for me.

2233
02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:31.130
No, my love, I should notmourn, but die for thee.

2234
02:29:33.370 --> 02:29:35.430
How now! what news? whycomest thou in such haste?

2235
02:29:35.430 --> 02:29:38.170
The rebels are inSouthwark; fly, my lord!

2236
02:29:38.170 --> 02:29:40.600
Jack Cade proclaimshimself Lord Mortimer,

2237
02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:42.730
Descended from the Duke ofClarence' house,

2238
02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:44.300
And calls your graceusurper openly

2239
02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:48.770
And vows to crown himselfin Westminster.

2240
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:50.030
His army is a raggedmultitude

2241
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:52.500
Of hinds and peasants,rude and merciless:

2242
02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:54.100
Sir Humphrey Stafford andh is brother's death

2243
02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:57.100
Hath given them heart andcourage to proceed:

2244
02:29:57.100 --> 02:29:59.700
All scholars, lawyers,courtiers, gentlemen,

2245
02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:02.800
They call false caterpillars,and intend their death.

2246
02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:05.800
O graceless men! they knownot what they do.

2247
02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:07.670
My gracious lord, returnto Killingworth,

2248
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:10.130
Until a power be raised toput them down.

2249
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:12.070
Ah, were the Duke ofSuffolk now alive,

2250
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:15.500
These Kentish rebels wouldbe soon appeased!

2251
02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:17.800
Lord Say, the traitorshate thee;

2252
02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:19.730
Therefore away with us toKillingworth.

2253
02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:21.470
So might your grace'sperson be in danger.

2254
02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:23.730
The sight of me is odiousin their eyes;

2255
02:30:23.730 --> 02:30:25.900
And therefore in this citywill I stay

2256
02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:28.200
And live alone as secretas I may.

2257
02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:30.100
Jack Cade hath gottenLondon bridge:

2258
02:30:30.100 --> 02:30:32.430
The citizens fly andforsake their houses:

2259
02:30:32.430 --> 02:30:33.470
The rascal people,thirsting after prey,

2260
02:30:33.470 --> 02:30:35.830
Join with the traitor, andthey jointly swear

2261
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:37.500
To spoil the city and yourroyal court.

2262
02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:39.930
Then linger not, my lord,away, take horse.

2263
02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:43.500
Come, Margaret; God, ourhope, will succor us.

2264
02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:47.100
My hope is gone, nowSuffolk is deceased.

2265
02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:51.000
Farewell, my lord: trustnot the Kentish rebels.

2266
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Trust nobody, for fear yoube betray'd.

2267
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.930
The trust I have is inmine innocence,

2268
02:30:55.930 --> 02:30:58.570
And therefore am I boldand resolute.

2269
02:31:31.970 --> 02:31:38.100
Jack Cade!

2270
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:59.200
Now is Mortimer lord ofLondon.

2271
02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:04.570
I charge and command that,at the city's cost,

2272
02:32:04.570 --> 02:32:06.970
the pissing-conduitrun nothing but

2273
02:32:06.970 --> 02:32:12.500
claret wine this firstyear of our reign.

2274
02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:16.270
And henceforward itshall be treason

2275
02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:21.230
for any that calls meother than Lord Mortimer.

2276
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:22.470
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!

2277
02:32:22.470 --> 02:32:28.030
Knock him down there.

2278
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:34.300
If this fellow be wise, he'llnever call ye Jack Cade more:

2279
02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:37.900
I think he hath a veryfair warning. My lord,

2280
02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:43.000
there's an army gatheredtogether in Smithfield.

2281
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:49.970
Come, then, let's go fightwith them; but first, go

2282
02:32:49.970 --> 02:32:53.930
and set London bridge onfire; and, if you can,

2283
02:32:53.930 --> 02:32:59.000
burn down the Towertoo. Come, let's away.

2284
02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:29.700
So, sirs: now go some andpull down the Savoy;

2285
02:34:29.700 --> 02:34:33.930
others to the inns ofcourt; down with them all.

2286
02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.870
I have a suit unto yourlordship.

2287
02:36:01.870 --> 02:36:05.400
Be it a lordship, thou shalthave it for that word.

2288
02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:09.630
Only that the laws of Englandmay come out of your mouth.

2289
02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:12.500
Mass, 'twill be sore law, then;

2290
02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:14.300
for he was thrust in themouth with a spear,

2291
02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:15.100
and 'tis not whole yet.

2292
02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:16.530
Nay, John, it willbe stinking law

2293
02:36:16.530 --> 02:36:19.770
for his breath stinks witheating toasted cheese.

2294
02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:25.000
I have thought uponit, it shall be so.

2295
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.170
Away, burn all therecords of the realm:

2296
02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:35.930
my mouth shall be theparliament of England.

2297
02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:40.070
Then we are like to havebiting statutes,

2298
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:42.300
unless his teeth be pulledout.

2299
02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:50.830
And henceforward allthings shall be in common.

2300
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:54.900
My lord, a prize, a prize!here's the Lord Say,

2301
02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.830
which sold the towns inFrance; he that made us pay

2302
02:36:57.830 --> 02:37:01.070
one and twenty fifteens, andone shilling to the pound,

2303
02:37:01.070 --> 02:37:02.530
the last subsidy.

2304
02:37:02.530 --> 02:37:06.930
Well, he shall be beheadedfor it ten times.

2305
02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:37.970
thou say, thou serge,nay, thou buckram lord!

2306
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:47.970
now art thou within point-blankof our jurisdiction regal.

2307
02:37:47.970 --> 02:37:50.200
What canst thouanswer to my majesty

2308
02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:53.600
for giving up of Normandy untoMounsieur kiss my backside,

2309
02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.670
the dauphin of France?

2310
02:37:57.670 --> 02:38:01.430
Be it known unto theeby these presence,

2311
02:38:01.430 --> 02:38:05.130
even the presence of LordMortimer, that I am the besom

2312
02:38:05.130 --> 02:38:06.470
that must sweep the court clean

2313
02:38:06.470 --> 02:38:12.100
of such filth as thou art.Thou hast most traitorously

2314
02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:17.270
corrupted the youth of the realmin erecting a grammar school;

2315
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:19.230
and whereas, before,our forefathers

2316
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:22.000
had no other books butthe score and the tally,

2317
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.230
thou hast causedprinting to be used,

2318
02:38:25.230 --> 02:38:28.300
and contrary to the king,his crown and dignity,

2319
02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:32.730
thou hast built a paper-mill.

2320
02:38:32.730 --> 02:38:36.870
It will be proved to thy facethat thou hast men about thee

2321
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:39.470
that usually speak ofa noun and a verb,

2322
02:38:39.470 --> 02:38:40.800
and such abominable words

2323
02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:44.300
as no Christian earcan endure to hear.

2324
02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:47.030
Thou hast appointedjustices of peace,

2325
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:50.030
to call poor men before them

2326
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:52.370
about matters they werenot able to answer.

2327
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:54.900
Moreover, thou hast putthem in prison; and because

2328
02:38:54.900 --> 02:39:02.130
they could not read,thou hast hanged them;

2329
02:39:02.130 --> 02:39:03.630
when, indeed, onlyfor that cause

2330
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:08.330
they have been mostworthy to live.

2331
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:15.430
Thou dost ride in afoot-cloth, dost thou not?

2332
02:39:15.430 --> 02:39:16.630
What of that?

2333
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:22.570
Marry, thou oughtest not tolet thy horse wear a cloak,

2334
02:39:22.570 --> 02:39:25.830
when honester men than thou goin their hose and doublets.

2335
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:29.970
And work in their shirt; asmyself, for example,

2336
02:39:29.970 --> 02:39:32.730
that am a butcher.

2337
02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:35.830
You men of Kent,--

2338
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:38.430
What say you of Kent?

2339
02:39:38.430 --> 02:39:42.930
Nothing but this; 'tis'bona terra, mala gens.'

2340
02:39:42.930 --> 02:39:46.930
Away with him, away withhim! he speaks Latin.

2341
02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:54.070
Hear me but speak, andbear me where you will.

2342
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:17.670
Kent, in the CommentariesCaesar writ,

2343
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:25.200
Is term'd the civil'stplace of all this isle:

2344
02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:28.630
Sweet is the country,because full of riches;

2345
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:36.070
The people liberal,valiant, active, wealthy;

2346
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:42.630
Which makes me hope youare not void of pity.

2347
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:48.130
I sold not Maine, I lostnot Normandy,

2348
02:40:48.130 --> 02:40:52.800
Yet, to recover them,would lose my life.

2349
02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:58.030
Justice with favour have Ialways done;

2350
02:40:58.030 --> 02:41:05.100
Prayers and tears have movedme, gifts could never.

2351
02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:09.500
When have I aught exactedat your hands,

2352
02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:15.570
But to maintain the king,the realm and you?

2353
02:41:15.570 --> 02:41:18.570
Large gifts have I bestow'don learned clerks,

2354
02:41:18.570 --> 02:41:21.200
Because my book preferr'dme to the king,

2355
02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:24.530
And seeing ignorance isthe curse of God,

2356
02:41:24.530 --> 02:41:27.970
Knowledge the wingwherewith we fly to heaven,

2357
02:41:27.970 --> 02:41:32.130
Unless you be possess'dwith devilish spirits,

2358
02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:38.000
You cannot but forbear tomurder me:

2359
02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.100
This tongue hath parley'dunto foreign kings

2360
02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:42.670
For your behoof,--

2361
02:41:42.670 --> 02:41:45.170
Tut, when struck'st thouone blow in the field?

2362
02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.370
Great men have reachinghands: oft have I struck

2363
02:41:51.370 --> 02:41:54.500
Those that I never saw andstruck them dead.

2364
02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:58.170
O monstrous coward! what,to come behind folks?

2365
02:41:58.170 --> 02:42:03.670
These cheeks are pale forwatching for your good.

2366
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:08.900
Give him a box o' the ear andthat will make 'em red again.

2367
02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:13.870
Long sitting to determinepoor men's causes

2368
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:17.530
Hath made me full ofsickness and diseases.

2369
02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:21.970
Why dost thou quiver, man?

2370
02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:25.570
The palsy, and not fear,provokes me.

2371
02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:34.770
Nay, he nods at us,as who should say,

2372
02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:40.000
I'll be even with them:

2373
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.530
I'll see if his headwill stand steadier

2374
02:42:41.530 --> 02:42:48.230
on a pole, or no. Take himaway, and behead him.

2375
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:58.400
Tell me wherein have Ioffended most?

2376
02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:04.730
Have I affected wealth orhonour? speak.

2377
02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:09.500
Are my chests fill'd upwith extorted gold?

2378
02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:15.030
Is my apparel sumptuous tobehold?

2379
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:23.370
Whom have I injured, thatye seek my death?

2380
02:43:23.370 --> 02:43:27.170
These hands are free fromguiltless bloodshedding,

2381
02:43:27.170 --> 02:43:32.570
This breast from harbouringfoul deceitful thoughts.

2382
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:43.570
O, let me live!

2383
02:43:43.570 --> 02:43:48.630
I feel remorse in myselfwith his words;

2384
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:53.270
but I'll bridle it: heshall die, an it be

2385
02:43:53.270 --> 02:44:00.500
but for pleading so well forhis life. Away with him!

2386
02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:05.100
he has a familiarunder his tongue;

2387
02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:07.800
he speaks not o' God's name.

2388
02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:08.970
Go, take him away,I say, and strike

2389
02:44:08.970 --> 02:44:12.830
off his head presently;and then break into his

2390
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:17.630
son-in-law's house,Sir James Cromer,

2391
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:19.930
and strike off his head,

2392
02:44:19.930 --> 02:44:24.100
and bring them bothupon two poles hither.

2393
02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:27.300
It shall be done.

2394
02:44:28.530 --> 02:44:33.700
Ah, countrymen! if whenyou make your prayers,

2395
02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:37.370
God should be so obdurateas yourselves,

2396
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:44.070
How would it fare withyour departed souls?

2397
02:44:44.430 --> 02:44:48.370
And therefore yet relent,and save my life.

2398
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:50.830
Away with him! and do as Icommand ye.

2399
02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:57.030
The proudest peer in therealm shall not wear

2400
02:44:57.030 --> 02:45:01.670
a head on his shoulders,unless he pay me tribute;

2401
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:03.700
there shall not amaid be married,

2402
02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:04.770
but she shall pay to me

2403
02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:09.300
her maidenhead ere theyhave it: men shall hold of

2404
02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:16.030
me in capite; and we chargeand command that their

2405
02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:27.400
wives shall be as free as heartcan wish or tongue can tell.

2406
02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:35.270
My lord, when shallwe go to Cheapside

2407
02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:39.770
to take up commoditiesupon our bills?

2408
02:45:39.770 --> 02:45:41.670
Marry, presently.

2409
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:44.730
O, brave!

2410
02:45:47.770 --> 02:45:57.800
But is not this braver?Let them kiss one another,

2411
02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:03.000
But is not this braver?Let them kiss one another,

2412
02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.530
for they loved wellwhen they were alive.

2413
02:46:06.530 --> 02:46:09.400
Now part them again, lest theyconsult about the giving up of

2414
02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:16.870
some more towns in France.Soldiers, defer the spoil

2415
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:21.230
of the city until night: forwith these borne before us,

2416
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:24.470
instead of maces,will we ride through

2417
02:46:24.470 --> 02:46:36.430
the streets, and at everycorner have them kiss. Away!

2418
02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:45.130
Up Fish Street! down SaintMagnus' Corner! Kill

2419
02:46:45.130 --> 02:46:48.000
and knock down! throw theminto Thames!

2420
02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.570
(trumpets)

2421
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:53.770
What noise is this I hear?Dare any be so bold

2422
02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:56.500
to sound retreat or parley,when I command them kill?

2423
02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:01.870
Ay, here they be that dareand will disturb thee:

2424
02:47:01.870 --> 02:47:05.330
Know, Cade, we comeambassadors from the king

2425
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:08.500
Unto the commons whom thouhast misled;

2426
02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:10.830
And here pronounce freepardon to them all

2427
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:13.430
That will forsake thee andgo home in peace.

2428
02:47:13.430 --> 02:47:17.830
What say ye, countrymen?will ye relent,

2429
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:20.870
And yield to mercy whilst'tis offer'd you;

2430
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:24.330
Or let a rebel lead you toyour deaths?

2431
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:28.700
Who loves the king andwill embrace his pardon,

2432
02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:32.500
Fling up his cap, and say'God save his majesty!'

2433
02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:36.500
Who hateth him and honoursnot his father,

2434
02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:40.730
Henry the Fifth, that madeall France to quake,

2435
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:45.530
Shake he his weapon at usand pass by.

2436
02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:50.830
God save the king! Godsave the king!

2437
02:47:50.830 --> 02:47:54.200
What, Buckingham andClifford, are ye so brave?

2438
02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.530
And you, base peasants,do ye believe him?

2439
02:47:57.530 --> 02:48:01.670
will you needs be hanged withyour pardons about your necks?

2440
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:04.270
Hath my sword thereforebroke through London gates,

2441
02:48:04.270 --> 02:48:06.100
that you should leave meat the White Hart in

2442
02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:09.700
Southwark? I thought yewould never have given out

2443
02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:11.700
these arms till you hadrecovered your ancient

2444
02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:17.130
freedom: but you are allrecreants and dastards,

2445
02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:22.470
and delight to live inslavery to the nobility.

2446
02:48:22.470 --> 02:48:27.170
Let them break your backswith burthens, take your

2447
02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:30.800
houses over your heads,ravish your wives

2448
02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.930
and daughters beforeyour faces: as for me,

2449
02:48:34.930 --> 02:48:36.700
I will make shift for one;

2450
02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:38.900
and so, God's curselight upon you all!

2451
02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:42.500
We'll follow Cade, we'llfollow Cade!

2452
02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.600
Is Cade the son of Henrythe Fifth,

2453
02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:49.400
That thus you do exclaimyou'll go with him?

2454
02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.100
Will he conduct you throughthe heart of France,

2455
02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:57.070
And make the meanest ofyou earls and dukes?

2456
02:48:57.070 --> 02:49:01.230
Were't not a shame, thatwhilst you live at jar,

2457
02:49:01.230 --> 02:49:05.000
The fearful French, whomyou late vanquished,

2458
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.570
Should make a start o'erseas and vanquish you?

2459
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:11.900
Methinks already in thiscivil broil

2460
02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:15.830
I see them lording it inLondon streets,

2461
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:20.170
Crying 'Villiago!' untoall they meet.

2462
02:49:20.170 --> 02:49:25.070
Better ten thousandbase-born Cades miscarry

2463
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:29.800
Than you should stoop untoa Frenchman's mercy.

2464
02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.970
To France, to France, andget what you have lost;

2465
02:49:34.970 --> 02:49:40.270
Spare England, for it isyour native coast;

2466
02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:45.930
Henry hath money, you arestrong and manly;

2467
02:49:45.930 --> 02:49:50.930
God on our side, doubt notof victory.

2468
02:49:50.930 --> 02:49:57.330
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'llfollow the king and Clifford.

2469
02:50:01.270 --> 02:50:05.700
Was ever feather solightly blown to and fro

2470
02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:11.230
as this multitude? The name ofHenry the Fifth hales them

2471
02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:20.170
to an hundred mischiefs, andmakes them leave me desolate.

2472
02:50:20.170 --> 02:50:25.500
I see them lay their headstogether to surprise me.

2473
02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:30.170
My sword make way for me,for here is no staying.

2474
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:32.330
In despite of thedevils and hell,

2475
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:34.800
have through the verymiddest of you?

2476
02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:38.230
What, is he fled? Go some,and follow him;

2477
02:50:38.230 --> 02:50:39.630
And he that brings hishead unto the king

2478
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:41.300
Shall have a thousandcrowns for his reward.

2479
02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:00.730
Follow me, soldiers: we'lldevise a mean

2480
02:51:00.730 --> 02:51:04.330
To reconcile you all untothe king.

2481
02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:48.430
Was ever king that joy'dan earthly throne,

2482
02:51:48.430 --> 02:51:52.670
And could command no morecontent than I?

2483
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:55.470
No sooner was I crept outof my cradle

2484
02:51:55.470 --> 02:52:00.070
But I was made a king, atnine months old.

2485
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:01.530
Was never subject long'dto be a king

2486
02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:05.570
As I do long and wish tobe a subject.

2487
02:52:05.570 --> 02:52:07.570
Health and glad tidings toyour majesty!

2488
02:52:07.570 --> 02:52:10.630
Why, Buckingham, is thetraitor Cade surprised?

2489
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:12.170
Or is he but retired tomake him strong?

2490
02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:15.870
He is fled, my lord, andall his powers do yield;

2491
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:18.770
And humbly thus, withhalters on their necks,

2492
02:52:18.770 --> 02:52:21.500
Expect your highness' doomof life or death.

2493
02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:23.870
Then, heaven, set ope thyeverlasting gates,

2494
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:27.030
To entertain my vows ofthanks and praise!

2495
02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:30.670
Soldiers, this day haveyou redeemed your lives,

2496
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:33.500
And show'd how well you loveyour prince and country:

2497
02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:36.500
Continue still in this sogood a mind,

2498
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:38.400
And Henry, though he beinfortunate,

2499
02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:41.930
Assure yourselves, willnever be unkind:

2500
02:52:41.930 --> 02:52:44.400
And so, with thanks andpardon to you all,

2501
02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:46.970
I do dismiss you to yourseveral countries.

2502
02:52:46.970 --> 02:52:56.130
God save the king! Godsave the king!

2503
02:52:56.130 --> 02:52:57.770
Please it your grace to beadvertised

2504
02:52:57.770 --> 02:53:00.200
The Duke of York is newlycome from Ireland,

2505
02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:01.670
And with a puissant and amighty force

2506
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:03.370
Of gallowglasses and stoutkerns

2507
02:53:03.370 --> 02:53:05.930
Is marching hitherward inproud array,

2508
02:53:05.930 --> 02:53:07.730
And still proclaimeth, ashe comes along,

2509
02:53:07.730 --> 02:53:09.500
His arms are only toremove from thee

2510
02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:13.800
The Duke of Somerset, whomhe terms a traitor.

2511
02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:18.030
Thus stands my state, 'twixtCade and York distress'd.

2512
02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:20.670
Like to a ship that,having 'scaped a tempest,

2513
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:23.130
Is straightway calm'd andboarded with a pirate:

2514
02:53:23.130 --> 02:53:25.400
But now is Cade drivenback, his men dispersed;

2515
02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:27.930
And now is York in arms tosecond him.

2516
02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:29.670
I pray thee, Buckingham,go and meet him,

2517
02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:32.770
And ask him what's thereason of these arms.

2518
02:53:32.770 --> 02:53:35.270
Tell him I'll send DukeEdmund to the Tower;

2519
02:53:35.270 --> 02:53:36.900
And, Somerset, we'llcommit thee thither,

2520
02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:39.900
Until his army bedismiss'd from him.

2521
02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:42.200
I will yield my lord toprison willingly,

2522
02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:46.100
Or unto death, to do mycountry good.

2523
02:53:46.370 --> 02:53:47.870
In any case, be not toorough in terms;

2524
02:53:47.870 --> 02:53:50.200
For he is fierce and cannotbrook hard language.

2525
02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:53.370
I will, my lord; and doubtnot so to deal

2526
02:53:53.370 --> 02:53:57.630
As all things shallredound unto your good.

2527
02:54:11.070 --> 02:54:15.570
Come, wife, let's in, andlearn to govern better;

2528
02:54:15.570 --> 02:54:20.430
For yet may England cursemy wretched reign.

2529
02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:48.970
Fie on ambition! fie onmyself, that have a sword,

2530
02:54:48.970 --> 02:54:56.200
and yet am ready to famish!These five days have I hid me

2531
02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:58.770
in these woods anddurst not peep out,

2532
02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:06.070
for all the country islaid for me; but now

2533
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:09.700
am I so hungry that if I mighthave a lease of my life

2534
02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:13.470
for a thousand years Icould stay no longer.

2535
02:55:13.470 --> 02:55:17.770
Wherefore, on a brick wall haveI climbed into this garden,

2536
02:55:17.770 --> 02:55:22.000
to see if I can eat grass, orpick a sallet another while,

2537
02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.430
which is not amiss tocool a man's stomach

2538
02:55:26.430 --> 02:55:32.370
this hot weather. And Ithink this word 'sallet'

2539
02:55:32.370 --> 02:55:38.130
was born to do me good:for many a time, but for a

2540
02:55:38.130 --> 02:55:41.100
sallet, my brainpan had beencleft with a brown bill;

2541
02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:46.770
and many a time, whenI have been dry and

2542
02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:50.030
bravely marching, it hathserved me instead of a

2543
02:55:50.030 --> 02:56:01.770
quart pot to drink in; andnow the word 'sallet'

2544
02:56:01.770 --> 02:56:04.300
must serve me to feed on.

2545
02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:21.400
Lord, who would liveturmoiled in the court,

2546
02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:26.770
And may enjoy such quietwalks as these?

2547
02:56:35.970 --> 02:56:39.500
This small inheritance myfather left me

2548
02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:45.830
Contenteth me, and worth amonarchy.

2549
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:49.630
I seek not to wax great byothers' waning,

2550
02:56:49.630 --> 02:56:53.900
Or gather wealth, I carenot, with what envy:

2551
02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:58.330
Sufficeth that I havemaintains my state

2552
02:56:58.330 --> 02:57:02.170
And sends the poor wellpleased from my gate.

2553
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:07.370
Here's the lord of the soilcome to seize me for a stray,

2554
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:15.630
for entering hisfee-simple without leave.

2555
02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:22.900
Ah, villain, thou wilt betrayme, and get a thousand

2556
02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:28.430
crowns of the kingcarrying my head to him:

2557
02:57:28.430 --> 02:57:31.700
but I'll make thee eat ironlike an ostrich, and swallow

2558
02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.830
my sword like a great pin,ere thou and I part.

2559
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:40.270
Why, rude companion,whatsoe'er thou be,

2560
02:57:40.270 --> 02:57:42.630
I know thee not; why, then,should I betray thee?

2561
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:47.030
Is't not enough to breakinto my garden,

2562
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:48.830
And, like a thief, to cometo rob my grounds,

2563
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:51.800
Climbing my walls in spiteof me the owner,

2564
02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:55.030
But thou wilt brave mewith these saucy terms?

2565
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:58.530
Brave thee! ay, by the bestblood that ever was broached,

2566
02:57:58.530 --> 02:58:10.700
and beard thee too.Look on me well:

2567
02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:15.430
I have eat no meat thesefive days; yet, come thou

2568
02:58:15.430 --> 02:58:19.830
and thy five men, and ifI do not leave you all

2569
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:25.730
as dead as a doornails, I prayGod I may never eat grass more.

2570
02:58:25.730 --> 02:58:31.570
Nay, it shall ne'er besaid, while England stands,

2571
02:58:31.570 --> 02:58:35.730
That Alexander Iden, anesquire of Kent,

2572
02:58:35.730 --> 02:58:38.500
Took odds to combat a poorfamish'd man.

2573
02:58:41.270 --> 02:58:47.230
Oppose thy steadfast-gazingeyes to mine,

2574
02:58:47.230 --> 02:58:51.300
See if thou canst outfaceme with thy looks:

2575
02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:56.430
Set limb to limb, and thouart far the lesser;

2576
02:58:56.430 --> 02:59:00.230
Thy hand is but a fingerto my fist,

2577
02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:04.300
Thy leg a stick comparedwith this truncheon;

2578
02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:10.500
My foot shall fight withall the strength thou hast;

2579
02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:14.500
And if mine arm be heavedin the air,

2580
02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:21.800
Thy grave is digg'dalready in the earth.

2581
02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:29.430
As for words, whosegreatness answers words,

2582
02:59:29.430 --> 02:59:36.030
Let this my sword reportwhat speech forbears.

2583
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:40.670
By my valour, the mostcomplete champion that ever I

2584
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:48.700
heard! Steel, if thou turnthe edge, or cut not out

2585
02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:52.670
this burly-boned clownin chines of beef

2586
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:55.030
ere thou sleep in thy sheath,

2587
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:58.770
I beseech God on my knees thou

2588
02:59:58.770 --> 03:00:02.130
mayst be turned tohobnails.

2589
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:27.300
O, I am slain!

2590
03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:39.900
famine and no otherhath slain me:

2591
03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:47.200
let ten thousand devils comeagainst me, and give me

2592
03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:53.070
but the ten meals I have lost,and I'll defy them all.

2593
03:01:00.530 --> 03:01:05.600
Wither, garden;and be henceforth

2594
03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:10.830
a burying-place to all thatdo dwell in this house,

2595
03:01:10.830 --> 03:01:17.270
because the unconqueredsoul of Cade is fled.

2596
03:01:17.570 --> 03:01:23.330
Is't Cade that I have slain,that monstrous traitor?

2597
03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:33.800
Iden, farewell, and beproud of thy victory. Tell

2598
03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:39.570
Kent from me, she hath losther best man, and exhort

2599
03:01:39.570 --> 03:01:46.170
all the world to be cowards;for I, that never feared any,

2600
03:01:46.170 --> 03:01:54.270
am vanquished byfamine, not by valour.

2601
03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:59.800
How much thou wrong'st me,heaven be my judge.

2602
03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:08.930
Die, damned wretch, thecurse of her that bare thee;

2603
03:02:08.930 --> 03:02:13.130
And as I thrust thy bodyin with my sword,

2604
03:02:13.130 --> 03:02:18.700
So wish I, I might thrustthy soul to hell.

2605
03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:24.770
Hence will I drag theeheadlong by the heels

2606
03:02:24.770 --> 03:02:29.570
Unto a dunghill whichshall be thy grave,

2607
03:02:29.570 --> 03:02:34.900
And there cut off thy mostungracious head;

2608
03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:39.300
Which I will bear intriumph to the king,

2609
03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:48.900
Leaving thy trunk forcrows to feed upon.

2610
03:02:54.930 --> 03:03:09.930
(trumpets and drums sound)

2611
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:38.030
From Ireland thus comesYork to claim his right,

2612
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:42.270
And pluck the crown fromfeeble Henry's head:

2613
03:03:42.270 --> 03:03:48.630
Ring, bells, aloud; burn,bonfires, clear and bright,

2614
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:54.000
To entertain greatEngland's lawful king.

2615
03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:01.000
Ah! sancta majestas, whowould not buy thee dear?

2616
03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:06.300
Let them obey that knownot how to rule;

2617
03:04:06.300 --> 03:04:11.430
This hand was made tohandle naught but gold.

2618
03:04:11.430 --> 03:04:13.430
I cannot give due actionto my words,

2619
03:04:13.430 --> 03:04:16.670
Except a sword or sceptrebalance it:

2620
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:21.830
A sceptre shall it have,have I a sword,

2621
03:04:22.130 --> 03:04:28.970
On which I'll toss theflower-de-luce of France.

2622
03:04:28.970 --> 03:04:33.070
Whom have we here?Buckingham, to disturb me?

2623
03:04:33.070 --> 03:04:39.270
The king hath sent him,sure: I must dissemble.

2624
03:04:39.270 --> 03:04:43.600
York, if thou meanestwell, I greet thee well.

2625
03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:48.300
Humphrey of Buckingham, Iaccept thy greeting.

2626
03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:50.970
Art thou a messenger, orcome of pleasure?

2627
03:04:50.970 --> 03:04:52.630
A messenger from Henry,our dread liege,

2628
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:55.930
To know the reason ofthese arms in peace;

2629
03:04:55.930 --> 03:04:58.670
Or why thou, being asubject as I am,

2630
03:04:58.670 --> 03:05:00.830
Against thy oath and trueallegiance sworn,

2631
03:05:00.830 --> 03:05:03.870
Should raise so great apower without his leave,

2632
03:05:04.270 --> 03:05:08.030
Or dare to bring thy forceso near the court.

2633
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:14.470
Scarce can I speak, mycholer is so great:

2634
03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:15.930
O, I could hew up rocksand fight with flint,

2635
03:05:15.930 --> 03:05:20.270
I am so angry at theseabject terms;

2636
03:05:20.270 --> 03:05:25.330
But I must make fairweather yet a while,

2637
03:05:25.330 --> 03:05:31.130
Till Henry be more weakand I more strong,--

2638
03:05:31.130 --> 03:05:33.930
Buckingham, I prithee,pardon me,

2639
03:05:33.930 --> 03:05:36.570
That I have given noanswer all this while;

2640
03:05:36.570 --> 03:05:40.530
My mind was troubled withdeep melancholy.

2641
03:05:40.530 --> 03:05:44.170
The cause why I havebrought this army hither

2642
03:05:44.170 --> 03:05:47.830
Is to remove proudSomerset from the king,

2643
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:49.600
Seditious to his grace andto the state.

2644
03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:54.700
That is too muchpresumption on thy part:

2645
03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:56.130
But if thy arms be to noother end,

2646
03:05:56.130 --> 03:05:59.700
The king hath yielded untothy demand:

2647
03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:03.270
The Duke of Somerset is inthe Tower.

2648
03:06:05.730 --> 03:06:08.570
Upon thine honour, is heprisoner?

2649
03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:12.770
Upon mine honour, he isprisoner.

2650
03:06:19.300 --> 03:06:24.870
Then, Buckingham, I dodismiss my powers.

2651
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:29.900
Soldiers, I thank you all;disperse yourselves;

2652
03:06:29.900 --> 03:06:32.400
Meet me to-morrow in St.George's field,

2653
03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:36.170
You shall have pay andevery thing you wish.

2654
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:39.570
And let my sovereign,virtuous Henry,

2655
03:06:39.570 --> 03:06:43.030
Command my eldest son,nay, all my sons,

2656
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:46.230
As pledges of my fealtyand love;

2657
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:48.600
I'll send them all aswilling as I live:

2658
03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.970
Lands, goods, horse,armour, any thing I have,

2659
03:06:50.970 --> 03:06:54.770
Is his to use, so Somersetmay die.

2660
03:06:54.770 --> 03:06:58.570
York, I commend this kindsubmission:

2661
03:06:59.370 --> 03:07:01.870
(horns sound)

2662
03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.030
In all submission andhumility

2663
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:12.830
York doth present himselfunto your highness.

2664
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:16.200
Then what intends theseforces thou dost bring?

2665
03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:19.200
To heave the traitorSomerset from hence,

2666
03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:22.500
And fight against thatmonstrous rebel Cade,

2667
03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:24.700
Who since I heard to bediscomfited.

2668
03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:27.270
If one so rude and of somean disposition

2669
03:07:27.270 --> 03:07:29.930
May pass into the presenceof a king,

2670
03:07:29.930 --> 03:07:32.930
Lo, I present your grace atraitor's head,

2671
03:07:32.930 --> 03:07:36.400
The head of Cade, whom Iin combat slew.

2672
03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:39.370
The head of Cade! GreatGod, how just art Thou!

2673
03:07:39.370 --> 03:07:41.830
O, let me view his visage,being dead,

2674
03:07:41.830 --> 03:07:44.430
That living wrought mesuch exceeding trouble.

2675
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:52.930
Tell me, my friend, artthou the man that slew him?

2676
03:07:52.930 --> 03:07:55.270
I was, an't like yourmajesty.

2677
03:07:55.270 --> 03:07:57.100
How art thou call'd? andwhat is thy degree?

2678
03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:00.700
Alexander Iden, that's myname;

2679
03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:03.370
A poor esquire of Kent,that loves his king.

2680
03:08:03.370 --> 03:08:05.400
So please it you, my lord,'twere not amiss

2681
03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:08.500
He were created knight forhis good service.

2682
03:08:08.500 --> 03:08:11.130
Iden, kneel down.

2683
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:18.930
Rise up a knight.

2684
03:08:20.670 --> 03:08:22.770
We give thee for reward athousand marks,

2685
03:08:22.770 --> 03:08:24.570
And will that thouhenceforth attend on us.

2686
03:08:24.570 --> 03:08:26.800
May Iden live to meritsuch a bounty.

2687
03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:31.030
And never live but trueunto his liege!

2688
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:33.200
See, Buckingham, Somersetcomes with the queen:

2689
03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:34.530
Go, bid her hide himquickly from the duke.

2690
03:08:34.530 --> 03:08:37.570
For thousand Yorks heshall not hide his head,

2691
03:08:37.570 --> 03:08:41.030
But boldly stand and fronthim to his face.

2692
03:08:42.270 --> 03:08:48.930
How now! is Somerset atliberty?

2693
03:08:48.930 --> 03:08:54.070
Then, York, unloose thylong-imprison'd thoughts,

2694
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:57.130
And let thy tongue beequal with thy heart.

2695
03:08:57.130 --> 03:09:01.330
Shall I endure the sightof Somerset?

2696
03:09:01.330 --> 03:09:05.800
False king! why hast thoubroken faith with me,

2697
03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:09.700
Knowing how hardly I canbrook abuse?

2698
03:09:09.700 --> 03:09:16.130
King did I call thee? no,thou art not king,

2699
03:09:16.130 --> 03:09:18.970
Not fit to govern and rulemultitudes,

2700
03:09:18.970 --> 03:09:24.570
Which darest not, no, norcanst not rule a traitor.

2701
03:09:24.570 --> 03:09:27.730
That head of thine dothnot become a crown;

2702
03:09:27.730 --> 03:09:30.700
Thy hand is made to graspa palmer's staff,

2703
03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:34.800
And not to grace an awfulprincely sceptre.

2704
03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:40.600
That gold must round engirtthese brows of mine,

2705
03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:44.130
Whose smile and frown,like to Achilles' spear,

2706
03:09:44.130 --> 03:09:47.030
Is able with the change tokill and cure.

2707
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:49.600
Here is a hand to hold asceptre up

2708
03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:53.600
And with the same to actcontrolling laws.

2709
03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.600
Give place: by heaven,thou shalt rule no more

2710
03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:02.170
O'er him whom heavencreated for thy ruler.

2711
03:10:02.170 --> 03:10:09.270
O monstrous traitor! Iarrest thee, York,

2712
03:10:09.270 --> 03:10:12.870
Of capital treason 'gainstthe king and crown;

2713
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:20.730
Obey, audacious traitor;kneel for grace.

2714
03:10:22.330 --> 03:10:31.000
Wouldst have me kneel?first let me ask of these,

2715
03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:35.900
If they can brook I bow aknee to man.

2716
03:10:36.200 --> 03:10:41.270
Sirrah, call in my sons tobe my bail;

2717
03:10:41.270 --> 03:10:44.170
I know, ere they will haveme go to ward,

2718
03:10:44.170 --> 03:10:47.230
They'll pawn their swordsfor my enfranchisement.

2719
03:10:47.230 --> 03:10:50.430
Call hither Clifford! bidhim come amain,

2720
03:10:50.430 --> 03:10:53.470
To say if that the bastardboys of York

2721
03:10:53.470 --> 03:10:58.170
Shall be the surety fortheir traitor father.

2722
03:10:58.170 --> 03:11:02.770
O blood-besottedNeapolitan,

2723
03:11:02.770 --> 03:11:09.400
Outcast of Naples,England's bloody scourge!

2724
03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:12.300
The sons of York, thybetters in their birth,

2725
03:11:12.300 --> 03:11:15.830
Shall be their father'sbail; and bane to those

2726
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:20.830
That for my surety willrefuse the boys!

2727
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:26.300
See where they come: I'llwarrant they'll make it good.

2728
03:11:26.300 --> 03:11:31.930
And here comes Clifford todeny their bail.

2729
03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:41.070
Health and all happinessto my lord the king!

2730
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:45.070
I thank thee, Clifford:say, what news with thee?

2731
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:48.330
Nay, do not fright us withan angry look;

2732
03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:53.930
We are thy sovereign,Clifford, kneel again;

2733
03:11:53.930 --> 03:11:58.070
For thy mistaking so, wepardon thee.

2734
03:11:58.070 --> 03:12:03.230
This is my king, York, Ido not mistake;

2735
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:07.800
But thou mistakest me muchto think I do:

2736
03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:10.700
To Bedlam with him! is theman grown mad?

2737
03:12:10.700 --> 03:12:12.830
Ay, Clifford; a bedlam andambitious humour

2738
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:14.800
Makes him oppose himselfagainst his king.

2739
03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:16.870
He is a traitor; let himto the Tower,

2740
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:18.670
And chop away thatfactious pate of his.

2741
03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:22.530
He is arrested, but willnot obey;

2742
03:12:22.530 --> 03:12:26.470
His sons, he says, shallgive their words for him.

2743
03:12:26.470 --> 03:12:29.500
Will you not, sons?

2744
03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:31.900
Ay, noble father, if ourwords will serve.

2745
03:12:31.900 --> 03:12:37.030
And if words will not,then our weapons shall.

2746
03:12:37.330 --> 03:12:43.970
Why, what a brood oftraitors have we here!

2747
03:12:43.970 --> 03:12:48.370
Look in a glass, and callthy image so:

2748
03:12:48.370 --> 03:12:54.500
I am thy king, and thou afalse-heart traitor.

2749
03:12:55.830 --> 03:13:00.870
Call hither to the stakemy two brave bears,

2750
03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:03.670
That with the very shakingof their chains

2751
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:08.400
They may astonish thesefell-lurking curs:

2752
03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:10.830
Bid Salisbury and Warwickcome to me.

2753
03:13:27.800 --> 03:13:36.130
Are these thy bears? we'llbait thy bears to death.

2754
03:13:36.130 --> 03:13:38.470
And manacle the bear-wardin their chains,

2755
03:13:38.470 --> 03:13:41.430
If thou darest bring themto the baiting place.

2756
03:13:41.430 --> 03:13:43.970
Oft have I seen a hoto'erweening cur

2757
03:13:43.970 --> 03:13:46.830
Run back and bite, becausehe was withheld;

2758
03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:50.270
Who, being suffer'd withthe bear's fell paw,

2759
03:13:50.270 --> 03:13:53.970
Hath clapp'd his tailbetween his legs and cried:

2760
03:13:53.970 --> 03:13:56.170
And such a piece ofservice will you do,

2761
03:13:56.170 --> 03:13:58.730
If you oppose yourselvesto match Lord Warwick.

2762
03:13:58.730 --> 03:14:02.570
Hence, heap of wrath, foulindigested lump,

2763
03:14:02.570 --> 03:14:04.670
As crooked in thy mannersas thy shape!

2764
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:10.100
Nay, we shall heed youthoroughly anon.

2765
03:14:10.100 --> 03:14:15.200
Take heed, lest by yourheat you burn yourselves.

2766
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:20.100
Why, Warwick, hath thyknee forgot to bow?

2767
03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:22.830
Old Salisbury, shame tothy silver hair,

2768
03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:26.900
Thou mad misleader of thybrain-sick son!

2769
03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:30.900
O, where is faith? O,where is loyalty?

2770
03:14:30.900 --> 03:14:32.470
If it be banish'd from thefrosty head,

2771
03:14:32.470 --> 03:14:36.570
Where shall it find aharbour in the earth?

2772
03:14:36.570 --> 03:14:38.530
Wilt thou go dig a graveto find out war,

2773
03:14:38.530 --> 03:14:42.470
And shame thine honourableage with blood?

2774
03:14:42.470 --> 03:14:44.330
Why art thou old, andwant'st experience?

2775
03:14:44.330 --> 03:14:48.070
Or wherefore dost abuseit, if thou hast it?

2776
03:14:48.070 --> 03:14:50.800
For shame! in duty bendthy knee to me

2777
03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:53.630
That bows unto the gravewith mickle age.

2778
03:14:53.630 --> 03:14:55.370
My lord, I have consider'dwith myself

2779
03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:58.900
The title of this mostrenowned duke;

2780
03:14:58.900 --> 03:15:01.130
And in my conscience dorepute his grace

2781
03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:04.400
The rightful heir toEngland's royal seat.

2782
03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:06.570
Hast thou not swornallegiance unto me?

2783
03:15:06.570 --> 03:15:09.770
I have.

2784
03:15:09.770 --> 03:15:12.270
Canst thou dispense withheaven for such an oath?

2785
03:15:12.270 --> 03:15:16.730
It is great sin to swearunto a sin,

2786
03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:21.130
But greater sin to keep asinful oath.

2787
03:15:21.130 --> 03:15:22.970
Who shall be bound by anysolemn vow

2788
03:15:22.970 --> 03:15:26.100
To do a murderous deed, torob a man,

2789
03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:28.970
To force a spotlessvirgin's chastity,

2790
03:15:28.970 --> 03:15:31.070
To reave the orphan of hispatrimony,

2791
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:34.430
To wring the widow fromher custom'd right,

2792
03:15:34.430 --> 03:15:36.770
And have no other reasonfor this wrong

2793
03:15:36.770 --> 03:15:39.970
But that he was bound by asolemn oath?

2794
03:15:39.970 --> 03:15:47.100
A subtle traitor needs nosophister.

2795
03:15:47.100 --> 03:15:48.600
Call Buckingham, and bidhim arm himself.

2796
03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:55.100
Call Buckingham, and allthe friends thou hast,

2797
03:15:55.100 --> 03:16:01.830
Both thou and they shall cursethis fatal hour.

2798
03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:06.670
I am resolved for death ordignity.

2799
03:16:06.670 --> 03:16:10.770
The first I warrant thee,if dreams prove true.

2800
03:16:10.770 --> 03:16:13.570
You were best to go to bedand dream again,

2801
03:16:13.570 --> 03:16:16.970
To keep thee from thetempest of the field.

2802
03:16:16.970 --> 03:16:20.330
I am resolved to bear agreater storm

2803
03:16:20.330 --> 03:16:22.730
Than any thou canstconjure up to-day;

2804
03:16:22.730 --> 03:16:26.330
And so to arms, victoriousfather,

2805
03:16:26.330 --> 03:16:28.730
To quell the rebels andtheir complices.

2806
03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:32.000
Fie! charity, for shame!speak not in spite,

2807
03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.500
For you shall sup withJesu Christ to-night.

2808
03:16:34.500 --> 03:16:37.400
Foul stigmatic, that'smore than thou canst tell.

2809
03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:40.630
If not in heaven, you'llsurely sup in hell.

2810
03:16:41.900 --> 03:16:46.230
(drums sounding)

2811
03:16:54.330 --> 03:16:59.030
Clifford of Cumberland,'tis Warwick calls:

2812
03:16:59.030 --> 03:17:02.200
And if thou dost not hidethee from the bear,

2813
03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:05.530
Now, when the angrytrumpet sounds alarum

2814
03:17:05.530 --> 03:17:10.500
And dead men's cries dofill the empty air,

2815
03:17:10.500 --> 03:17:14.730
Clifford, I say, comeforth and fight with me:

2816
03:17:15.930 --> 03:17:20.800
Proud northern lord,Clifford of Cumberland,

2817
03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:24.800
Warwick is hoarse withcalling thee to arms.

2818
03:17:31.870 --> 03:17:36.800
Of one or both of us thetime is come.

2819
03:17:36.800 --> 03:17:42.100
Hold, Warwick, seek theeout some other chase,

2820
03:17:42.100 --> 03:17:45.370
For I myself must huntthis deer to death.

2821
03:17:45.370 --> 03:17:49.830
Then, nobly, York; 'tisfor a crown thou fight'st.

2822
03:17:50.970 --> 03:17:53.970
As I intend, Clifford, tothrive to-day,

2823
03:17:53.970 --> 03:17:58.870
It grieves my soul toleave thee unassail'd.

2824
03:18:03.270 --> 03:18:06.800
What seest thou in me,York? why dost thou pause?

2825
03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:09.130
With thy brave bearingshould I be in love,

2826
03:18:09.130 --> 03:18:11.600
But that thou art so fastmine enemy.

2827
03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:15.300
Nor should thy prowesswant praise and esteem,

2828
03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:19.370
But that 'tis shownignobly and in treason.

2829
03:18:19.370 --> 03:18:21.970
So let it help me nowagainst thy sword

2830
03:18:21.970 --> 03:18:25.330
As I in justice and trueright express it.

2831
03:18:25.330 --> 03:18:30.370
My soul and body on theaction both!

2832
03:18:30.370 --> 03:18:34.400
A dreadful lay! Addressthee instantly.

2833
03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:37.200
The end crowns all.

2834
03:20:46.930 --> 03:20:55.430
Thus war hath given theepeace, for thou art still.

2835
03:20:55.430 --> 03:20:59.930
Peace with his soul,heaven, if it be thy will!

2836
03:21:02.430 --> 03:21:05.830
(battle cries)

2837
03:21:06.970 --> 03:21:11.070
Shame and confusion! allis on the rout;

2838
03:21:11.070 --> 03:21:14.070
Fear frames disorder, anddisorder wounds

2839
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:18.230
Where it should guard. Owar, thou son of hell,

2840
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:21.830
Whom angry heavens do maketheir minister

2841
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:24.200
Throw in the frozen bosomsof our part

2842
03:21:24.200 --> 03:21:28.100
Hot coals of vengeance!

2843
03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:35.670
Let no soldier fly. He thatis truly dedicate to war

2844
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:38.630
Hath no self-love, nor hethat loves himself

2845
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:40.870
Hath not essentially butby circumstance

2846
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:45.730
The name of valour.

2847
03:21:54.900 --> 03:21:57.070
O, let the vile world end,

2848
03:21:57.070 --> 03:21:58.830
And the premised flames ofthe last day

2849
03:21:58.830 --> 03:22:02.600
Knit earth and heaventogether!

2850
03:22:02.600 --> 03:22:05.370
Now let the generaltrumpet blow his blast,

2851
03:22:05.370 --> 03:22:07.370
Particularities and pettysounds

2852
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:09.030
To cease!

2853
03:22:18.130 --> 03:22:21.230
Wast thou ordain'd,dear father,

2854
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:24.100
To lose thy youth inpeace, and to achieve

2855
03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:27.100
The silver livery ofadvised age,

2856
03:22:27.100 --> 03:22:29.800
And, in thy reverence andthy chair-days, thus

2857
03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:37.630
To die in ruffian battle?Even at this sight

2858
03:22:37.630 --> 03:22:42.930
My heart is turn'd tostone: and while 'tis mine,

2859
03:22:42.930 --> 03:22:49.070
It shall be stony. Yorknot our old men spares;

2860
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:55.600
No more will I theirbabes: tears virginal

2861
03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:59.970
Shall be to me even as thedew to fire,

2862
03:22:59.970 --> 03:23:04.500
And beauty that the tyrantoft reclaims

2863
03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:09.630
Shall to my flaming wrathbe oil and flax.

2864
03:23:09.630 --> 03:23:14.200
Henceforth I will not haveto do with pity:

2865
03:23:14.200 --> 03:23:15.970
Meet I an infant of thehouse of York,

2866
03:23:15.970 --> 03:23:18.500
Into as many gobbets willI cut it

2867
03:23:18.500 --> 03:23:22.930
As wild Medea youngAbsyrtus did:

2868
03:23:22.930 --> 03:23:27.830
In cruelty will I seek outmy fame.

2869
03:23:31.230 --> 03:23:37.830
Come, thou new ruin of oldClifford's house:

2870
03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:44.830
As did AEneas old Anchisesbear,

2871
03:23:44.830 --> 03:23:50.100
So bear I thee upon mymanly shoulders;

2872
03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:59.770
But then AEneas bare aliving load,

2873
03:23:59.770 --> 03:24:03.000
Nothing so heavy as thesewoes of mine.

2874
03:24:56.900 --> 03:25:00.230
So, lie thou there;

2875
03:25:03.100 --> 03:25:05.670
For underneath analehouse' paltry sign,

2876
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:09.000
The Castle in SaintAlban's, Somerset

2877
03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:12.070
Hath made the wizardfamous in his death.

2878
03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:17.030
Sword, hold thy temper;heart, be wrathful still:

2879
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:21.100
Priests pray for enemies,but princes kill.

2880
03:26:00.930 --> 03:26:08.330
Away, my lord! you areslow; for shame, away!

2881
03:26:08.330 --> 03:26:12.900
Can we outrun the heavens?good Margaret, stay.

2882
03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:17.500
What are you made of?you'll nor fight nor fly:

2883
03:26:17.500 --> 03:26:20.230
Now is it manhood, wisdomand defence,

2884
03:26:20.230 --> 03:26:22.930
To give the enemy way, andto secure us

2885
03:26:22.930 --> 03:26:27.570
By what we can, which canno more but fly.

2886
03:26:27.570 --> 03:26:30.170
If you be ta'en, we thenshould see the bottom

2887
03:26:30.170 --> 03:26:32.970
Of all our fortunes: butif we haply scape,

2888
03:26:32.970 --> 03:26:35.730
As well we may, if notthrough your neglect,

2889
03:26:35.730 --> 03:26:38.900
We shall to London get,where you are loved

2890
03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:41.900
And where this breach nowin our fortunes made

2891
03:26:41.900 --> 03:26:43.530
May readily be stopp'd.

2892
03:26:43.530 --> 03:26:45.530
But that my heart's onfuture mischief set,

2893
03:26:45.530 --> 03:26:48.200
I would speak blasphemyere bid you fly:

2894
03:26:48.200 --> 03:26:50.800
But fly you must;uncurable discomfit

2895
03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:54.030
Reigns in the hearts ofall our present parts.

2896
03:26:54.030 --> 03:26:55.730
Away, for your relief! andwe will live

2897
03:26:55.730 --> 03:26:58.530
To see their day and themour fortune give:

2898
03:26:58.530 --> 03:27:01.400
Away, my lord, away!

2899
03:27:31.770 --> 03:27:39.030
Of Salisbury, who canreport of him,

2900
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:41.630
That winter lion, who inrage forgets

2901
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:46.500
Aged contusions and allbrush of time,

2902
03:27:46.500 --> 03:27:48.770
And, like a gallant in thebrow of youth,

2903
03:27:48.770 --> 03:27:52.770
Repairs him with occasion?This happy day

2904
03:27:52.770 --> 03:27:55.470
Is not itself, nor have wewon one foot,

2905
03:27:55.470 --> 03:27:58.730
If Salisbury be lost.

2906
03:27:58.730 --> 03:27:59.800
My noble father,

2907
03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:02.370
Three times to-day I holphim to his horse,

2908
03:28:02.370 --> 03:28:05.500
Three times bestrid him;thrice I led him off,

2909
03:28:05.500 --> 03:28:07.400
Persuaded him from anyfurther act:

2910
03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:10.830
But still, where dangerwas, still there I met him;

2911
03:28:10.830 --> 03:28:13.370
And like rich hangings ina homely house,

2912
03:28:13.370 --> 03:28:15.700
So was his will in his oldfeeble body.

2913
03:28:16.470 --> 03:28:18.530
(drums sound)

2914
03:28:19.230 --> 03:28:23.930
But, noble as he is, lookwhere he comes.

2915
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:39.200
Now, by my sword, wellhast thou fought to-day;

2916
03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:46.600
By the mass, so did weall. I thank you, Richard:

2917
03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:50.170
God knows how long it is Ihave to live;

2918
03:28:50.170 --> 03:28:53.330
And it hath pleased himthat three times to-day

2919
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:57.500
You have defended me fromimminent death.

2920
03:28:57.500 --> 03:29:03.830
Well, lords, we have notgot that which we have:

2921
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:06.570
'Tis not enough our foesare this time fled,

2922
03:29:06.570 --> 03:29:10.630
Being opposites of suchrepairing nature.

2923
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:13.870
I know our safety is tofollow them;

2924
03:29:13.870 --> 03:29:17.570
For, as I hear, the kingis fled to London,

2925
03:29:17.570 --> 03:29:20.870
To call a present court ofparliament.

2926
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:24.230
Let us pursue him ere thewrits go forth.

2927
03:29:24.230 --> 03:29:27.030
What says Lord Warwick?shall we after them?

2928
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:33.930
After them! nay, beforethem, if we can.

2929
03:29:33.930 --> 03:29:39.800
Now, by my faith, lords,'twas a glorious day:

2930
03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:45.030
Saint Alban's battle wonby famous York

2931
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:49.570
Shall be eternized in allage to come.

2932
03:29:49.570 --> 03:29:54.700
Sound drums and trumpets,and to London all:

2933
03:29:54.700 --> 03:29:58.330
And more such days asthese to us befall!

2934
03:29:58.330 --> 03:30:01.500
(drums sound)

2935
03:33:08.470 --> 03:33:11.470
