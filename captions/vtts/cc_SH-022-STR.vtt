00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:07.870


2
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:21.670
(Bugles blaring, drums beating)

3
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.470
As by your high imperial majesty

4
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.630
I had in charge at my depart for France,

5
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.700
As procurator to your excellence,

6
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.330
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,

7
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.600
So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,

8
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.070
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,

9
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.830
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,

10
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.300
Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,

11
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.470
I have perform'd my task and was espoused:

12
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.130
And humbly now upon my bended knee,

13
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.270
In sight of England and her lordly peers,

14
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.170
Deliver up my title in the queen

15
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.200
To your most gracious hands,

16
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.470
that are the substance

17
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.270
Of that great shadow I did represent;

18
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.430
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,

19
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.900
The fairest queen that ever king received. Suffolk, arise.

20
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.430
Welcome, Queen Margaret:

21
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.370
I can express no kinder sign of love

22
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.830
Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,

23
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.070
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!

24
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.630
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face

25
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.670
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,

26
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.170
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.

27
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.600
Great King of England and my gracious lord,

28
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.430
The mutual conference that my mind hath had,

29
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.070
By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,

30
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.630
In courtly company or at my beads,

31
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.170
With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,

32
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.130
Makes me the bolder to salute my king

33
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.670
With ruder terms, such as my wit affords

34
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.970
And over-joy of heart doth minister.

35
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.000
Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,

36
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.500
Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,

37
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.930
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;

38
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.070
Such is the fulness of my heart's content.

39
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.570
Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.

40
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.600
Long live Queen Margaret, England's happiness!

41
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.300
We thank you all.

42
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.200
My lord protector, so it please your grace,

43
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.100
Here are the articles of contracted peace

44
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.770
between our sovereign and the French king Charles,

45
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.900
For eighteen months concluded by consent.

46
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.600
'Imprimis, it is agreed

47
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.730
between the French king Charles,

48
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.570
and William de la Pole, Marquess of Suffolk,

49
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.670
ambassador for Henry King of England,

50
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.870
that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,

51
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.230
daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and Jerusalem,

52

and crown her Queen of England

53

Item, that is further agreed that the duchy of Anjou

55

and the county of Maine shall be released

56
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.170
and delivered to the king her father'--

57
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.070
Uncle, how now!

58
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.600
Pardon me, gracious lord;

59
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.330
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart

60
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.170
And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no more.

61
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:54.970
Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.

62
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.100
'Item, It is further agreed between them,

63
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.000
that the duchies of Anjou and the county of Maine

64

shall be released and delivered to the king her father,

65
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.400
and she sent over

66
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.330
of the King of England's own proper cost and charges,

67
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.270
without having any dowry.'

68
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:31.430
They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:

69
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.170
We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,

70
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.100
And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,

71
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.300
We here discharge your grace

72
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.300
from being regent I' the parts of France,

73
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.600
till term of eighteen months be full expired.

74
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.830
Thanks, uncle Winchester,

75
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.730
Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,

76
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.930
Salisbury, and Warwick;

77
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.300
We thank you all for the great favour done,

78
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.870
In entertainment to my princely queen.

79
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.400
Come, let us in, and with all speed

80
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.670
provide to see her coronation be perform'd.

81
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.900
(Bugle blaring)

82
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:12.530
Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,

83
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.130
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,

84
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.800
Your grief, the common grief of all the land.

85
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.230
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,

86
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.430
His valour, coin and people, in the wars?

87
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.170
Did he so often lodge in open field,

88
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.030
In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,

89
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.830
To conquer France, his true inheritance?

90
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.800
Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,

91
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.230
Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,

92
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.600
Received deep scars in France and Normandy?

93
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.200
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,

94
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.370
With all the learned council of the realm,

95
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.070
Studied so long,

96
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.070
sat in the council-house Early and late, debating to and fro

97
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.230
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,

98
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:11.030
And shall these labours and these honours die?

99
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:16.370
O peers of England, shameful is this league!

100
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.300
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,

101
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.970
Blotting your names from books of memory,

102
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.700
Razing the characters of your renown,

103
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:32.400
Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,

104
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.170
Undoing all, as all had never been!

105
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.830
Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,

106
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.300
This peroration with such circumstance?

107
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:51.370
For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.

108
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.630
Ay, we will keep it, if we can;

109
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.700
But now it is impossible we should:

110
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.630
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,

111
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.700
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine

112
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.000
Unto the poor King Reignier,

113
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.730
whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.

114
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.500
By the death of Him that died for all,

115
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.870
These counties were the keys of Normandy.

116
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.030
(Crying)

117
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.000
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?

118
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.500
For grief that they are past recovery:

119
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.270
For, were there hope to conquer them again,

120
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:41.300
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.

121
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.470
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;

122
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:51.370
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:

123
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.170
And are the cities, that I got with wounds,

124
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.170
Delivered up again with peaceful words?

125
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.270
Mort Dieu!

126
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.000
For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,

127
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.200
That dims the honour of this warlike isle!

128
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.770
France should have torn and rent my very heart,

129
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.330
Before I would have yielded to this league.

130
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.400
I never read but England's kings

131
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.470
have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:

132
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.170
And our King Henry gives away his own,

133
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.670
To match with her that brings no vantages.

134
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.600
She should have stayed in France and starved

135
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.330
in France.

136
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.270
My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:

137
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.070
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.

138
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.300
My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;

139
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.170
'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,

140
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.870
But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.

141
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.700
Rancour will out: proud prelate,

142
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.370
in thy face I see thy fury: if I longer stay,

143
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.770
We shall begin our ancient bickerings.

144
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:04.570
Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,

145
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:10.330
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.

146
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:18.300
So, there goes our protector in a rage.

147
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.870
'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,

148
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.100
Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,

149
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.400
And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.

150
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.300
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,

151
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.800
And heir apparent to the English crown:

152
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.230
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,

153
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.230
With all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,

154
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.930
There's reason he should be displeased at it.

155
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.000
Look to it, lords!

156
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.470
let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts;

157
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.470
be wise and circumspect.

158
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.230
What though the common people favour him,

159
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.330
Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,'

160
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.870
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,

161
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.870
'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'

162
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.870
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'

163
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.800
I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,

164
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.030
He will be found a dangerous protector.

165
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:20.030
Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,

166
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:25.600
He being of age to govern of himself?

167
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.230
Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,

168
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.170
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,

169
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:38.030
We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.

170
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.600
This weighty business will not brook delay:

171
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.000
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.

172
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.370
Cousin of Buckingham,

173
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.370
though Humphrey's pride

174
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.870
and greatness of his place be grief to us,

175
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.530
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:

176
00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.970
His insolence is more intolerable

177
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.330
Than all the princes in the land beside:

178
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.900
If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.

179
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.100
Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,

180
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.300
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.

181
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.530
Pride went before, ambition follows him.

182
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.070
While these do labour for their own preferment,

183
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.070
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.

184
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.730
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester

185
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.430
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.

186
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.000
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,

187
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.730
More like a soldier than a man o' the church,

188
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.270
As stout and proud as he were lord of all,

189
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.100
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself

190
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.370
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.

191
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.130
Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,

192
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.670
Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,

193
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.670
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,

194
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.800
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:

195
00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.000
And, cousin York, thy acts in Ireland,

196
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.830
In bringing them to civil discipline,

197
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.330
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,

198
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.800
When thou wert regent for our sovereign,

199
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.430
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:

200
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.430
The reverence of mine age and Nevelle's name

201
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.030
is of no little force if I command.

202
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.970
Join we together, for the public good,

203
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.730
In what we can, to bridle and suppress

204
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.600
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,

205
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.930
With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;

206
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.570
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,

207
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.070
While they do tend the profit of the land.

208
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.370
So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,

209
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.530
And common profit of his country!

210
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:52.600
And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.

211
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.900
Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.

212
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.300
Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;

213
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.370
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,

214
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.200
And would have kept so long as breath did last!

215
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.170
Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,

216
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:17.000
Which I will win from France, or else be slain,

217
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.570
Anjou and Maine are given to the French;

218
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.830
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy

219
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.730
Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:

220
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.930
Suffolk concluded on the articles,

221
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:42.430
The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased to change

222
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:49.930
two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.

223
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:56.200
I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?

224
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.900
'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.

225
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.470
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage

226
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.170
And purchase friends and give to courtezans,

227
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.130
Still revelling like lords till all be gone;

228
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:21.400
While as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them

229
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.800
and wrings his hapless hands

230
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.000
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,

231
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.300
While all is shared and all is borne away,

232
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.330
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:

233
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.600
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,

234
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:45.270
While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.

235
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:50.430
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!

236
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.870
Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,

237
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.630
Even as I have of fertile England's soil.

238
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.570
A day will come when York shall claim his own;

239
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:12.200
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts

240
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.230
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,

241
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.630
And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,

242
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.330
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:

243
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:28.030
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,

244
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.030
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,

245
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.900
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,

246
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.200
Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.

247
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:44.570
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:

248
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:49.500
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,

249
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500
To pry into the secrets of the state;

250
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.700
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,

251
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.830
With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,

252
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.700
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:

253
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:13.670
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,

254
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.670
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;

255
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.000
And in my standard, bear the arms of York

256
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.300
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;

257
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.230
And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,

258
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.800
Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.

259
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.700
Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,

260
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.470
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?

261
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.430
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,

262
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.370
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?

263
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.300
What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,

264
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.700
Enchased with all the honours of the world?

265
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.230
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,

266
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.070
Until thy head be circled with the same.

267
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:15.570
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.

268
00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:19.870
What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:

269
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.930
And, having both together heaved it up,

270
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:24.170
We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,

271
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.430
And never more abase our sight so low

272
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:30.230
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.

273
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.900
O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,

274
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.730
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.

275
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.870
And may that hour, when I imagine ill against my king

276
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.900
and nephew, virtuous Henry,

277
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:50.600
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!

278
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.670
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.

279
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.600
What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it

280
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.470
with sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.

281
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:08.470
Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,

282
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.030
Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,

283
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.530
But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;

284
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.570
And on the pieces of the broken wand

285
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:24.600
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,

286
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.130
And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.

287
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:35.870
This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.

288
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.370
Tut, this was nothing but an argument

289
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.600
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove

290
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.530
Shall lose his head for his presumption.

291
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:49.770
But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:

292
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.370
Methought I sat in seat of majesty

293
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.430
In the cathedral church of Westminster,

294
00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:00.200
And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;

295
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.500
Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me

296
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.600
And on my head did set the diadem.

297
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.830
Art thou not second woman in the realm,

298
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:15.830
And the protector's wife, beloved of him?

299
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.930
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,

300
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.900
Above the reach or compass of thy thought?

301
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.170
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,

302
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.700
To tumble down thy husband and thyself

303
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.100
From top of honour to disgrace's feet?

304
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.170
Away from me, and let me hear no more!

305
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.400
What, what, my lord! are you so choleric with Eleanor,

306
00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.000
for telling but her dream?

307
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.500
Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,

308
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.330
And not be cheque'd.

309
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:50.530
Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.

310
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.600
My lord protector,

311
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.400
'tis his highness' pleasure you do prepare

312
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.130
to ride unto Saint Alban's,

313
00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.130
Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.

314
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:10.600
I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?

315
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:14.270
Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.

316
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.730
Follow I must; I cannot go before,

317
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.870
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.

318
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:34.830
Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,

319
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.600
I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks

320
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.230
And smooth my way upon their headless necks;

321
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.870
And, being a woman, I will not be slack

322
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:49.530
To play my part in Fortune's pageant.

323
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:55.570
Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,

324
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.700
We are alone; here's none but thee and I.

325
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.400
Jesus preserve your royal majesty!

326
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.070
What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.

327
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.500
But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,

328
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.570
Your grace's titles shall be multiplied.

329
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.730
What say'st thou, man?

330
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.300
hast thou as yet conferr'd With Margery Jourdain,

331
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.670
the witch of I, With Bolingbroke,

332
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.130
the cunning conjurer? And will they undertake to do me good?

333
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.630
This they have promised me, to show your highness

334
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:40.300
A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,

335
00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.870
That shall make answer to such questions

336
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.900
As by your grace shall be propounded him.

337
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:50.670
It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:

338
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.730
When from St. Alban's we do make return,

339
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.630
We'll see these things effected to the full.

340
00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.770
Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,

341
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.870
With thy confederates in this weighty cause.

342
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.170
Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;

343
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.100
(Laughing)

344
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.830
Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!

345
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.370
Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:

346
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.600
The business asketh silent secrecy.

347
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.900
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:

348
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.330
Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.

349
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.670
Yet have I gold flies from another coast;

350
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.770
I dare not say, from the rich cardinal

351
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.800
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,

352
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.270
Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,

353
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.900
They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,

354
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.170
Have hired me to undermine the duchess

355
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.170
And buz these conjurations in her brain.

356
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.230
They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'

357
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.130
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.

358
00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.870
Hume, if you take not heed,

359
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.130
you shall go near to call them both

360
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.930
a pair of crafty knaves.

361
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:22.000
Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear,

362
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.930
at last Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,

363
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.770
And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:

364
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:38.130
Sort how it will, I will have gold for all.

365
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.400
(Laughing)

366
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.530
My masters, let's stand close:

367
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.630
my lord protector will come this way by and by,

368
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.500
and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.

369
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.930
Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!

370
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:11.130
Jesu bless him!

371
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:16.400
Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.

372
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.570
I'll be the first, sure.

373
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.070
Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk,

374
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.130
and not my lord protector.

375
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.270
How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?

376
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.230
Pardon me my lord; I took ye for my lord protector.

377
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:31.930
'To my Lord Protector!' Are your supplications to his lordship?

378
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:32.700
Let me see them:

379
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.970
what is thine?

380
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.970
Pardon me maam. Mine is, an't please your grace,

381
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.570
against John Goodman, my lord cardinal's man,

382
00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.000
for keeping my house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.

383
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.230
Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed.

384
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:55.230
What's yours? What's here!

385
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.400
'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the

386
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.930
commons of Long Melford.' How now, sir knave!

387
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.000
Alas, sir,

388
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.170
I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.

389
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.230
Against my master, Thomas Horner,

390
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.370
for saying that the Duke of York was rightful

391
00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.800
heir to the crown.

392
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.700
What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was rightful

393
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.570
heir to the crown?

394
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.070
That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said

395
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:30.200
that he was, and that the king was an userer.

396
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.830
A usurper, thou would'st say.

397
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.000
Ay usurper user

398
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.800
Who is there?

399
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.930
Take this fellow in,

400
00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:44.200
and send for his master with a presently: we'll hear

401
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.270
more of your matter before the King.

402
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.970
And as for you, that love to be protected

403
00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.300
Under the wings of our protector's grace,

404
00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.600
Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.

405
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.170
Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let him go.

406
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.870
Come, let's be gone.

407
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:19.830
My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,

408
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.400
Is this the fashion in the court of England?

409
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.170
Is this the government of Britain's isle,

410
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.070
And this the royalty of Albion's king?

411
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.500
What shall King Henry be a pupil still

412
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.830
Under the surly Gloucester's governance?

413
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.600
Am I a queen in title and in style,

414
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.700
And must be made a subject to a duke?

415
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.800
I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours

416
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.030
Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love

417
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:51.170
And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,

418
00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.870
I thought King Henry had resembled thee in courage,

419
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:59.570
courtship and proportion:

420
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.700
But all his mind is bent to holiness,

421
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.500
To number Ave-Maries on his beads;

422
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.400
His champions are the prophets and apostles,

423
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.500
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,

424
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.700
His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves

425
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.170
Are brazen images of canonized saints.

426
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.500
I would the college of the cardinals

427
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.300
Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,

428
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.070
And set the triple crown upon his head:

429
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.800
That were a state fit for his holiness.

430
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.770
Madam, be patient: as I was cause

431
00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.100
Your highness came to England,

432
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.070
so will I In England work your grace's full content.

433
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:37.130
Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,

434
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:42.670
The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,

435
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.530
And grumbling York: and not the least of these

436
00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.070
But can do more in England than the king.

437
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.570
And he of these that can do most of all

438
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.730
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:

439
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.870
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.

440
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.100
Not all these lords do vex me half so much

441
00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:02.500
As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.

442
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.330
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,

443
00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.800
More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:

444
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.170
Strangers in court do take her for the queen:

445
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.370
She bears a duke's revenues on her back,

446
00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.530
And in her heart she scorns our poverty:

447
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.330
Shall I not live to be avenged on her?

448
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.600
Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,

449
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.530
She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,

450
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.200
The very train of her worst wearing gown

451
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.970
Was better worth than all my father's lands,

452
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:45.370
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.

453
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:48.470
Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,

454
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.930
And placed a quire of such enticing birds,

455
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.230
That she will light to listen to the lays,

456
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:58.230
And never mount to trouble you again.

457
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.000
So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;

458
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.470
For I am bold to counsel you in this.

459
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.630
Although we fancy not the cardinal,

460
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.570
Yet must we join with him and with the lords,

461
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.870
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.

462
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.770
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint

463
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.030
Will make but little for his benefit.

464
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:25.700
So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,

465
00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:28.670
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

466
00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.930
For my part, noble lords, I care not which;

467
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.530
Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.

468
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.370
(Bugles play)

469
00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.130
If York have ill demean'd himself in France,

470
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.430
Then let him be denay'd the regentship.

471
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:43.870
If Somerset be unworthy of the place,

472
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.030
Let York be regent; I will yield to him.

473
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.770
Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,

474
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:49.770
Dispute not that: York is the worthier.

475
00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.400
Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.

476
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.600
The cardinal's not my better in the field.

477
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.970
All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.

478
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.730
Warwick may live to be the best of all.

479
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.870
Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,

480
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.570
Why Somerset should be preferred in this.

481
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:07.700
Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.

482
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.170
Madam, the king is old enough himself to give his censure:

483
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.700
these are no women's matters.

484
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.270
If he be old enough, what needs your grace

485
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.570
To be protector of his excellence?

486
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.130
Madam, I am protector of the realm;

487
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.730
And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.

488
00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:30.000
Resign it then and leave thine insolence.

489
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.230
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--

490
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:35.930
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;

491
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.070
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;

492
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.170
And all the peers and nobles of the realm

493
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.170
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.

494
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.970
The commons hast thou rack'd;

495
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.170
the clergy's bags Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

496
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.830
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire

497
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.300
Have cost a mass of public treasury.

498
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.330
Thy cruelty in execution

499
00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.400
Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,

500
00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.930
And left thee to the mercy of the law.

501
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.930
They sale of offices and towns in France,

502
00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.030
If they were known, as the suspect is great,

503
00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.470
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.

504
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:17.400
Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?

505
00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.070
I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?

506
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:25.630
Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:

507
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.670
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,

508
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:29.900
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.

509
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.070
Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.

510
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.200
Against her will! good king, look to't in time;

511
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.330
She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:

512
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.870
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,

513
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.600
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.

514
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.470
Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,

515
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.430
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:

516
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:57.530
She's tickled now; her fury needs no spurs,

517
00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:01.870
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.

518
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:07.570
Now, lords, my choler being over-blown

519
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.470
With walking once about the quadrangle,

520
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.470
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.

521
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:17.170
As for your spiteful false objections,

522
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.830
Prove them, and I lie open to the law:

523
00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.930
But God in mercy so deal with my soul,

524
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.500
As I in duty love my king and country!

525
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.000
But, to the matter that we have in hand:

526
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.070
I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man

527
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.230
To be your regent in the realm of France.

528
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.530
Before we make election,

529
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.870
give me leave to show some reason, of no little force,

530
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:45.170
That York is most unmeet of any man.

531
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.730
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:

532
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.070
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;

533
00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.130
Next, if I be appointed for the place,

534
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.830
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,

535
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.330
Without discharge, money, or furniture,

536
00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:07.500
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:

537
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.870
Last time, I danced attendance on his will

538
00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.830
Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.

539
00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:15.830
That can I witness; and a fouler fact

540
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.470
Did never traitor in the land commit.

541
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.500
Peace, headstrong Warwick!

542
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.170
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?

543
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.000
Because here is a man accused of treason:

544
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.470
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!

545
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:33.330
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?

546
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.570
What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?

547
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.330
Please it your majesty, this is the man

548
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.630
That doth accuse his master of high treason:

549
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.600
His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,

550
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.670
Was rightful heir unto the English crown

551
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.100
And that your majesty was a usurper.

552
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.530
Say, man, were these thy words?

553
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.330
An't shall please your majesty,

554
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.470
I never said nor thought any such matter:

555
00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.430
God is my witness, I am falsely accused by the villain.

556
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.630
By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to me

557
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.570
in the garret one night, as we were scouring my

558
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.830
Lord of York's armour.

559
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.570
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,

560
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.330
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.

561
00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.900
I do beseech your royal majesty,

562
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.800
Let him have all the rigor of the law.

563
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.370
Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.

564
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:22.230
My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct

565
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.800
him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees

566
00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:29.830
he would be even with me: I have good witness of this:

567
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.670
therefore I beseech your majesty,

568
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:38.670
do not cast away an honest man for a villain's accusation.

569
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.970
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?

570
00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:56.970
This doom, my lord, if I may judge my case:

571
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:00.100
Let Somerset be regent over the French,

572
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.400
Because in York this breeds suspicion:

573
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.670
And let these have a day appointed them

574
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.270
For single combat in convenient place,

575
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.770
For he hath witness of his servant's malice:

576
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:16.130
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.

577
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.770
I humbly thank your royal majesty.

578
00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.930
And I accept the combat willingly.

579
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:27.670
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity my case.

580
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.800
The spite of man prevaileth against me.

581
00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.600
O Lord, have mercy upon me!

582
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.200
I shall never be able to fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!

583
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.730
Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.

584
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.570
Away with them to prison; and the day of combat

585
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:45.570
shall be the last of the next month.

586
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.700
Come, Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.

587
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:25.570
(Cymbals clanging)

588
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.430
Come master Bolingbroke; the duchess, I tell you,

589
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:36.830
expects performance of your promises.

590
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.100
Master Hume, we are therefore provided:

591
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.070
will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?

592
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.200
Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.

593
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.270
I have heard her reported to be

594
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:50.100
a woman of an exceptional spirit:

595
00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:50.970
but it shall be convenient,

596
00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:53.670
Master Hume, that you be by her aloft,

597
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.670
while we be busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,

598
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:58.700
and leave us.

599
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.600
Mother Jourdain,

600
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:07.930
be you prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,

601
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:13.830
read you; and let us to our work.

602
00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.370
Well said, my masters;

603
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.200
To this gear the sooner the better.

604
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.030
Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:

605
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.600
(drumming)

606
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:41.530
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,

607
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.370
The time of night when Troy was set on fire;

608
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.970
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,

609
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:56.030
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,

610
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:59.970
That time best fits the work we have in hand.

611
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:04.430
Madam, stay you and fear not: whom we raise,

612
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:08.230
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.

613
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:20.630
(chanting magic spell)

614
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:41.600
(chanting magic spell)

615
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:55.130
Adsum,

616
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.230
Asmath,

617
00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.430
By the eternal God, whose name and power

618
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:05.170
Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;

619
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.730
For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.

620
00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:17.370
Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!

621
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:23.530
'First of the king: what shall of him become?'

622
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:30.800
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;

623
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.870
Yet him outlive, and die a violent death.

624
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:44.930
Tell me 'What fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?'

625
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:50.270
By water shall he die, and take his end.

626
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:55.200
'What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?'

627
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.500
Let him shun castles;

628
00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.830
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains

629
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:05.970
Than where castles mounted stand.

630
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:11.930
Have done, for more I hardly can endure.

631
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:17.470
Descend to darkness and the burning lake!

632
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:21.470
False fiend, avoid!

633
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:31.500
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.

634
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:36.530
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.

635
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:42.870
Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.

636
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:47.670
What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal

637
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.930
Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:

638
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.530
My lord protector will, I doubt it not,

639
00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.870
See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.

640
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:58.900
Not half so bad as thine to England's king,

641
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.130
Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.

642
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:13.730
True, madam, none at all: what call you this?

643
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:15.600
Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.

644
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.770
And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.

645
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:21.030
take her to thee.

646
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:24.630
We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.

647
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.470
All, away!

648
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.170
Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:

649
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:51.170
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!

650
00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.930
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.

651
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.070
What have we here?

652
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.070
'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;

653
00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:17.070
But him outlive, and die a violent death.'

654
00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:27.730
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?

655
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:31.800
By water shall he die, and take his end.

656
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:38.070
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?

657
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.500
Let him shun castles;

658
00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:46.200
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains

659
00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.600
Than where castles mounted stand.'

660
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.730
(Laughing) Come, come, my lords;

661
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.930
These oracles are hardly attain'd,

662
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:01.930
And hardly understood.

663
00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.570
The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,

664
00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.330
With him the husband of this lovely lady:

665
00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:13.400
Thither go these news, as fast as horse can carry them:

666
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:16.130
A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.

667
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.470
Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,

668
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.230
To be the post, in hope of his reward.

669
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:26.030
At your pleasure, my good lord.

670
00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.700
Within there, ho!

671
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.000
Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick

672
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.470
To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!

673
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:59.100
(cheering and horns)

674
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.630
Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,

675
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.500
I saw not better sport these seven years' day:

676
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.400
But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,

677
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.700
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!

678
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.270
To see how God in all his creatures works!

679
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.470
Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.

680
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.830
No marvel, an it like your majesty,

681
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:22.170
My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;

682
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:24.100
They know their master loves to be aloft,

683
00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.170
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.

684
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.030
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind

685
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.070
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.

686
00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:37.970
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.

687
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:40.000
Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?

688
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.600
Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?

689
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.600
The treasury of everlasting joy.

690
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.300
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts

691
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.130
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;

692
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:54.970
Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,

693
00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.630
That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!

694
00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:02.370
Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, can you do it?

695
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:05.600
To hide such malice with such holiness?

696
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.070
No malice, sir; no more than well becomes

697
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:13.800
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

698
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.630
As who, my lord?

699
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.300
Why, as yourself, my lord,

700
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.600
An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.

701
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.770
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.

702
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.030
And thy ambition, Gloucester.

703
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.970
I prithee, peace, good queen,

704
00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.530
And whet not on these furious peers;

705
00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.900
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.

706
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.770
Let me be blessed for the peace I make,

707
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:39.170
Against this proud protector, with my sword!

708
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.230
Faith, holy uncle,

709
00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.500
would 'twere come to that!

710
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.370
Marry, when thou darest.

711
00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.330
Dare? Until thee priest,

712
00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:50.600
plantagenets could never brook the dare.

713
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.730
I am plantagenet as well as thou.

714
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.200
And son to John of Gaunt.

715
00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.400
In bastardy.

716
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.630
I scorn thy words.

717
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.600
Make up no factious numbers for the matter;

718
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.200
In thine own person answer thy abuse.

719
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.230
Ay, where thou darest not peep:

720
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.530
an if thou darest,

721
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.030
This evening, on the east side of the grove.

722
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.800
How now, my lords!

723
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.800
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,

724
00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.200
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,

725
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.730
We had had more sport.

726
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.730
Come with thy two-hand sword.

727
00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.170
True, uncle.

728
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.500
Are ye well advised?

729
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:19.900
The east side of the grove?

730
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.030
I am with you.

731
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:22.900
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!

732
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.600
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.

733
00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.930
Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,

734
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.230
Protector, see to't well, protect thyself.

735
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:35.500
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.

736
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.830
How irksome is this music to my heart!

737
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.100
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?

738
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.400
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.

739
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.600
(commotion in background)

740
00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:56.470
What noise is this?

741
00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:01.800
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?

742
00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.870
A miracle! a miracle!

743
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.370
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.

744
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.500
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,

745
00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.930
Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;

746
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.570
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.

747
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.370
Now, God be praised, that to believing souls

748
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:22.070
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!

749
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.430
(crowd chanting)

750
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.000
Here comes the townsmen on procession,

751
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.530
To present your highness with the man.

752
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.670
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,

753
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.530
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.

754
00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:41.900
(men singing) A miracle! A miracle!

755
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.770
Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;

756
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:55.500
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.

757
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.970
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,

758
00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.270
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.

759
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:05.730
What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?

760
00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:07.170
Born blind, an't please your grace.

761
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.170
Ay, indeed, was he.

762
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:10.230
What woman is this?

763
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.970
His wife, an't like your worship.

764
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:16.630
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told.

765
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.030
Where wert thou born?

766
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:20.900
At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.

767
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.470
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:

768
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:27.170
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,

769
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.570
But still remember what the Lord hath done.

770
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:32.170
Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,

771
00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.330
Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?

772
00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.770
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd

773
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.970
A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,

774
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.570
By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Saunder, come,

775
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.800
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'

776
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.900
Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft

777
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.700
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.

778
00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:53.070
What, art thou lame?

779
00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:55.400
Ay, God Almighty help me!

780
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.870
How camest thou so?

781
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.430
A fall off of a tree.

782
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:02.470
A plum-tree, master.

783
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.570
How long hast thou been blind?

784
00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.170
Born so, master.

785
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.430
What, and wouldst climb a tree?

786
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.130
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.

787
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.870
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.

788
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:18.200
Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst venture so.

789
00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.270
Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,

790
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.800
And made me climb, with danger of my life.

791
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.270
A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.

792
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:38.000
Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:

793
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.530
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.

794
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:43.930
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.

795
00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:49.100
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?

796
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.770
Red, master; red as blood.

797
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:54.870
Why, that's well said. What colour is this gown of?

798
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.670
Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.

799
00:51:57.670 --> 00:52:00.830
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?

800
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:03.000
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.

801
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.270
But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.

802
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.800
Never, before this day, in all his life.

803
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.530
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?

804
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.170
Alas, master, I know not.

805
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.270
What's his name?

806
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.130
I know not.

807
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.170
Nor his?

808
00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.000
No, indeed, master.

809
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.400
What's thine own name?

810
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.230
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.

811
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:29.200
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in Christendom.

812
00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.070
If thou hadst been born blind,

813
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:34.100
thou mightest as well have known all our names as thus to

814
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.230
name the several colours we do wear.

815
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.100
Sight may distinguish of colours,

816
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.270
but suddenly to nominate them all, it is impossible.

817
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:45.700
Saint Alban here hath done a miracle;

818
00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.170
and might ye not think his cunning to be great,

819
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.500
that could restore this cripple to his legs?

820
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.430
O master, that you could!

821
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:53.770
My masters of Saint Alban's,

822
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.900
have you not a beadle in your town, and things called whips?

823
00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.200
Yes, my lord.

824
00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.530
Send for one presently.

825
00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.070
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.

826
00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:06.600
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,

827
00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.670
if you mean to save yourself from whipping,

828
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:13.800
leap me over this stool and run.

829
00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.900
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:

830
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:18.000
You go about to torture me in vain.

831
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.100
Well we must have you find your legs.

832
00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:27.530
Whip him till he leap over that same stool.

833
00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.900
Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet quickly.

834
00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:33.400
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.

835
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:39.130
(Man screams. Crowd chants) A miracle!!

836
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:43.630
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?

837
00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:47.500
It made me laugh to see the villain run.

838
00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:51.400
Follow the knave; and take this drab away.

839
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.300
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.

840
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.730
Let them be whipped through every market-town,

841
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.600
till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.

842
00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.430
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.

843
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:08.670
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.

844
00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:11.200
But you have done more miracles than I;

845
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.770
You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.

846
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:20.470
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?

847
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:22.970
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.

848
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:26.400
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,

849
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:29.430
Under the countenance and confederacy of Lady Eleanor,

850
00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:30.370
the protector's wife,

851
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:33.330
The ringleader and head of all this rout,

852
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:37.130
Have practised dangerously against your state,

853
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.370
Dealing with witches and with conjurers:

854
00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.830
Whom we have apprehended in the fact;

855
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:44.470
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,

856
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:47.930
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,

857
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:50.300
And other of your highness' privy-council;

858
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.270
As more at large your grace shall understand.

859
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.430
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,

860
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:59.230
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!

861
00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:02.300
Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.

862
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:06.800
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.

863
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.800
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,

864
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.700
How I have loved my king and commonweal:

865
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:22.170
And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;

866
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:26.030
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:

867
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:31.300
Noble she is, but if she have forgot

868
00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.800
Honour and virtue and conversed with such

869
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.400
As, like to pitch, defile nobility,

870
00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.930
I banish her my bed and company

871
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:47.000
And give her as a prey to law and shame,

872
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.400
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.

873
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:57.730
Well, for this night we will repose us here:

874
00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:59.230
To-morrow toward London back again,

875
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.670
To look into this business thoroughly

876
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:04.100
And call these foul offenders to their answers

877
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.830
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,

878
00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:11.870
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.

879
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:39.700
Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,

880
00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:43.030
Our simple supper ended, give me leave

881
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:45.930
In this close walk to satisfy myself,

882
00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:48.330
In craving your opinion of my title,

883
00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:53.100
Which is infallible, to England's crown.

884
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.370
My lord, I long to hear it at full.

885
00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:58.800
Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,

886
00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.800
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.

887
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.800
Then thus:

888
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:14.330
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:

889
00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:17.000
The first, the Black Prince died before his father

890
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.870
and left behind him, Richard, his only son.

891
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:24.270
Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;

892
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.770
Till Henry Bolingbroke, The son and heir of John of Gaunt,

893
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.900
the fourth of Edward's sons

894
00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.330
Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,

895
00:57:33.330 --> 00:57:36.000
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,

896
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.130
And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,

897
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:43.630
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.

898
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:47.300
Father, the duke of York hath told the truth:

899
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:49.800
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.

900
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.930
Which now they hold by force and not by right;

901
00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:01.430
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,

902
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:04.730
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.

903
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.500
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.

904
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.500
The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line

905
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:14.670
I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,

906
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:17.630
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:

907
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:20.730
Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;

908
00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.870
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.

909
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:26.330
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,

910
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:28.400
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;

911
00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:36.630
And therefore was kept captive til he died

912
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:38.300
But to the rest.

913
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.730
His eldest sister, Anne,

914
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:43.970
My mother, being heir unto the crown

915
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.800
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge;

916
00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.170
who was son to Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.

917
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:56.070
By her I claim the kingdom:

918
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:59.500
she was heir To Roger Earl of March, who was the son

919
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.770
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,

920
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:06.270
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:

921
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:12.000
So, if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger,

922
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.670
I am king.

923
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:17.470
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?

924
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:19.270
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,

925
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:22.970
The fourth son; York claims it from the third.

926
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:25.930
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:

927
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:28.430
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee

928
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:33.730
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.

929
00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:37.770
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;

930
00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.900
And in this private plot be we the first

931
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.030
That shall salute our rightful sovereign

932
00:59:42.030 --> 00:59:45.700
With honour of his birthright to the crown.

933
00:59:57.330 --> 01:00:01.630
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!

934
01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:09.630
We thank you, lords. But I am not your king

935
01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:13.130
Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd

936
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:15.970
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;

937
01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:19.000
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,

938
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.570
But with advice and silent secrecy.

939
01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.370
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:

940
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.930
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,

941
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:35.470
At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,

942
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.700
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,

943
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:41.770
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,

944
01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.930
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:

945
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:49.570
'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that

946
01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.470
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.

947
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:56.900
My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.

948
01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:00.770
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick

949
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:07.530
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.

950
01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:10.530
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:

951
01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:13.770
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick

952
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:18.970
The greatest man in England but the king.

953
01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:46.270
Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:

954
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:57.970
In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:

955
01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:59.870
Receive the sentence of the law for sins

956
01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:03.400
Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.

957
01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.000
You four, from hence to prison back again;

958
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.330
From thence unto the place of execution:

959
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.430
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,

960
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.700
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.

961
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.130
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,

962
01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:20.130
Despoiled of your honour in your life,

963
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.870
Shall, after three days' open penance done,

964
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.670
Live in your country here in banishment,

965
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:26.670
With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.

966
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:32.630
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.

967
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:38.730
Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:

968
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:43.400
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.

969
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:54.630
(old woman laughs)

970
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.870
I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;

971
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:10.930
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.

972
01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.230
Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,

973
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:29.130
Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself protector be;

974
01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:30.170
and God shall be my hope,

975
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:34.600
My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:

976
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.070
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved

977
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:40.330
Than when thou wert protector to thy King.

978
01:03:40.330 --> 01:03:42.600
I see no reason why a king of years

979
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.070
Should be to be protected like a child.

980
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:48.870
God and King Henry govern England's realm.

981
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.070
Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.

982
01:03:53.070 --> 01:04:01.870
My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:

983
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:04.730
As willingly do I the same resign

984
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:09.330
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;

985
01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:14.830
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it

986
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:20.970
As others would ambitiously receive it.

987
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:26.270
Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,

988
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:30.870
May honourable peace attend thy throne!

989
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:53.970
Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;

990
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:58.130
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,

991
01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:02.670
That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;

992
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:07.800
His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.

993
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:15.900
This staff of honour raught, there let it stand

994
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:21.100
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.

995
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.200
Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;

996
01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.200
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.

997
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:36.200
Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,

998
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.800
This is the day appointed for the combat;

999
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.330
And ready are the appellant and defendant,

1000
01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:44.430
The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,

1001
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:47.770
So please your highness to behold the fight.

1002
01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:49.870
Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore

1003
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:54.370
Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.

1004
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:57.100
O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:

1005
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.670
Here let them end it; and God defend the right!

1006
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.570
Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of sack:

1007
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:26.100
and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.

1008
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:32.370
And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.

1009
01:06:32.370 --> 01:06:35.830
And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour:

1010
01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:39.400
drink, and fear not your man.

1011
01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:50.400
Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all;

1012
01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.870
and a fig for Peter!

1013
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:54.130
First 'Prentice Here, Peter, I drink to thee:

1014
01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:55.600
and be not afraid.

1015
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.500
Second 'Prentice Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master:

1016
01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.900
fight for credit of the 'prentices.

1017
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:06.830
I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray you;

1018
01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:08.930
for I think I have taken my last draught in this world.

1019
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:14.830
Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee my apron:

1020
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.070
and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer:

1021
01:07:18.070 --> 01:07:22.470
and here, Tom, take all the money that I have.

1022
01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:25.970
O Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to deal

1023
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:29.400
with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.

1024
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:32.300
Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.

1025
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.900
Sirrah, what's thy name?

1026
01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:36.300
Peter, forsooth.

1027
01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.530
Peter! what more?

1028
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:38.670
Thump.

1029
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:44.470
Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.

1030
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:51.200
Masters, I am come hither, as it were,

1031
01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.670
at my man's instigation,

1032
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:59.530
to prove him a knave and myself an honest man:

1033
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:03.230
and touching the Duke of York,

1034
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:07.000
I will take my death, I never meant him any ill,

1035
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.570
nor the king, nor the queen: and therefore,

1036
01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.830
Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!

1037
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:19.330
Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.

1038
01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:21.630
Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!

1039
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:26.170
(trumpets sound)

1040
01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:15.600
Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.

1041
01:09:16.930 --> 01:09:26.970
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God,

1042
01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:36.270
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God,

1043
01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:40.200
and the good wine in thy master's way.

1044
01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:53.670
O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?

1045
01:09:56.330 --> 01:10:01.400
O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!

1046
01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.770
Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;

1047
01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:08.030
For by his death we do perceive his guilt:

1048
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:09.970
And God in justice hath revealed to us

1049
01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:12.630
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,

1050
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:15.870
Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.

1051
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.270
Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.

1052
01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:36.600
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;

1053
01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:40.030
And after summer evermore succeeds barren winter,

1054
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:44.170
with his wrathful nipping cold:

1055
01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:50.100
So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.

1056
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:50.930
Sirs, what's o'clock?

1057
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:52.500
Ten, my lord.

1058
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.570
Ten is the hour that was appointed me

1059
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:59.700
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:

1060
01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:05.330
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,

1061
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:08.770
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.

1062
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:15.730
Soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare

1063
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.930
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.

1064
01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.830
So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.

1065
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:29.870
No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.

1066
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:34.800
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?

1067
01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.100
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!

1068
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.300
See how the giddy multitude do point,

1069
01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:45.300
And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!

1070
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.530
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,

1071
01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.830
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,

1072
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:53.200
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!

1073
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:56.900
Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.

1074
01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:00.200
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!

1075
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.630
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,

1076
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:06.500
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?

1077
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.970
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;

1078
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:14.100
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.

1079
01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:18.570
Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,

1080
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:21.730
And he a prince and ruler of the land:

1081
01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:24.970
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was

1082
01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:27.830
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,

1083
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:29.870
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock

1084
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:33.300
To every idle rascal follower.

1085
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.700
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,

1086
01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.830
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death

1087
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:43.670
Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;

1088
01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:46.570
For Suffolk, he that can do all in all

1089
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.070
With her that hateth thee and hates us all,

1090
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.330
And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,

1091
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:55.570
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,

1092
01:12:55.570 --> 01:13:00.330
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:

1093
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:04.000
But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,

1094
01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.900
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.

1095
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:09.400
Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;

1096
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.430
I must offend before I be attainted;

1097
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:17.100
And had I twenty times so many foes,

1098
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.070
And each of them had twenty times their power,

1099
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:23.370
All these could not procure me any scathe,

1100
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:27.830
So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.

1101
01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.100
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?

1102
01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:42.470
Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away

1103
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:45.170
But I in danger for the breach of law.

1104
01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:51.500
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:

1105
01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.830
I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;

1106
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.730
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.

1107
01:13:57.730 --> 01:14:01.000
I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,

1108
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:06.570
Holden at Bury the first of this next month.

1109
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:12.270
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!

1110
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:20.900
This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.

1111
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:32.770
My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,

1112
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:35.900
Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.

1113
01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.200
An't please your grace, here my commission stays,

1114
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:41.030
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now

1115
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:44.730
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.

1116
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:48.130
Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?

1117
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:53.300
So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.

1118
01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:58.500
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray you use her well:

1119
01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.570
the world may laugh again;

1120
01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:05.070
And I may live to do you kindness if you do it her:

1121
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.230
and so, Sir John, farewell!

1122
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:14.000
What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!

1123
01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.730
Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.

1124
01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:30.370
Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!

1125
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:37.770
For none abides with me: my joy is death;

1126
01:15:37.770 --> 01:15:39.270
Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,

1127
01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:44.600
Because I wish'd this world's eternity.

1128
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.030
Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;

1129
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.370
I care not whither, for I beg no favour,

1130
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:52.570
Only convey me where thou art commanded.

1131
01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:57.970
Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,

1132
01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:01.170
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.

1133
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:04.870
It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.

1134
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:10.330
Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.

1135
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:12.430
Come, Stanley, shall we go?

1136
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:17.630
Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,

1137
01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:20.770
And go we to attire you for our journey.

1138
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:24.530
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:

1139
01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:27.630
No, it will hang upon my richest robes

1140
01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:32.430
And show itself, attire me how I can.

1141
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:39.230
Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.

1142
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.470
I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:

1143
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.870
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,

1144
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:13.600
Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.

1145
01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.000
Can you not see? or will ye not observe

1146
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.470
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?

1147
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:22.500
With what a majesty he holds himself,

1148
01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.000
How insolent of late he is become,

1149
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.530
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?

1150
01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:32.030
We know the time since he was mild and affable,

1151
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:34.030
And if we did but glance a far-off look,

1152
01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:36.930
Immediately he was upon his knee,

1153
01:17:36.930 --> 01:17:40.130
That all the court admired him for submission:

1154
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.300
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,

1155
01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.300
When every one will give the time of day,

1156
01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:47.500
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,

1157
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:50.570
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,

1158
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:54.500
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.

1159
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.670
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;

1160
01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:02.870
But great men tremble when the lion roars;

1161
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:06.900
And Humphrey is no little man in England.

1162
01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.500
First note that he is near you in descent,

1163
01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.600
And should you fall, he as the next will mount.

1164
01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:17.230
Me seemeth then it is no policy,

1165
01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:19.830
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears

1166
01:18:19.830 --> 01:18:23.230
And his advantage following your decease,

1167
01:18:23.230 --> 01:18:25.070
That he should come about your royal person

1168
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:28.400
Or be admitted to your highness' council.

1169
01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:31.670
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,

1170
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:34.200
And when he please to make commotion,

1171
01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.930
'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.

1172
01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:42.800
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;

1173
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.630
Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden

1174
01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:48.870
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.

1175
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:51.800
The reverent care I bear unto my lord

1176
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.730
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.

1177
01:18:55.730 --> 01:19:00.330
If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;

1178
01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:05.100
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,

1179
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:09.900
I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.

1180
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.400
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,

1181
01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:18.670
Reprove my allegation, if you can;

1182
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:23.230
Or else conclude my words effectual.

1183
01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:26.030
Well hath your highness seen into this duke;

1184
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.930
And, had I first been put to speak my mind,

1185
01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:31.000
I think I should have told your grace's tale.

1186
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.230
The duchess, by his subornation,

1187
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:36.070
Upon my life, began her devilish practises:

1188
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.630
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;

1189
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:41.470
And in his simple show he harbours treason.

1190
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:43.730
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.

1191
01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:45.430
No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man

1192
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:48.070
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.

1193
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:50.700
Did he not, contrary to form of law,

1194
01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:54.800
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?

1195
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:57.030
And did he not, in his protectorship,

1196
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:59.970
Levy great sums of money through the realm

1197
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:03.200
For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?

1198
01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.600
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.

1199
01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:10.200
Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.

1200
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.030
Which time will bring to light in smooth

1201
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:14.400
Duke Humphrey.

1202
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.730
My lords, at once: the care you have of us,

1203
01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:19.930
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,

1204
01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:23.600
Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,

1205
01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.130
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent

1206
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:28.630
From meaning treason to our royal person

1207
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.830
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:

1208
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:34.970
The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given

1209
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:37.300
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.

1210
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:42.100
Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!

1211
01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:45.530
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,

1212
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:48.300
For he's disposed as the hateful raven:

1213
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:52.100
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,

1214
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:54.870
For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolves.

1215
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:59.600
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all

1216
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.130
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.

1217
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:06.230
All health unto my gracious sovereign!

1218
01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:09.070
Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?

1219
01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.670
That all your interest in those territories

1220
01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:16.130
Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.

1221
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:20.970
Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!

1222
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:28.830
Cold news for me; for I had hope of France

1223
01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:31.900
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.

1224
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:35.530
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud

1225
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:39.700
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;

1226
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.770
But I will remedy this gear ere long,

1227
01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:45.230
Or sell my title for a glorious grave.

1228
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:49.700
All happiness unto my lord the king!

1229
01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:54.600
Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.

1230
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.100
Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,

1231
01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:00.630
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:

1232
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.600
I do arrest thee of high treason here.

1233
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:17.830
Well, Suffolk's Duke, thou shalt not see me blush

1234
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:21.370
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:

1235
01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:25.700
The purest spring is not so free from mud

1236
01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:29.270
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:

1237
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:35.000
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?

1238
01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:41.370
'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,

1239
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:45.030
And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;

1240
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:50.900
By means whereof his highness hath lost France.

1241
01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.330
Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?

1242
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:58.100
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,

1243
01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:00.330
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.

1244
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:04.230
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,

1245
01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.330
Because I would not tax the needy commons,

1246
01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:08.070
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,

1247
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:10.670
And never ask'd for restitution.

1248
01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:14.970
It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.

1249
01:23:14.970 --> 01:23:19.100
I say no more than truth, so help me God!

1250
01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.730
In your protectorship you did devise

1251
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:26.370
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,

1252
01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:29.400
That England was defamed by tyranny.

1253
01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:32.170
Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was protector,

1254
01:23:32.170 --> 01:23:34.400
Pity was all the fault that was in me;

1255
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.270
For I should melt at an offender's tears,

1256
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:41.330
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.

1257
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:43.030
My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:

1258
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:45.730
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,

1259
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:47.630
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.

1260
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:49.930
I do arrest you in his highness' name;

1261
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.530
And here commit you to my lord cardinal

1262
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:54.370
To keep, until your further time of trial.

1263
01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.770
My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope

1264
01:24:07.770 --> 01:24:10.830
That you will clear yourself from all suspense:

1265
01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:13.570
My conscience tells me you are innocent.

1266
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:21.170
Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:

1267
01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:26.600
Virtue is choked with foul ambition

1268
01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:30.200
And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;

1269
01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:33.930
Foul subornation is predominant

1270
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:37.970
And equity exiled your highness' land.

1271
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:41.370
I know their complot is to have my life,

1272
01:24:41.370 --> 01:24:44.200
And if my death might make this island happy,

1273
01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.330
And prove the period of their tyranny,

1274
01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.270
I would expend it with all willingness:

1275
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:52.970
But mine is made the prologue to their play;

1276
01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:55.700
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,

1277
01:24:55.700 --> 01:25:00.870
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.

1278
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:06.100
Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,

1279
01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:10.030
And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;

1280
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:13.000
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue

1281
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.470
The envious load that lies upon his heart;

1282
01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:21.570
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,

1283
01:25:21.570 --> 01:25:24.530
Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,

1284
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:27.530
By false accuse doth level at my life:

1285
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:34.700
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,

1286
01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:38.600
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,

1287
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.700
And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up

1288
01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:47.270
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:

1289
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:51.030
Ay, all you have laid your heads together--

1290
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:53.900
Myself had notice of your conventicles--

1291
01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:59.130
And all to make away my guiltless life.

1292
01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:01.630
I shall not want false witness to accuse me,

1293
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:05.000
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;

1294
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.230
The ancient proverb will be well effected:

1295
01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:11.470
'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'

1296
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:13.730
My liege, his raging is intolerable:

1297
01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:15.600
He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:

1298
01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.370
Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.

1299
01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:22.530
Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.

1300
01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:28.730
Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch

1301
01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:33.400
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.

1302
01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:37.900
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,

1303
01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:44.470
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.

1304
01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:53.800
Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!

1305
01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:01.600
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.

1306
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.700
My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,

1307
01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:16.530
Do or undo, as if ourself were here.

1308
01:27:16.530 --> 01:27:20.100
What, will your highness leave the parliament?

1309
01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.270
Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,

1310
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:25.930
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,

1311
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:27.600
My body round engirt with misery,

1312
01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.830
For what's more miserable than discontent?

1313
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.500
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see

1314
01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:37.200
The map of honour, truth and loyalty:

1315
01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:40.000
What louring star now envies thy estate,

1316
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.400
That these great lords and Margaret our queen

1317
01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:45.730
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?

1318
01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:50.100
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;

1319
01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:53.570
And as the butcher takes away the calf

1320
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:55.600
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,

1321
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.930
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,

1322
01:27:57.930 --> 01:28:02.430
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;

1323
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:03.900
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,

1324
01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.570
Looking the way her harmless young one went,

1325
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:08.430
And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,

1326
01:28:08.430 --> 01:28:11.100
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case

1327
01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:13.600
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes

1328
01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.370
Look after him and cannot do him good,

1329
01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:19.500
So mighty are his vowed enemies.

1330
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.430
His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan

1331
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:25.770
Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'

1332
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:46.100
Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.

1333
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.530
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,

1334
01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:53.730
Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show

1335
01:28:53.730 --> 01:28:56.800
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile

1336
01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:00.770
With sorrow snares relenting passengers,

1337
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:06.070
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--

1338
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:10.530
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--

1339
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:13.700
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,

1340
01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.270
To rid us of the fear we have of him.

1341
01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:20.030
That he should die is worthy policy;

1342
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:23.870
But yet we want a colour for his death:

1343
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:27.570
'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.

1344
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:29.830
But, in my mind, that were no policy:

1345
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:32.400
The king will labour still to save his life,

1346
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.330
The commons haply rise, to save his life;

1347
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:36.670
And yet we have but trivial argument,

1348
01:29:36.670 --> 01:29:41.500
More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.

1349
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.900
So that, by this, you would not have him die.

1350
01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:51.900
Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!

1351
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.770
'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.

1352
01:29:55.770 --> 01:29:59.930
But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,

1353
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:03.100
Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,

1354
01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.300
Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set

1355
01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:08.700
To guard the chicken from a kite,

1356
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.570
As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?

1357
01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:18.670
So the poor chicken should be sure of death.

1358
01:30:18.670 --> 01:30:23.070
Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,

1359
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:27.230
To make the fox surveyor of the fold?

1360
01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.070
No; let him die, in that he is a fox,

1361
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:32.530
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,

1362
01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:35.870
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:

1363
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:38.770
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,

1364
01:30:38.770 --> 01:30:40.270
Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,

1365
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:42.900
So he be dead; for that is good deceit

1366
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.400
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.

1367
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.830
Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.

1368
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:52.100
Not resolute, except so much were done;

1369
01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.630
For things are often spoke and seldom meant:

1370
01:30:54.630 --> 01:30:57.800
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,

1371
01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:00.700
Seeing the deed is meritorious,

1372
01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.730
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,

1373
01:31:03.730 --> 01:31:08.100
Say but the word, and I will be his priest.

1374
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:10.630
But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,

1375
01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:15.130
Ere you can take due orders for a priest:

1376
01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:17.770
Say you consent and censure well the deed,

1377
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:22.170
And I'll provide his executioner,

1378
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:25.970
I tender so the safety of my liege.

1379
01:31:25.970 --> 01:31:30.170
Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.

1380
01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:32.600
And so say I.

1381
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.830
And I and now we three have spoke it,

1382
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:40.470
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.

1383
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:42.800


1384
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.470
From Ireland am I come amain,

1385
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:46.170
To signify that rebels there are up

1386
01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:49.270
And put the Englishmen unto the sword:

1387
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.730
Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,

1388
01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:54.070
Before the wound do grow uncurable;

1389
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:55.730
For, being green, there is great hope of help.

1390
01:31:55.730 --> 01:31:59.430
A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!

1391
01:31:59.430 --> 01:32:02.830
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?

1392
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:07.900
That Somerset be sent as regent thither:

1393
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:11.930
'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;

1394
01:32:11.930 --> 01:32:16.500
Witness the fortune he hath had in France.

1395
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:18.930
If York, with all his far-fet policy,

1396
01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:20.670
Had been the regent there instead of me,

1397
01:32:20.670 --> 01:32:23.030
He never would have stay'd in France so long.

1398
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:26.200
No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:

1399
01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.230
I rather would have lost my life betimes

1400
01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:31.270
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home

1401
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:37.100
By staying there so long till all were lost.

1402
01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:42.370
Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:

1403
01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:46.230
Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.

1404
01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:50.970
Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,

1405
01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:52.900
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:

1406
01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:56.400
No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:

1407
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:59.430
Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,

1408
01:32:59.430 --> 01:33:02.300
Might happily have proved far worse than his.

1409
01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:06.100
What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!

1410
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.770
And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!

1411
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:14.970
My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.

1412
01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:18.270
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms

1413
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:20.430
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:

1414
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:22.400
To Ireland will you lead a band of men,

1415
01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:25.570
Collected choicely, from each county some,

1416
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:30.670
And try your hap against the Irishmen?

1417
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:34.170
I will, my lord, so please his majesty.

1418
01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:36.830
Why, our authority is his consent,

1419
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:39.600
And what we do establish he confirms:

1420
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:42.600
Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.

1421
01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:46.630
I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,

1422
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:48.870
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.

1423
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:51.430
A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.

1424
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:54.870
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.

1425
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.900
No more of him; for I will deal with him

1426
01:33:56.900 --> 01:33:59.330
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.

1427
01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:04.100
And so break off; the day is almost spent:

1428
01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:06.200
Lord, you and I must talk of that event.

1429
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:10.470
My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days

1430
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:13.030
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;

1431
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:15.630
For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.

1432
01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:18.500
I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.

1433
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:30.770
Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,

1434
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:34.030
And change misdoubt into resolution:

1435
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:38.770
Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art resign to death;

1436
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:42.300
it is not worth the enjoying:

1437
01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:47.130
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,

1438
01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:53.670
And find no harbour in a royal heart.

1439
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:57.270
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on thought,

1440
01:34:57.270 --> 01:35:03.270
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.

1441
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:07.870
My brain more busy than the labouring spider

1442
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:12.100
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.

1443
01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:16.970
Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,

1444
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:20.570
To send me packing with an host of men:

1445
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:25.100
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,

1446
01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:28.670
Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your hearts.

1447
01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:34.500
'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:

1448
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:39.070
I take it kindly; and yet be well assured

1449
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:44.930
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.

1450
01:35:57.130 --> 01:36:02.200
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,

1451
01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.270
I will stir up in England some black storm

1452
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:10.530
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;

1453
01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:14.070
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage

1454
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:16.130
Until the golden circuit on my head,

1455
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:18.800
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,

1456
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:26.470
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.

1457
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:29.870
And, for a minister of my intent,

1458
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:33.470
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,

1459
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:35.730
John Cade of Ashford,

1460
01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:39.000
To make commotion, as full well he can,

1461
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.770
Under the title of John Mortimer.

1462
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:45.870
That devil here shall be my substitute;

1463
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:49.370
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,

1464
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:52.200
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:

1465
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.970
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,

1466
01:36:56.970 --> 01:37:02.530
How they affect the house and claim of York.

1467
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:06.300
Say that he be taken, rack'd and tortured,

1468
01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.730
I know no pain they can inflict upon him

1469
01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:11.200
Will make him say I moved him to these arms.

1470
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.830
Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,

1471
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:20.630
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength

1472
01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:23.400
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;

1473
01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.330
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,

1474
01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:37.630
And Henry put apart, the next for me.

1475
01:37:45.330 --> 01:37:48.070
Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know

1476
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:49.900
We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.

1477
01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:52.370
O that it were to do! What have we done?

1478
01:37:52.370 --> 01:37:54.800
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?

1479
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:56.300
Here comes my lord.

1480
01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.970
Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?

1481
01:37:57.970 --> 01:37:59.530
Ay, my good lord, he's dead.

1482
01:37:59.530 --> 01:38:01.470
Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;

1483
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:02.900
I will reward you for this venturous deed.

1484
01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:06.170
The king and all the peers are here at hand.

1485
01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:07.730
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,

1486
01:38:07.730 --> 01:38:08.800
According as I gave directions?

1487
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.070
'Tis handsome, my lord.

1488
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:11.170
Away! be gone.

1489
01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:19.870
(trumpets playing)

1490
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:26.970
Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;

1491
01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:28.830
Say we intend to try his grace to-day.

1492
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:31.000
If he be guilty, as 'tis published.

1493
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.400
I'll call him presently, my noble lord.

1494
01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.730
Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,

1495
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:38.170
Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester

1496
01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:40.470
Than from true evidence of good esteem

1497
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:43.470
He be approved in practise culpable.

1498
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:45.570
God forbid any malice should prevail,

1499
01:38:45.570 --> 01:38:47.830
That faultless may condemn a nobleman!

1500
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:51.900
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!

1501
01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:56.000
I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.

1502
01:38:57.730 --> 01:39:03.400
How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?

1503
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.570
Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?

1504
01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.400
Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.

1505
01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:18.270
Marry, God forfend!

1506
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:21.870
God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night

1507
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:25.400
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.

1508
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.530
How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.

1509
01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:33.530
Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.

1510
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:39.470
Go, run, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!

1511
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:41.470
He doth revive again: madam, be patient.

1512
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:43.130
O heavenly God!

1513
01:39:43.130 --> 01:39:44.800
How fares my gracious lord?

1514
01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:48.070
Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!

1515
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:51.070
What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?

1516
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:53.430
Came he right now to sing a raven's note,

1517
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:56.330
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;

1518
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:58.170
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,

1519
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:00.200
By crying comfort from a hollow breast,

1520
01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.570
Can chase away the first-conceived sound?

1521
01:40:03.570 --> 01:40:06.530
Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;

1522
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.000
Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;

1523
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.730
Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.

1524
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:15.200
Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!

1525
01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.200
Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:

1526
01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.500
Yet do not go: come, basilisk,

1527
01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.770
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;

1528
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.970
For in the shade of death I shall find joy;

1529
01:40:24.970 --> 01:40:27.630
In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.

1530
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:33.330
Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?

1531
01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:35.730
Although the duke was enemy to him,

1532
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:40.070
Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:

1533
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:43.430
And for myself, foe as he was to me,

1534
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:48.500
Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans

1535
01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:51.370
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,

1536
01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:55.770
I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,

1537
01:40:55.770 --> 01:41:00.330
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,

1538
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:03.630
And all to have the noble duke alive.

1539
01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:06.730
What know I how the world may deem of me?

1540
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:09.470
For it is known we were but hollow friends:

1541
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:13.230
It may be judged I made the duke away;

1542
01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:16.700
So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,

1543
01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.500
And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.

1544
01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:24.700
This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!

1545
01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:27.630
To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!

1546
01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:31.530
Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!

1547
01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:33.900
Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.

1548
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.700
What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?

1549
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:42.870
I am no loathsome leper; look on me.

1550
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:45.970
What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?

1551
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:50.870
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.

1552
01:41:53.500 --> 01:42:00.270
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?

1553
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:03.500
Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.

1554
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.670
Erect his statue and worship it,

1555
01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:10.500
And make my image but an alehouse sign.

1556
01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:15.400
Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea

1557
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:18.070
And twice by awkward wind from England's bank

1558
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:22.900
Drove back again unto my native clime?

1559
01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:27.070
What boded this, but well forewarning wind

1560
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:31.670
Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,

1561
01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:36.730
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?

1562
01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:40.400
What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts

1563
01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.470
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:

1564
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:49.770
And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,

1565
01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:52.700
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock

1566
01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:55.370
Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,

1567
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:58.470
But left that hateful office unto thee:

1568
01:42:58.470 --> 01:43:02.030
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,

1569
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:04.870
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,

1570
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:10.000
With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:

1571
01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.270
The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands

1572
01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:17.200
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,

1573
01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.600
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,

1574
01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:26.930
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.

1575
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:30.930
As far as I could ken thy chalky shores,

1576
01:43:30.930 --> 01:43:35.100
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,

1577
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:38.630
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,

1578
01:43:38.630 --> 01:43:41.900
And when the dusky sky began to rob

1579
01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:47.130
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,

1580
01:43:47.130 --> 01:43:50.770
I took a costly jewel from my neck,

1581
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:53.400
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,

1582
01:43:53.400 --> 01:44:00.130
And threw it towards thy shore: the sea received it,

1583
01:44:00.130 --> 01:44:05.170
And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:

1584
01:44:05.170 --> 01:44:11.000
And even with this I lost fair England's view

1585
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.200
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart

1586
01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:18.730
And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,

1587
01:44:18.730 --> 01:44:24.370
For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.

1588
01:44:24.370 --> 01:44:27.500
How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,

1589
01:44:27.500 --> 01:44:29.970
The agent of thy foul inconstancy,

1590
01:44:29.970 --> 01:44:34.600
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did

1591
01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:37.030
When he to madding Dido would unfold

1592
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:41.900
His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!

1593
01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:48.400
Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?

1594
01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:56.470
Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!

1595
01:44:56.470 --> 01:45:03.430
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

1596
01:45:03.970 --> 01:45:11.670
(angry crowd makes noise outside)

1597
01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:19.400
It is reported, mighty sovereign,

1598
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:22.500
That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd

1599
01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.430
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.

1600
01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:25.930
(crowd) Ay!

1601
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:32.070
The commons, like an angry hive of bees

1602
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:34.370
That want their leader, scatter up and down

1603
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:38.470
And care not who they sting in his revenge.

1604
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:41.200
Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,

1605
01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.500
Until they hear the order of his death.

1606
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:47.600
That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;

1607
01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:50.900
But how he died God knows, not Henry:

1608
01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:53.230
his chamber, view his breathless corpse,

1609
01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:56.500
And comment then upon his sudden death.

1610
01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.430
That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,

1611
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:05.730
With the rude multitude till I return.

1612
01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:12.370
O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,

1613
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:14.370
My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul

1614
01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:17.130
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!

1615
01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:20.330
If my suspect be false, forgive me God,

1616
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:22.870
For judgment only doth belong to thee.

1617
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:30.670
Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.

1618
01:46:37.630 --> 01:46:41.670
That is to see how deep my grave is made;

1619
01:46:41.670 --> 01:46:44.900
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,

1620
01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.170
For seeing him I see my life in death.

1621
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.330
As surely as my soul intends to live with that dread King

1622
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:14.270
that took our state upon him

1623
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:17.870
To free us from his father's wrathful curse,

1624
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:20.400
I do believe that violent hands were laid

1625
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:24.900
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.

1626
01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:29.430
A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!

1627
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:32.730
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?

1628
01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:44.100
See how his face is black and full of blood.

1629
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:46.370
His eye-balls further out than when he lived,

1630
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:50.170
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;

1631
01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:56.170
His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;

1632
01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:59.170
His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd

1633
01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:04.670
And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:

1634
01:48:06.230 --> 01:48:13.830
Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;

1635
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:17.070
His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,

1636
01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:20.500
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.

1637
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:25.770
It cannot be but he was murder'd here;

1638
01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:29.370
The least of all these signs were probable.

1639
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:32.970
Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?

1640
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:35.700
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;

1641
01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:37.530
And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.

1642
01:48:37.530 --> 01:48:40.770
But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,

1643
01:48:40.770 --> 01:48:43.600
And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:

1644
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:46.500
'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;

1645
01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:49.630
And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.

1646
01:48:49.630 --> 01:48:52.170
Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen

1647
01:48:52.170 --> 01:48:56.170
As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.

1648
01:48:56.170 --> 01:49:00.300
Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh

1649
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:03.070
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,

1650
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:06.930
But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?

1651
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:10.800
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,

1652
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.300
But may imagine how the bird was dead,

1653
01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:16.170
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?

1654
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:20.030
Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?

1655
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:23.670
Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?

1656
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:27.170
I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;

1657
01:49:27.170 --> 01:49:29.700
But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,

1658
01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.230
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart

1659
01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:35.030
That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.

1660
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:38.000
Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,

1661
01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.100
That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.

1662
01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:42.570
What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?

1663
01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:45.200
He dares not calm his contumelious spirit

1664
01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:47.770
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,

1665
01:49:47.770 --> 01:49:50.900
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.

1666
01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:57.070
Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;

1667
01:49:57.070 --> 01:50:00.430
For every word you speak in his behalf

1668
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:03.700
Is slander to your royal dignity.

1669
01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:07.630
Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!

1670
01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:09.600
If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,

1671
01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.170
Thy mother took into her blameful bed

1672
01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:16.100
Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock

1673
01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:19.470
Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,

1674
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:20.830
And never of the Nevils' noble race.

1675
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:23.970
But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee

1676
01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:25.870
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,

1677
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:28.730
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,

1678
01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:31.830
And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,

1679
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:36.800
I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee

1680
01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:39.900
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,

1681
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:43.270
And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st

1682
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:46.900
That thou thyself was born in bastardy;

1683
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:49.170
And after all this fearful homage done,

1684
01:50:49.170 --> 01:50:53.270
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,

1685
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:56.230
Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!

1686
01:50:56.230 --> 01:50:58.900
Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,

1687
01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.900
If from this presence thou darest go with me.

1688
01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.630
Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:

1689
01:51:04.630 --> 01:51:08.300
Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee

1690
01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:12.270
And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.

1691
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:20.030
What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!

1692
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:23.670
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,

1693
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:26.170
And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel

1694
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:28.730
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.

1695
01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:31.400
(crowd makes noise in background)

1696
01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:33.970
What noise is this?

1697
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.230
Why, how now, lords!

1698
01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:45.670
Your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence!

1699
01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:46.630
Dare you be so bold?

1700
01:51:46.630 --> 01:51:47.730
The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury

1701
01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:50.170
Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.

1702
01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:53.830
[To the Commons, entering] Sirs, stand apart;

1703
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:56.200
The king shall know your mind.

1704
01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.070
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,

1705
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:05.130
Unless false Suffolk straight be done to death,

1706
01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:08.230
Or banished fair England's territories,

1707
01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:10.770
They will by violence tear him from your palace

1708
01:52:10.770 --> 01:52:14.400
And torture him with grievous lingering death.

1709
01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:18.100
They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;

1710
01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:22.100
They say, in him they fear your highness' death;

1711
01:52:22.100 --> 01:52:23.900
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,

1712
01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:27.300
Makes them thus forward in his banishment.

1713
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:30.500
They say, in care of your most royal person,

1714
01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:32.500
That if your highness should intend to sleep

1715
01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:35.400
And charge that no man should disturb your rest

1716
01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:37.770
In pain of your dislike or pain of death,

1717
01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:40.700
Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,

1718
01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:43.000
Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,

1719
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.800
That slily glided towards your majesty,

1720
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.870
It were but necessary you were waked,

1721
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:50.900
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,

1722
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.030
That they will guard you, whether you will or no,

1723
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:56.330
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,

1724
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:58.230
With whose envenomed and fatal sting,

1725
01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:02.170
Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,

1726
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:05.900
They say, is shamefully bereft of life.

1727
01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:10.500
(crowd chants) An answer from the king, my Lord of Salisbury!

1728
01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:13.730
'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,

1729
01:53:13.730 --> 01:53:17.000
Could send such message to their sovereign:

1730
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.130
But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,

1731
01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:21.770
To show how quaint an orator you are:

1732
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:24.730
But all the honour Salisbury hath won

1733
01:53:24.730 --> 01:53:26.370
Is that he was the lord ambassador

1734
01:53:26.370 --> 01:53:28.970
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.

1735
01:53:28.970 --> 01:53:30.870
(crowd chants) An answer from the king,

1736
01:53:30.870 --> 01:53:33.300
or we will all break in!

1737
01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:35.670
Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.

1738
01:53:35.670 --> 01:53:38.600
I thank them for their tender loving care;

1739
01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.430
And had I not been cited so by them,

1740
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.430
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;

1741
01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.070
For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy

1742
01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:50.470
Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:

1743
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:52.470
And therefore, by His majesty I swear,

1744
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:55.270
Whose far unworthy deputy I am,

1745
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:57.170
He shall not breathe infection in this air

1746
01:53:57.170 --> 01:54:01.000
But three days longer, on the pain of death.

1747
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!

1748
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.430
Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!

1749
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:12.900
No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,

1750
01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.700
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.

1751
01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:16.600
Had I but said, I would have kept my word,

1752
01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:20.430
But when I swear, it is irrevocable.

1753
01:54:20.430 --> 01:54:22.130
If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found

1754
01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:24.730
On any ground that I am ruler of,

1755
01:54:24.730 --> 01:54:28.430
The world shall not be ransom for thy life.

1756
01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:35.430
Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;

1757
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:38.730
I have great matters to impart to thee.

1758
01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:44.600
Mischance and sorrow go along with thee!

1759
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.370
Heart's discontent and sour affliction

1760
01:54:47.370 --> 01:54:51.230
Be playfellows to keep you company!

1761
01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:55.530
There's two of you; the devil make a third!

1762
01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:59.930
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!

1763
01:54:59.930 --> 01:55:02.930
Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,

1764
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.130
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.

1765
01:55:05.130 --> 01:55:08.700
Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!

1766
01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:11.970
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?

1767
01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:15.900
A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?

1768
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:19.470
Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,

1769
01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:23.430
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,

1770
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:27.330
As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,

1771
01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:29.300
Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,

1772
01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:31.870
With full as many signs of deadly hate,

1773
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:36.330
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:

1774
01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:38.970
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;

1775
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:42.500
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;

1776
01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:46.870
Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;

1777
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:51.600
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:

1778
01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:55.000
And even now my burthen'd heart would break,

1779
01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.330
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!

1780
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:05.300
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!

1781
01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:11.070
Their softest shade a grove of cypress trees!

1782
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:15.630
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!

1783
01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:18.970
Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!

1784
01:56:18.970 --> 01:56:22.870
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,

1785
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:27.600
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!

1786
01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:31.170
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--

1787
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:35.170
Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;

1788
01:56:35.170 --> 01:56:37.570
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,

1789
01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:39.930
Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,

1790
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:42.000
And turn the force of them upon thyself.

1791
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.270
You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?

1792
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:53.270
Ay entreat thee cease. O give me thy hand,

1793
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:58.070
That I may dew it with my mournful tears;

1794
01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:06.930
O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,

1795
01:57:06.930 --> 01:57:11.530
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,

1796
01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:18.400
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!

1797
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:26.000
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;

1798
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.470
'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,

1799
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:34.470
I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,

1800
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:38.470
Adventure to be banished myself:

1801
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:41.630
And banished I am, if but from thee.

1802
01:57:41.630 --> 01:57:48.600
No; speak not to me; even now be gone.

1803
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.870
No. O' go not yet!

1804
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:12.730
And yet farewell; and farewell life with thee!

1805
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:18.030
Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;

1806
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:21.870
Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.

1807
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:26.900
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;

1808
01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.500
A wilderness is populous enough,

1809
01:58:29.500 --> 01:58:32.030
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:

1810
01:58:32.030 --> 01:58:35.800
For where thou art, there is the world itself,

1811
01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:39.770
With every several pleasure in the world,

1812
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:44.630
And where thou art not, desolation.

1813
01:58:47.230 --> 01:58:53.970
I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;

1814
01:58:53.970 --> 01:58:58.570
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.

1815
01:59:04.100 --> 01:59:07.830
Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?

1816
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:08.830
To signify unto his majesty

1817
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:11.030
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;

1818
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:13.100
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,

1819
01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:17.800
That makes him gasp and stare and grasp the air,

1820
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:20.970
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.

1821
01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:22.870
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost

1822
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:25.770
Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,

1823
01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:27.630
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,

1824
01:59:27.630 --> 01:59:29.770
The secrets of his overcharged soul;

1825
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:30.970
And I am sent to tell his majesty

1826
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:33.430
That even now he cries aloud for him.

1827
01:59:35.070 --> 01:59:39.170
Go tell this heavy message to the king.

1828
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:53.070
Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!

1829
01:59:57.170 --> 01:59:59.970
Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;

1830
01:59:59.970 --> 02:00:02.100
If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.

1831
02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:04.500
If I depart from thee, I cannot live;

1832
02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.970
And in thy sight to die, what were it else

1833
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:09.600
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?

1834
02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:13.370
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,

1835
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:17.000
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe

1836
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.500
Dying with mother's dug between its lips:

1837
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:24.870
To die by thee were but to die in jest;

1838
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:30.130
From thee to die were torture more than death:

1839
02:00:30.130 --> 02:00:36.200
O, let me stay, befall what may befall!

1840
02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:39.070
Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,

1841
02:00:39.070 --> 02:00:43.800
It is applied to a deathful wound.

1842
02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.830
To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;

1843
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:50.000
For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,

1844
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.030
I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out. Away!

1845
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:58.300
I go.

1846
02:00:58.300 --> 02:00:59.900
And take my heart with thee.

1847
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:10.270
A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask

1848
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:13.900
That ever did contain a thing of worth.

1849
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:19.030
Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we

1850
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:22.670
This way fall I to death.

1851
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:27.030
This way for me.

1852
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:31.870
(horns sounding)

1853
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.970
How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign.

1854
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:57.000
If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,

1855
02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.100
Enough to purchase such another island,

1856
02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:09.830
So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.

1857
02:02:11.670 --> 02:02:13.630
Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,

1858
02:02:13.630 --> 02:02:16.130
Where death's approach is seen so terrible!

1859
02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:27.070
Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.

1860
02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:34.000
Bring me unto my trial when thou will.

1861
02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:39.330
Died he not in his bed? where should he die?

1862
02:02:39.330 --> 02:02:46.500
Can I make men live, whether they will or not?

1863
02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:54.500
O, torture me no more! I will confess.

1864
02:02:58.530 --> 02:03:05.230
Alive again? then show me where he is:

1865
02:03:05.230 --> 02:03:13.800
I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.

1866
02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:28.030
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.

1867
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:34.270
Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,

1868
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:42.270
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.

1869
02:03:45.730 --> 02:03:55.770
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary

1870
02:03:58.270 --> 02:04:12.770
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.

1871
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:16.930
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.

1872
02:04:16.930 --> 02:04:19.070
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!

1873
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:21.130
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend

1874
02:04:21.130 --> 02:04:23.600
That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.

1875
02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:26.630
And from his bosom purge this black despair!

1876
02:04:26.630 --> 02:04:29.200
See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!

1877
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.970
Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.

1878
02:04:32.970 --> 02:04:37.700
Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!

1879
02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:40.730
Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,

1880
02:04:40.730 --> 02:04:44.470
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.

1881
02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:56.870
He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!

1882
02:04:56.870 --> 02:05:00.530
So bad a death argues a monstrous life.

1883
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:05.430
Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.

1884
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:09.000
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;

1885
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:12.370
And let us all to meditation.

1886
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:25.570
The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day

1887
02:05:25.570 --> 02:05:28.470
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;

1888
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:34.000
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades

1889
02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
That drag the tragic melancholy night;

1890
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.070
Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,

1891
02:05:43.070 --> 02:05:48.830
Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws

1892
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:57.830
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.

1893
02:05:57.830 --> 02:06:05.470
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;

1894
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:08.070
For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,

1895
02:06:08.070 --> 02:06:13.800
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,

1896
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.670
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.

1897
02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:18.470
Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;

1898
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.700
And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;

1899
02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:25.900
The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.

1900
02:06:27.230 --> 02:06:31.200
What is my ransom, master? Let me know.

1901
02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:41.230
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.

1902
02:06:41.230 --> 02:06:46.770
(Master's-Mate)And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.

1903
02:06:46.770 --> 02:06:52.500
What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,

1904
02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:57.570
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?

1905
02:06:57.570 --> 02:07:00.670
Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:

1906
02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:02.400
The lives of those which we have lost in fight

1907
02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:04.330
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!

1908
02:07:04.330 --> 02:07:09.230
I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.

1909
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:11.930
And so will I and write home for it straight.

1910
02:07:11.930 --> 02:07:15.800
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,

1911
02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:19.700
And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;

1912
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:22.430
And so should these, if I might have my will.

1913
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:27.430
Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.

1914
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:32.400
Look on my George; I am a gentleman:

1915
02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.100
Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.

1916
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.830
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.

1917
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:45.900
How now! why start'st thou? what, doth death affright?

1918
02:07:45.900 --> 02:07:52.100
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.

1919
02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:54.170
A cunning man did calculate my birth

1920
02:07:54.170 --> 02:07:59.670
And told me that by water I should die:

1921
02:07:59.670 --> 02:08:03.600
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;

1922
02:08:03.600 --> 02:08:07.270
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,

1923
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:10.400
But with our sword we wiped away the blot;

1924
02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:13.630
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,

1925
02:08:13.630 --> 02:08:17.370
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,

1926
02:08:17.370 --> 02:08:19.030
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!

1927
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:22.870
Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,

1928
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:26.470
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.

1929
02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:36.000
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!

1930
02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.970
Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:

1931
02:08:38.970 --> 02:08:42.830
Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?

1932
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:51.700
But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.

1933
02:08:54.070 --> 02:08:59.570
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,

1934
02:08:59.570 --> 02:09:02.270
The honourable blood of Lancaster,

1935
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:06.700
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.

1936
02:09:06.700 --> 02:09:11.300
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?

1937
02:09:11.300 --> 02:09:14.500
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule

1938
02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.900
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?

1939
02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.730
How often hast thou waited at my cup,

1940
02:09:19.730 --> 02:09:23.430
Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.

1941
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:27.070
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?

1942
02:09:27.070 --> 02:09:31.130
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,

1943
02:09:31.130 --> 02:09:33.730
Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;

1944
02:09:33.730 --> 02:09:39.270
Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?

1945
02:09:39.270 --> 02:09:49.100
First let my words stab him, as he hath me.

1946
02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:55.930
Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.

1947
02:09:55.930 --> 02:10:02.770
Convey him hence and on our longboat's side

1948
02:10:02.770 --> 02:10:04.370
Strike off his head.

1949
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:05.630
Thou darest not, for thy own.

1950
02:10:05.630 --> 02:10:06.070
Pole!

1951
02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:08.030
Pole!

1952
02:10:08.030 --> 02:10:17.770
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink;

1953
02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:22.730
whose filth Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.

1954
02:10:22.730 --> 02:10:29.870
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth

1955
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:32.130
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:

1956
02:10:32.130 --> 02:10:36.930
Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;

1957
02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:41.270
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,

1958
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:44.630
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,

1959
02:10:44.630 --> 02:10:47.570
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:

1960
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:50.400
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,

1961
02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:52.630
For daring to affy a mighty lord

1962
02:10:52.630 --> 02:10:56.470
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,

1963
02:10:58.070 --> 02:11:05.900
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,

1964
02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:08.570
The false revolting Normans thorough thee

1965
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:11.370
Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy

1966
02:11:11.370 --> 02:11:15.000
Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,

1967
02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And sent the ragged wounded soldiers home.

1968
02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.430
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,

1969
02:11:20.430 --> 02:11:22.600
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,

1970
02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:25.630
As hating thee, are rising up in arms:

1971
02:11:25.630 --> 02:11:29.070
And now the house of York, thrust from the crown

1972
02:11:29.070 --> 02:11:32.330
By shameful murder of a guiltless king

1973
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:36.230
Burns with revenging fire;

1974
02:11:36.230 --> 02:11:39.930
The commons here in Kent are up in arms:

1975
02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:45.200
And, to conclude, reproach and beggary

1976
02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:48.370
Is crept into the palace of our king.

1977
02:11:48.370 --> 02:11:55.070
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.

1978
02:11:55.070 --> 02:12:02.070
O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder

1979
02:12:02.070 --> 02:12:09.130
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!

1980
02:12:09.130 --> 02:12:12.800
It is impossible that I should die

1981
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.500
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.

1982
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.370
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:

1983
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:22.900
Ay but thy deeds shall stay thy fury soon

1984
02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.630
I go of message from the queen to France;

1985
02:12:26.630 --> 02:12:32.370
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.

1986
02:12:32.370 --> 02:12:39.570
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.

1987
02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:42.300
'tis thee I fear.

1988
02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:48.000
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.

1989
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.130
What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?

1990
02:12:53.730 --> 02:12:56.730
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.

1991
02:12:56.730 --> 02:13:01.130
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,

1992
02:13:01.130 --> 02:13:06.400
Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.

1993
02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:09.000
Far be it we should honour such as these

1994
02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.570
With humble suit: no, rather let my head

1995
02:13:12.570 --> 02:13:15.500
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any

1996
02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:18.670
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;

1997
02:13:18.670 --> 02:13:20.970
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole

1998
02:13:20.970 --> 02:13:27.100
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.

1999
02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:32.100
True nobility is exempt from fear:

2000
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.830
More can I bear than you dare execute.

2001
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:40.830
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.

2002
02:13:40.830 --> 02:13:46.030
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,

2003
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:51.370
That this my death may never be forgot!

2004
02:13:51.370 --> 02:13:55.030
Great men oft die by vile bezonians:

2005
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:57.200
A Roman sworder and banditto slave

2006
02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:01.000
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand

2007
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.900
Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders

2008
02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:09.900
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk...(sound of beheading)

2009
02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:14.470
...dies by pirates.

2010
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:18.270
And as for those whose ransom we have set,

2011
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:21.670
It is our pleasure one of them depart;

2012
02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:25.130
So come you with us and let him go.

2013
02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:38.970
There let his head and lifeless body lie,

2014
02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:44.070
Until the queen his mistress bury it.

2015
02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:53.630
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!

2016
02:14:53.630 --> 02:14:56.900
His body will I bear unto the king:

2017
02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:05.070
If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;

2018
02:15:05.070 --> 02:15:11.370
So will the queen, that living held him dear.

2019
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:15.970
Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;

2020
02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:18.000
they have been up these two days.

2021
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
They have the more need to sleep now, then.

2022
02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.130
I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress

2023
02:15:23.130 --> 02:15:26.170
the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.

2024
02:15:26.170 --> 02:15:29.770
So he had need, for 'tis threadbare.

2025
02:15:29.770 --> 02:15:34.100
Well, I say it was never merry world in England

2026
02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:35.830
since gentlemen came up.

2027
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:39.270
O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.

2028
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:42.200
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.

2029
02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:45.070
Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.

2030
02:15:45.070 --> 02:15:50.930
True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;

2031
02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:52.530
which is as much to say as,

2032
02:15:52.530 --> 02:15:55.130
let the magistrates be labouring men;

2033
02:15:55.130 --> 02:15:56.270
and therefore should we be magistrates.

2034
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:58.770
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a

2035
02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:01.870
brave mind than a hard hand.

2036
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:06.970
I see them! I see them!

2037
02:16:06.970 --> 02:16:08.630
There's Best's son, tanner of Wingham,--

2038
02:16:08.630 --> 02:16:10.030
He shall have the skin of our enemies,

2039
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:11.030
to make dog's-leather of.

2040
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:12.270
And Dick the Butcher,--

2041
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:14.270
Then is sin struck down like an ox,

2042
02:16:14.270 --> 02:16:15.670
and iniquity's throat cut like a calf.

2043
02:16:15.670 --> 02:16:17.770
And Smith the weaver,--

2044
02:16:17.770 --> 02:16:19.530
Argo, their thread of life is spun.

2045
02:16:19.530 --> 02:16:21.730
Come, come, let's fall in with them.

2046
02:16:23.570 --> 02:16:32.630
(men chanting) John Cade!!

2047
02:16:51.170 --> 02:16:55.430
We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--

2048
02:16:55.430 --> 02:16:57.900
Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.

2049
02:16:57.900 --> 02:17:03.630
For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with

2050
02:17:03.630 --> 02:17:06.900
the spirit of putting down kings and princes,

2051
02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:10.400
--Command silence.

2052
02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:12.400
Silence!

2053
02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:15.000
My father was a Mortimer,--

2054
02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.700
He was an honest man, and a good bricklayer.

2055
02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:19.470
My mother a Plantagenet,--

2056
02:17:19.470 --> 02:17:22.100
I knew her well; she was a midwife.

2057
02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:25.130
My wife descended of the Lacies,--

2058
02:17:25.130 --> 02:17:27.000
She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter,

2059
02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.430
and sold many laces.

2060
02:17:28.430 --> 02:17:31.800
Therefore am I of an honourable house.

2061
02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:34.330
Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;

2062

2063
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:38.670
Valiant I am.

2064

2067
02:17:48.330 --> 02:17:49.770
whipped three market-days together.

2068
02:17:49.770 --> 02:17:55.170

all the realm shall be in common;

2075
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:21.270

all shall eat and drink on my score;

2080
02:18:37.970 --> 02:18:42.130
and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree

2081
02:18:42.130 --> 02:18:46.970

(crowd) Ay.

2084
02:18:51.630 --> 02:18:54.870
Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing,

2085
02:18:54.870 --> 02:19:00.200
that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment?

2086
02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:03.130
that parchment, being scribbled o'er,

2087
02:19:03.130 --> 02:19:08.430
should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:

2088
02:19:08.430 --> 02:19:12.300
I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but once

2089
02:19:12.300 --> 02:19:16.430
seal to a thing, and I was never mine own man since.

unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.

The elder of them, being put to nurse,

2141
02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.900
Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;

02:22:41.900 --> 02:22:44.070
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,

2143
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:46.900
Became a bricklayer when he came to age:

2144

His son am I; deny it, if you can.

Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house,

and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;

2148

And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head

2159

for selling the dukedom of Maine.

and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up.

Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say

2163
02:23:43.170 --> 02:23:48.100
hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:

2164
02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:51.100
and more than that, he can speak French;

2165
02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:52.930
and therefore he is a traitor.

2166
02:23:52.930 --> 02:23:55.330
O gross and miserable ignorance!

2167
02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:57.000
Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our

2168
02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:00.700
enemies; go to, then, I ask but this:

2169
02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:05.000
can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy

2170
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.630
be a good counsellor, or no?

2171
02:24:08.630 --> 02:24:13.470
(crowd) No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.

2172
02:24:13.470 --> 02:24:16.130
Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,

2173
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:18.430

Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;

2176
02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:25.630
That those which fly before the battle ends

2177
02:24:25.630 --> 02:24:28.930
May, even in their wives' and children's sight,

Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;

2184
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:04.730
For they are thrifty honest men,

2185
02:25:04.730 --> 02:25:08.630
and such as would, but that they dare not, take our parts.

2186

They are all in order and march toward us.

2187
02:25:11.730 --> 02:25:21.470
But then are we in order when we are most out of order.

2188
02:25:21.470 --> 02:25:25.470
Come, march forward.

Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?

2191
02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:28.570
Here, sir.

2192
02:26:28.570 --> 02:26:32.070
They fell before thee like sheep and oxen,

2193
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:33.570
and thou behavedst thyself

2194
02:26:33.570 --> 02:26:36.930
as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter-house:

2195
02:26:36.930 --> 02:26:38.670
therefore thus will I reward thee,

02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:42.830
Eh?

2198
02:26:42.830 --> 02:26:48.100
thou shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking one.

2199
02:26:49.330 --> 02:26:52.300
I desire no more.

2200
02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:57.230
And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less.

2201
02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:19.470
This monument of the victory will I bear;

2202
02:27:19.470 --> 02:27:22.670
and the bodies will be dragged at my heels

2203
02:27:22.670 --> 02:27:25.600
till I do come to London, where we will have the

2204

mayor's sword borne before us.

2205
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:34.000

2206
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.300
break open the gaols and let out the prisoners.

2207
02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:40.730
Fear not that, I warrant thee.

2208
02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:46.500
Come, let's march towards London.

(crowd chants) John Cade! John Cade!

2210
02:28:01.830 --> 02:28:06.270
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,

2211
02:28:06.270 --> 02:28:10.930
And makes it fearful and degenerate;

2212
02:28:10.930 --> 02:28:20.370
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.

2213
02:28:20.370 --> 02:28:28.030
But who can cease to weep and look on this?

2214
02:28:28.030 --> 02:28:35.900
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:

2215
02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:38.370
But where's the body that I should embrace?

2216
02:28:38.370 --> 02:28:42.770
What answer makes your grace to the rebels' supplication?

2217
02:28:42.770 --> 02:28:44.900
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;

2218
02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:46.630
For God forbid so many simple souls

2219
02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:48.970
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,

2220
02:28:48.970 --> 02:28:50.770
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,

2221
02:28:50.770 --> 02:28:52.930
Will parley with Jack Cade their general:

2222
02:28:52.930 --> 02:28:56.800
But stay, I'll read it over once again.

2223
02:28:56.800 --> 02:29:01.070
Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face

2224
02:29:01.070 --> 02:29:04.300
Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,

2225
02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:06.570
And could it not enforce them to relent,

2226
02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:09.430
That were unworthy to behold the same?

2227
02:29:09.430 --> 02:29:12.400
Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.

2228
02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:15.370
Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.

02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:20.830
Still lamenting Suffolk's death?

2231
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:22.600
I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,

2232
02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:25.900
Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.

2233
02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:31.130
No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

2234
02:29:33.370 --> 02:29:35.430
How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?

2235
02:29:35.430 --> 02:29:38.170
The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!

2236
02:29:38.170 --> 02:29:40.600
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,

2237
02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:42.730
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,

2238
02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:44.300
And calls your grace usurper openly

2239
02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:48.770
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.

2240
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:50.030
His army is a ragged multitude

2241
02:29:50.030 --> 02:29:52.500
Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:

2242
02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:54.100
Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death

2243
02:29:54.100 --> 02:29:57.100
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:

2244
02:29:57.100 --> 02:29:59.700
All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,

2245
02:29:59.700 --> 02:30:02.800
They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.

2246
02:30:02.800 --> 02:30:05.800
O graceless men! they know not what they do.

2247
02:30:05.800 --> 02:30:07.670
My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,

2248
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:10.130
Until a power be raised to put them down.

2249
02:30:10.130 --> 02:30:12.070
Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,

2250
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:15.500
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!

2251
02:30:15.500 --> 02:30:17.800
Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;

2252
02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:19.730
Therefore away with us to Killingworth.

2253
02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:21.470
So might your grace's person be in danger.

2254
02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:23.730
The sight of me is odious in their eyes;

2255
02:30:23.730 --> 02:30:25.900
And therefore in this city will I stay

2256
02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:28.200
And live alone as secret as I may.

2257
02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:30.100
Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:

2258
02:30:30.100 --> 02:30:32.430
The citizens fly and forsake their houses:

2259
02:30:32.430 --> 02:30:33.470
The rascal people, thirsting after prey,

2260
02:30:33.470 --> 02:30:35.830
Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear

2261
02:30:35.830 --> 02:30:37.500
To spoil the city and your royal court.

2262
02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:39.930
Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.

2263
02:30:39.930 --> 02:30:43.500
Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.

2264
02:30:43.500 --> 02:30:47.100
My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.

2265
02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:51.000
Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.

2266
02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.

2267
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.930
The trust I have is in mine innocence,

2268
02:30:55.930 --> 02:30:58.570
And therefore am I bold and resolute.

2269
02:31:31.970 --> 02:31:38.100
Jack Cade!

2270
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:59.200
Now is Mortimer lord of London.

2271
02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:04.570
I charge and command that, at the city's cost,

2272
02:32:04.570 --> 02:32:06.970
the pissing-conduit run nothing but

2273
02:32:06.970 --> 02:32:12.500
claret wine this first year of our reign.

2274
02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:16.270
And henceforward it shall be treason

2275
02:32:16.270 --> 02:32:21.230
for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer.

2276
02:32:21.230 --> 02:32:22.470
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!

2277
02:32:22.470 --> 02:32:28.030
Knock him down there.

2278
02:32:28.030 --> 02:32:34.300
If this fellow be wise, he'll never call ye Jack Cade more:

2279
02:32:34.300 --> 02:32:37.900
I think he hath a very fair warning. My lord,

2280
02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:43.000
there's an army gathered together in Smithfield.

2281
02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:49.970
Come, then, let's go fight with them; but first, go

2282
02:32:49.970 --> 02:32:53.930
and set London bridge on fire; and, if you can,

2283
02:32:53.930 --> 02:32:59.000
burn down the Tower too. Come, let's away.

2284
02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:29.700
So, sirs: now go some and pull down the Savoy;

2285
02:34:29.700 --> 02:34:33.930
others to the inns of court; down with them all.

2286
02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:01.870
I have a suit unto your lordship.

2287
02:36:01.870 --> 02:36:05.400
Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.

2288
02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:09.630
Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.

2289
02:36:09.630 --> 02:36:12.500
Mass, 'twill be sore law, then;

2290
02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:14.300
for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear,

2291
02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:15.100
and 'tis not whole yet.

2292
02:36:15.100 --> 02:36:16.530
Nay, John, it will be stinking law

2293
02:36:16.530 --> 02:36:19.770
for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.

2294
02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:25.000
I have thought upon it, it shall be so.

2295
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:30.170
Away, burn all the records of the realm:

2296
02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:35.930
my mouth shall be the parliament of England.

2297
02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:40.070
Then we are like to have biting statutes,

2298
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:42.300
unless his teeth be pulled out.

2299
02:36:42.300 --> 02:36:50.830
And henceforward all things shall be in common.

2300
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:54.900
My lord, a prize, a prize! here's the Lord Say,

2301
02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:57.830
which sold the towns in France; he that made us pay

2302
02:36:57.830 --> 02:37:01.070
one and twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the pound,

2303
02:37:01.070 --> 02:37:02.530
the last subsidy.

2304
02:37:02.530 --> 02:37:06.930
Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.

2305
02:37:29.330 --> 02:37:37.970
thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord!

2306
02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:47.970
now art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction regal.

2307
02:37:47.970 --> 02:37:50.200
What canst thou answer to my majesty

2308
02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:53.600
for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur kiss my backside,

2309
02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:57.670
the dauphin of France?

2310
02:37:57.670 --> 02:38:01.430
Be it known unto thee by these presence,

2311
02:38:01.430 --> 02:38:05.130
even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom

2312
02:38:05.130 --> 02:38:06.470
that must sweep the court clean

2313
02:38:06.470 --> 02:38:12.100
of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously

2314
02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:17.270
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school;

2315
02:38:17.270 --> 02:38:19.230
and whereas, before, our forefathers

2316
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:22.000
had no other books but the score and the tally,

2317
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.230
thou hast caused printing to be used,

2318
02:38:25.230 --> 02:38:28.300
and contrary to the king, his crown and dignity,

2319
02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:32.730
thou hast built a paper-mill.

2320
02:38:32.730 --> 02:38:36.870
It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee

2321
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:39.470
that usually speak of a noun and a verb,

2322
02:38:39.470 --> 02:38:40.800
and such abominable words

2323
02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:44.300
as no Christian ear can endure to hear.

2324
02:38:44.300 --> 02:38:47.030
Thou hast appointed justices of peace,

2325
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:50.030
to call poor men before them

2326
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:52.370
about matters they were not able to answer.

2327
02:38:52.370 --> 02:38:54.900
Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because

2328
02:38:54.900 --> 02:39:02.130
they could not read, thou hast hanged them;

2329
02:39:02.130 --> 02:39:03.630
when, indeed, only for that cause

2330
02:39:03.630 --> 02:39:08.330
they have been most worthy to live.

2331
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:15.430
Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?

2332
02:39:15.430 --> 02:39:16.630
What of that?

2333
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:22.570
Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a cloak,

2334
02:39:22.570 --> 02:39:25.830
when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets.

2335
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:29.970
And work in their shirt; as myself, for example,

2336
02:39:29.970 --> 02:39:32.730
that am a butcher.

2337
02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:35.830
You men of Kent,--

2338
02:39:35.830 --> 02:39:38.430
What say you of Kent?

2339
02:39:38.430 --> 02:39:42.930
Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'

2340
02:39:42.930 --> 02:39:46.930
Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.

2341
02:39:48.900 --> 02:39:54.070
Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.

2342
02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:17.670
Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,

2343
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:25.200
Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle:

2344
02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:28.630
Sweet is the country, because full of riches;

2345
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:36.070
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;

2346
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:42.630
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.

2347
02:40:42.630 --> 02:40:48.130
I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,

2348
02:40:48.130 --> 02:40:52.800
Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.

2349
02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:58.030
Justice with favour have I always done;

2350
02:40:58.030 --> 02:41:05.100
Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.

2351
02:41:05.100 --> 02:41:09.500
When have I aught exacted at your hands,

2352
02:41:09.500 --> 02:41:15.570
But to maintain the king, the realm and you?

2353
02:41:15.570 --> 02:41:18.570
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,

2354
02:41:18.570 --> 02:41:21.200
Because my book preferr'd me to the king,

2355
02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:24.530
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,

2356
02:41:24.530 --> 02:41:27.970
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,

2357
02:41:27.970 --> 02:41:32.130
Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,

2358
02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:38.000
You cannot but forbear to murder me:

2359
02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:41.100
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings

2360
02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:42.670
For your behoof,--

2361
02:41:42.670 --> 02:41:45.170
Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?

2362
02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.370
Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck

2363
02:41:51.370 --> 02:41:54.500
Those that I never saw and struck them dead.

2364
02:41:54.500 --> 02:41:58.170
O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?

2365
02:41:58.170 --> 02:42:03.670
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.

2366
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:08.900
Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.

2367
02:42:08.900 --> 02:42:13.870
Long sitting to determine poor men's causes

2368
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:17.530
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.

2369
02:42:17.530 --> 02:42:21.970
Why dost thou quiver, man?

2370
02:42:21.970 --> 02:42:25.570
The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.

2371
02:42:25.570 --> 02:42:34.770
Nay, he nods at us, as who should say,

2372
02:42:34.770 --> 02:42:40.000
I'll be even with them:

2373
02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:41.530
I'll see if his head will stand steadier

2374
02:42:41.530 --> 02:42:48.230
on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.

2375
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:58.400
Tell me wherein have I offended most?

2376
02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:04.730
Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.

2377
02:43:04.730 --> 02:43:09.500
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?

2378
02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:15.030
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?

2379
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:23.370
Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?

2380
02:43:23.370 --> 02:43:27.170
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,

2381
02:43:27.170 --> 02:43:32.570
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.

2382
02:43:32.570 --> 02:43:43.570
O, let me live!

2383
02:43:43.570 --> 02:43:48.630
I feel remorse in myself with his words;

2384
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:53.270
but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be

2385
02:43:53.270 --> 02:44:00.500
but for pleading so well for his life. Away with him!

2386
02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:05.100
he has a familiar under his tongue;

2387
02:44:05.100 --> 02:44:07.800
he speaks not o' God's name.

2388
02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:08.970
Go, take him away, I say, and strike

2389
02:44:08.970 --> 02:44:12.830
off his head presently; and then break into his

2390
02:44:12.830 --> 02:44:17.630
son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer,

2391
02:44:17.630 --> 02:44:19.930
and strike off his head,

2392
02:44:19.930 --> 02:44:24.100
and bring them both upon two poles hither.

2393
02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:27.300
It shall be done.

2394
02:44:28.530 --> 02:44:33.700
Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,

2395
02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:37.370
God should be so obdurate as yourselves,

2396
02:44:37.370 --> 02:44:44.070
How would it fare with your departed souls?

2397
02:44:44.430 --> 02:44:48.370
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.

2398
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:50.830
Away with him! and do as I command ye.

2399
02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:57.030
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear

2400
02:44:57.030 --> 02:45:01.670
a head on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute;

2401
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:03.700
there shall not a maid be married,

2402
02:45:03.700 --> 02:45:04.770
but she shall pay to me

2403
02:45:04.770 --> 02:45:09.300
her maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold of

2404
02:45:09.300 --> 02:45:16.030
me in capite; and we charge and command that their

2405
02:45:16.030 --> 02:45:27.400
wives shall be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.

2406
02:45:31.530 --> 02:45:35.270
My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside

2407
02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:39.770
to take up commodities upon our bills?

2408
02:45:39.770 --> 02:45:41.670
Marry, presently.

2409
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:44.730
O, brave!

2410
02:45:47.770 --> 02:45:57.800
But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,

2411
02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:03.000
But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,

2412
02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:06.530
for they loved well when they were alive.

2413
02:46:06.530 --> 02:46:09.400
Now part them again, lest they consult about the giving up of

2414
02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:16.870
some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the spoil

2415
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:21.230
of the city until night: for with these borne before us,

2416
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:24.470
instead of maces, will we ride through

2417
02:46:24.470 --> 02:46:36.430
the streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!

2418
02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:45.130
Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill

2419
02:46:45.130 --> 02:46:48.000
and knock down! throw them into Thames!

2420
02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.570
(trumpets)

2421
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:53.770
What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold

2422
02:46:53.770 --> 02:46:56.500
to sound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?

2423
02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:01.870
Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee:

2424
02:47:01.870 --> 02:47:05.330
Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king

2425
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:08.500
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;

2426
02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:10.830
And here pronounce free pardon to them all

2427
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:13.430
That will forsake thee and go home in peace.

2428
02:47:13.430 --> 02:47:17.830
What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,

2429
02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:20.870
And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;

2430
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:24.330
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?

2431
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:28.700
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,

2432
02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:32.500
Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'

2433
02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:36.500
Who hateth him and honours not his father,

2434
02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:40.730
Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,

2435
02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:45.530
Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.

2436
02:47:45.530 --> 02:47:50.830
God save the king! God save the king!

2437
02:47:50.830 --> 02:47:54.200
What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave?

2438
02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.530
And you, base peasants, do ye believe him?

2439
02:47:57.530 --> 02:48:01.670
will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?

2440
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:04.270
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,

2441
02:48:04.270 --> 02:48:06.100
that you should leave me at the White Hart in

2442
02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:09.700
Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out

2443
02:48:09.700 --> 02:48:11.700
these arms till you had recovered your ancient

2444
02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:17.130
freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,

2445
02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:22.470
and delight to live in slavery to the nobility.

2446
02:48:22.470 --> 02:48:27.170
Let them break your backs with burthens, take your

2447
02:48:27.170 --> 02:48:30.800
houses over your heads, ravish your wives

2448
02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.930
and daughters before your faces: as for me,

2449
02:48:34.930 --> 02:48:36.700
I will make shift for one;

2450
02:48:36.700 --> 02:48:38.900
and so, God's curse light upon you all!

2451
02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:42.500
We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!

2452
02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:45.600
Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,

2453
02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:49.400
That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?

2454
02:48:49.400 --> 02:48:52.100
Will he conduct you through the heart of France,

2455
02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:57.070
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?

2456
02:48:57.070 --> 02:49:01.230
Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,

2457
02:49:01.230 --> 02:49:05.000
The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,

2458
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.570
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?

2459
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:11.900
Methinks already in this civil broil

2460
02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:15.830
I see them lording it in London streets,

2461
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:20.170
Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.

2462
02:49:20.170 --> 02:49:25.070
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry

2463
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:29.800
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.

2464
02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:34.970
To France, to France, and get what you have lost;

2465
02:49:34.970 --> 02:49:40.270
Spare England, for it is your native coast;

2466
02:49:40.270 --> 02:49:45.930
Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;

2467
02:49:45.930 --> 02:49:50.930
God on our side, doubt not of victory.

2468
02:49:50.930 --> 02:49:57.330
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.

2469
02:50:01.270 --> 02:50:05.700
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro

2470
02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:11.230
as this multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them

2471
02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:20.170
to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me desolate.

2472
02:50:20.170 --> 02:50:25.500
I see them lay their heads together to surprise me.

2473
02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:30.170
My sword make way for me, for here is no staying.

2474
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:32.330
In despite of the devils and hell,

2475
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:34.800
have through the very middest of you?

2476
02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:38.230
What, is he fled? Go some, and follow him;

2477
02:50:38.230 --> 02:50:39.630
And he that brings his head unto the king

2478
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:41.300
Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.

2479
02:50:57.500 --> 02:51:00.730
Follow me, soldiers: we'll devise a mean

2480
02:51:00.730 --> 02:51:04.330
To reconcile you all unto the king.

2481
02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:48.430
Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,

2482
02:51:48.430 --> 02:51:52.670
And could command no more content than I?

2483
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:55.470
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle

2484
02:51:55.470 --> 02:52:00.070
But I was made a king, at nine months old.

2485
02:52:00.070 --> 02:52:01.530
Was never subject long'd to be a king

2486
02:52:01.530 --> 02:52:05.570
As I do long and wish to be a subject.

2487
02:52:05.570 --> 02:52:07.570
Health and glad tidings to your majesty!

2488
02:52:07.570 --> 02:52:10.630
Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?

2489
02:52:10.630 --> 02:52:12.170
Or is he but retired to make him strong?

2490
02:52:12.170 --> 02:52:15.870
He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield;

2491
02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:18.770
And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,

2492
02:52:18.770 --> 02:52:21.500
Expect your highness' doom of life or death.

2493
02:52:21.500 --> 02:52:23.870
Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,

2494
02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:27.030
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!

2495
02:52:27.330 --> 02:52:30.670
Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,

2496
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:33.500
And show'd how well you love your prince and country:

2497
02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:36.500
Continue still in this so good a mind,

2498
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:38.400
And Henry, though he be infortunate,

2499
02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:41.930
Assure yourselves, will never be unkind:

2500
02:52:41.930 --> 02:52:44.400
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,

2501
02:52:44.400 --> 02:52:46.970
I do dismiss you to your several countries.

2502
02:52:46.970 --> 02:52:56.130
God save the king! God save the king!

2503
02:52:56.130 --> 02:52:57.770
Please it your grace to be advertised

2504
02:52:57.770 --> 02:53:00.200
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,

2505
02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:01.670
And with a puissant and a mighty force

2506
02:53:01.670 --> 02:53:03.370
Of gallowglasses and stout kerns

2507
02:53:03.370 --> 02:53:05.930
Is marching hitherward in proud array,

2508
02:53:05.930 --> 02:53:07.730
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,

2509
02:53:07.730 --> 02:53:09.500
His arms are only to remove from thee

2510
02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:13.800
The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.

2511
02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:18.030
Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.

2512
02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:20.670
Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,

2513
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:23.130
Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:

2514
02:53:23.130 --> 02:53:25.400
But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;

2515
02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:27.930
And now is York in arms to second him.

2516
02:53:27.930 --> 02:53:29.670
I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,

2517
02:53:29.670 --> 02:53:32.770
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.

2518
02:53:32.770 --> 02:53:35.270
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;

2519
02:53:35.270 --> 02:53:36.900
And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,

2520
02:53:36.900 --> 02:53:39.900
Until his army be dismiss'd from him.

2521
02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:42.200
I will yield my lord to prison willingly,

2522
02:53:42.200 --> 02:53:46.100
Or unto death, to do my country good.

2523
02:53:46.370 --> 02:53:47.870
In any case, be not too rough in terms;

2524
02:53:47.870 --> 02:53:50.200
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.

2525
02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:53.370
I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal

2526
02:53:53.370 --> 02:53:57.630
As all things shall redound unto your good.

2527
02:54:11.070 --> 02:54:15.570
Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;

2528
02:54:15.570 --> 02:54:20.430
For yet may England curse my wretched reign.

2529
02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:48.970
Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,

2530
02:54:48.970 --> 02:54:56.200
and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me

2531
02:54:56.200 --> 02:54:58.770
in these woods and durst not peep out,

2532
02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:06.070
for all the country is laid for me; but now

2533
02:55:06.070 --> 02:55:09.700
am I so hungry that if I might have a lease of my life

2534
02:55:09.700 --> 02:55:13.470
for a thousand years I could stay no longer.

2535
02:55:13.470 --> 02:55:17.770
Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden,

2536
02:55:17.770 --> 02:55:22.000
to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while,

2537
02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.430
which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach

2538
02:55:26.430 --> 02:55:32.370
this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'

2539
02:55:32.370 --> 02:55:38.130
was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a

2540
02:55:38.130 --> 02:55:41.100
sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill;

2541
02:55:41.100 --> 02:55:46.770
and many a time, when I have been dry and

2542
02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:50.030
bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a

2543
02:55:50.030 --> 02:56:01.770
quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'

2544
02:56:01.770 --> 02:56:04.300
must serve me to feed on.

2545
02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:21.400
Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,

2546
02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:26.770
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?

2547
02:56:35.970 --> 02:56:39.500
This small inheritance my father left me

2548
02:56:39.500 --> 02:56:45.830
Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.

2549
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:49.630
I seek not to wax great by others' waning,

2550
02:56:49.630 --> 02:56:53.900
Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:

2551
02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:58.330
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state

2552
02:56:58.330 --> 02:57:02.170
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.

2553
02:57:04.670 --> 02:57:07.370
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray,

2554
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:15.630
for entering his fee-simple without leave.

2555
02:57:15.630 --> 02:57:22.900
Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand

2556
02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:28.430
crowns of the king carrying my head to him:

2557
02:57:28.430 --> 02:57:31.700
but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow

2558
02:57:31.700 --> 02:57:35.830
my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.

2559
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:40.270
Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,

2560
02:57:40.270 --> 02:57:42.630
I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?

2561
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:47.030
Is't not enough to break into my garden,

2562
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:48.830
And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,

2563
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:51.800
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,

2564
02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:55.030
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?

2565
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:58.530
Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was broached,

2566
02:57:58.530 --> 02:58:10.700
and beard thee too. Look on me well:

2567
02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:15.430
I have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou

2568
02:58:15.430 --> 02:58:19.830
and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all

2569
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:25.730
as dead as a doornails, I pray God I may never eat grass more.

2570
02:58:25.730 --> 02:58:31.570
Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,

2571
02:58:31.570 --> 02:58:35.730
That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,

2572
02:58:35.730 --> 02:58:38.500
Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.

2573
02:58:41.270 --> 02:58:47.230
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,

2574
02:58:47.230 --> 02:58:51.300
See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:

2575
02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:56.430
Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;

2576
02:58:56.430 --> 02:59:00.230
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,

2577
02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:04.300
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;

2578
02:59:04.300 --> 02:59:10.500
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;

2579
02:59:10.500 --> 02:59:14.500
And if mine arm be heaved in the air,

2580
02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:21.800
Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.

2581
02:59:21.800 --> 02:59:29.430
As for words, whose greatness answers words,

2582
02:59:29.430 --> 02:59:36.030
Let this my sword report what speech forbears.

2583
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:40.670
By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I

2584
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:48.700
heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out

2585
02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:52.670
this burly-boned clown in chines of beef

2586
02:59:52.670 --> 02:59:55.030
ere thou sleep in thy sheath,

2587
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:58.770
I beseech God on my knees thou

2588
02:59:58.770 --> 03:00:02.130
mayst be turned to hobnails.

2589
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:27.300
O, I am slain!

2590
03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:39.900
famine and no other hath slain me:

2591
03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:47.200
let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me

2592
03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:53.070
but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them all.

2593
03:01:00.530 --> 03:01:05.600
Wither, garden; and be henceforth

2594
03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:10.830
a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,

2595
03:01:10.830 --> 03:01:17.270
because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.

2596
03:01:17.570 --> 03:01:23.330
Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?

2597
03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:33.800
Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell

2598
03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:39.570
Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort

2599
03:01:39.570 --> 03:01:46.170
all the world to be cowards; for I, that never feared any,

2600
03:01:46.170 --> 03:01:54.270
am vanquished by famine, not by valour.

2601
03:01:54.270 --> 03:01:59.800
How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.

2602
03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:08.930
Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;

2603
03:02:08.930 --> 03:02:13.130
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,

2604
03:02:13.130 --> 03:02:18.700
So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.

2605
03:02:22.300 --> 03:02:24.770
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels

2606
03:02:24.770 --> 03:02:29.570
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,

2607
03:02:29.570 --> 03:02:34.900
And there cut off thy most ungracious head;

2608
03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:39.300
Which I will bear in triumph to the king,

2609
03:02:39.300 --> 03:02:48.900
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

2610
03:02:54.930 --> 03:03:09.930
(trumpets and drums sound)

2611
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:38.030
From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,

2612
03:03:38.030 --> 03:03:42.270
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:

2613
03:03:42.270 --> 03:03:48.630
Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,

2614
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:54.000
To entertain great England's lawful king.

2615
03:03:54.000 --> 03:04:01.000
Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?

2616
03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:06.300
Let them obey that know not how to rule;

2617
03:04:06.300 --> 03:04:11.430
This hand was made to handle naught but gold.

2618
03:04:11.430 --> 03:04:13.430
I cannot give due action to my words,

2619
03:04:13.430 --> 03:04:16.670
Except a sword or sceptre balance it:

2620
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:21.830
A sceptre shall it have, have I a sword,

2621
03:04:22.130 --> 03:04:28.970
On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.

2622
03:04:28.970 --> 03:04:33.070
Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?

2623
03:04:33.070 --> 03:04:39.270
The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.

2624
03:04:39.270 --> 03:04:43.600
York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.

2625
03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:48.300
Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.

2626
03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:50.970
Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?

2627
03:04:50.970 --> 03:04:52.630
A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,

2628
03:04:52.630 --> 03:04:55.930
To know the reason of these arms in peace;

2629
03:04:55.930 --> 03:04:58.670
Or why thou, being a subject as I am,

2630
03:04:58.670 --> 03:05:00.830
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,

2631
03:05:00.830 --> 03:05:03.870
Should raise so great a power without his leave,

2632
03:05:04.270 --> 03:05:08.030
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.

2633
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:14.470
Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:

2634
03:05:14.470 --> 03:05:15.930
O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,

2635
03:05:15.930 --> 03:05:20.270
I am so angry at these abject terms;

2636
03:05:20.270 --> 03:05:25.330
But I must make fair weather yet a while,

2637
03:05:25.330 --> 03:05:31.130
Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--

2638
03:05:31.130 --> 03:05:33.930
Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,

2639
03:05:33.930 --> 03:05:36.570
That I have given no answer all this while;

2640
03:05:36.570 --> 03:05:40.530
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.

2641
03:05:40.530 --> 03:05:44.170
The cause why I have brought this army hither

2642
03:05:44.170 --> 03:05:47.830
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,

2643
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:49.600
Seditious to his grace and to the state.

2644
03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:54.700
That is too much presumption on thy part:

2645
03:05:54.700 --> 03:05:56.130
But if thy arms be to no other end,

2646
03:05:56.130 --> 03:05:59.700
The king hath yielded unto thy demand:

2647
03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:03.270
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.

2648
03:06:05.730 --> 03:06:08.570
Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?

2649
03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:12.770
Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.

2650
03:06:19.300 --> 03:06:24.870
Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.

2651
03:06:24.870 --> 03:06:29.900
Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;

2652
03:06:29.900 --> 03:06:32.400
Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,

2653
03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:36.170
You shall have pay and every thing you wish.

2654
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:39.570
And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,

2655
03:06:39.570 --> 03:06:43.030
Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,

2656
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:46.230
As pledges of my fealty and love;

2657
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:48.600
I'll send them all as willing as I live:

2658
03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.970
Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,

2659
03:06:50.970 --> 03:06:54.770
Is his to use, so Somerset may die.

2660
03:06:54.770 --> 03:06:58.570
York, I commend this kind submission:

2661
03:06:59.370 --> 03:07:01.870
(horns sound)

2662
03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.030
In all submission and humility

2663
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:12.830
York doth present himself unto your highness.

2664
03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:16.200
Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?

2665
03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:19.200
To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,

2666
03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:22.500
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,

2667
03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:24.700
Who since I heard to be discomfited.

2668
03:07:24.700 --> 03:07:27.270
If one so rude and of so mean disposition

2669
03:07:27.270 --> 03:07:29.930
May pass into the presence of a king,

2670
03:07:29.930 --> 03:07:32.930
Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,

2671
03:07:32.930 --> 03:07:36.400
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.

2672
03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:39.370
The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!

2673
03:07:39.370 --> 03:07:41.830
O, let me view his visage, being dead,

2674
03:07:41.830 --> 03:07:44.430
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.

2675
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:52.930
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?

2676
03:07:52.930 --> 03:07:55.270
I was, an't like your majesty.

2677
03:07:55.270 --> 03:07:57.100
How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?

2678
03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:00.700
Alexander Iden, that's my name;

2679
03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:03.370
A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.

2680
03:08:03.370 --> 03:08:05.400
So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss

2681
03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:08.500
He were created knight for his good service.

2682
03:08:08.500 --> 03:08:11.130
Iden, kneel down.

2683
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:18.930
Rise up a knight.

2684
03:08:20.670 --> 03:08:22.770
We give thee for reward a thousand marks,

2685
03:08:22.770 --> 03:08:24.570
And will that thou henceforth attend on us.

2686
03:08:24.570 --> 03:08:26.800
May Iden live to merit such a bounty.

2687
03:08:26.800 --> 03:08:31.030
And never live but true unto his liege!

2688
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:33.200
See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:

2689
03:08:33.200 --> 03:08:34.530
Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.

2690
03:08:34.530 --> 03:08:37.570
For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,

2691
03:08:37.570 --> 03:08:41.030
But boldly stand and front him to his face.

2692
03:08:42.270 --> 03:08:48.930
How now! is Somerset at liberty?

2693
03:08:48.930 --> 03:08:54.070
Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,

2694
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:57.130
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.

2695
03:08:57.130 --> 03:09:01.330
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?

2696
03:09:01.330 --> 03:09:05.800
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,

2697
03:09:05.800 --> 03:09:09.700
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?

2698
03:09:09.700 --> 03:09:16.130
King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,

2699
03:09:16.130 --> 03:09:18.970
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,

2700
03:09:18.970 --> 03:09:24.570
Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.

2701
03:09:24.570 --> 03:09:27.730
That head of thine doth not become a crown;

2702
03:09:27.730 --> 03:09:30.700
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,

2703
03:09:30.700 --> 03:09:34.800
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.

2704
03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:40.600
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,

2705
03:09:40.600 --> 03:09:44.130
Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,

2706
03:09:44.130 --> 03:09:47.030
Is able with the change to kill and cure.

2707
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:49.600
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up

2708
03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:53.600
And with the same to act controlling laws.

2709
03:09:53.600 --> 03:09:58.600
Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more

2710
03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:02.170
O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.

2711
03:10:02.170 --> 03:10:09.270
O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,

2712
03:10:09.270 --> 03:10:12.870
Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;

2713
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:20.730
Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.

2714
03:10:22.330 --> 03:10:31.000
Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,

2715
03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:35.900
If they can brook I bow a knee to man.

2716
03:10:36.200 --> 03:10:41.270
Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;

2717
03:10:41.270 --> 03:10:44.170
I know, ere they will have me go to ward,

2718
03:10:44.170 --> 03:10:47.230
They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.

2719
03:10:47.230 --> 03:10:50.430
Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,

2720
03:10:50.430 --> 03:10:53.470
To say if that the bastard boys of York

2721
03:10:53.470 --> 03:10:58.170
Shall be the surety for their traitor father.

2722
03:10:58.170 --> 03:11:02.770
O blood-besotted Neapolitan,

2723
03:11:02.770 --> 03:11:09.400
Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!

2724
03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:12.300
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,

2725
03:11:12.300 --> 03:11:15.830
Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those

2726
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:20.830
That for my surety will refuse the boys!

2727
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:26.300
See where they come: I'll warrant they'll make it good.

2728
03:11:26.300 --> 03:11:31.930
And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.

2729
03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:41.070
Health and all happiness to my lord the king!

2730
03:11:41.070 --> 03:11:45.070
I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?

2731
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:48.330
Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;

2732
03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:53.930
We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;

2733
03:11:53.930 --> 03:11:58.070
For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.

2734
03:11:58.070 --> 03:12:03.230
This is my king, York, I do not mistake;

2735
03:12:03.230 --> 03:12:07.800
But thou mistakest me much to think I do:

2736
03:12:07.800 --> 03:12:10.700
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?

2737
03:12:10.700 --> 03:12:12.830
Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour

2738
03:12:12.830 --> 03:12:14.800
Makes him oppose himself against his king.

2739
03:12:14.800 --> 03:12:16.870
He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,

2740
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:18.670
And chop away that factious pate of his.

2741
03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:22.530
He is arrested, but will not obey;

2742
03:12:22.530 --> 03:12:26.470
His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.

2743
03:12:26.470 --> 03:12:29.500
Will you not, sons?

2744
03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:31.900
Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.

2745
03:12:31.900 --> 03:12:37.030
And if words will not, then our weapons shall.

2746
03:12:37.330 --> 03:12:43.970
Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!

2747
03:12:43.970 --> 03:12:48.370
Look in a glass, and call thy image so:

2748
03:12:48.370 --> 03:12:54.500
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.

2749
03:12:55.830 --> 03:13:00.870
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,

2750
03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:03.670
That with the very shaking of their chains

2751
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:08.400
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:

2752
03:13:08.400 --> 03:13:10.830
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.

2753
03:13:27.800 --> 03:13:36.130
Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.

2754
03:13:36.130 --> 03:13:38.470
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,

2755
03:13:38.470 --> 03:13:41.430
If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.

2756
03:13:41.430 --> 03:13:43.970
Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur

2757
03:13:43.970 --> 03:13:46.830
Run back and bite, because he was withheld;

2758
03:13:46.830 --> 03:13:50.270
Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,

2759
03:13:50.270 --> 03:13:53.970
Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:

2760
03:13:53.970 --> 03:13:56.170
And such a piece of service will you do,

2761
03:13:56.170 --> 03:13:58.730
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.

2762
03:13:58.730 --> 03:14:02.570
Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,

2763
03:14:02.570 --> 03:14:04.670
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!

2764
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:10.100
Nay, we shall heed you thoroughly anon.

2765
03:14:10.100 --> 03:14:15.200
Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.

2766
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:20.100
Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?

2767
03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:22.830
Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,

2768
03:14:22.830 --> 03:14:26.900
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!

2769
03:14:26.900 --> 03:14:30.900
O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?

2770
03:14:30.900 --> 03:14:32.470
If it be banish'd from the frosty head,

2771
03:14:32.470 --> 03:14:36.570
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?

2772
03:14:36.570 --> 03:14:38.530
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,

2773
03:14:38.530 --> 03:14:42.470
And shame thine honourable age with blood?

2774
03:14:42.470 --> 03:14:44.330
Why art thou old, and want'st experience?

2775
03:14:44.330 --> 03:14:48.070
Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?

2776
03:14:48.070 --> 03:14:50.800
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me

2777
03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:53.630
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.

2778
03:14:53.630 --> 03:14:55.370
My lord, I have consider'd with myself

2779
03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:58.900
The title of this most renowned duke;

2780
03:14:58.900 --> 03:15:01.130
And in my conscience do repute his grace

2781
03:15:01.130 --> 03:15:04.400
The rightful heir to England's royal seat.

2782
03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:06.570
Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?

2783
03:15:06.570 --> 03:15:09.770
I have.

2784
03:15:09.770 --> 03:15:12.270
Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?

2785
03:15:12.270 --> 03:15:16.730
It is great sin to swear unto a sin,

2786
03:15:16.730 --> 03:15:21.130
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.

2787
03:15:21.130 --> 03:15:22.970
Who shall be bound by any solemn vow

2788
03:15:22.970 --> 03:15:26.100
To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,

2789
03:15:26.100 --> 03:15:28.970
To force a spotless virgin's chastity,

2790
03:15:28.970 --> 03:15:31.070
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,

2791
03:15:31.070 --> 03:15:34.430
To wring the widow from her custom'd right,

2792
03:15:34.430 --> 03:15:36.770
And have no other reason for this wrong

2793
03:15:36.770 --> 03:15:39.970
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?

2794
03:15:39.970 --> 03:15:47.100
A subtle traitor needs no sophister.

2795
03:15:47.100 --> 03:15:48.600
Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.

2796
03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:55.100
Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,

2797
03:15:55.100 --> 03:16:01.830
Both thou and they shall curse this fatal hour.

2798
03:16:01.830 --> 03:16:06.670
I am resolved for death or dignity.

2799
03:16:06.670 --> 03:16:10.770
The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.

2800
03:16:10.770 --> 03:16:13.570
You were best to go to bed and dream again,

2801
03:16:13.570 --> 03:16:16.970
To keep thee from the tempest of the field.

2802
03:16:16.970 --> 03:16:20.330
I am resolved to bear a greater storm

2803
03:16:20.330 --> 03:16:22.730
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;

2804
03:16:22.730 --> 03:16:26.330
And so to arms, victorious father,

2805
03:16:26.330 --> 03:16:28.730
To quell the rebels and their complices.

2806
03:16:28.730 --> 03:16:32.000
Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,

2807
03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.500
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.

2808
03:16:34.500 --> 03:16:37.400
Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.

2809
03:16:37.400 --> 03:16:40.630
If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.

2810
03:16:41.900 --> 03:16:46.230
(drums sounding)

2811
03:16:54.330 --> 03:16:59.030
Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:

2812
03:16:59.030 --> 03:17:02.200
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,

2813
03:17:02.200 --> 03:17:05.530
Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum

2814
03:17:05.530 --> 03:17:10.500
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,

2815
03:17:10.500 --> 03:17:14.730
Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:

2816
03:17:15.930 --> 03:17:20.800
Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,

2817
03:17:20.800 --> 03:17:24.800
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.

2818
03:17:31.870 --> 03:17:36.800
Of one or both of us the time is come.

2819
03:17:36.800 --> 03:17:42.100
Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,

2820
03:17:42.100 --> 03:17:45.370
For I myself must hunt this deer to death.

2821
03:17:45.370 --> 03:17:49.830
Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.

2822
03:17:50.970 --> 03:17:53.970
As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,

2823
03:17:53.970 --> 03:17:58.870
It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.

2824
03:18:03.270 --> 03:18:06.800
What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?

2825
03:18:06.800 --> 03:18:09.130
With thy brave bearing should I be in love,

2826
03:18:09.130 --> 03:18:11.600
But that thou art so fast mine enemy.

2827
03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:15.300
Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,

2828
03:18:15.300 --> 03:18:19.370
But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.

2829
03:18:19.370 --> 03:18:21.970
So let it help me now against thy sword

2830
03:18:21.970 --> 03:18:25.330
As I in justice and true right express it.

2831
03:18:25.330 --> 03:18:30.370
My soul and body on the action both!

2832
03:18:30.370 --> 03:18:34.400
A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.

2833
03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:37.200
The end crowns all.

2834
03:20:46.930 --> 03:20:55.430
Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.

2835
03:20:55.430 --> 03:20:59.930
Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!

2836
03:21:02.430 --> 03:21:05.830
(battle cries)

2837
03:21:06.970 --> 03:21:11.070
Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;

2838
03:21:11.070 --> 03:21:14.070
Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds

2839
03:21:14.070 --> 03:21:18.230
Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,

2840
03:21:18.230 --> 03:21:21.830
Whom angry heavens do make their minister

2841
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:24.200
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part

2842
03:21:24.200 --> 03:21:28.100
Hot coals of vengeance!

2843
03:21:31.800 --> 03:21:35.670
Let no soldier fly. He that is truly dedicate to war

2844
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:38.630
Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself

2845
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:40.870
Hath not essentially but by circumstance

2846
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:45.730
The name of valour.

2847
03:21:54.900 --> 03:21:57.070
O, let the vile world end,

2848
03:21:57.070 --> 03:21:58.830
And the premised flames of the last day

2849
03:21:58.830 --> 03:22:02.600
Knit earth and heaven together!

2850
03:22:02.600 --> 03:22:05.370
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,

2851
03:22:05.370 --> 03:22:07.370
Particularities and petty sounds

2852
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:09.030
To cease!

2853
03:22:18.130 --> 03:22:21.230
Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,

2854
03:22:21.230 --> 03:22:24.100
To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve

2855
03:22:24.100 --> 03:22:27.100
The silver livery of advised age,

2856
03:22:27.100 --> 03:22:29.800
And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus

2857
03:22:29.800 --> 03:22:37.630
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight

2858
03:22:37.630 --> 03:22:42.930
My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,

2859
03:22:42.930 --> 03:22:49.070
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;

2860
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:55.600
No more will I their babes: tears virginal

2861
03:22:55.600 --> 03:22:59.970
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,

2862
03:22:59.970 --> 03:23:04.500
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims

2863
03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:09.630
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.

2864
03:23:09.630 --> 03:23:14.200
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:

2865
03:23:14.200 --> 03:23:15.970
Meet I an infant of the house of York,

2866
03:23:15.970 --> 03:23:18.500
Into as many gobbets will I cut it

2867
03:23:18.500 --> 03:23:22.930
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:

2868
03:23:22.930 --> 03:23:27.830
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.

2869
03:23:31.230 --> 03:23:37.830
Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:

2870
03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:44.830
As did AEneas old Anchises bear,

2871
03:23:44.830 --> 03:23:50.100
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;

2872
03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:59.770
But then AEneas bare a living load,

2873
03:23:59.770 --> 03:24:03.000
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.

2874
03:24:56.900 --> 03:25:00.230
So, lie thou there;

2875
03:25:03.100 --> 03:25:05.670
For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,

2876
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:09.000
The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset

2877
03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:12.070
Hath made the wizard famous in his death.

2878
03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:17.030
Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:

2879
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:21.100
Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.

2880
03:26:00.930 --> 03:26:08.330
Away, my lord! you are slow; for shame, away!

2881
03:26:08.330 --> 03:26:12.900
Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.

2882
03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:17.500
What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:

2883
03:26:17.500 --> 03:26:20.230
Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,

2884
03:26:20.230 --> 03:26:22.930
To give the enemy way, and to secure us

2885
03:26:22.930 --> 03:26:27.570
By what we can, which can no more but fly.

2886
03:26:27.570 --> 03:26:30.170
If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom

2887
03:26:30.170 --> 03:26:32.970
Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,

2888
03:26:32.970 --> 03:26:35.730
As well we may, if not through your neglect,

2889
03:26:35.730 --> 03:26:38.900
We shall to London get, where you are loved

2890
03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:41.900
And where this breach now in our fortunes made

2891
03:26:41.900 --> 03:26:43.530
May readily be stopp'd.

2892
03:26:43.530 --> 03:26:45.530
But that my heart's on future mischief set,

2893
03:26:45.530 --> 03:26:48.200
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:

2894
03:26:48.200 --> 03:26:50.800
But fly you must; uncurable discomfit

2895
03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:54.030
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.

2896
03:26:54.030 --> 03:26:55.730
Away, for your relief! and we will live

2897
03:26:55.730 --> 03:26:58.530
To see their day and them our fortune give:

2898
03:26:58.530 --> 03:27:01.400
Away, my lord, away!

2899
03:27:31.770 --> 03:27:39.030
Of Salisbury, who can report of him,

2900
03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:41.630
That winter lion, who in rage forgets

2901
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:46.500
Aged contusions and all brush of time,

2902
03:27:46.500 --> 03:27:48.770
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,

2903
03:27:48.770 --> 03:27:52.770
Repairs him with occasion? This happy day

2904
03:27:52.770 --> 03:27:55.470
Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,

2905
03:27:55.470 --> 03:27:58.730
If Salisbury be lost.

2906
03:27:58.730 --> 03:27:59.800
My noble father,

2907
03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:02.370
Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,

2908
03:28:02.370 --> 03:28:05.500
Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,

2909
03:28:05.500 --> 03:28:07.400
Persuaded him from any further act:

2910
03:28:07.400 --> 03:28:10.830
But still, where danger was, still there I met him;

2911
03:28:10.830 --> 03:28:13.370
And like rich hangings in a homely house,

2912
03:28:13.370 --> 03:28:15.700
So was his will in his old feeble body.

2913
03:28:16.470 --> 03:28:18.530
(drums sound)

2914
03:28:19.230 --> 03:28:23.930
But, noble as he is, look where he comes.

2915
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:39.200
Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;

2916
03:28:39.200 --> 03:28:46.600
By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:

2917
03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:50.170
God knows how long it is I have to live;

2918
03:28:50.170 --> 03:28:53.330
And it hath pleased him that three times to-day

2919
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:57.500
You have defended me from imminent death.

2920
03:28:57.500 --> 03:29:03.830
Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:

2921
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:06.570
'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,

2922
03:29:06.570 --> 03:29:10.630
Being opposites of such repairing nature.

2923
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:13.870
I know our safety is to follow them;

2924
03:29:13.870 --> 03:29:17.570
For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,

2925
03:29:17.570 --> 03:29:20.870
To call a present court of parliament.

2926
03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:24.230
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.

2927
03:29:24.230 --> 03:29:27.030
What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?

2928
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:33.930
After them! nay, before them, if we can.

2929
03:29:33.930 --> 03:29:39.800
Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:

2930
03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:45.030
Saint Alban's battle won by famous York

2931
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:49.570
Shall be eternized in all age to come.

2932
03:29:49.570 --> 03:29:54.700
Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:

2933
03:29:54.700 --> 03:29:58.330
And more such days as these to us befall!

2934
03:29:58.330 --> 03:30:01.500
(drums sound)

2935
03:33:08.470 --> 03:33:11.470
