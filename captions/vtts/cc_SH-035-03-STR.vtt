00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.230


2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.530
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.330
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice

4
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.900
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.100
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula Walk in the orchard

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.730
and our whole discourse Is all of her;

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.600
say that thou overheard'st us;

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.870
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.830
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.800
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.900
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.630
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,

13
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.400
To listen our purpose.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.930
This is thy office; Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

15
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.470
I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

16
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.800
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.130
As we do trace this alley up and down,

18
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.670
Our talk must only be of Benedick.

19
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.570
When I do name him, let it be thy part

20
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
To praise him more than ever man did merit:

21
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830
My talk to thee must be how Benedick

22
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.400
Is sick in love with Beatrice.

23
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.130
Of this matter Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,

24
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.100
That only wounds by hearsay.

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.670
Now begin; For look where Beatrice,

26
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.330
like a lapwing, runs Close by the ground,

27
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.870
to hear our conference.

28
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.730
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish

29
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.270
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,

30
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.300
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:

31
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.070
So angle we for Beatrice;

32
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.370
who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture.

33
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.700
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

34
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.200
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.100
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.

36
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.270
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.400
I know her spirits are as coy and wild

38
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.530
As haggerds of the rock.

39
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.900
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

40
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.470
So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.

41
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.530
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

42
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.330
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;

43
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.200
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.430
To wish him wrestle with affection,

45
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.570
And never to let Beatrice know of it.

46
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.270
Why did you so?

47
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.130
Doth not the gentleman

48
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.930
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed

49
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.270
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

50
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.300
O god of love!

51
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.500
I know he doth deserve

52
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.700
As much as may be yielded to a man:

53
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.730
But Nature never framed a woman's heart

54
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.630
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;

55
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.600
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,

56
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.370
Misprising what they look on,

57
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.200
and her wit Values itself so highly that to her

58
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.500
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,

59
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.730
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,

60
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.830
She is so self-endeared.

61
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.630
Sure, I think so; And therefore certainly

62
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.800
it were not good She knew his love,

63
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800
lest she make sport at it.

64
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.100
Why, you speak truth.

65
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.600
I never yet saw man, How wise,

66
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.430
how noble, young, how rarely featured,

67
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.900
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,

68
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.930
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;

69
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.900
If black, why, Nature,

70
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.630
drawing of an antique, Made a foul blot;

71
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.330
if tall, a lance ill-headed;

72
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.970
If low, an agate very vilely cut;

73
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.170
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;

74
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.670
If silent, why, a block moved with none.

75
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.430
So turns she every man the wrong side out

76
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.100
And never gives to truth and virtue that

77
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.170
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

78
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.170
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.

79
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.000
No, not to be so odd and from all fashions

80
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.570
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:

81
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.270
But who dare tell her so?

82
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.930
If I should speak, She would mock me into air;

83
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.130
O, she would laugh me

84
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.630
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.

85
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.970
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,

86
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.700
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:

87
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.930
It were a better death than die with mocks,

88
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.530
Which is as bad as die with tickling.

89
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.930
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

90
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.930
No; rather I will go to Benedick

91
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.830
And counsel him to fight against his passion.

92
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.030
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders

93
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.130
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know

94
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.330
How much an ill word may empoison liking.

95
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.670
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.

96
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.470
She cannot be so much without true judgment--

97
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.900
Having so swift and excellent a wit

98
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.670
As she is prized to have--as to refuse

99
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.430
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

100
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.730
He is the only man of Italy.

101
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.100
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

102
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.670
I pray you, be not angry with me,

103
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.270
madam, Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,

104
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.700
For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,

105
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.370
Goes foremost in report through Italy.

106
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.700
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

107
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.630
His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.

108
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.300
When are you married, madam?

109
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.670
Why, every day, to-morrow.

110
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.370
Come, go in: I'll show thee some attires,

111
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.530
and have thy counsel me

112
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.100
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.

113
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.670
She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.

114
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.930
If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:

115
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.370
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

116
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.000
What fire is in mine ears?

117
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.570
Can this be true?

118
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:15.430
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?

119
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.870
Contempt, farewell!

120
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.930
and maiden pride, adieu!

121
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.730
No glory lives behind the back of such.

122
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:35.070
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,

123
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:42.430
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:

124
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.670
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee

125
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.600
To bind our loves up in a holy band;

126
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.130
For others say thou dost deserve,

127
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.400
and I Believe it better than reportingly.

128
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.130
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,

129
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.270
and then go I toward Arragon.

130
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.530
I'll bring you thither, my lord,

131
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.800
if you'll vouchsafe me.

132
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.200
Nay, that would be as great a soil

133
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.170
in the new gloss of your marriage

134
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:30.770
as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.

135
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.670
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company;

136
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.330
for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot,

137
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.870
he is all mirth:

138
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.970
he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string

139
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.200
and the little hangman dare not shoot at him;

140
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.630
he hath a heart as sound as a bell

141
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.770
and his tongue is the clapper,

142
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.770
for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.

143
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.300
Gallants, I am not as I have been.

144
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.830
So say I methinks you are sadder.

145
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.630
I hope he be in love.

146
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.470
Hang him, truant!

147
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.070
there's no true drop of blood in him,

148
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.230
to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,

149
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:11.570
he wants money.

150
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.900
I have the toothache.

151
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.100
Draw it.

152
00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.100
Hang it!

153
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:15.930
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

154
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.870
What!

155
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.830
sigh for the toothache?

156
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.230
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.

157
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.530
Yet say I, he is in love.

158
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.030
There is no appearance of fancy in him,

159
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.570
unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises;

160
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.870
as, to be a Dutchman today,

161
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.400
a Frenchman to-morrow.

162
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.830
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery,

163
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.830
as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy,

164
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.270
as you would have it appear he is.

165
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.000
If he be not in love with some woman,

166
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
there is no believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o' mornings;

167
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.400
what should that bode?

168
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.200
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?

169
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.670
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,

170
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.330
and the old ornament of his cheek

171
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.170
hath already stuffed tennis-balls.

172
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.170
Indeed, he looks younger than he did,

173
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.000
by the loss of a beard.

174
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.430
Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?

175
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.870
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.

176
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.030
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

177
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.270
And when was he wont to wash his face?

178
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.970
Yea, or to paint himself?

179
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.270
for the which, I hear what they say of him.

180
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.970
Nay, but his jesting spirit;

181
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.470
which is now crept into a lute-string

182
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.130
and now governed by stops.

183
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.470
Indeed, that hangs a heavy tale for him:

184
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.800
conclude, conclude he is in love.

185
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.830
Nay, but I know who loves him.

186
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.130
That would I know too:

187
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.870
I warrant, one that knows him not.

188
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.300
Yes, and his ill conditions;

189
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.130
and, in despite of all, dies for him.

190
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.670
She shall be buried with her face upwards.

191
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:49.630
Yet is this no charm for the toothache.

192
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.530
Old signior, walk aside with me:

193
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.770
I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you,

194
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.700
which these hobby-horses must not hear.

195
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.100
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.

196
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.770
'Tis even so.

197
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.800
Hero and Margaret

198
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.530
have by this played their parts with Beatrice;

199
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.830
and then the two bears

200
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.070
will not bite one another when they meet.

201
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.400
My lord and brother, God save you!

202
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.500
Good den, brother.

203
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.570
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.

204
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.870
In private?

205
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.670
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear;

206
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.600
for what I would speak of concerns him.

207
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.270
What's the matter?

208
00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.300
Means your lordship to be married to-morrow?

209
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.930
You know he does.

210
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.700
I know not that, when he knows what I know.

211
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.000
If there be any impediment,

212
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I pray you discover it.

213
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.630
You may think I love you not:

214
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.100
let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me

215
00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.800
by that I now will manifest.

216
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.330
For my brother, I think he holds you well,

217
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.230
and in dearness of heart

218
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.400
hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage;

219
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.270
--surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed.

220
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.330
Why, what's the matter?

221
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.800
I came hither to tell you;

222
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.500
and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long

223
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.530
a talking of, the lady is disloyal.

224
00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.470
Who, Hero?

225
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.600
Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero,

226
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.130
every man's Hero: Disloyal?

227
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.130
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness;

228
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.700
I could say she were worse: think you of a worse title,

229
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.370
and I will fit her to it.

230
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.800
Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me to-night,

231
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.270
you shall see her chamber-window entered,

232
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.170
even the night before her wedding-day:

233
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.930
if you love her then, to-morrow wed her;

234
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.970
but it would better fit your honour to change your mind.

235
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.330
May this be so?

236
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.230
I will not think it.

237
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.300
If you dare not trust that you see,

238
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:02.200
confess not that you know: if you will follow me,

239
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.830
I will show you enough;

240
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.230
and when you have seen more and heard more,

241
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:13.800
proceed accordingly. If I see any thing to-night

242
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.600
why I should not marry her to-morrow in the congregation,

243
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.870
where I should wed, there will I shame her.

244
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.700
And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her,

245
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.900
I will join with thee to disgrace her.

246
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.400
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses:

247
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.170
bear it coldly but till midnight,

248
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.870
and let the issue show itself.

249
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.900
O day untowardly turned!

250
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.170
O mischief strangely thwarting!

251
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.700
O plague right well prevented!

252
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.300
so will you say when you have seen the sequel.

253
00:12:50.200 --> 00:13:03.270
(cats meowing, dogs barking)

254
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.470
Are you good men and true?

255
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.530
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation,

256
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:22.570
body and soul.

257
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.400
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them,

258
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.970
if they should have any allegiance in them,

259
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.400
being chosen for the prince's watch.

260
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.970
Well, give them their charge,

261
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.370
neighbour Dogberry.

262
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:36.300
First, who think you the most desertless man to be constable?

263
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.330
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole;

264
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.930
for they can write and read.

265
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.670
Come hither, neighbour Seacole.

266
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.830
God hath blessed you with a good name:

267
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:50.830
to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune;

268
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.330
but to write and read comes by nature.

269
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.870
Both which, master constable,

270
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.100
- You have: I knew it would be your answer.

271
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.530
Well, for your favour, sir,

272
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.200
why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it;

273
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.330
and for your writing and reading,

274
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.370
let that appear when there is no need of such vanity.

275
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.870
You are thought here to be the most senseless

276
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.400
and fit man for the constable of the watch;

277
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.330
therefore bear you the lantern.

278
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.530
This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men;

279
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.600
you are to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.

280
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.170
How if a' will not stand?

281
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.400
Why, take no note of him, but let him go;

282
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.330
and presently call the rest of the watch

283
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.200
and thank God you are rid of a knave.

284
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.270
If he will not stand when he is bidden,

285
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.970
he is none of the prince's subjects.

286
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.170
True, and they are to meddle

287
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.070
with none but the prince's subjects.

288
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.870
Also, you shall make no noise in the streets;

289
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.170
for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable

290
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.670
and not to be endured.

291
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.570
We will rather sleep than talk:

292
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.070
we know what belongs to a watch.

293
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.970
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman;

294
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.970
for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:

295
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.630
only, have a care that your bills be not stolen.

296
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.870
Well, you are to call at all the ale-houses,

297
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:09.100
and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.

298
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.370
How if they will not?

299
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.830
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober:

300
00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.600
if they make you not then the better answer,

301
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.930
you may say they are not the men you took them for.

302
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.830
Well, sir.

303
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.230
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him,

304
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.570
by virtue of your office, to be no true man;

305
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.630
and, for such kind of men,

306
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.270
the less you meddle or make with them,

307
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.270
why the more is your honesty.

308
00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.170
If we know him to be a thief,

309
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.600
shall we not lay hands on him?

310
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.270
Truly, by your office, you may;

311
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.470
but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled:

312
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.230
the most peaceable way for you,

313
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.470
if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself

314
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.430
what he is and steal out of your company.

315
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:53.100
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.

316
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.570
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will,

317
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.800
much more a man who hath any honesty in him.

318
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.500
If you hear a child cry in the night,

319
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.700
you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.

320
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.470
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?

321
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.000
Why, then, depart in peace,

322
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.730
and let the child wake her with crying;

323
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.400
for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes

324
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.800
will never answer a calf when he bleats.

325
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.470
'Tis very true.

326
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.270
This is the end of the charge:--

327
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.730
you, constable, are to present the prince's own person:

328
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.600
if you meet the prince in the night,

329
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.230
you may stay him.

330
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.770
Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.

331
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.270
Five shillings to one on't,

332
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.970
any man that knows the statutes,

333
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:43.970
may stay him: marry, not without the prince be willing;

334
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.730
for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man;

335
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.370
and it is an offence to stay a man against his will.

336
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.800
By'r lady, I think it be so.

337
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.400
Well, masters, good night:

338
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.700
an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me:

339
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:03.430
keep your fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.

340
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.170
Come, neighbour.

341
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.370
Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here

342
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.270
upon the church-bench till two,

343
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.130
and then all to bed.

344
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.930
One word more, honest neighbours.

345
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.700
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door;

346
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.970
for the wedding being there to-morrow,

347
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.100
there is a great coil to-night.

348
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.770
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

349
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:41.800
(♪music)

350
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.900
What Conrade!

351
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.270
Peace! stir not.

352
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.670
Conrade, I say!

353
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.200
Here, man; I am at thy elbow.

354
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.270
Mass, and my elbow itched;

355
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.500
I thought there would a scab follow.

356
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.400
I will owe thee an answer for that:

357
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.500
now forward with thy tale.

358
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.870
Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house,

359
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.430
for it drizzles rain;

360
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.100
and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.

361
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.230
Some treason, masters: yet stand close.

362
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:14.400
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.

363
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.100
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?

364
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.530
Thou shouldst rather ask

365
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.400
if it were possible any villany should be so rich;

366
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.870
for when rich villains have need of poor ones,

367
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.430
poor ones may make what price they will.

368
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.530
I wonder at it.

369
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.530
That shows thou art unconfirmed.

370
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:31.900
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet,

371
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.430
or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.

372
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:35.800
Yes, it is apparel.

373
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800
I mean, the fashion.

374
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.300
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

375
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.730
Tush!

376
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.770
I may as well say the fool's the fool.

377
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.730
But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?

378
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.800
I know that Deformed;

379
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800
a' has been a vile thief this seven year;

380
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.670
a' goes up and down like a gentleman:

381
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.500
I remember his name.

382
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.600
Didst thou not hear somebody?

383
00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.670
No; 'twas the vane on the house.

384
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.800
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?

385
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.370
how giddily a' turns about all the hot bloods

386
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.330
between fourteen and five-and-thirty?

387
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.930
Art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too,

388
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.870
that thou hast shifted out of thy tale

389
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.300
into telling me of the fashion?

390
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:24.200
Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night wooed

391
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.030
Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman,

392
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.570
by the name of Hero:

393
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.070
she leans me out at her mistress' chamber-window,

394
00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:39.170
bids me a thousand times good night,

395
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.530
I tell this tale vilely:

396
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.330
I should first tell thee how the prince,

397
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.430
and Claudio and my master, planted and placed

398
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.170
and possessed by my master Don John,

399
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.700
saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.

400
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.600
And thought they Margaret was Hero?

401
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.000
Two of them did, the prince and Claudio;

402
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.830
but the devil my master knew she was Margaret;

403
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.470
and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them,

404
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.970
partly by the dark night,

405
00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.900
which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany,

406
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.330
which did confirm any slander that Don John had made,

407
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.630
away went Claudio enraged;

408
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.400
swore he would meet her, as he was appointed,

409
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.030
next morning at the temple,

410
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.500
and there, before the whole congregation,

411
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.770
shame her with what he saw o'er night

412
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:32.030
and send her home again without a husband.

413
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.570
We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!

414
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.130
Call up the right master constable.

415
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.200
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of

416
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.630
lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.

417
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.200
And one Deformed is one of them: I know him;

418
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.700
a' wears a lock.

419
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.930
Masters, masters,--

420
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:49.930
You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.

421
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.670
Masters,-- Never speak: we charge you

422
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:57.530
let us obey you to go with us.

423
00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.800
We are like to prove a goodly commodity,

424
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.500
being taken up of these men's bills.

425
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.700
A commodity in question, I warrant you.

426
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.630
Come, we'll obey you.

427
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:23.230
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice,

428
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.030
and desire her to rise.

429
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.500
I will, lady.

430
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.570
And bid her come hither.

431
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.930
Well.

432
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.270
Troth, I think your other rabato were better.

433
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.600
No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.

434
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.770
By my troth, 's not so good;

435
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.230
and I warrant your cousin will say so.

436
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.970
My cousin's a fool, and thou art another:

437
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:46.000
I'll wear none but this.

438
00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.700
I like the new tire within excellently,

439
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.430
if the hair were a thought browner;

440
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.630
and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith.

441
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.100
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so.

442
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.900
O, that exceeds, they say.

443
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.430
By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of yours:

444
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.170
cloth o' gold, and cuts,

445
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.570
and laced with silver, set with pearls,

446
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.200
down sleeves, side sleeves,

447
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.700
and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:

448
00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.670
but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent fashion,

449
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.730
yours is worth ten on 't.

450
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.100
God give me joy to wear it!

451
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.930
for my heart is exceeding heavy.

452
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.500
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.

453
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.430
Fie upon thee!

454
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.000
art not ashamed?

455
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.230
Of what, lady?

456
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.630
of speaking honourably?

457
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.970
Is not marriage honourable in a beggar?

458
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.970
Is not your lord honourable without marriage?

459
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.200
I think you would have me say,

460
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.900
'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad thinking

461
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.500
do not wrest true speaking,

462
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.030
I'll offend nobody:

463
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:54.270
is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband'?

464
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.500
None, I think,

465
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.130
and it be the right husband and the right wife;

466
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.130
otherwise 'tis light, and not heavy:

467
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.430
ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.

468
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.470
Good morrow, coz.

469
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.870
Good morrow, sweet Hero.

470
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.200
Why how now?

471
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.730
do you speak in the sick tune?

472
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:13.400
I am out of all other tune, methinks.

473
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.870
Clap's into 'Light o' love;

474
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.470
that goes without a burden:

475
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.500
do you sing it, and I'll dance it.

476
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.130
Ye light o' love, with your heels!

477
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.200
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin;

478
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.270
tis time you were ready.

479
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:32.330
By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!

480
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.270
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?

481
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.030
For the letter that begins them all,

482
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.070
H.

483
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.900
Well, and you be not turned Turk,

484
00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.770
there's no more sailing by the star.

485
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.670
What means the fool, trow?

486
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.170
Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!

487
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.370
These gloves the count sent me;

488
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.430
they are an excellent perfume.

489
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.600
I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.

490
00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.900
A maid, and stuffed!

491
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.730
there's goodly catching of cold.

492
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.970
O, God help me!

493
00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.470
God help me!

494
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.600
how long have you professed apprehension?

495
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.170
Even since you left it.

496
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.770
Doth not my wit become me rarely?

497
00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.530
It is not seen enough often enough,

498
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.430
you should wear it in your cap.

499
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:13.270
By my troth, I am ill.

500
00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.570
Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,

501
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:17.400
and lay it to your heart:

502
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.630
it is the only thing for a qualm.

503
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.330
There thou prickest her with a thistle.

504
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.270
Benedictus!

505
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.070
why Benedictus?

506
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.570
you have some moral in this Benedictus.

507
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.770
Moral!

508
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.770
no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning;

509
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.070
I meant, plain holy-thistle.

510
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.730
You may think perchance that I think you are in love:

511
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.400
nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list,

512
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.770
nor I list not to think what I can,

513
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:42.830
nor indeed I cannot think,

514
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.370
if I would think my heart out of thinking,

515
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:45.700
that you are in love or that you

516
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.270
will be in love or that you can be in love.

517
00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.570
Yet Benedick was such another,

518
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.170
and now is he become a man:

519
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.930
he swore he would never marry,

520
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.770
and yet now, in despite of his heart,

521
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.000
he eats his meat without grudging:

522
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.270
and how you may be converted I know not,

523
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.800
but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.

524
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.100
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?

525
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.030
Not a false gallop.

526
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.000
Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count,

527
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.470
Signior Benedick, Don John,

528
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.430
and all the gallants of the town,

529
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.800
are come to fetch you to church.

530
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.900
Help to dress me, good coz,

531
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.470
good Meg, good Ursula.

532
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.170
What would you with me, honest neighbour?

533
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.030
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you

534
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.700
that decerns you nearly.

535
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.800
Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.

536
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.730
Marry, this it is, sir.

537
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.530
Yes, in truth it is, sir.

538
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.970
What is it, my good friends?

539
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.700
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter:

540
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:46.070
an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as,

541
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.770
God help, I would desire they were;

542
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.330
but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.

543
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.970
Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living

544
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:59.470
that is an old man and no honester than I.

545
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.200
Comparisons are odorous:

546
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.630
palabras, neighbour Verges.

547
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.270
Neighbours, you are tedious.

548
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.330
It pleases your worship to say so,

549
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:10.900
but we are the poor duke's officers;

550
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.000
but truly, for mine own part,

551
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.270
if I were as tedious as a king,

552
00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:20.000
I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.

553
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.130
All thy tediousness on me, ah?

554
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.930
Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis;

555
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.830
for I hear as good exclamation on your

556
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.530
worship as of any man in the city;

557
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.600
and though I be but a poor man,

558
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.900
I am glad to hear it.

559
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:33.830
And so am I.

560
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.270
I would fain know what you have to say.

561
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.870
Marry, sir, our watch to-night,

562
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.100
excepting your worship's presence,

563
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.800
ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.

564
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.870
A good old man, sir; he will be talking:

565
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.370
as they say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help us!

566
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.770
it is a world to see.

567
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.900
Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges:

568
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.770
well, God's a good man; an two men ride of a horse,

569
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.700
one must ride behind.

570
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.570
An honest soul, i' faith, sir;

571
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.600
by my troth he is, as ever broke bread;

572
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.230
but God is to be worshipped;

573
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.170
all men are not alike; alas,

574
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.430
good neighbour!

575
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.870
Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.

576
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:14.570
Gifts that God gives.

577
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.300
I must leave you.

578
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:20.600
One word, sir: our watch, sir,

579
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.030
have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons,

580
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.630
and we would have them this morning examined

581
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.100
before your worship.

582
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.230
Take their examination yourself and bring it me:

583
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.900
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.

584
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.730
It shall be suffigance.

585
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.900
Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.

586
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.670
My lord, they stay for you

587
00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:44.930
to give your daughter to her husband.

588
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:47.130
I'll wait upon them: I am ready.

589
00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:51.200
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;

590
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.730
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol:

591
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.630
we are now to examination these men.

592
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.800
And we must do it wisely.

593
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.930
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you;

594
00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:02.330
here's that shall drive some of them to a non-come:

595
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.370
only get the learned writer

596
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:08.730
to set down our excommunication and meet me at the gaol.

597
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.830
