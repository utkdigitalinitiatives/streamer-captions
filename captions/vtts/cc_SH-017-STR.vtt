00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:05.700


2
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.700
Good day, sir.

3
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.700
I am glad you're well.

4
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.670
I have not seen you long.

5
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.800
How goes the world?

6
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.600
Oh, it wears, sir, as it grows.

7
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.900
Ay, that's well known: but what particular rarity?

8
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
What strange,

9
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.570
which manifold record not matches?

10
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.770
See, magic of bounty!

11
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.370
All these spirits thy powers have conjured to attend.

12
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.530
I know the merchant.

13
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.230
I know them both; the other's a jeweller.

14
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.100
Oh, 'tis a worthy lord.

15
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.470
Nay, that's most fixed.

16
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.600
A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,

17
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.270
to an untirable and continuate goodness:

18
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.930
he passes.

19
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.970
I have a jewel here

20
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270
Oh, pray, let's see it.

21
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.830
For the Lord Timon, sir?

22
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.730
If he will touch the estimate:

23
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.270
but, for that

24
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.470
'Tis a good form.

25
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.470
And rich, yes.

26
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.670
You are rapt, sir, in some work,

27
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.470
some dedication to the great Lord.

28
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.230
A thing slipped idly from me.

29
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.130
Our poesy is as a gum

30
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130
which oozes from whence 'tis nourished:

31
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.900
the fire in the flint shows not till it be struck;

32
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.230
our gentle flame provokes itself

33
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.830
and like the current flies each bound it chafes.

34
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.830
What have you there?

35
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.130
A picture, sir.

36
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.470
When comes your book forth?

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.700
Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.

38
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.930
Let's see your piece.

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.400
It's a good piece.

40
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.830
Oh, so 'tis:

41
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.970
this comes off well and excellent.

42
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.200
Indifferent.

43
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.070
Admirable: how this grace speaks his own standing.

44
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.370
What a mental power this eye shoots forth.

45
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.270
How big imagination moves in this lip.

46
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.500
To the dumbness of the gesture one might interpret.

47
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
It's a pretty mocking of the life.

48
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.030
Here is a touch; is it good?

49
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.370
I will say of it, it tutors nature:

50
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.400
Artificial strife lives in these touches,

51
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.970
livelier than life.

52
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.700
How this lord is followed.

53
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.400
The senators of Athens: happy man.

54
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.270
Look, more.

55
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.800
You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors?

56
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.470
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,

57
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.400
whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug

58
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.900
with amplest entertainment:

59
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930
my free drift halts not particularly,

60
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.300
but moves itself in a wide sea of tacks:

61
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.470
no levelled malice infects one comma in the course I hold;

62
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.330
but flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,

63
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.000
leaving no tract behind.

64
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
How shall I understand you?

65
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.930
I will unbolt to you.

66
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.800
You see how all conditions, how all minds,

67
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800
as well of glib and slippery creatures

68
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.230
as of grave and austere quality,

69
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.300
tender down their services to Lord Timon:

70
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.030
his large fortune upon his good and gracious nature hanging

71
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.970
subdues and properties to his love and tendence

72
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.800
all sorts of hearts;

73
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.000
yea, from the glass-faced flatterers

74
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.230
to Apemantus,

75
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.230
whom few things loves better than to abhor himself:

76
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.670
even he drops down the knee before him

77
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.800
and returns in peace most rich in Timon's nod.

78
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.530
I saw them speak together.

79
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.330
Sir, I have on a high and pleasant hill

80
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.170
feigned fortune to be throned: the base of the mount

81
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.670
is ranked with all deserts, all kind of natures,

82
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.400
that labor on the bosom of this sphere

83
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.330
to propagate their states.

84
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.630
Amongst them all, whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fixed,

85
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.400
one do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,

86
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.000
whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;

87
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.630
whose present grace to present slaves and servants

88
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.900
translates his rivals.

89
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.230
'Tis conceived to scope.

90
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.000
This throne, this fortune, and this hill, methinks,

91
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.870
with one man beckoned from the rest below,

92
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.600
bowing his head against the sleepy mount

93
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.900
to climb his happiness,

94
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.030
would be well expressed in our condition.

95
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.870
Nay, sir, but hear me on.

96
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.370
All those which were his fellows but of late

97
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.470
Mmm.

98
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.930
No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.

99
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.930
But of late.

100
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.230
Even better than his value,

101
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.600
on the moment follow his strides,

102
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.100
his lobbies fill with tendance,

103
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.230
rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,

104
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.730
make sacred even his stirrup,

105
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.770
and through him drink the free air.

106
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.700
Ay, marry, what of these?

107
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.330
When fortune in her shift and change of mood

108
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.770
spurns down her late beloved,

109
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.670
all his dependants that labor after him

110
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.500
to the mountain's top, even on their knees and hands,

111
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.800
let him slip down,

112
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.700
not one accompanying his declining foot.

113
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.670
'Tis common: a thousand moral paintings I can show

114
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.000
that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune's

115
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.300
more pregnantly than words.

116
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.130
Yet you do well to show Lord Timon

117
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.000
that mean eyes have seen the foot above the head.

118
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.600
Imprisoned is he, say you?

119
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.770
Ay, my good lord.

120
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.330
Five talents is his debt,

121
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.800
his means most short, his creditors most strait:

122
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.430
your honorable letter he desires

123
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.800
to those have shut him up;

124
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.470
which failing, periods his comfort.

125
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.630
Noble Ventidius!

126
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.070
Well; I am not of that feather to shake off my friend

127
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.830
when he must needs me.

128
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.800
I do know him a gentleman well deserves a help:

129
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.400
which he shall have: I'll pay the debt and free him.

130
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.130
Your Lordship ever binds him.

131
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.370
Commend me to him.

132
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.730
I will send his ransom;

133
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.470
and being enfranchised, bid him come to me.

134
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.200
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,

135
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.400
but to support him after.

136
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.370
Lord Timon, hear me speak.

137
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.470
Freely, good father.

138
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.530
Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.

139
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.500
Yes, I have so: what of him?

140
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.700
Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.

141
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.130
Attends he here, or no?

142
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.270
Lucilius!

143
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.370
Here, at Your Lordship's service.

144
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.600
This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature

145
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.730
at night frequents my house.

146
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.000
I am a man that from my first have been inclined to thrift;

147
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.830
and my estate deserves an heir more raised

148
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.600
than one which holds a trencher.

149
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.500
Well; what further?

150
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.470
One only daughter have I, no kin else,

151
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.870
on whom I may confer what I have got.

152
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.970
The maid is fair, of the youngest for a bride,

153
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.630
and I have bred her at my dearest cost

154
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.070
in qualities of the best.

155
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.230
This man of thine attempts her love.

156
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.470
I prithee, noble Lord, join with me

157
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.630
to forbid him her resort;

158
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.700
myself have spoke in vain.

159
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.270
The man is honest.

160
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.830
Therefore he will be, Timon:

161
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.470
his honesty rewards him in itself;

162
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.270
it must not bear my daughter.

163
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.600
Does she love him?

164
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.700
She is young and apt.

165
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.500
Our own precedent passions do instruct us

166
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.700
what levity's in youth.

167
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.070
And love you the maid?

168
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.070
Ay, my good Lord, and she accepts of it.

169
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.670
If, in her marriage, my consent is missing,

170
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.530
I call the gods to witness,

171
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.130
I will choose mine heir from forth the beggars of this world,

172
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.170
and dispossess her all!

173
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.970
How shall she be endowed,

174
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.170
if she be mated with an equal husband?

175
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.470
Three talents on the present; in future, all.

176
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.430
This gentleman of mine hath served me long.

177
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.370
To build his fortune, I will strain a little,

178
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.400
for 'tis a bond in men.

179
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.630
Give him thy daughter.

180
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.500
What you bestow, in him, I'll counterpoise,

181
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.370
make him weigh with her.

182
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.400
My noble Lord,

183
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.530
pawn me to this your honor, she is his.

184
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.130
My hand to you; my honor on my promise.

185
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.670
Humbly I thank Your Lordship.

186
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.570
Never may that state of fortune fall into my keeping,

187
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.830
that is not owed to you.

188
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.370
Vouchsafe my labor, and long live Your Lordship!

189
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.470
I thank you; you shall hear from me anon.

190
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.870
What have you there, my friend?

191
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.230
A piece of painting, which I do beseech Your Lordship to accept.

192
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.730
Painting is welcome.

193
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.070
Painting is almost the natural man;

194
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.400
or since dishonor traffics with man's nature,

195
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.100
he is but outside.

196
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.500
these pencilled figures are even such as they give out.

197
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.070
I like your work; you shall find I like it.

198
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.730
Wait attendance till you hear further from me.

199
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.000
The gods preserve you!

200
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.830
Well fare you, gentleman.

201
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.730
Give me your hand; we must needs dine together, hmm?

202
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.670
Sir, sir, your jewel hath suffered under praise.

203
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.970
What, my lord?

204
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.970
Dispraise?

205
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.900
A mere satiety of commendations.

206
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.530
If I should pay you for it as 'tis extolled,

207
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.170
it would unclew me quite.

208
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.700
My lord, 'tis rated as those which sell would give.

209
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.130
But you well know, things of like value

210
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.570
differing in the owners

211
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.630
are prized by their masters.

212
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.800
Believe it, dear lord,

213
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.900
you mend the jewel by the wearing it.

214
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.900
Well mocked.

215
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.330
Oh, no, my good lord;

216
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:58.230
he speaks the common tongue, which all men speak with him.

217
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.870
Look, who comes here: will you be chid?

218
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.230
We'll bear, with Your Lordship.

219
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.200
We'll spare none.

220
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.170
Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus.

221
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.800
Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;

222
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.400
when thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.

223
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400
Why dost thou call them knaves?

224
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.600
Thou knowest them not.

225
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.870
Are they not Athenians?

226
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.870
Yes.

227
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.370
Then I repent not.

228
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.930
You know me, Apemantus?

229
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.900
Thou knowest I do: I called thee by thy name.

230
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.370
Thou art proud, Apemantus.

231
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.870
Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.

232
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.170
Whither art going?

233
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.730
To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.

234
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.930
That's a deed thou'lt die for.

235
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:38.370
Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.

236
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.730
How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?

237
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.430
The best, for the innocence.

238
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.200
Wrought he not well that painted it?

239
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.400
He wrought better that made the painter;

240
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.600
and yet he's but a filthy piece of work.

241
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.200
You're a dog.

242
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.170
Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?

243
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.330
Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?

244
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.500
No; I eat not lords.

245
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.370
And thou shouldst, thou wouldst anger ladies.

246
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.800
O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.

247
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.830
That's a lascivious apprehension.

248
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.270
So thou apprehendest it.

249
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.770
Take it for thy labor.

250
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.800
How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?

251
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.430
Not as well as plain dealing,

252
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.430
which will not cost a man a doit.

253
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.100
What dost thou think 'tis worth?

254
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.130
Not worth my thinking.

255
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.000
How now, poet!

256
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.770
How now, philosopher!

257
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.930
Thou liest.

258
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.930
Art not one?

259
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.930
Yes.

260
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.000
Then I lie not.

261
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.430
Art not a poet?

262
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.430
Yes.

263
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.430
Then thou liest.

264
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.570
Look in thy last work,

265
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.870
where thou hast feigned him a worthy fellow.

266
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.500
That's not feigned; he is so.

267
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.000
Yes, he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy labor.

268
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.770
He that loves to be flattered is worthy of the flatterer.

269
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.500
Heavens, that I were a lord.

270
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.100
What wouldst do then, Apemantus?

271
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.900
Even as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.

272
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.070
What, thyself?

273
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.070
Ay.

274
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.100
Wherefore?

275
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.300
That I had no angry wit to be a lord.

276
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.800
Art not thou a merchant?

277
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.330
Ay, Apemantus.

278
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.270
Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!

279
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.030
If traffic do it, the gods do it.

280
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.100
Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee.

281
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.230
What trumpet's that?

282
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.830
'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,

283
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.030
all of companionship.

284
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.300
Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.

285
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.470
Now go not you hence till I've thanked you.

286
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.470
When dinner's done, you show me this piece.

287
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.300
I am joyful of your sights.

288
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.800
Oh.

289
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.100
Most welcome, sir!

290
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.700
Sir, you have saved my longing,

291
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.470
and I feed most hungerly on your sight.

292
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.830
Right welcome, sir!

293
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.900
Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time

294
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.130
in different pleasures.

295
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.970
Pray, pray let us in.

296
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.070
So, so, there!

297
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.130
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!

298
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.530
That there should be small love among these sweet knaves,

299
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.430
and all this courtesy.

300
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.300
The strain of man's bred out into baboon and monkey

301
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.300
What time of day is it, Apemantus?

302
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.430
Time to be honest.

303
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.070
That time serves still.

304
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.170
The more accursed thou, that still omittest it.

305
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.130
Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?

306
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.670
Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.

307
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.130
Fare thee well, fare thee well.

308
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.930
Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.

309
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.230
Why, Apemantus?

310
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.600
Shouldst have kept one to thyself,

311
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.800
for I mean to give thee none.

312
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.830
Hang thyself!

313
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.670
No, I will do nothing at thy bidding:

314
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.800
make thy requests to thy friend.

315
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.600
Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!

316
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.730
I will fly, like a dog, the heels of the ass.

317
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.770
Hee-haw.

318
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.570
He's opposite to humanity.

319
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.670
Come, shall we in, and taste Lord Timon's bounty?

320
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.230
He outgoes the very heart of kindness.

321
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.770
He pours it out;

322
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.530
Plutus, the god of gold, is but his steward.

323
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.900
No meed, but he repays sevenfold above itself;

324
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.670
no gift to him, but breeds the giver a return

325
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.230
exceeding all use of quittance.

326
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.200
The noblest mind he carries that ever governed man.

327
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.170
Long may he live in fortunes.

328
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.170
Shall we in?

329
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.270
I'll keep you company.

330
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.930
Most honored Timon!

331
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.230
Ventidius!

332
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.600
Oh!

333
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.030
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,

334
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.570
and call him to long peace.

335
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.100
He is gone happy, and has left me rich.

336
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.330
And, as in grateful virtue I am bound to your free heart,

337
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.630
I do return those talents,

338
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.830
doubled with thanks and service,

339
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.000
from whose help I derived liberty.

340
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.770
Oh, by no means, honest Ventidius;

341
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.970
you mistake my love:

342
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.970
I gave it freely ever;

343
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.930
and there's none can truly say he gives,

344
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.600
if he receives.

345
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.830
If our betters play at that game,

346
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.030
we must not dare to imitate them.

347
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.000
Faults that are rich are fair.

348
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.370
A noble spirit.

349
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.100
Nay, my lord.

350
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.270
Ceremony was but devised at first

351
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.600
to set a gloss on faint deeds,

352
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.500
hollow welcomes, recanting goodness,

353
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.370
sorry ere 'tis shown;

354
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.470
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.

355
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.830
Pray, sit;

356
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.930
more welcome are ye to my fortunes

357
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.330
than my fortunes are to me.

358
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.430
My lord, we have always confessed it.

359
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.600
Oh, confessed it!

360
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.900
Hanged it, have you not?

361
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.630
Oh, Apemantus, you are welcome.

362
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.000
No, you shall not make me welcome.

363
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.030
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.

364
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.500
Fie, thou art a churl;

365
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.100
you've a humor there does not become a man:

366
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.670
'tis much to blame.

367
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.870
They say, my lords, "ira furor brevis est;"

368
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.630
but yond man is ever angry.

369
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.570
Go, let him have a table by himself,

370
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.500
for he does neither affect company,

371
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.670
nor is he fit for it, indeed.

372
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.400
Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon.

373
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.630
I come to observe;

374
00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.030
I give thee warning on it.

375
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.630
I take no heed of thee;

376
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.730
Thou art an Athenian, therefore welcome:

377
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.230
I myself would have no power;

378
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.870
prithee, let my meat make thee silent.

379
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.230
I scorn thy meat;

380
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.330
'twould choke me, for I should ne'er flatter thee.

381
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.300
O you gods, what a number of men eats Timon,

382
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.400
and he sees 'em not!

383
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.170
It grieves me to see so many

384
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.400
dip their meat in one man's blood;

385
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.030
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.

386
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.800
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:

387
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.730
Methinks they should invite them without knives;

388
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.100
good for their meat, and safer for their lives.

389
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.330
There's much example for it;

390
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.770
the fellow that sits next him, now parts bread with him,

391
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.700
pledges the breath of him in a divided draught,

392
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.400
is the readiest man to kill him.

393
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.900
It has been proved.

394
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.070
If I were a huge man, I would fear to drink at meals

395
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.670
lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:

396
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.300
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

397
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.470
My lords, in heart.

398
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.300
And let the health go round.

399
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.570
Let it flow this way, my good lord.

400
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.570
Flow this way!

401
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.570
A brave fellow!

402
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.300
He keeps his tides well.

403
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.500
Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill, Timon.

404
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.000
Here's that which is too weak to be a sinner,

405
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.570
honest water,

406
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.900
which ne'er left man in the mire:

407
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.530
It and my food are equals;

408
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.370
there's no odds.

409
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.430
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.

410
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.830
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;

411
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.830
I pray for no man but myself.

412
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.000
Grant I may never prove so fond

413
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
to trust man on his oath or bond;

414
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.570
or a harlot, for her weeping;

415
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.300
or a dog, that seems a-sleeping;

416
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.030
or a keeper with my freedom;

417
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.970
or my friends, if I should need 'em.

418
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.670
Amen.

419
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.200
So fall to it.

420
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.600
Rich men sin, and I eat root.

421
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.470
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus.

422
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.030
All!

423
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.430
May it please Your Honor.

424
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.470
Lord Lucius, out of his free love,

425
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.230
hath presented to you four milk-white horses

426
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.500
trapped in silver.

427
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.670
I shall accept them fairly.

428
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.970
Let the presents be worthily entertained.

429
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.430
Please you, my lord,

430
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.400
Lord Lucullus entreats your company tomorrow

431
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.570
to hunt with him,

432
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.270
and has sent Your Honor two brace of greyhounds.

433
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.170
I'll hunt with him.

434
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.630
Let them be well received, not without fair reward.

435
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.230
Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.

436
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.570
My heart's ever at your service, my good lord.

437
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.170
Had you rather be at a breakfast of enemies

438
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.030
than a dinner of friends?

439
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.000
So they were bleeding-new, my lord,

440
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.130
there's no meat like them:

441
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.730
I could wish my best friend at such a feast.

442
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.370
Would all those flatterers were thy enemies then,

443
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.770
that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!

444
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.770
Might we but have that happiness, my lord,

445
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.430
that you would once use our hearts,

446
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.930
whereby we might express some part of our zeals,

447
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.970
we should think ourselves forever perfect.

448
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.070
No doubt, my good friends, but the gods themselves

449
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.670
have provided I shall have much help from you.

450
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.630
How had you been my friends else?

451
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.870
Why have you that charitable title from thousands,

452
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.200
did not you chiefly belong to my heart?

453
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.930
I have told more of you to myself

454
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.030
than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf;

455
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.570
and thus far, I confirm you.

456
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.070
O you gods, think I, what need we have any friends,

457
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.930
should we ne'er have need of 'em?

458
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.570
They're the most needless creatures living,

459
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.500
should we ne'er have use of 'em,

460
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.770
and should most resemble sweet instruments

461
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.700
hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves.

462
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.870
Why, I have often wished myself poorer,

463
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.600
that I might come nearer to you.

464
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.070
We're born to do benefits:

465
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.630
and what better or properer can we call our own

466
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.530
than the riches of our friends?

467
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.370
O, what a precious comfort 'tis,

468
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.600
to have so many, like brothers,

469
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.370
commanding one another's fortunes.

470
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.270
Oh, joy's even made a way ere it can be born.

471
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.130
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks.

472
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.830
To forget their faults, I drink to you.

473
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.130
Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.

474
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.800
Joy had the like conception in our eyes,

475
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.430
and that instant, like a babe, sprung up.

476
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.600
I laugh to think that babe a bastard.

477
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.200
I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.

478
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.230
Much!

479
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.630
How now? What means that trump?

480
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.770
Please you, my lord, there are certain ladies

481
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.300
most desirous of admittance.

482
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.770
Ladies!

483
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.000
What are their wills?

484
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.670
There comes with them a forerunner, my lord,

485
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.470
which bears that office, to signify their pleasures.

486
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.070
Well, let them have kind admittance.

487
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.570
Music, make their welcome.

488
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:19.800
Hail, hail, hail to thee, worthy Timon,

489
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:30.100
and to all that of his bounties taste!

490
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:39.270
The five best senses acknowledge thee their patron;

491
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:49.770
and come freely to gratulate thy plenteous bosom:

492
00:24:49.770 --> 00:25:01.100
and come freely to gratulate thy plenteous bosom:

493
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.230
There, taste, touch, all,

494
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.370
there, taste, touch, all,

495
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.700
pleased from thy table rise;

496
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.670
pleased from thy table rise;

497
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.030
pleased from thy table rise;

498
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.300
pleased from thy table rise;

499
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:22.530
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.

500
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:30.330
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.

501
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.700
You see, my lord, how ample you are beloved?

502
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.300
Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!

503
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.530
They dance.

504
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.270
They are mad women.

505
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.030
Like madness is the glory of this life.

506
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.530
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.

507
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.700
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves;

508
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.970
and spend our flatteries to drink those men

509
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.270
upon whose age we void it up again

510
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.730
with poisonous spite and envy.

511
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.500
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?

512
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.670
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves

513
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.000
of their friends' gift?

514
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.270
I should fear that those that dance before me now

515
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.570
would one day stamp upon me.

516
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.470
It has been done.

517
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.700
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.

518
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.600
You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,

519
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.270
set a fair fashion on our entertainment.

520
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.500
I am to thank you for it.

521
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.100
My lord, you take us even at the best.

522
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.570
'Faith, for the worst is filthy;

523
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.470
and would not hold taking, I doubt me.

524
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.370
Flavius, the little casket bring me hither.

525
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.330
Yes, my lord.

526
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.800
More jewels yet!

527
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.630
There is no crossing him in his humor;

528
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.630
Else I should tell him

529
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.930
well, in faith I should

530
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.430
when all's spent,

531
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.570
he would be crossed then, he could.

532
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.670
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,

533
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.730
that man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.

534
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.870
Ah, Flavius.

535
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.170
My lord, honor me so much as to advance this jewel;

536
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.430
accept it and wear it, kind my lord.

537
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.600
I am so far already in your gifts

538
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.930
So are we all.

539
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.330
I beseech Your Honor, vouchsafe me a word;

540
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.500
it does concern you near.

541
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.630
Near!

542
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.830
Why, then, another time I'll hear:

543
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.730
What will this come to?

544
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.330
He commands us to provide and give great gifts,

545
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.230
and all out of an empty coffer:

546
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.830
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,

547
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.630
to show him what a beggar his heart is,

548
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.870
being of no power to make his wishes good.

549
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.730
His promises fly so beyond his state

550
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.330
that what he speaks is all in debt;

551
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.030
he owes for every word.

552
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.900
He is so kind that he now pays interest for it;

553
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.700
his land's put to their books.

554
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.570
Well, would I were gently put out of office

555
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.300
before I were forced out.

556
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.200
Happier is he that has no friend to feed

557
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.400
than such that do even enemies exceed.

558
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.270
I bleed inwardly for my lord.

559
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.170
You do yourselves too much wrong,

560
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.230
you bate too much of your own merits:

561
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.930
Here, my lord, a token of our love.

562
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.130
With more than common thanks I will receive it.

563
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.870
O, he is the very soul of bounty!

564
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.370
Now I do remember, my lord,

565
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.830
you gave good words the other day

566
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.500
of a bay courser I rode on:

567
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.270
it is yours, because you liked it.

568
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.870
Oh, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.

569
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.170
You may take my word.

570
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.600
I know no man can justly praise but what he does affect:

571
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.600
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;

572
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600
I'll tell you true.

573
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600
I'll call to you.

574
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.700
Oh, none so welcome.

575
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.830
I take all and your several visitations so kind to heart,

576
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.470
'tis not enough to give;

577
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.230
methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends

578
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.530
and ne'er be weary.

579
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.430
Alcibiades, thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;

580
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.770
It comes in charity to thee:

581
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.830
for all thy living is amongst the dead.

582
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.670
All the lands thou hast lie in a pitched field.

583
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.570
Ay, defiled land, my lord.

584
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.500
We are so virtuously bound.

585
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.570
And I to you.

586
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.430
So infinitely endeared

587
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.230
So I to you.

588
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.100
Lights, more lights!

589
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.130
The best of happiness, honor and fortunes,

590
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.370
keep with you, Lord Timon!

591
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:09.300
Ready for his friends.

592
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.230
What a coil's here.

593
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.730
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums.

594
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.430
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums

595
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.870
that are paid for them.

596
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.000
Friendship's full of dregs.

597
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.800
Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs,

598
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.430
thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies.

599
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.600
Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen,

600
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.930
I would be good to thee.

601
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.070
No, I'll nothing:

602
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.730
for if I should be bribed too,

603
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.700
there would be none left to rail upon thee,

604
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.070
and then thou wouldst sin the faster.

605
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.470
Thou givest so long, Timon,

606
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:48.400
I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly:

607
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.330
what need these feasts, pomps and vainglories?

608
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.430
Nay, and you begin to rail upon society once,

609
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.130
I am sworn not to give regard to you.

610
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.130
Farewell.

611
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.300
Come again with better music.

612
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.700
So thou wilt not hear me now;

613
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.900
thou shalt not then:

614
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.300
I'll lock thy heaven from thee.

615
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.270
Oh, that men's ears should be to counsel deaf,

616
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.830
but not to flattery.

617
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.070
Here, my lord.

618
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.530
Haste you to Lord Timon;

619
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.770
Importune him for my moneys;

620
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.000
be not ceased by slight denial,

621
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.030
nor then silenced when

622
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.700
"Commend me to your master,"

623
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.130
and the cap plays in the right hand, thus.

624
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.900
But tell him, my uses cry to me,

625
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.730
I must serve my turn out of mine own.

626
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.270
His days and times are past

627
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.970
and my reliance on his fracted dates

628
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.700
have smit my credit:

629
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.970
I love and honor him,

630
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.700
but I must not break my back to heal his finger.

631
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.000
Immediate are my needs,

632
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.070
and my relief must not be tossed and turned to me in words,

633
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.900
but find supply immediate.

634
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.500
Get you gone.

635
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
Put on a most importunate aspect,

636
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.670
a visage of demand, for, I do fear,

637
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.730
when every feather sticks in his own wing,

638
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.630
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,

639
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.730
which flashes now a phoenix.

640
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.730
Get you gone.

641
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.730
I go, sir.

642
00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:27.870
Take the bonds along with you,

643
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.870
I will, sir.

644
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.230
Have the dates in contempt.

645
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.970
Go.

646
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.000
No care, no stop!

647
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.130
So senseless of expense,

648
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.900
that he will neither know how to maintain it,

649
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.530
nor cease his flow of riot.

650
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.200
Takes no account how things go from him,

651
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.530
nor resumes no care of what is to continue.

652
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.100
Never mind was to be so unwise, to be so kind.

653
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.430
Oh, what shall be done?

654
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.730
He will not hear, till feel.

655
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.500
I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.

656
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.670
Fie, fie, fie!

657
00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.730
Good even.

658
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.800
What, you come for money?

659
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.430
Is it your business too?

660
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:03.600
'Tis, and yours?

661
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.600
Would we were all discharged!

662
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600
I fear it.

663
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.900
Here comes the lord.

664
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.500
So soon as dinner's done,

665
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.800
we'll forth again, my Alcibiades.

666
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800
With me?

667
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.970
What is your will?

668
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.670
My lord, here is a note of certain dues.

669
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.900
Dues?

670
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.100
Whence are you?

671
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.330
Of Athens here, my lord.

672
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.500
Go to my steward.

673
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.600
Please it, Your Lordship,

674
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.830
he has put me out to the succession

675
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.330
of new days this month.

676
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.570
My master is awaked to great occasion

677
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.930
to call upon his own,

678
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.030
and humbly prays you that, with your other noble parts,

679
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.770
you'll suit in giving him his right.

680
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.170
Mine honest friend, I prithee, but repair to me next morning.

681
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.170
Nay, good my lord!

682
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.630
Contain thyself, good friend.

683
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.630
One Varro's servant, my good

684
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.630
From Isidore;

685
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.070
he humbly prays your speedy payment.

686
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.530
If you did know, my lord, my master's wants

687
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.070
'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks and past.

688
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.370
Give me breath!

689
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.870
My lords, I beseech you, keep on;

690
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.430
I'll wait upon you instantly.

691
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.570
Come hither, I pray you.

692
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.800
I beseech you, how goes the world

693
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.930
that I am thus encountered with clamorous demands

694
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.000
of debt, broken bonds,

695
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.170
and the detention of long-since-due debts against my honor?

696
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.300
Please you, gentlemen,

697
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.770
the time is unagreeable to this business.

698
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.830
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,

699
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.200
that I may make His Lordship understand

700
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.670
wherefore you are not paid.

701
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.970
Do so, my friends.

702
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.000
Pray, you're welcome here.

703
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.200
I'll speak with you anon.

704
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.570
You make me marvel.

705
00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.700
Wherefore ere this time

706
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.300
you had not fully laid my state before me,

707
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.870
that I might so have rated my expense,

708
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.170
as I had leave of means?

709
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.730
You would not hear me; at many leisures, I proposed.

710
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.330
Go to!

711
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.170
Perchance some single vantages you took

712
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.300
when my indisposition put you back,

713
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.030
and that unaptness made your minister,

714
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.600
thus to excuse yourself.

715
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.030
Oh, my good lord, at many times I brought in my accounts,

716
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.330
laid them before you.

717
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.400
You would throw them off

718
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.670
and say you found them in mine honesty.

719
00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.800
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me return so much,

720
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.770
I have shook my head and wept;

721
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.200
Yea, against the authority of manners,

722
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.430
prayed you to hold your hand more close.

723
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.730
I have endured not seldom, nor no slight checks,

724
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.570
when I have prompted you in the ebb of your estate

725
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.300
and your great flow of debts.

726
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.930
My loved lord, though you hear now too late

727
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.430
yet now's a time

728
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.630
the greatest of your having lacks a half

729
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.930
to pay your present debts.

730
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.800
Let all my lands be sold.

731
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.400
'tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;

732
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.130
and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues.

733
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.200
The future comes apace.

734
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.370
What shall defend the interim?

735
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.470
And at length, how goes our reckoning?

736
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.530
To Lacedaemon did my land extend.

737
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.130
O my good lord, the world is but a word.

738
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.830
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,

739
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.870
how quickly were it gone!

740
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.000
You tell me true?

741
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.330
If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,

742
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.800
call me before the exactest auditors

743
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.070
and set me on the proof.

744
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.700
So the gods bless me,

745
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.230
when all our offices have been oppressed with riotous feeders,

746
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.400
when our vaults have wept with drunken spilth of wine,

747
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.200
when every room was blazed with lights

748
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.100
and brayed with minstrelsy,

749
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.730
I have retired me to a wasteful cock

750
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.730
and set mine eyes at flow.

751
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:03.900
Prithee, no more.

752
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.130
Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!

753
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.430
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants

754
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.500
this night englutted!

755
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.170
Who is not Timon's?

756
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.630
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon's?

757
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.670
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!

758
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.230
Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,

759
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.830
the breath is gone whereof this praise is made.

760
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.770
Feast-won, fast-lost;

761
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.030
one cloud of winter showers, these flies are couched.

762
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.530
Come, sermon me no further.

763
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.000
No villainous bounty yet hath passed my heart;

764
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.630
unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.

765
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.330
Why dost thou weep?

766
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.230
Has thou the conscience lack to think I shall lack friends?

767
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.930
Secure thy heart;

768
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.070
if I would broach the vessels of my love,

769
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.500
and try the arguments of hearts by borrowing,

770
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.470
men and men's fortunes could I frankly use

771
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.100
as I can bid thee speak.

772
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.300
Assurance bless your thoughts!

773
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.500
And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crowned,

774
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.830
that I account them blessings;

775
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.400
for by these shall I try friends.

776
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.230
You shall see how you mistake my fortunes;

777
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.370
I am wealthy in my friends.

778
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.570
Within there!

779
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.570
Flaminius!

780
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.630
My lord?

781
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.630
Servilius!

782
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.670
My lord?

783
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.070
I will dispatch you severally;

784
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.030
To Lord Lucius, you;

785
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.830
to Lord Lucullus, you.

786
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.200
I hunted with His Honor today.

787
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.500
To Sempronius, you.

788
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.230
Commend me to their loves, and, I am proud, say,

789
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.770
that my occasions have found time to use 'em

790
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.530
toward a supply of money.

791
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:53.230
Let the request be... fifty talents?

792
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.500
As you have said, my lord.

793
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.900
Lord Lucius and Lucullus, hmm?

794
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.300
And go you, sir, to the senators

795
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.530
of whom, even to the state's best health,

796
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.230
I have deserved this hearing

797
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.830
bid 'em send of the instant a thousand talents to me.

798
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.070
I have been bold

799
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.800
for that I knew it the most general way

800
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.100
to them to use your signet and your name;

801
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.370
but they do shake their heads,

802
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.630
and I am here no richer in return.

803
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.470
It is true?

804
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.070
Can it be?

805
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.030
They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,

806
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.130
that now they are at fall, want treasure,

807
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.130
cannot do what they would;

808
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.130
are sorry you are honorable

809
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:29.400
but yet they could have wished

810
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.470
they know not something hath been amiss

811
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.730
a noble nature may catch a wrench

812
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.970
would all were well  'tis pity;

813
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.730
and so, intending other serious matters,

814
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.700
after distasteful looks and these hard fractions,

815
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.200
with certain half-caps and cold-moving nods

816
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.570
they froze me into silence.

817
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.370
You gods, reward them!

818
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.030
Prithee, man, look cheerly.

819
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.530
These old fellows have their ingratitude in them hereditary.

820
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:08.000
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;

821
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
'tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;

822
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.400
and nature, as it grows again toward earth,

823
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.800
is fashioned for the journey, dull and heavy.

824
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.230
Go to Ventidius.

825
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.600
Prithee, be not sad.

826
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.800
Ingeniously I speak.

827
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.970
No blame belongs to thee.

828
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.770
Ventidius lately buried his father,

829
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.700
by whose death he's stepped into a great estate.

830
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.030
When he was poor, imprisoned, and in scarcity of friends,

831
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.900
I cleared him with five talents.

832
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.400
Greet him from me;

833
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.630
bid him suppose some good necessity touches his friend,

834
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.100
which craves to be remembered with those five talents.

835
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.930
That had, give it these fellows to whom 'tis instant due.

836
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.130
Ne'er speak, or think, that Timon's fortunes

837
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.770
amongst his friends can sink.

838
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.400
I would I could not think it.

839
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.100
That thought is bounty's foe;

840
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.000
being free itself, it thinks all others so.

841
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.500
Flaminius, honest Flaminius;

842
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.000
you are very respectively welcome, sir.

843
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.330
And how does that honorable, complete,

844
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.230
free-hearted gentleman of Athens,

845
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.930
thy very bountiful good lord and master?

846
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.600
His health is well sir.

847
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.630
I am right glad that his health is well, sir.

848
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.800
And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?

849
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.430
'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir;

850
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.870
Which, in my lord's behalf,

851
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.130
I come to entreat Your Honor to supply;

852
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.100
who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents,

853
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.830
hath sent to Your Lordship to furnish him,

854
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.200
nothing doubting your present assistance therein.

855
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.470
La, la!

856
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.800
La, la, la!

857
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.370
"Nothing doubting," says he?

858
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.130
Alas, good lord!

859
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.870
A noble gentleman 'tis,

860
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.530
if he would not keep so good a house.

861
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.700
Many a time and often I have dined with him,

862
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.500
and told him on it, and come again to supper to him,

863
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.330
of purpose to have him spend less,

864
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.070
and yet he would embrace no counsel,

865
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.970
take no warning by my coming.

866
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.500
Every man has his fault, and honesty is his.

867
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.630
I had told him on it,

868
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.700
but I could ne'er get him from it.

869
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.070
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise.

870
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.530
Your Lordship speaks your pleasure.

871
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.430
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit

872
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.670
give thee thy due

873
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.600
and one that knows what belongs to reason;

874
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.670
and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well.

875
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.830
Good parts in thee.

876
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.100
Draw nearer, honest Flaminius.

877
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.170
Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman.

878
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.630
But thou art wise;

879
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.770
and thou knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,

880
00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.100
that this is no time to lend money,

881
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.770
especially upon bare friendship, without security.

882
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:24.570
Here's three solidares for thee.

883
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:29.200
Good boy, wink at me, and say thou sawest me not.

884
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.830
Fare thee well.

885
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.070
Is it possible the world should so much differ,

886
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.670
and we alive that lived?

887
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.670
Fly, damned baseness, to him that worships thee!

888
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.900
Ha!

889
00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.430
Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master.

890
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.400
May these add to the number that may scald thee!

891
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.470
Let molten coin be thy damnation,

892
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.370
thou disease of a friend, and not himself!

893
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.870
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,

894
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.800
it turns in less than two nights?

895
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.970
Oh, you gods, I feel master's passion!

896
00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.100
This slave, unto his honor, has my lord's meat in him.

897
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.000
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,

898
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.830
when he is turned to poison?

899
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.900
Oh, may diseases only work upon it!

900
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.800
And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature

901
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.100
which my lord paid for

902
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.900
be of any power to expel sickness,

903
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.600
but prolong his hour!

904
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:23.600
Servilius!

905
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.700
You are kindly met, sir.

906
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.170
Commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord,

907
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.330
my very exquisite friend.

908
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.200
May it please Your Honor, my lord hath sent

909
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.970
Ha! What has he sent?

910
00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.700
I am so much endeared to that lord;

911
00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.070
he's ever sending.

912
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.570
How shall I thank him, thinkest thou?

913
00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.830
And what has he sent now?

914
00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:46.770
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;

915
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.000
requesting Your Lordship to supply his instant use

916
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.130
with so many talents.

917
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:56.070
I know His Lordship is but merry with me;

918
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.900
he cannot want 5,500 talents.

919
00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.870
But in the meantime, he wants less, my lord.

920
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.400
If his occasion were not virtuous,

921
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.100
I should not urge it half so faithfully.

922
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.770
Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?

923
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.200
Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.

924
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.770
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself

925
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.530
against such a good time,

926
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.030
when I might have shown myself honorable.

927
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.970
How unluckily it happened, that I should purchase

928
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.630
the day before for a little part

929
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:33.970
and undo a great deal of honor.

930
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:37.500
Servilius, now, before the gods, I am not able to do

931
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.730
the more beast, I say.

932
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.800
I was sending to use Lord Timon myself,

933
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.770
But I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now.

934
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.700
Commend me bountifully to His good Lordship;

935
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.600
and I hope His Honor will conceive the fairest of me,

936
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.230
because I have no power to be kind.

937
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:06.000
And tell him this from me,

938
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.070
I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say,

939
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:16.670
that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman.

940
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.830
Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far

941
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.500
as to use mine own words to him?

942
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.700
Yes, sir, I shall.

943
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.470
I'll look you out a good turn,

944
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.530
Servilius.

945
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.930
Must he needs trouble me in it, hmm,

946
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.270
above all others?

947
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.170
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;

948
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.300
and now Ventidius is wealthy too,

949
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.170
whom he redeemed from prison.

950
00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.070
all these owe their estates unto him.

951
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.500
My lord, they've all been touched and found base metal,

952
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.030
for they have all denied him.

953
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.570
How!

954
00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.330
Have they denied him?

955
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.230
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?

956
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.330
And does he send to me?

957
00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.430
Three?

958
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.800
Hum!

959
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.970
It shows but little love or judgment in him.

960
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.870
Must I be his last refuge?

961
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.600
His friends, like physicians, thrice give him over.

962
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.500
Must I take the cure upon me?

963
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.070
Has much disgraced me in it;

964
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:32.770
I'm angry at him, that might have known my place.

965
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.330
I see no sense for it,

966
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.970
but his occasions might have wooed me first;

967
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.800
for, in my conscience, I was the first man

968
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.270
that e'er received gift from him.

969
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.730
And does he think so backwardly of me now

970
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.670
that I'll requite it last?

971
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.500
No.

972
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.200
So it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest,

973
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.000
and I amongst the lords be thought a fool.

974
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.270
I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum

975
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.730
had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;

976
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.000
I'd such a courage to do him good.

977
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.270
But now return, and with their faint reply this answer join:

978
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.400
who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.

979
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:16.730
One of Lord Timon's men.

980
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.900
Flaminius!

981
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.100
Sir, a word.

982
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.000
Pray, is my lord ready to come forth?

983
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.100
No, indeed, he is not.

984
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.230
We attend His Lordship;

985
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.230
pray, signify so much.

986
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.230
I need not tell him that!

987
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.230
He knows you are too diligent.

988
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:27.270
Is not that his steward muffled so?

989
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.400
He goes away in a cloud.

990
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.400
Call him.

991
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.570
Ho! Do you hear, sir?

992
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.800
By your leave, sir,

993
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.500
What do ye ask of me, my friend?

994
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.430
We wait for certain money here, sir.

995
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.430
Ay, if money were as certain as your waiting,

996
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.900
'twere sure enough.

997
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.030
Why then preferred you not your sums and bills,

998
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.830
when your false masters eat of my lord's meat?

999
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.570
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts

1000
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:49.270
and take down the interest into their gluttonous maws.

1001
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.230
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up.

1002
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.370
Let me pass quietly.

1003
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:55.930
Believe it, my lord and I have made an end;

1004
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.030
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.

1005
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.270
Ay, but this answer will not serve.

1006
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.130
If 'twill not serve, 'tis not so base as you;

1007
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.930
For you serve knaves.

1008
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.770
How, what does his cashiered worship mutter?

1009
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.730
No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge enough.

1010
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:08.970
Here comes Servilius;

1011
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:12.600
now we shall know some answer.

1012
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.330
If I might beseech you, gentlemen,

1013
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:15.470
to repair some other hour,

1014
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:17.030
I should derive much from it;

1015
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.570
for take it of my soul,

1016
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.600
my lord leans wondrously to discontent.

1017
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.530
His comfortable temper has forsook him;

1018
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.400
he's much out of health and keeps his chamber.

1019
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.430
Many who keep their chambers are not sick.

1020
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.770
And if it be so far beyond his health,

1021
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.600
methinks he should the sooner pay his debts

1022
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.470
and make a clear way to the gods.

1023
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.800
We cannot take this for answer, sir.

1024
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.400
Aah!

1025
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.770
Are my doors opposed against my passage?

1026
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.470
Have I been ever free,

1027
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:45.000
and must my house now be my retentive enemy, my jail?

1028
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.600
The place which I have feasted, does it now, like all mankind,

1029
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.670
show me an iron heart?

1030
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:50.730
My lord, here is my bill.

1031
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:51.730
Here's mine.

1032
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:52.730
And mine, my lord.

1033
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:53.730
Knock me down with 'em.

1034
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:54.730
Cleave me to the girdle.

1035
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:55.730
Alas, my lord

1036
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.730
Cut my heart in sums.

1037
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.730
Mine, fifty talents.

1038
00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:58.730
Tell out my blood!

1039
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:59.730
Five thousand crowns, my lord.

1040
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.730
Five thousand drops pays that.

1041
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:01.730
What's yours?

1042
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.200
Alas, my lord

1043
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.170
The gods fall upon you!

1044
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:12.470
They have even put my breath from me, the slaves.

1045
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:14.470
Creditors?

1046
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.470
Devils!

1047
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.570
My dear lord

1048
00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:18.630
What if it should be so?

1049
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.930
My lord

1050
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.200
I'll have it so.

1051
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.370
My steward!

1052
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.870
Here, my lord.

1053
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.200
So fitly?

1054
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.130
Go, bid all my friends again,

1055
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:38.870
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius.

1056
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.230
All.

1057
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.030
I'll once more feast the rascals.

1058
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.130
O my lord, you only speak from your distracted soul;

1059
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.830
there is not so much left to furnish out a moderate table.

1060
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:50.430
Be it not in thy care.

1061
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.970
Go, I charge thee, invite them all.

1062
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.870
Let in the tide of knaves once more;

1063
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.730
my cook and I'll provide.

1064
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:23.030
My lord, you have my voice to it;

1065
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.600
the fault's Bloody;

1066
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.770
'tis necessary he should die.

1067
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:29.270
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

1068
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.270
Most true.

1069
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.070
The law shall bruise him.

1070
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:38.600
Honor, health, and compassion to the senate.

1071
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.400
Now, Captain?

1072
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.370
I am an humble suitor to your virtues;

1073
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.400
for pity is the virtue of the law,

1074
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.130
and none but tyrants use it cruelly.

1075
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:56.230
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy

1076
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.970
upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,

1077
00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.270
hath stepped into the law,

1078
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.870
which is past depth to those that, without heed,

1079
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.100
do plunge into it.

1080
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.200
He is a man, setting his fate aside, of comely virtues.

1081
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.630
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice

1082
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.130
an honor in him which buys out his fault

1083
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.500
but with a noble fury and fair spirit,

1084
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.870
seeing his reputation touched to death,

1085
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.900
he did oppose his foe.

1086
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.030
And with such sober and unnoted passion,

1087
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.200
he did behoove his anger,

1088
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.600
ere 'twas spent,

1089
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.900
as if he had but proved an argument.

1090
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.500
You undergo too strict a paradox,

1091
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.670
striving to make an ugly deed look fair.

1092
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:34.400
Your words have took such pains

1093
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.870
as if they labored to bring manslaughter into form

1094
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.700
and set quarrelling upon the head of valor;

1095
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.970
which indeed is valor misbegot and came into the world

1096
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.930
when sects and factions were newly born.

1097
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.830
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer

1098
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.630
the worst that man can breathe

1099
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.130
and make his wrongs his outsides,

1100
00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.870
to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,

1101
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.570
and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,

1102
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.970
to bring it into danger.

1103
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:03.870
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,

1104
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:07.000
what folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

1105
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.100
My lord

1106
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.200
You cannot make gross sins look clear.

1107
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.230
My lord!

1108
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.430
To revenge is no valor, but to bear.

1109
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.500
My lords, then, under favor,

1110
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.170
pardon me, if I speak like a captain.

1111
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.370
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,

1112
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:21.330
and not endure all threats?

1113
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.530
Sleep upon it, and let the foes quietly cut their throats,

1114
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.470
without repugnancy?

1115
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:27.900
If there be such valor in the bearing,

1116
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.770
what make we abroad?

1117
00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:32.570
Why then, women are more valiant that stay at home,

1118
00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.500
if bearing carry it,

1119
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.630
and the ass more captain than the lion,

1120
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.930
the fellow loaden with irons wiser than the judge,

1121
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.230
if wisdom be in suffering.

1122
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:50.130
O my lords, as you are great, be pitifully good.

1123
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.530
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?

1124
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.100
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;

1125
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.970
but, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.

1126
00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:00.300
To be in anger is impiety;

1127
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.800
but who is man that is not angry?

1128
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.470
Weigh but the crime with this.

1129
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.570
You breathe in vain.

1130
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:08.330
In vain!

1131
00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:10.600
His service done at Lacedaemon and Byzantium

1132
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.270
were a sufficient briber for his life.

1133
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.370
What's that?

1134
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:14.630
I say, my lords, he has done fair service,

1135
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.530
and slain in fight many of your enemies.

1136
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.970
How full of valor did he bear himself in the last conflict,

1137
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.730
and made plenteous wounds!

1138
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.430
He has made too much plenty with 'em;

1139
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:24.230
he's a sworn rioter.

1140
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:25.870
He has a sin that often drowns him

1141
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:27.370
and takes his valor prisoner.

1142
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.570
If there were no foes,

1143
00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.170
that were enough to overcome him.

1144
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.330
In the beastly fury, he has been known to commit outrages

1145
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.300
and cherish factions.

1146
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.700
It is inferred to us

1147
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.770
that his days are foul and his drink dangerous.

1148
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.830
He dies.

1149
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.900
Hard fate!

1150
00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.970
He might have died in war.

1151
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.700
My lords, if not for any parts in him

1152
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.430
though his right arm might purchase his own time

1153
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:51.700
and be in debt to none

1154
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.330
yet more to move you,

1155
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.330
take my deserts to his, and join 'em both.

1156
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.830
And, for I know your reverend ages love security,

1157
00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:01.770
I'll pawn my victories, all my honors to you,

1158
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.600
upon his good returns.

1159
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.670
If, by this crime, he owes the law his life,

1160
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.300
why, let the war receive it in valiant gore

1161
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.770
for law is strict, and war is nothing more.

1162
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.800
We are for law.

1163
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.970
He dies.

1164
00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.000
Urge it no more, on height of our displeasure.

1165
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.300
Friend or brother,

1166
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.570
he forfeits his own blood that spills another.

1167
00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:24.100
Must it be so?

1168
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.470
It must not be.

1169
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.930
My lords, I do beseech you, know me.

1170
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:27.930
How!

1171
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.930
Call me to your remembrances.

1172
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.070
What!

1173
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.430
I cannot think but that your age has forgot me;

1174
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:33.900
it could not else be, I should prove so base, to sue,

1175
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.700
and be denied such common grace.

1176
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.070
My wounds ache at you.

1177
00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:39.870
Do you dare our anger?

1178
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.630
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;

1179
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.570
we banish thee forever.

1180
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.230
Banish me!

1181
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.270
Banish your dotage;

1182
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:52.430
banish usury, that makes the senate ugly.

1183
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:55.170
If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,

1184
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.830
attend our weightier judgment.

1185
00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:02.300
And, not to swell our spirit, he shall be executed presently.

1186
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.830
Now the gods keep you old enough;

1187
00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:07.170
that you may live only in bone, that none may look on you!

1188
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.530
I'm worse than mad.

1189
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:14.530
I have kept back their foes,

1190
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.770
while they have told their money

1191
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.270
and let out their coin upon large interest,

1192
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:22.900
I myself rich only in large hurts.

1193
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.200
All those for this?

1194
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.370
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate

1195
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.570
pours into captains' wounds?

1196
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.200
Banishment.

1197
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.670
It comes not ill;

1198
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.970
I hate not to be banished;

1199
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.730
it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury

1200
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.300
that I may strike at Athens.

1201
00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.770
I'll cheer up my discontented troops

1202
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.100
and lay for hearts.

1203
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:55.770
'Tis honor with most lands to be at odds;

1204
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:59.700
soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

1205
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.930
The good time of day to you, sir.

1206
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:17.130
I also wish it to you.

1207
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:22.070
I think this honorable lord did but try us this other day.

1208
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.100
Upon that were my thoughts tiring,

1209
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.600
when we encountered.

1210
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.000
I hope it is not so low with him

1211
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.800
as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.

1212
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.900
It should not be,

1213
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.030
by the persuasion of his new feasting.

1214
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:41.900
I should think so.

1215
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.900
He hath sent me an earnest inviting,

1216
00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:49.370
which many my near occasions did urge me to put off;

1217
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.000
but he hath conjured me beyond them,

1218
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.770
and I must needs appear.

1219
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:57.730
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business,

1220
00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:02.000
but he would not hear my excuse.

1221
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.070
I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me,

1222
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.370
that my provision was out.

1223
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.700
I am sick of that grief too,

1224
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.830
as I understand how all things go.

1225
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.800
Every man here's so.

1226
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.330
What would he have borrowed of you?

1227
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.400
A thousand pieces.

1228
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.200
He sent to me, sir

1229
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.400
Here he comes.

1230
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:35.730
With all my heart, gentlemen both.

1231
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.100
How fare you?

1232
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.070
Ever at the best, hearing well of Your Lordship.

1233
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:42.670
The swallow follows not summer

1234
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.200
more willing than we, Your Lordship.

1235
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.400
Nor more willingly leaves winter;

1236
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.830
such summer-birds are men.

1237
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:58.900
Our dinner will not recompense this long stay.

1238
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.670
Feast your ears with the music awhile,

1239
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.930
if they will fare so harshly of the trumpet's sound;

1240
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:10.470
we will to it presently.

1241
00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.800
I hope it remains not unkindly with Your Lordship

1242
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.630
that I returned you an empty messenger.

1243
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.300
O, sir, let it not trouble you.

1244
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:39.370
My noble lord

1245
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:41.200
My good friend, what cheer?

1246
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:45.070
My most honorable lord, I am even sick of shame that,

1247
00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:47.070
when this other day Your Lordship sent to me,

1248
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:49.230
I was so unfortunate a beggar.

1249
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.670
Think not on it.

1250
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.300
If you had sent but two hours before

1251
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.500
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.

1252
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.400
Come, bring in all together.

1253
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:09.730
All covered dishes.

1254
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.330
Royal cheer, I warrant you.

1255
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.600
I doubt not that,

1256
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.000
if money and the season can yield it.

1257
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
How do you?

1258
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.100
What's the news?

1259
01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.170
Alcibiades is banished.

1260
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.300
Hear you of it?

1261
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.070
Alcibiades banished.

1262
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:23.630
'Tis so; be sure of it.

1263
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.630
How, how?

1264
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:26.330
I pray you, upon what?

1265
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.070
My worthy friends, will you draw near?

1266
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:29.330
I'll tell you more anon.

1267
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.070
Here's a noble feast toward.

1268
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.300
This is the old man still.

1269
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.400
Will it do? Will it do?

1270
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400
It does.

1271
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.000
But time will, and so

1272
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.400
I do conceive.

1273
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:48.000
Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would

1274
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
to the lip of his mistress.

1275
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.030
Your diet shall be in all places alike.

1276
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.900
Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool

1277
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.700
ere we can agree upon the first place.

1278
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.530
Sit, sit.

1279
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:04.070
The gods require our thanks.

1280
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.070
You great benefactors,

1281
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:16.730
sprinkle our society with thankfulness.

1282
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:21.270
For your own gifts, let yourselves be praised.

1283
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:26.270
But reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised.

1284
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:29.100
Lend to each man enough,

1285
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.970
that one need not lend to another;

1286
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.030
for, were your godheads to borrow of men,

1287
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.000
men would forsake the gods.

1288
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.270
Let the meat be beloved

1289
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:41.370
more than the man that gives it.

1290
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:45.030
Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains.

1291
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:48.100
if there sit twelve women at the table,

1292
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.200
let a dozen of them be as they are.

1293
01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:56.130
The rest of your fees, you gods

1294
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.300
the senators of Athens,

1295
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.830
together with the common lag of people

1296
01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.370
what is amiss in them,

1297
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:04.770
you gods, make suitable for destruction.

1298
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:09.100
For these, my present friends, as they are nothing to me,

1299
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.530
so in nothing bless them,

1300
01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:13.170
and to nothing are they welcome.

1301
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.930
Uncover, dogs, and lap.

1302
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.370
What does His Lordship mean?

1303
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:36.230
I know not.

1304
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.900
May you a better feast never behold,

1305
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.900
you knot of mouth-friends.

1306
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.130
Smoke and lukewarm water is your perfection.

1307
01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:46.530
This is Timon's last;

1308
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.930
who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,

1309
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:53.400
washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces

1310
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.100
your reeking villainy.

1311
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.430
Live loathed and long,

1312
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:06.370
most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,

1313
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:13.370
courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,

1314
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:20.130
you fools of fortune, trencher-friends,

1315
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:25.630
cap and knee slaves, vapors, minute-jacks!

1316
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:32.730
Of man and beast the infinite malady crust you quite o'er!

1317
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.430
What, dost thou go?

1318
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.970
All in motion soft!

1319
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:39.000
Take thy physic first thou too

1320
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.770
and thou

1321
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:43.400
Stay, I'll lend thee money, borrow none.

1322
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.730
Henceforth be no feast,

1323
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.330
whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.

1324
01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:52.330
Burn, house!

1325
01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:55.430
Sink, Athens!

1326
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.100
Henceforth hated be of Timon

1327
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.070
man and all humanity!

1328
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:06.400
Matrons, turn incontinent!

1329
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.200
Obedience, fail in children!

1330
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.300
Slaves and fools,

1331
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.270
pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,

1332
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:17.500
and minister in their steads!

1333
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.930
To general filths convert of the instant,

1334
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:24.070
green virginity, do it in your parents' eyes!

1335
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.000
Bankrupts, hold fast;

1336
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.430
rather than render back, out with your knives,

1337
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.470
and cut your trusters' throats!

1338
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.630
Bound servants, steal!

1339
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.530
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,

1340
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:39.630
and pill by law.

1341
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:43.130
Maid, to thy master's bed;

1342
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:45.900
thy mistress is of the brothel!

1343
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.200
Son of sixteen, pluck the lined crutch

1344
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.300
from thy old limping sire, with it, beat out his brains!

1345
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.870
Piety and fear, religion to the gods,

1346
01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:01.970
peace, justice, truth, domestic awe, night-rest,

1347
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.170
neighborhood, instruction, manners,

1348
01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.730
mysteries, trades,

1349
01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:09.670
decline to your confounding contraries,

1350
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:12.630
and let confusion live!

1351
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:15.400
Plagues, incident to men,

1352
01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.600
your potent and infectious fevers heap on Athens,

1353
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.570
ripe for stroke!

1354
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:25.270
Thou cold sciatica, cripple our senators,

1355
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.800
that their limbs may halt as lamely as their manners.

1356
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.300
Lust and liberty creep into the minds and marrows of our youth,

1357
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.400
that 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,

1358
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.500
and drown themselves in riot!

1359
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.200
Itches, blains, sow all the Athenian bosoms;

1360
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.170
and their crop be general leprosy!

1361
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:51.770
Breath infect breath, that their society,

1362
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:55.200
as their friendship, may be merely poisoned!

1363
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.500
Nothing I'll bear from thee but nakedness,

1364
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.230
thou detestable town!

1365
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:08.630
Take thou that with multiplying bans!

1366
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.900
The gods confound

1367
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.970
hear me, you good gods all

1368
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.470
the Athenians both within and out that wall!

1369
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:21.930
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow

1370
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:26.770
to the whole race of mankind, high and low!

1371
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:28.300
Amen.

1372
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.800
Hear you!

1373
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:44.730
Master steward?

1374
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:52.930
Where's our master?

1375
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400
Are we undone?

1376
01:06:57.630 --> 01:07:00.470
Cast off? Nothing remaining?

1377
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:04.400
Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?

1378
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.500
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,

1379
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.130
I am as poor as you.

1380
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.700
Such a house broke?

1381
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.370
So noble a master fallen?

1382
01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.170
All gone, and not one friend to take his fortune by the arm,

1383
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.370
and go along with him?

1384
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:17.570
As we do turn our back from our companion

1385
01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:18.600
thrown into his grave,

1386
01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.730
so his familiars to his buried fortunes

1387
01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:21.900
slink all away,

1388
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.300
leave their false vows in him,

1389
01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.870
like empty purses picked;

1390
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.100
and his poor self, a dedicated beggar to the air,

1391
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.200
with his disease of all-shunned poverty,

1392
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.330
walks, like contempt, alone.

1393
01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:34.730
More of our fellows.

1394
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:37.500
All broken implements of a ruined house.

1395
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.230
Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;

1396
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.730
that see I by our faces;

1397
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:46.700
we are fellows still, serving alike in sorrow.

1398
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.670
Leaked is our bark, and we, poor mates,

1399
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.270
stand on the dying deck, hearing the surges threat.

1400
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:53.270
We must all part into this sea of air.

1401
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.200
Good fellows all, the latest of my wealth

1402
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.000
I'll share amongst you.

1403
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.870
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,

1404
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.530
let's yet be fellows;

1405
01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.300
let's shake our heads and say,

1406
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.930
as 'twere a knell unto our master's fortune,

1407
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:06.270
"We have seen better days."

1408
01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:07.630
Let each take some;

1409
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:09.700
nay, put out all your hands.

1410
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.870
Not one word more.

1411
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:17.170
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.

1412
01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:20.770
Oh, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us.

1413
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.870
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,

1414
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:26.670
since riches point to misery and contempt?

1415
01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.230
Who would be so mocked with glory?

1416
01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:30.800
Or to live but in a dream of friendship?

1417
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.700
To have his pomp and all what state compounds

1418
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:37.130
but only painted, like his varnished friends?

1419
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:40.630
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,

1420
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:43.000
undone by goodness.

1421
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.700
Strange, unusual blood, when man's worst sin is

1422
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.800
he does too much good.

1423
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.500
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?

1424
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:54.330
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.

1425
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:58.400
My dearest lord, blessed, to be most accursed,

1426
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.200
rich, only to be wretched,

1427
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.200
thy great fortunes are made thy chief afflictions.

1428
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.630
Alas, kind lord.

1429
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.900
He's flung in rage

1430
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.770
from this ingrateful seat of monstrous friends,

1431
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.430
nor has he with him to supply his life,

1432
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.370
or that which can command it.

1433
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.900
I'll follow and inquire him out.

1434
01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.200
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;

1435
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.430
whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

1436
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:28.770
O blessed breeding sun,

1437
01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:33.430
draw from the earth rotten humidity;

1438
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:38.700
below thy sister's orb, infect the air!

1439
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.170
Twin brothers of one womb,

1440
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.830
whose procreation, residence, and birth

1441
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:47.000
scarce is dividant,

1442
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.930
touch them with several fortunes;

1443
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:54.200
the greater scorns the lesser.

1444
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.200
Not nature, to whom all sores lay siege,

1445
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.870
can bear great fortune,

1446
01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:03.970
but by contempt of nature.

1447
01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:09.130
Raise me this beggar, deny it that lord;

1448
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:13.300
the senator shall bear contempt hereditary,

1449
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:18.000
the beggar, native honor.

1450
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.630
It is the pasture lards, the brother's sides,

1451
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:25.030
the want that makes him lean.

1452
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:28.400
Who dares, who dares,

1453
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.470
in purity of manhood stand upright,

1454
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:33.870
and say, "This man's a flatterer"?

1455
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:37.630
If one be, so are they all;

1456
01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:41.930
for every grise of fortune is smoothed by that below.

1457
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:44.230
The learned pate ducks to the golden fool.

1458
01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:46.600
All is oblique;

1459
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.170
there's nothing level in our cursed natures,

1460
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:51.970
but direct villainy.

1461
01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:54.500
Therefore, be abhorred

1462
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.300
all feasts, societies, throngs of men.

1463
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:08.700
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains.

1464
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.630
Destruction fang mankind!

1465
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:21.530
Earth, yield me roots.

1466
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:23.900
Who seeks for better of thee,

1467
01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.530
sauce his palate with thy most operant poison.

1468
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.900
What is here?

1469
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.170
Gold?

1470
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:50.970
Yellow, glittering, precious gold?

1471
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:57.300
No, gods, I'm no idle votarist!

1472
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.370
Roots, you clear heavens!

1473
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.370
Thus much of this will make black white,

1474
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:14.600
foul fair, wrong right, base noble,

1475
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.770
old young, coward valiant.

1476
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.270
Ha, you gods!

1477
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:22.370
What this?

1478
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:30.800
Why, this will lug your priests and servants from your sides,

1479
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.230
pluck pillows from beneath stout men's heads.

1480
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:39.570
This yellow slave will knit and break religions,

1481
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:43.000
bless the accursed, make the hoar leprosy adored,

1482
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.900
place thieves and give them title, knee and approbation

1483
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.670
with senators on the bench.

1484
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:55.430
Why, this is it that makes the wappened widow wed again;

1485
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:58.670
she whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores

1486
01:13:58.670 --> 01:13:59.930
would cast the gorge at,

1487
01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:06.830
this embalms and spices to the April day again.

1488
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:11.530
Come, damned earth, thou common whore of mankind,

1489
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.700
that puttest odds among the route of nations,

1490
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.470
I will make thee do thy right nature.

1491
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.600
Ha!

1492
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
A drum?

1493
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:26.900
Thou art quick, but yet I'll bury thee.

1494
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.030
Thou go, strong thief,

1495
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:33.370
when gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.

1496
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:38.470
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

1497
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.370
What art thou there?

1498
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:43.000
Speak.

1499
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.430
A beast, as thou art.

1500
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:48.900
The canker gnaw thy heart,

1501
01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.100
for showing me again the eyes of man.

1502
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.170
What is thy name?

1503
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:59.370
Is man so hateful to thee that art thyself a man?

1504
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:07.300
I am Misanthropos and hate mankind.

1505
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.300
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog

1506
01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.730
that I might love thee something.

1507
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.600
I know thee well;

1508
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.130
but in thy fortunes am unlearned and strange.

1509
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:17.900
I know thee too;

1510
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.400
and more than that I know thee, I not desire to know.

1511
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.600
Follow thy drum;

1512
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.500
with man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules.

1513
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.770
Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;

1514
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:33.000
what should war be?

1515
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.170
This fell whore of thine hath in her more destruction

1516
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.070
than thy sword, for all her cherubim look.

1517
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:39.400
Oh, thy lips rot off!

1518
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.830
I'll not kiss thee;

1519
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:44.300
then the rot returns to thine own lips again.

1520
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.770
How came the noble Timon to this change?

1521
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:52.000
As the moon does, by wanting light to give.

1522
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.670
But then renew I could not, like the moon;

1523
01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:58.500
there were no suns to borrow of.

1524
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.570
Noble Timon, what friendship may I do thee?

1525
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:05.870
None, but to maintain my opinion.

1526
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:07.430
What is it, Timon?

1527
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:10.970
Promise me friendship, but perform none.

1528
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:14.000
If thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee,

1529
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.400
for thou art a man.

1530
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.270
If thou dost perform, confound thee,

1531
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:19.700
for thou art a man!

1532
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.700
I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.

1533
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.730
Thou sawest them, when I had prosperity.

1534
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:26.500
I see them now;

1535
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.170
then was a blessed time.

1536
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:31.730
As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

1537
01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:33.870
Is this the Athenian minion

1538
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.470
the world has voiced so regardfully?

1539
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:37.630
Art thou Timandra?

1540
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:38.700
Yes.

1541
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.130
Be a whore still.

1542
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.700
They love thee not that use thee;

1543
01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.330
give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.

1544
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:50.530
Make use of thy salt hours.

1545
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.270
Season the slaves for tubs and baths;

1546
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:56.230
bring down rose-cheeked youth to the tub-fast and diet.

1547
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:57.330
Hang thee, monster!

1548
01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.700
Pardon him, sweet Timandra;

1549
01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.500
his wits are drowned and lost in his calamities.

1550
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.270
I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,

1551
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:08.130
the want whereof doth daily make revolt

1552
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:09.800
in my penurious band.

1553
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.900
I have heard, and grieved, how cursed Athens,

1554
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.200
mindless of thy worth,

1555
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.670
forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbor states,

1556
01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:21.970
but for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them

1557
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.530
I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.

1558
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:26.000
I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.

1559
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.400
How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?

1560
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.300
I had rather be alone!

1561
01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.700
Why, fare thee well.

1562
01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.770
Here is some gold for thee.

1563
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:36.230
Keep it; I cannot eat it.

1564
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.500
When I have laid proud Athens on a heap

1565
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.500
Warrest thou against Athens?

1566
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.970
Ay, Timon, and have cause.

1567
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:46.900
The gods confound them all in thy conquest;

1568
01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:50.030
and thee after, when thou hast conquered!

1569
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.100
Why me, Timon?

1570
01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.200
That, by killing of villains,

1571
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.500
thou was born to conquer my country.

1572
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.600
Put up thy gold.

1573
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600
Go on

1574
01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.470
here's gold

1575
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:02.500
go on;

1576
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.530
be as a planetary plague,

1577
01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:06.500
when Jove will over some high-viced city

1578
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.670
hang his poison in the sick air.

1579
01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:11.530
Let not thy sword skip one.

1580
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.130
Pity not honored age for his white beard;

1581
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:15.800
he is an usurer.

1582
01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.100
Strike me the counterfeit matron;

1583
01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.600
it is her habit only that is honest,

1584
01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.100
herself's a bawd.

1585
01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.470
Let not the virgin's cheek make soft thy trenchant sword;

1586
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:26.800
for those milk paps, that through the window-bars

1587
01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.900
bore at men's eyes,

1588
01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.370
are not within the leaf of pity writ,

1589
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:31.930
but set them down horrible traitors.

1590
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:35.600
Spare not the babe, whose dimpled smiles

1591
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.400
from fools exhaust their mercy;

1592
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.800
think it a bastard,

1593
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.370
whom the oracle hath doubtfully pronounced

1594
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.800
the throat shall cut,

1595
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.470
and mince it sans remorse.

1596
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.730
Swear against objects;

1597
01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.000
put armor on thine ears and on thine eyes;

1598
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.730
whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,

1599
01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:54.400
nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,

1600
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.330
shall pierce a jot.

1601
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.800
There's gold to pay thy soldiers.

1602
01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.870
Make large confusion;

1603
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.500
and, thy fury spent, confounded be thyself!

1604
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.230
Speak not, be gone.

1605
01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:07.300
Hast thou gold yet?

1606
01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.330
I'll take the gold thou givest me,

1607
01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:10.800
not all thy counsel.

1608
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:17.300
Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse upon thee!

1609
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.730
Give us some gold, good Timon.

1610
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:20.270
Hast thou more?

1611
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.770
Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,

1612
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:25.200
and to make whores, a bawd.

1613
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.530
Hold up, you sluts, your aprons mountant.

1614
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:33.370
You are not oathable, although, I know, you'll swear,

1615
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:35.470
terribly swear into strong shudders

1616
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.230
and heavenly agues the immortal gods that hear you

1617
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:42.230
spare your oaths, I'll trust to your conditions.

1618
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.170
Be whores still;

1619
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:47.200
and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,

1620
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.270
be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;

1621
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:53.470
let your close fire predominate his smoke,

1622
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:54.730
and be no turncoats.

1623
01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:57.730
Yet may your pains, six months, be quite contrary.

1624
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:08.200
And thatch your poor thin roofs with burthens of the dead

1625
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.800
some that were hanged, no matter

1626
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.170
wear them, betray with them.

1627
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.800
Whore still;

1628
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.630
paint till a horse may mire upon your face,

1629
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:19.330
a pox of wrinkles!

1630
01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:20.800
Well, more gold.

1631
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.130
What then?

1632
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:24.800
Believe it that we'll do anything for gold.

1633
01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.730
Consumptions sow in hollow bones of man;

1634
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:30.400
strike their sharp shins, and mar men's spurring.

1635
01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:34.870
Crack the lawyer's voice,

1636
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:37.100
that he may never more false title plead,

1637
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.370
nor sound his quillets shrilly.

1638
01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:43.670
Hoar the flamen, who scolds against the quality of flesh,

1639
01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.830
and not believes himself.

1640
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:50.570
Down with the nose, down with it flat;

1641
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:52.930
take the bridge quite away of him that,

1642
01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:56.600
his particular to foresee, smells from the general weal.

1643
01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.730
Make curled-pate ruffians bald;

1644
01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.230
and let the unscarred braggarts of the war

1645
01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:04.970
derive some pain from you.

1646
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:07.030
Plague all;

1647
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.900
that your activity may defeat and quell

1648
01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.370
the source of all erection.

1649
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.730
There's more gold.

1650
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:16.970
Gold.

1651
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:19.570
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,

1652
01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:22.100
and ditches grave you all.

1653
01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.000
More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.

1654
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.800
More gold and more mischief first;

1655
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.230
I've given you earnest.

1656
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.900
Strike up the drum towards Athens!

1657
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.430
Farewell, Timon.

1658
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.170
If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.

1659
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:36.370
If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.

1660
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:37.570
I never did thee harm!

1661
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:39.230
Yes, thou spokest well of me.

1662
01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:40.270
Callest thou that harm?

1663
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.300
Men daily find it.

1664
01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:47.770
Get thee gone, and take thy beagles with thee.

1665
01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:50.330
We but offend him.

1666
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:51.330
Strike!

1667
01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:05.530
That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,

1668
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:08.470
should yet be hungry.

1669
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:11.700
Common mother, thou, whose womb immeasurable,

1670
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.670
and infinite breast, teems and feeds all;

1671
01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:19.930
whereof thine proud child, arrogant man, is puffed,

1672
01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:23.600
engenders the black toad and adder blue,

1673
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.970
the gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm,

1674
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:31.570
with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven

1675
01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:35.300
whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;

1676
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.670
yield him, whom all the human sons do hate,

1677
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:43.430
from forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root.

1678
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:47.500
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb;

1679
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:51.870
let it no more bring out ingrateful man.

1680
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:58.530
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, bears;

1681
01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:00.530
teem with new monsters,

1682
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:02.800
whom thy upward face to the marbled mansion

1683
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.700
all above hath never presented.

1684
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.170
A root!

1685
01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:14.100
Dear thanks!

1686
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:25.970
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;

1687
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:27.800
whereof ingrateful man,

1688
01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.800
with liquorish draughts and morsels unctuous,

1689
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.670
greases his pure mind,

1690
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:36.570
that from it all consideration slips.

1691
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:40.400
More man.

1692
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:44.600
Plague, plague!

1693
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:49.530
I was directed hither.

1694
01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:52.770
Men report thou dost affect my manners

1695
01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:54.730
and dost use them.

1696
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.330
'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,

1697
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.600
whom I would imitate.

1698
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.130
Consumption catch thee!

1699
01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:03.900
This is in thee a nature but infected;

1700
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:09.630
a poor unmanly melancholy sprung from change of fortune.

1701
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:11.530
Why this spade?

1702
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:13.470
This place?

1703
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.300
This slave-like habit?

1704
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.070
And these looks of care?

1705
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:23.430
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;

1706
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:25.730
hug their diseased perfumes,

1707
01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:27.900
and have forgot that ever Timon was.

1708
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.530
No, no, no!

1709
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:30.800
Shame not this place

1710
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.530
by putting on the cunning of a carper.

1711
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:35.430
Be thou a flatterer now,

1712
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:38.830
and seek to thrive by that which has undone thee.

1713
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.870
Hinge thy knee, and let his very breath,

1714
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:44.700
whom thoust observe, blow off thy cap;

1715
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:49.730
praise his most vicious strain, and call it excellent.

1716
01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:51.830
Thou wast told thus;

1717
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:54.000
thou gavest thine ears like tapsters

1718
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.330
that bid welcome to knaves and all approachers.

1719
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:00.930
'Tis most just that thou turn rascal;

1720
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:05.230
hadst thou wealth again, rascals should have it.

1721
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:08.230
Do not assume my likeness.

1722
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:09.870
Were I like thee, I'd throw away myself.

1723
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:12.870
Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;

1724
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:16.400
a madman so long, now a fool.

1725
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.530
What, thinkest that the bleak air,

1726
01:25:19.530 --> 01:25:23.200
thy boisterous chamberlain, will put thy shirt on warm?

1727
01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.230
Will the mossed trees that have outlived the eagle

1728
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:28.630
page thy heels, and skip where thou pointest out?

1729
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.000
Will the cold brook, candied with ice,

1730
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.430
caudle thy morning taste,

1731
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:34.630
to cure thy o'er-night's surfeit?

1732
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:37.130
Call the creatures whose naked natures

1733
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:39.230
live in all the spite of wreakful heaven,

1734
01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:41.070
whose bare unhoused trunks,

1735
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:43.500
to the conflicting elements exposed,

1736
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.500
answer mere nature;

1737
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.700
bid them flatter thee;

1738
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.700
oh, thou shalt find

1739
01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.570
A fool of thee.

1740
01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:53.770
Depart.

1741
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:57.230
I love thee better now than e'er I did.

1742
01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:58.870
I hate thee worse.

1743
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:59.870
Why?

1744
01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:01.370
Thou flatterest misery.

1745
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:02.600
I flatter not;

1746
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.200
but say thou art a caitiff.

1747
01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.070
Why dost thou seek me out?

1748
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:10.270
To vex thee.

1749
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:13.400
Always a villain's office or a fool's.

1750
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.400
Dost please thyself in it?

1751
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.400
Ay.

1752
01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.600
What! A knave too?

1753
01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.400
If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on

1754
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.730
to castigate thy pride, 'twere well.

1755
01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:24.430
But thou dost it enforcedly;

1756
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:29.370
thou wouldst courtier be again, wert thou not beggar.

1757
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:32.730
Willing misery outlives encertain pomp,

1758
01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.370
is crowned before.

1759
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:36.770
The one is filling still, never complete;

1760
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:39.600
the other, at high wish.

1761
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.730
Best state, contentless, hath a distracted

1762
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.700
and most wretched being,

1763
01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:51.970
worse than the worst, content.

1764
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:56.770
Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.

1765
01:26:56.770 --> 01:27:00.830
Not by his breath that is more miserable.

1766
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:05.030
Thou art a slave, whom fortune's tender arm

1767
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:06.500
with favor never clasped,

1768
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.570
but bred a dog.

1769
01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:11.730
Hadst thou, like us from our first swath,

1770
01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:12.900
proceeded the sweet degrees

1771
01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.870
that this brief world affords to such

1772
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:17.030
as may the passive drudges of it freely command,

1773
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:21.530
thou wouldst have drowned thyself in general riot;

1774
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.570
melted down thy youth in different beds of lust;

1775
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:26.130
and never learned the icy precepts of respect,

1776
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:29.430
but followed the sugared game before thee.

1777
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:34.600
But myself, who had the world as my confectionary,

1778
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.670
the eyes, the tongues, the hearts,

1779
01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:38.230
the mouths of men at duty,

1780
01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:40.630
more than I could frame employment,

1781
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:45.730
these that numberless upon me stuck

1782
01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:46.970
as leaves do on the oak,

1783
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.500
with one winter's brush fell from their boughs

1784
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:53.800
and left me open, bare to every storm that blows.

1785
01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.530
I, to bear this, that never knew but better,

1786
01:27:56.530 --> 01:27:57.730
is some burden.

1787
01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.470
Thy nature did commence in sufferance,

1788
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:04.270
time hath made thee hard in it.

1789
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:07.100
Why dost thou hate men?

1790
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.600
They never flattered thee.

1791
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.270
What hast thou given?

1792
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:14.300
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,

1793
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.470
must be thy subject,

1794
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:17.730
who in spite put stuff to some she beggar

1795
01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:21.030
and compounded thee poor rogue hereditary.

1796
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:23.530
Hence, be gone!

1797
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:25.030
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,

1798
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:26.670
thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

1799
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.370
Art thou proud yet?

1800
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:30.030
Ay, that I am not thee.

1801
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:32.000
I, that I was no prodigal.

1802
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.400
I, that I am one now.

1803
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.830
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,

1804
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.870
I'd give thee leave to hang it.

1805
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:39.870
Get thee gone.

1806
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.230
That the whole world of Athens were in this,

1807
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:47.900
thus would I eat it.

1808
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.770
Here; I will mend thy feast.

1809
01:28:49.770 --> 01:28:51.970
First, mend my company; take away thyself.

1810
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:54.270
So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.

1811
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.370
'Tis not well mended so; 'tis but botched;

1812
01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:59.700
if 'twere not, I would it were.

1813
01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.370
What wouldst thou have to Athens?

1814
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:05.270
Thee thither in a whirlwind.

1815
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:08.770
If thou wilt, tell them there I have gold.

1816
01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:11.630
Look.

1817
01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:15.870
See?

1818
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.200
So I have.

1819
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:21.600
Here is no use for gold.

1820
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.470
The best and truest;

1821
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:26.330
for here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.

1822
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:36.200
Where liest at nights, Timon?

1823
01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.200
Under that's above me.

1824
01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.270
Where feedest thou days, Apemantus?

1825
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:43.330
Where my stomach finds meat;

1826
01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:45.070
or, rather, where I eat it.

1827
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:47.300
Would poison were obedient and knew my mind.

1828
01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.530
Where wouldst thou send it?

1829
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:49.670
To sauce thy dishes.

1830
01:29:54.130 --> 01:29:56.970
The middle of humanity thou never knewest,

1831
01:29:56.970 --> 01:29:59.930
but the extremity of both ends.

1832
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:02.230
When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume,

1833
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:05.130
they mocked thee for too much curiosity;

1834
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:07.400
in thy rags, thou knowest none,

1835
01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.530
but art despised for the contrary.

1836
01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:14.730
There's a medlar for thee; eat it.

1837
01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:16.870
On what I hate I feed not.

1838
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.430
Dost hate a medlar?

1839
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:21.730
Ay, e'en though it look like thee.

1840
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:24.070
Hadst thou hated medlars sooner,

1841
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:26.200
thou shouldst have loved thyself better now.

1842
01:30:30.130 --> 01:30:32.030
What man didst thou ever know unthrift

1843
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:35.530
that was beloved after his means?

1844
01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.270
Who, without those means thou speaks of,

1845
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:38.500
didst ever know beloved?

1846
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Myself.

1847
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.570
I understand thee;

1848
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:42.370
thou hadst some means to keep a dog.

1849
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:51.630
What things in the world

1850
01:30:51.630 --> 01:30:57.000
canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?

1851
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.800
Women nearest;

1852
01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.130
but men, men are the things themselves.

1853
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.600
What wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus,

1854
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.700
if it lay in your power?

1855
01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.330
Give it the beasts to be rid of the men.

1856
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:20.100
Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men

1857
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.630
and live a beast with the beasts?

1858
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.870
Ay, Timon.

1859
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.130
A beastly ambition,

1860
01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:28.530
which the gods grant thee to attain to.

1861
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:32.600
Wert thou the lion, the fox would beguile thee;

1862
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.800
wert thou the lamb, the fox would eat thee up.

1863
01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.300
Wert thou the fox, the lion would suspect thee,

1864
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.100
when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass.

1865
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:46.530
Wert thou the ass, thy dullness would torment thee,

1866
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:49.700
and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf.

1867
01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:53.030
Wert thou the wolf, thy greediness should afflict thee,

1868
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:55.930
and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner.

1869
01:31:55.930 --> 01:32:00.070
Wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee

1870
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.700
and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury.

1871
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.600
Wert thou a bear, thou would be killed by a horse.

1872
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.100
Wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by a leopard.

1873
01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.800
Wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane to the lion,

1874
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.470
and all the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life.

1875
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:20.370
All thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence.

1876
01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:21.630
What beast couldst thou be

1877
01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:23.970
that were not subject to a beast?

1878
01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:25.570
And what a beast art thou already

1879
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:27.870
that seest not thy loss in transformation.

1880
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:33.570
If thou couldst please me with speaking to me,

1881
01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:36.430
thou mightst have hit upon it here.

1882
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:41.070
The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts.

1883
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:43.570
How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city?

1884
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:49.600
Yonder comes a poet and a painter.

1885
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.530
The plague of company light upon thee.

1886
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:57.030
I will fear to catch it and give way.

1887
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:04.400
When I know not what else to do, I'll see thee again.

1888
01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.300
When there is not else living but thee,

1889
01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.630
thou shalt be welcome.

1890
01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:11.200
I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.

1891
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:15.970
Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.

1892
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.600
Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon.

1893
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.670
A plague upon thee.

1894
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:20.230
Thou art too bad to curse.

1895
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.030
All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

1896
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:24.430
There is no leprosy but what thou speakest.

1897
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:26.730
If I name thee.

1898
01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:28.670
I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.

1899
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:30.800
I would my tongue could rot them off.

1900
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.200
Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!

1901
01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.230
Choler does kill me that thou art still alive;

1902
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:37.230
I swound to see thee.

1903
01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:39.170
Wouldst thou would burst!

1904
01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:41.130
Away, thou tedious rogue!

1905
01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:44.670
I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.

1906
01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:45.900
Beast!

1907
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.930
Slave!

1908
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:48.070
Toad!

1909
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:52.930
Rogue, rogue, rogue!

1910
01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:55.870
I am sick of this false world

1911
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:59.730
and will love nought but even the mere necessities upon it.

1912
01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:04.630
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;

1913
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:07.070
lie where the light foam of the sea

1914
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:09.770
may beat thy grave stone daily.

1915
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:12.830
Make thine epitaph, that death in me

1916
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:15.300
at other lives may laugh.

1917
01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:20.600
O thou sweet king killer,

1918
01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.000
thou dear divorce 'twixt natural son and sire!

1919
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.200
Thou bright defiler of Hymen's purest bed!

1920
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.730
Thou valiant Mars!

1921
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:35.500
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,

1922
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.730
whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow

1923
01:34:37.730 --> 01:34:40.270
that lies on Dian's lap!

1924
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:44.800
Thou visible god that solderest close impossibilities,

1925
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.200
and makest them kiss.

1926
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.130
Thou touch of hearts.

1927
01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:53.200
Think, thy slave man rebels,

1928
01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.830
and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds,

1929
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:57.670
that beasts may have the world in empire!

1930
01:34:57.670 --> 01:34:59.970
Would 'twere so!

1931
01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:02.570
But not till I am dead.

1932
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:04.030
I'll say thou hast gold.

1933
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:06.300
Thou wilt be thronged to shortly.

1934
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.770
Get back, I prithee!

1935
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:12.830
Live, and love thy misery.

1936
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:16.230
Long live so, and so die.

1937
01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:21.400
I am quit.

1938
01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.900
More things like men!

1939
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.030
Eat, Timon, and abhor them.

1940
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:39.170
Where should he have this gold?

1941
01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:40.230
It is some poor fragment,

1942
01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:41.670
some slender sort of his remainder.

1943
01:35:41.670 --> 01:35:42.700
The mere want of gold,

1944
01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:43.770
and the falling-from of his friends,

1945
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:45.270
drove him into this melancholy.

1946
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:47.130
It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.

1947
01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:48.500
Let us make the assay upon him.

1948
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.170
If he care not for it, he will supply us easily;

1949
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:54.770
if he covetously reserve it, how shall us get it?

1950
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:57.200
True; for he bears it not about him.

1951
01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.070
It's hid.

1952
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:01.730
Is not that he?

1953
01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:02.730
Where?

1954
01:36:02.730 --> 01:36:04.430
It is his description.

1955
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:06.200
What, he?

1956
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:09.030
I know him.

1957
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.930
Save thee, Timon.

1958
01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:20.270
Now, thieves?

1959
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.830
Soldiers, not thieves.

1960
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:24.470
Both too;

1961
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:25.800
and women's sons.

1962
01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.930
We are not thieves; we are men that much do want.

1963
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:33.600
Your greatest want is, you want much meat.

1964
01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.200
Why should you want?

1965
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.570
Behold, the earth hath roots;

1966
01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:43.570
within this mile break forth a hundred springs;

1967
01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:49.930
the oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;

1968
01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.200
the bounteous housewife, nature,

1969
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.230
on each bush lays her full mess before you.

1970
01:36:55.230 --> 01:36:57.030
Want!

1971
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:58.300
Why want?

1972
01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.030
We cannot live on grass, berries, water,

1973
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:04.870
as beasts, birds, and fishes.

1974
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:09.130
Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;

1975
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:13.370
you must eat men.

1976
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:17.830
Yet thanks I must you con that you are thieves professed,

1977
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.800
that you work not in holier shapes.

1978
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.570
For there is boundless theft in limited professions.

1979
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:31.270
Rascal thieves, here's gold.

1980
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:35.800
Go, suck the subtle blood of the grape,

1981
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.200
till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,

1982
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.630
and so 'scape hanging.

1983
01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:43.130
Trust not the physician;

1984
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:45.970
his antidotes are poison;

1985
01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:49.270
he slays more than you rob.

1986
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:52.730
Take wealth and lives together;

1987
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:58.700
do villainy, do, since you protest to do it, like workmen.

1988
01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.630
I'll example you with thievery.

1989
01:38:02.630 --> 01:38:06.130
The sun's a thief, and, with his great attraction,

1990
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.870
robs the vast sea.

1991
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:11.430
The moon's an arrant thief

1992
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:15.770
whose pale fire is snatched from the sun.

1993
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:18.370
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge

1994
01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:22.130
resolves the moon into salt tears.

1995
01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:25.400
The earth's a thief that feeds and breeds

1996
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.600
from the composture stolen from general excrement.

1997
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.130
Each thing's a thief.

1998
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:35.570
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power,

1999
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:38.530
has unchecked theft.

2000
01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:40.830
Love not yourselves.

2001
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:42.070
Rob one another.

2002
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.100
There's more gold.

2003
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:48.830
Cut throats.

2004
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:50.570
All that you meet are thieves.

2005
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:53.100
To Athens go, break open shops;

2006
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:56.570
nothing can you steal, but thieves do lose it.

2007
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:59.100
Steal not less for this I give you;

2008
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.970
and gold confound you howsoe'er.

2009
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.430
Amen.

2010
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:06.400
Has almost charmed me from my profession

2011
01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.770
by persuading me to it.

2012
01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:10.000
It is in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us;

2013
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.170
not to have us thrive in our mystery.

2014
01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:14.570
I'll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade.

2015
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:17.070
Let us first see peace in Athens.

2016
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:22.500
There is no time so miserable a man may be true.

2017
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.670
True.

2018
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:48.070
O you gods.

2019
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:52.830
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?

2020
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:56.400
Full of decay and failing?

2021
01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:01.200
O monument and wonder of good deeds evilly disposed.

2022
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.070
What an alteration of honor has desperate want made.

2023
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:06.930
What viler thing upon the earth than friends

2024
01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:10.530
who can bring noblest minds to basest ends.

2025
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:12.400
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,

2026
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.470
when man was wished to love his enemies.

2027
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:17.070
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo

2028
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:20.600
those who would mischief me than those that do.

2029
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.370
Has caught me in his eye.

2030
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:25.370
I will present my honest grief unto him;

2031
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:30.130
and, as my lord, still serve him with my life.

2032
01:40:30.130 --> 01:40:32.370
My dearest master.

2033
01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:35.070
Away.

2034
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:36.830
What art thou?

2035
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:39.530
Have you forgot me, sir?

2036
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:41.370
I have forgot all men;

2037
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:44.170
then, if thou grantest thou art a man,

2038
01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:45.900
I have forgot thee.

2039
01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.830
An honest poor servant of yours.

2040
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:51.500
Then I know thee not.

2041
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.330
I never had honest men about me, I

2042
01:40:54.330 --> 01:40:57.600
all I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

2043
01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.830
The gods are witness,

2044
01:40:58.830 --> 01:41:00.600
ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief

2045
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.870
for his undone lord than mine eyes for you.

2046
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:07.130
Why dost thou weep?

2047
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:08.170
Come nearer.

2048
01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.170
Then I love thee, because thou art a woman

2049
01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:18.830
and disclaimest flinty mankind,

2050
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:24.870
whose eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter.

2051
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:28.070
Pity's sleeping.

2052
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:30.100
Strange times that weep with laughing,

2053
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:31.500
not with weeping.

2054
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.100
I beg of you to know me, good my lord,

2055
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:34.170
to accept my grief,

2056
01:41:34.170 --> 01:41:35.830
and whilst this poor wealth lasts,

2057
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:38.900
to entertain me as your steward still.

2058
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:46.330
Had I a steward so true, so just,

2059
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:49.970
and now so comfortable?

2060
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:56.530
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.

2061
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:58.000
Let me behold thy face.

2062
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.000
Surely, this man was born of woman.

2063
01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:18.200
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,

2064
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.370
you perpetual-sober gods.

2065
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:26.400
I do proclaim one honest man

2066
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.370
mistake me not

2067
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:33.400
but one; no more, I pray,

2068
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.870
and he's a steward.

2069
01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:46.430
How fain I would have hated all mankind.

2070
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:50.370
But thou redeemest thyself.

2071
01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:55.000
But all, save thee, I fell with curses.

2072
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.200
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;

2073
01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.200
for, by oppressing and betraying me,

2074
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.500
thou mightst sooner got another service.

2075
01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.430
For many so arrive at second masters,

2076
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:16.730
upon their first lord's neck.

2077
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:19.830
But tell me true

2078
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:24.630
for I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure

2079
01:43:24.630 --> 01:43:33.500
is not thy kindness subtle, covetous, and

2080
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.970
and, as rich men deal gifts,

2081
01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:37.870
expecting in return twenty for one?

2082
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.830
No, no, my most worthy master;

2083
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:41.670
in whose breast doubt and suspect, alas,

2084
01:43:41.670 --> 01:43:43.130
are placed too late.

2085
01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:45.500
You should have feared false times when you did feast.

2086
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:48.800
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.

2087
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.200
That which I show, heaven knows,

2088
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.730
is merely love, duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,

2089
01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:54.300
care of your food and living;

2090
01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:55.830
and, believe it, my most honored lord,

2091
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:57.370
for any benefit that comes to me,

2092
01:43:57.370 --> 01:44:00.830
either in hope or present, I'd exchange for this one wish,

2093
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:03.000
that you had power and wealth to requite me

2094
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.300
by making rich yourself.

2095
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:10.230
Why, look thee, 'tis so.

2096
01:44:10.230 --> 01:44:12.970
Thou singly honest man,

2097
01:44:12.970 --> 01:44:17.400
the gods out of my misery have sent thee treasure.

2098
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:21.630
Go, live rich and happy;

2099
01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:24.770
but thus conditioned:

2100
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:27.530
thou shalt build from men;

2101
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:32.230
hate all, curse all, show charity to none,

2102
01:44:32.230 --> 01:44:34.430
but let the famished flesh slide from the bone,

2103
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:35.900
ere thou relieve the beggar;

2104
01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:38.830
give to dogs what thou deniest to men;

2105
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:44.370
let prisons swallow 'em up, debts wither 'em to nothing;

2106
01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:46.630
be men like blasted woods,

2107
01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:49.030
and diseases lick their false bloods.

2108
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:51.300
So, so farewell and thrive.

2109
01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.130
Oh, let me stay and comfort you, my master.

2110
01:44:53.130 --> 01:44:57.530
Fly, whilst thou art blest and free!

2111
01:44:57.530 --> 01:45:01.100
Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

2112
01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:24.630
As I took note of the place,

2113
01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:27.130
it cannot be far where he abides.

2114
01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:28.900
What's to be thought of him?

2115
01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.400
Does the rumour hold for true that he's so full of gold?

2116
01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.600
Certain.

2117
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.670
Alcibiades reports it;

2118
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.500
Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.

2119
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.870
He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers

2120
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:40.070
with great quantity.

2121
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:41.070
Then this breaking of his

2122
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:43.500
has been but a try for his friends.

2123
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.630
Nothing else.

2124
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:46.070
You shall see him a palm in Athens again

2125
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:47.530
and flourish with the highest.

2126
01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:50.230
Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our love to him

2127
01:45:50.230 --> 01:45:52.630
in this supposed distress of his.

2128
01:45:52.630 --> 01:45:54.270
It will show honestly in us

2129
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:55.570
and is very likely to load our purposes

2130
01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:56.830
with what they travail for,

2131
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:59.330
if it be a just and true report that goes of his having.

2132
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:03.470
What have you now to present unto him?

2133
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:06.000
Nothing at this time but my visitation.

2134
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.070
Only I will promise him a most excellent piece.

2135
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:10.830
I must serve him so too,

2136
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:14.670
tell him of an intent that's coming towards him.

2137
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:15.870
Good as the best.

2138
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:17.930
Promising is the very air of the time.

2139
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:20.630
It opens the eyes of expectation.

2140
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:22.630
Performance is ever the duller for his act;

2141
01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:24.830
and, but in the plainer and simpler kind of people,

2142
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:27.600
the deed of saying is quite out of use.

2143
01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:30.970
To promise is most courtly and fashionable.

2144
01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:34.400
Performance is a kind of will or testament

2145
01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.370
that argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it.

2146
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:41.970
I am thinking what I shall say that I have provided for him,

2147
01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:43.970
it must be a personating of himself,

2148
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:47.700
a satire against the softness of prosperity,

2149
01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.800
with a discovery of the infinite flatteries

2150
01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.530
that follow youth and opulency.

2151
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.230
Nay, let's seek him.

2152
01:46:54.230 --> 01:46:56.870
Then do we sin against our own estate,

2153
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:59.870
when we may profit meet and come too late.

2154
01:46:59.870 --> 01:47:01.270
True;

2155
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:03.870
when the day serves, before black-cornered night,

2156
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:06.600
find what thou wantest by free and offered light.

2157
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.800
Come.

2158
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:24.870
Hail, worthy Timon!

2159
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:26.900
Our late noble master.

2160
01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:32.400
Have I once lived to see two honest men?

2161
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:37.370
Sir, having often of your open bounty tasted,

2162
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:41.100
hearing you were retired,

2163
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.770
your friends fallen off, whose thankless natures

2164
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:45.270
O abhorred spirits

2165
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:47.330
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough.

2166
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:48.330
What!

2167
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:51.900
to you, whose star-like nobleness

2168
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:54.930
gave life and influence to their whole being.

2169
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:58.200
I am rapt and cannot cover the monstrous bulk

2170
01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.170
of this ingratitude with any size of words.

2171
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:04.930
Let it go naked; men may see it the better.

2172
01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:07.730
You that are honest, by being what you are,

2173
01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:10.030
make it best seen and known.

2174
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:13.570
He and myself have travailed in the great

2175
01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:14.570
and sweetly felt it.

2176
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:16.530
Ay, you are honest men.

2177
01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:20.030
We are hither come to offer you our service.

2178
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:23.370
Most honest men.

2179
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:25.200
How shall I requite you?

2180
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.900
Can you eat root and drink cold water?

2181
01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.000
No?

2182
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.100
What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.

2183
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.800
You're honest men.

2184
01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:57.570
You've heard that I have gold?

2185
01:48:59.030 --> 01:49:00.900
I am sure you have.

2186
01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:01.900
Speak truth;

2187
01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.600
you're honest men.

2188
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.370
So it is said, my noble lord;

2189
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:07.070
but therefore came not my friend nor I.

2190
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:13.070
Ay, good honest men.

2191
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:17.470
Thou drawest the best counterfeit in all Athens.

2192
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:19.130
Indeed, thou art the best;

2193
01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:22.330
Thou counterfeitest most lively.

2194
01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:23.570
So, so, my lord.

2195
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:26.530
Even so, sir, as I say.

2196
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:29.570
And, for thy fiction, why,

2197
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:35.130
thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth,

2198
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:38.370
thou art even natural in thine own art.

2199
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:42.370
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,

2200
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:45.870
I must needs say you have a little fault.

2201
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.030
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you,

2202
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:50.830
neither wish I you take much pains to mend.

2203
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:53.530
Beseech Your Honor; make it known to us.

2204
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:57.500
You'll take it ill.

2205
01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.730
Most thankfully, my lord.

2206
01:49:58.730 --> 01:49:59.930
Will you, indeed?

2207
01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:02.170
Doubt it not, worthy lord.

2208
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:09.930
There's never a one of you that trusts a knave,

2209
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:13.270
but mightily deceives you.

2210
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:14.470
Do we, my lord?

2211
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:20.600
Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,

2212
01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.430
know his gross patchery,

2213
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:27.800
love him, feed him, keep in your bosom.

2214
01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.030
Yet remain assured, he's a made-up villain.

2215
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:34.100
I know none such, my lord.

2216
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.200
Nor I.

2217
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.070
Look you, I love you well;

2218
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:38.870
I'll give you gold;

2219
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:41.970
rid me these villains from your companies.

2220
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:45.870
Hang them, stab them, drown them in a draught,

2221
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:47.100
confound them by some course,

2222
01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.400
come to me; I'll give you gold enough.

2223
01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.630
Name them, my lord; let's know them.

2224
01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:55.400
You that way and you this,

2225
01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.400
each man apart, but two in company,

2226
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.200
all single and alone,

2227
01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.200
yet an arch-villain keeps him company.

2228
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:17.370
If where thou art two villains shall not be,

2229
01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.570
come not near him.

2230
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:27.700
If thou would not reside but where one villain is,

2231
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:29.600
then him abandon.

2232
01:51:39.370 --> 01:51:43.470
Hence, pack!

2233
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:45.200
You came for gold, you slaves.

2234
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:48.900
There's gold.

2235
01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.970
You've worked for me;

2236
01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.370
there's payment!

2237
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:53.630
You're an alchemist;

2238
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:55.430
make gold of that.

2239
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:58.100
Out, rascal dogs!

2240
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:14.730
It is vain that you would speak with Timon;

2241
01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:16.830
for he is set so only to himself

2242
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.700
that nothing but himself which looks like man

2243
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:19.730
is friendly with him.

2244
01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:21.000
Bring us to him.

2245
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.430
It is our part and promise to the Athenians

2246
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:23.830
to speak with Timon.

2247
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:25.900
At all times, alike men are not still the same.

2248
01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.930
'Twas time and griefs that framed him thus.

2249
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:31.570
Time, with his fairer hand, offering the fortunes

2250
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:33.730
of his former days,

2251
01:52:33.730 --> 01:52:35.470
the former man may make him.

2252
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:37.370
Bring us to him, and chance it as it may.

2253
01:52:47.770 --> 01:52:49.600
Lord Timon.

2254
01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.730
Timon.

2255
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.200
Look out, and speak to friends.

2256
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:57.600
The Athenians, by two of their most reverend senate,

2257
01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.330
greet thee.

2258
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:00.800
Speak to them, noble Timon.

2259
01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:07.300
Thou sun, that comforts, burn.

2260
01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:10.700
Speak, and be hanged.

2261
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:16.670
For each true word, a blister,

2262
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:20.030
and each false be as a cauterizing

2263
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:22.600
to the root o' the tongue,

2264
01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.670
consuming it with speaking.

2265
01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:37.200
Worthy Timon

2266
01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.130
Of none but such as you and you of Timon.

2267
01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:46.200
The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.

2268
01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.670
I thank them

2269
01:53:48.670 --> 01:53:50.470
and would send them back the plague,

2270
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:52.700
could I but catch it for them.

2271
01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:56.300
Oh, forget what we are sorry for ourselves in thee.

2272
01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.630
The senators with one consent of love

2273
01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:00.830
entreat thee back to Athens;

2274
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:02.800
who have thought on special dignities,

2275
01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:05.900
which vacant lie for thy best use and wearing.

2276
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.130
They confess towards thee

2277
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:10.770
forgetfulness too general, gross.

2278
01:54:10.770 --> 01:54:12.570
You witch me in it;

2279
01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:20.600
surprise me to the very brink of tears.

2280
01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.830
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,

2281
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:27.030
and I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

2282
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:30.170
Therefore, so please thee to return with us

2283
01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:33.100
and of our Athens, thine and ours,

2284
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:37.200
to take the captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,

2285
01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.530
allowed with absolute power

2286
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:42.230
and thy good name live with authority.

2287
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:45.370
So soon we shall drive back of Alcibiades the approaches wild,

2288
01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:47.700
who, like a boar too savage,

2289
01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.700
doth root up his country's peace.

2290
01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:52.670
And shakes his threatening sword against the walls of Athens.

2291
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:53.730
Therefore, Timon

2292
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:59.400
Therefore, I will, sir;

2293
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.500
therefore, I will, sir; thus.

2294
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:09.870
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,

2295
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:14.570
let Alcibiades know this of Timon:

2296
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:18.030
that Timon cares not.

2297
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:22.430
But if he sack fair Athens

2298
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:26.430
and take our goodly aged men by the beards,

2299
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:28.870
giving our holy virgins to the stain

2300
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:33.270
of contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war,

2301
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:37.530
then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it.

2302
01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:39.530
In pity of our aged and our youth,

2303
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:43.900
I cannot choose but tell him

2304
01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:49.770
that I care not and let him take it at worst;

2305
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:50.970
for their knives care not,

2306
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:55.430
while you have throats to answer.

2307
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:59.830
For myself, there's not a whittle in the unruly camp

2308
01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:01.430
but I do prize it at my love

2309
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:05.530
before the reverendest throat in Athens.

2310
01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:10.300
So I leave you to the protection of the gods,

2311
01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.300
as thieves to keepers.

2312
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.070
Stay not; all's in vain.

2313
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:20.030
Why, I was writing of my epitaph.

2314
01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:26.330
It will be seen tomorrow.

2315
01:56:26.330 --> 01:56:31.700
My long sickness of health and living now begins to mend,

2316
01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:35.170
and nothing brings me all things.

2317
01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:40.370
Go; live still;

2318
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:44.600
be Alcibiades your plague, you his,

2319
01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.830
and live so long enough.

2320
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:48.270
We speak in vain.

2321
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:54.700
But yet I love my country and am not one

2322
01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.330
that rejoices in the common wreck,

2323
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:57.930
as common bruit doth put it.

2324
01:56:57.930 --> 01:56:59.630
That's well spoke.

2325
01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:03.000
Commend me to my loving countrymen

2326
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.300
These words become your lips as they pass through them.

2327
01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:07.400
And enter in our ears like great triumphers

2328
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.600
in their applauding gates.

2329
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.830
Commend me to them,

2330
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:17.170
and tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,

2331
01:57:17.170 --> 01:57:22.770
their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,

2332
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:26.200
their pangs of love, with other incident throes

2333
01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.370
that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain

2334
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:30.770
in life's uncertain voyage,

2335
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:34.330
I will some kindness do them.

2336
01:57:34.330 --> 01:57:38.230
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

2337
01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:39.330
I like this well;

2338
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:41.330
he will return again.

2339
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:47.200
I have a tree which grows here in my close

2340
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:51.330
that mine own use invites me to cut down.

2341
01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:54.900
Shortly must I fell it.

2342
01:57:54.900 --> 01:58:00.770
Tell my friends, tell Athens, in sequence of degree

2343
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:03.070
from high to low throughout,

2344
01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:06.630
that whoso please to stop affliction,

2345
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:10.900
let him take his haste, come hither,

2346
01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:14.630
ere my tree hath felt the axe,

2347
01:58:14.630 --> 01:58:16.230
and hang himself.

2348
01:58:17.730 --> 01:58:20.030
I pray you, do my greeting.

2349
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:21.300
Trouble him no further;

2350
01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:23.670
thus you still shall find him.

2351
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:26.730
Come not to me again,

2352
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:29.830
but say to Athens,

2353
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:32.970
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion

2354
01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:36.470
upon the beached verge of the salt flood;

2355
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:40.400
who, once a day, with his embossed froth,

2356
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:44.070
the turbulent surge shall cover.

2357
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:48.670
Thither come; let my gravestone be your oracle.

2358
01:58:52.230 --> 01:59:01.730
Lips, let four words go by and language end.

2359
01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:08.700
What is amiss plague and infection mend.

2360
01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:13.200
Graves only be men's works, death their gain.

2361
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:20.300
Sun, hide thy beams.

2362
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:25.270
Timon hath done his reign.

2363
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:36.630
His discontents are unremovably coupled to nature.

2364
01:59:36.630 --> 01:59:38.800
Our hope in him is dead.

2365
01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.100
Let us return and strain

2366
01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.770
what other means are left to us in our dear peril.

2367
01:59:43.770 --> 01:59:45.670
It requires swift foot.

2368
01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:47.330
The enemy's drum is heard,

2369
01:59:47.330 --> 01:59:51.200
and fearful scouring doth choke the air with dust.

2370
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.830
On and prepare.

2371
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:55.200
Ours is the fall, I fear,

2372
01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.830
our foes the snare.

2373
02:00:30.570 --> 02:00:31.900
Till now you have gone on

2374
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:34.000
and filled the time with all licentious measure,

2375
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.800
making your wills the scope of justice;

2376
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.330
till now, myself and such

2377
02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:44.670
as slept within the shadow of your power,

2378
02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:47.200
have wandered with our traversed arms,

2379
02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:52.570
and breathed our sufferance vainly.

2380
02:00:52.570 --> 02:00:59.830
Now the time is flush,

2381
02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:02.030
when crouching marrow in the bearer

2382
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:06.330
strong cries of itself, "No more."

2383
02:01:06.330 --> 02:01:09.200
Now breathless wrong shall sit and pant

2384
02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.000
in your great chairs of ease,

2385
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.300
and pursy insolence shall break his wind

2386
02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:22.200
with fear and horrid flight.

2387
02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:27.330
Noble and young, when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,

2388
02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:29.970
ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,

2389
02:01:29.970 --> 02:01:32.600
we sent to thee to give thy rages balm,

2390
02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.730
to wipe out our ingratitude with loves above their quantity.

2391
02:01:36.730 --> 02:01:39.730
So did we woo transformed Timon to our city's love

2392
02:01:39.730 --> 02:01:41.700
by humble message and by promised means.

2393
02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:43.100
We were not all unkind,

2394
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:46.630
nor all deserve the common stroke of war.

2395
02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:50.170
These walls of ours were not erected by their hands

2396
02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:51.730
from whom you have received your griefs;

2397
02:01:51.730 --> 02:01:54.200
nor are they such that these great towers,

2398
02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.670
trophies, and schools should fall for private faults in them.

2399
02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:01.800
Nor are they living that were the motives that you first went out;

2400
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.770
shame that they wanted cunning,

2401
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.970
in excess hath broke their hearts.

2402
02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:10.130
March, noble lord, into our city with thy banners spread.

2403
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:13.170
By decimation, and a tithed death

2404
02:02:13.170 --> 02:02:16.970
if thy revenges hunger for that food which nature loathes

2405
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:18.730
take thou the destined tenth,

2406
02:02:18.730 --> 02:02:24.070
and by the hazard of the spotted die, let die the spotted.

2407
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:26.400
All have not offended;

2408
02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.770
for those that were,

2409
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:30.900
it is not square to take on those that are revenge.

2410
02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.670
Crimes, like lands, are not inherited.

2411
02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:37.030
Then, dear countryman, bring in thy ranks,

2412
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:39.130
but leave without thy rage.

2413
02:02:39.130 --> 02:02:41.300
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin

2414
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.830
which in the bluster of thy wrath

2415
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:47.000
must fall with those that have offended.

2416
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.470
Like a shepherd, approach the fold,

2417
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:53.370
and cull the infected forth, but kill not all together.

2418
02:02:53.370 --> 02:02:56.130
What thou wilt, thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile

2419
02:02:56.130 --> 02:02:58.130
than hew to it with thy sword.

2420
02:02:58.130 --> 02:03:00.130
Set but thy foot against our rampired gates,

2421
02:03:00.130 --> 02:03:01.430
and they shall ope;

2422
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:03.530
so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,

2423
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:06.370
to say thou'lt enter friendly.

2424
02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:10.230
Throw thy glove, or any token of thine honor else,

2425
02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:12.670
that thou wilt use these wars as thy redress

2426
02:03:12.670 --> 02:03:14.670
and not as our confusion,

2427
02:03:14.670 --> 02:03:18.170
all thy powers shall make their harbor in our town,

2428
02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:20.500
till we have sealed thy full desires.

2429
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.470
Then there's my glove.

2430
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:35.800
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own

2431
02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:41.770
whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof fall

2432
02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:44.630
and no more.

2433
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:47.900
And to atone your fears with my more noble meaning,

2434
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:49.470
not a man shall pass his quarter

2435
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:54.300
or offend the stream of regular justice in your city's bounds,

2436
02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:58.270
but shall be rendered to your public laws at heaviest answer.

2437
02:03:58.270 --> 02:04:02.270
'Tis most nobly spoken.

2438
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:06.130
My noble general, Timon is dead;

2439
02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:08.170
entombed upon the very hem of the sea;

2440
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:10.000
and on his grave-stone this insculpture,

2441
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.200
which with wax I brought away,

2442
02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:18.030
whose soft impression interprets for my poor ignorance.

2443
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:24.470
"Here lies a wretched corse, wretched soul bereft.

2444
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:27.330
"Seek not my name.

2445
02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:30.230
"A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left.

2446
02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:34.930
"Here lie I, Timon,

2447
02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:38.670
"who, alive, all living men did hate.

2448
02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:42.100
"Pass by and curse thy fill,

2449
02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:46.370
but pass and stay not here thy gait."

2450
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:54.930
These well express in thee thy latter spirits.

2451
02:04:54.930 --> 02:04:58.230
Though thou abhorredst in us our human griefs,

2452
02:04:58.230 --> 02:05:01.670
scornedst our brain's flow and those our droplets

2453
02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:04.830
which from niggard nature fall,

2454
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:09.700
yet rich conceit taught thee to make vast Neptune weep

2455
02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:14.830
for aye on thy low grave, on faults forgiven.

2456
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.370
Dead is noble Timon

2457
02:05:26.370 --> 02:05:31.030
of whose memory hereafter more.

2458
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:32.430
Bring me into your city,

2459
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:37.930
and I will use the olive with my sword,

2460
02:05:37.930 --> 02:05:44.700
make war breed peace, make peace stint war,

2461
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:51.770
make each prescribe to other as each other's leech.

2462
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:56.800
