00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:05.700


2
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.700
Good day, sir.

3
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.700
I am glad you're well.

4
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.670
I have not seen you long.

5
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.800
How goes the world?

6
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.600
Oh, it wears, sir, as itgrows.

7
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.900
Ay, that's well known: butwhat particular rarity?

8
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.200
What strange,

9
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.570
which manifold record notmatches?

10
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.770
See, magic of bounty!

11
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.370
All these spirits thy powershave conjured to attend.

12
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.530
I know the merchant.

13
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.230
I know them both; theother's a jeweller.

14
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.100
Oh, 'tis a worthy lord.

15
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.470
Nay, that's most fixed.

16
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.600
A most incomparable man,breathed, as it were,

17
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.270
to an untirable andcontinuate goodness:

18
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.930
he passes.

19
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.970
I have a jewel here

20
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270
Oh, pray, let's see it.

21
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.830
For the Lord Timon, sir?

22
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.730
If he will touch theestimate:

23
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.270
but, for that

24
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.470
'Tis a good form.

25
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.470
And rich, yes.

26
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.670
You are rapt, sir, in somework,

27
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.470
some dedication to thegreat Lord.

28
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.230
A thing slipped idly fromme.

29
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.130
Our poesy is as a gum

30
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.130
which oozes from whence'tis nourished:

31
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.900
the fire in the flint showsnot till it be struck;

32
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.230
our gentle flame provokesitself

33
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.830
and like the current flieseach bound it chafes.

34
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.830
What have you there?

35
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.130
A picture, sir.

36
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.470
When comes your bookforth?

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.700
Upon the heels of mypresentment, sir.

38
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.930
Let's see your piece.

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.400
It's a good piece.

40
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.830
Oh, so 'tis:

41
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.970
this comes off well andexcellent.

42
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.200
Indifferent.

43
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.070
Admirable: how this gracespeaks his own standing.

44
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.370
What a mental power thiseye shoots forth.

45
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.270
How big imagination movesin this lip.

46
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.500
To the dumbness of thegesture one might interpret.

47
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.500
It's a pretty mocking ofthe life.

48
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.030
Here is a touch; is itgood?

49
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.370
I will say of it, ittutors nature:

50
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.400
Artificial strife lives inthese touches,

51
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.970
livelier than life.

52
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.700
How this lord is followed.

53
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.400
The senators of Athens:happy man.

54
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.270
Look, more.

55
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.800
You see this confluence, thisgreat flood of visitors?

56
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.470
I have, in this roughwork, shaped out a man,

57
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.400
whom this beneath worlddoth embrace and hug

58
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.900
with amplestentertainment:

59
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.930
my free drift halts notparticularly,

60
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.300
but moves itself in a widesea of tacks:

61
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.470
no levelled malice infects onecomma in the course I hold;

62
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.330
but flies an eagle flight,bold and forth on,

63
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.000
leaving no tract behind.

64
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
How shall I understandyou?

65
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.930
I will unbolt to you.

66
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.800
You see how allconditions, how all minds,

67
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800
as well of glib andslippery creatures

68
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.230
as of grave and austerequality,

69
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.300
tender down their servicesto Lord Timon:

70
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.030
his large fortune upon his goodand gracious nature hanging

71
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.970
subdues and properties tohis love and tendence

72
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.800
all sorts of hearts;

73
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.000
yea, from the glass-facedflatterers

74
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.230
to Apemantus,

75
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.230
whom few things loves betterthan to abhor himself:

76
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.670
even he drops down theknee before him

77
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.800
and returns in peace mostrich in Timon's nod.

78
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.530
I saw them speak together.

79
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.330
Sir, I have on a high andpleasant hill

80
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.170
feigned fortune to be throned:the base of the mount

81
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.670
is ranked with all deserts,all kind of natures,

82
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.400
that labor on the bosom ofthis sphere

83
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.330
to propagate their states.

84
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.630
Amongst them all, whoseeyes are on this sovereignlady fixed,

85
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.400
one do I personate of LordTimon's frame,

86
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.000
whom fortune with herivory hand wafts to her;

87
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.630
whose present grace topresent slaves and servants

88
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.900
translates his rivals.

89
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.230
'Tis conceived to scope.

90
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.000
This throne, this fortune,and this hill, methinks,

91
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.870
with one man beckoned fromthe rest below,

92
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.600
bowing his head againstthe sleepy mount

93
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.900
to climb his happiness,

94
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.030
would be well expressed inour condition.

95
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.870
Nay, sir, but hear me on.

96
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.370
All those which were hisfellows but of late

97
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.470
Mmm.

98
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.930
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

99
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.930
But of late.

100
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.230
Even better than hisvalue,

101
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.600
on the moment follow hisstrides,

102
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.100
his lobbies fill withtendance,

103
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.230
rain sacrificialwhisperings in his ear,

104
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.730
make sacred even hisstirrup,

105
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.770
and through him drink thefree air.

106
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.700
Ay, marry, what of these?

107
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.330
When fortune in her shiftand change of mood

108
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.770
spurns down her latebeloved,

109
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.670
all his dependants thatlabor after him

110
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.500
to the mountain's top, evenon their knees and hands,

111
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.800
let him slip down,

112
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.700
not one accompanying hisdeclining foot.

113
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.670
'Tis common: a thousandmoral paintings I can show

114
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.000
that shall demonstrate thesequick blows of fortune's

115
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.300
more pregnantly thanwords.

116
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.130
Yet you do well to showLord Timon

117
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.000
that mean eyes have seenthe foot above the head.

118
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.600
Imprisoned is he, say you?

119
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.770
Ay, my good lord.

120
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.330
Five talents is his debt,

121
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.800
his means most short, hiscreditors most strait:

122
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.430
your honorable letter hedesires

123
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.800
to those have shut him up;

124
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.470
which failing, periods hiscomfort.

125
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.630
Noble Ventidius!

126
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.070
Well; I am not of that featherto shake off my friend

127
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.830
when he must needs me.

128
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.800
I do know him a gentlemanwell deserves a help:

129
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.400
which he shall have: I'llpay the debt and free him.

130
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.130
Your Lordship ever bindshim.

131
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.370
Commend me to him.

132
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.730
I will send his ransom;

133
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.470
and being enfranchised,bid him come to me.

134
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.200
'Tis not enough to helpthe feeble up,

135
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.400
but to support him after.

136
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.370
Lord Timon, hear me speak.

137
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.470
Freely, good father.

138
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.530
Thou hast a servant namedLucilius.

139
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.500
Yes, I have so: what ofhim?

140
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.700
Most noble Timon, call theman before thee.

141
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.130
Attends he here, or no?

142
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.270
Lucilius!

143
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.370
Here, at Your Lordship'sservice.

144
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.600
This fellow here, LordTimon, this thy creature

145
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.730
at night frequents myhouse.

146
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.000
I am a man that from my firsthave been inclined to thrift;

147
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.830
and my estate deserves anheir more raised

148
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.600
than one which holds atrencher.

149
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.500
Well; what further?

150
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.470
One only daughter have I,no kin else,

151
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.870
on whom I may confer whatI have got.

152
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.970
The maid is fair, of theyoungest for a bride,

153
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.630
and I have bred her at mydearest cost

154
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.070
in qualities of the best.

155
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.230
This man of thine attemptsher love.

156
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.470
I prithee, noble Lord,join with me

157
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.630
to forbid him her resort;

158
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.700
myself have spoke in vain.

159
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.270
The man is honest.

160
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.830
Therefore he will be,Timon:

161
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.470
his honesty rewards him initself;

162
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.270
it must not bear mydaughter.

163
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.600
Does she love him?

164
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.700
She is young and apt.

165
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.500
Our own precedent passionsdo instruct us

166
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.700
what levity's in youth.

167
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.070
And love you the maid?

168
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.070
Ay, my good Lord, and sheaccepts of it.

169
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.670
If, in her marriage, myconsent is missing,

170
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.530
I call the gods to witness,

171
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.130
I will choose mine heirfrom forth the beggarsof this world,

172
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.170
and dispossess her all!

173
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.970
How shall she be endowed,

174
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.170
if she be mated with anequal husband?

175
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.470
Three talents on thepresent; in future, all.

176
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.430
This gentleman of minehath served me long.

177
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.370
To build his fortune, Iwill strain a little,

178
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.400
for 'tis a bond in men.

179
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.630
Give him thy daughter.

180
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.500
What you bestow, in him,I'll counterpoise,

181
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.370
make him weigh with her.

182
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.400
My noble Lord,

183
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.530
pawn me to this yourhonor, she is his.

184
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.130
My hand to you; my honoron my promise.

185
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.670
Humbly I thank YourLordship.

186
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:44.570
Never may that state offortune fall into my keeping,

187
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.830
that is not owed to you.

188
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:48.370
Vouchsafe my labor, andlong live Your Lordship!

189
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.470
I thank you; you shallhear from me anon.

190
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.870
What have you there, myfriend?

191
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.230
A piece of painting, whichI do beseech Your Lordshipto accept.

192
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.730
Painting is welcome.

193
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.070
Painting is almost thenatural man;

194
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.400
or since dishonor trafficswith man's nature,

195
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.100
he is but outside.

196
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:07.500
these pencilled figures areeven such as they give out.

197
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.070
I like your work; youshall find I like it.

198
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.730
Wait attendance till youhear further from me.

199
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.000
The gods preserve you!

200
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.830
Well fare you, gentleman.

201
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.730
Give me your hand; we mustneeds dine together, hmm?

202
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.670
Sir, sir, your jewel hathsuffered under praise.

203
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.970
What, my lord?

204
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.970
Dispraise?

205
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.900
A mere satiety ofcommendations.

206
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.530
If I should pay you for itas 'tis extolled,

207
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.170
it would unclew me quite.

208
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.700
My lord, 'tis rated as thosewhich sell would give.

209
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.130
But you well know, thingsof like value

210
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.570
differing in the owners

211
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.630
are prized by theirmasters.

212
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.800
Believe it, dear lord,

213
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.900
you mend the jewel by thewearing it.

214
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.900
Well mocked.

215
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.330
Oh, no, my good lord;

216
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:58.230
he speaks the commontongue, which all menspeak with him.

217
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.870
Look, who comes here: willyou be chid?

218
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.230
We'll bear, with YourLordship.

219
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.200
We'll spare none.

220
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.170
Good morrow to thee,gentle Apemantus.

221
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.800
Till I be gentle, staythou for thy good morrow;

222
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.400
when thou art Timon's dog,and these knaves honest.

223
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400
Why dost thou call themknaves?

224
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.600
Thou knowest them not.

225
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.870
Are they not Athenians?

226
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.870
Yes.

227
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.370
Then I repent not.

228
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.930
You know me, Apemantus?

229
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.900
Thou knowest I do: Icalled thee by thy name.

230
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.370
Thou art proud, Apemantus.

231
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.870
Of nothing so much as thatI am not like Timon.

232
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.170
Whither art going?

233
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.730
To knock out an honestAthenian's brains.

234
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.930
That's a deed thou'lt diefor.

235
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:38.370
Right, if doing nothing bedeath by the law.

236
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.730
How likest thou thispicture, Apemantus?

237
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.430
The best, for theinnocence.

238
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.200
Wrought he not well thatpainted it?

239
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.400
He wrought better thatmade the painter;

240
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.600
and yet he's but a filthypiece of work.

241
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.200
You're a dog.

242
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.170
Thy mother's of mygeneration: what's she, ifI be a dog?

243
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.330
Wilt dine with me,Apemantus?

244
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.500
No; I eat not lords.

245
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.370
And thou shouldst, thouwouldst anger ladies.

246
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.800
O, they eat lords; so theycome by great bellies.

247
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.830
That's a lasciviousapprehension.

248
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.270
So thou apprehendest it.

249
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.770
Take it for thy labor.

250
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.800
How dost thou like thisjewel, Apemantus?

251
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.430
Not as well as plain dealing,

252
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.430
which will not cost a mana doit.

253
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.100
What dost thou think 'tisworth?

254
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.130
Not worth my thinking.

255
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:29.000
How now, poet!

256
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.770
How now, philosopher!

257
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:31.930
Thou liest.

258
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.930
Art not one?

259
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.930
Yes.

260
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.000
Then I lie not.

261
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.430
Art not a poet?

262
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.430
Yes.

263
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.430
Then thou liest.

264
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.570
Look in thy last work,

265
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.870
where thou hast feignedhim a worthy fellow.

266
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.500
That's not feigned; he isso.

267
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.000
Yes, he is worthy of thee andto pay thee for thy labor.

268
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.770
He that loves to be flatteredis worthy of the flatterer.

269
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.500
Heavens, that I were alord.

270
00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.100
What wouldst do then,Apemantus?

271
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.900
Even as Apemantus does now;hate a lord with my heart.

272
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.070
What, thyself?

273
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.070
Ay.

274
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.100
Wherefore?

275
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.300
That I had no angry wit tobe a lord.

276
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.800
Art not thou a merchant?

277
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.330
Ay, Apemantus.

278
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.270
Traffic confound thee, ifthe gods will not!

279
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.030
If traffic do it, the godsdo it.

280
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.100
Traffic's thy god; and thygod confound thee.

281
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.230
What trumpet's that?

282
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.830
'Tis Alcibiades, and sometwenty horse,

283
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.030
all of companionship.

284
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.300
Pray, entertain them; givethem guide to us.

285
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.470
Now go not you hence tillI've thanked you.

286
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.470
When dinner's done, youshow me this piece.

287
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.300
I am joyful of your sights.

288
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.800
Oh.

289
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.100
Most welcome, sir!

290
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.700
Sir, you have saved mylonging,

291
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.470
and I feed most hungerlyon your sight.

292
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.830
Right welcome, sir!

293
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.900
Ere we depart, we'll sharea bounteous time

294
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.130
in different pleasures.

295
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.970
Pray, pray let us in.

296
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.070
So, so, there!

297
00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.130
Aches contract and starveyour supple joints!

298
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.530
That there should be smalllove among these sweet knaves,

299
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.430
and all this courtesy.

300
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.300
The strain of man's bredout into baboon and monkey

301
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.300
What time of day is it,Apemantus?

302
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.430
Time to be honest.

303
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.070
That time serves still.

304
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.170
The more accursed thou,that still omittest it.

305
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.130
Thou art going to LordTimon's feast?

306
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.670
Ay, to see meat fill knavesand wine heat fools.

307
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.130
Fare thee well, fare theewell.

308
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.930
Thou art a fool to bid mefarewell twice.

309
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.230
Why, Apemantus?

310
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.600
Shouldst have kept one tothyself,

311
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.800
for I mean to give theenone.

312
00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.830
Hang thyself!

313
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.670
No, I will do nothing atthy bidding:

314
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.800
make thy requests to thyfriend.

315
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.600
Away, unpeaceable dog, orI'll spurn thee hence!

316
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.730
I will fly, like a dog,the heels of the ass.

317
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.770
Hee-haw.

318
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.570
He's opposite to humanity.

319
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.670
Come, shall we in, andtaste Lord Timon's bounty?

320
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.230
He outgoes the very heartof kindness.

321
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.770
He pours it out;

322
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.530
Plutus, the god of gold,is but his steward.

323
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.900
No meed, but he repayssevenfold above itself;

324
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.670
no gift to him, but breedsthe giver a return

325
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.230
exceeding all use of quittance.

326
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:02.200
The noblest mind he carriesthat ever governed man.

327
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.170
Long may he live infortunes.

328
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.170
Shall we in?

329
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.270
I'll keep you company.

330
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.930
Most honored Timon!

331
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.230
Ventidius!

332
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.600
Oh!

333
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.030
It hath pleased the gods toremember my father's age,

334
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.570
and call him to longpeace.

335
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.100
He is gone happy, and hasleft me rich.

336
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.330
And, as in grateful virtue Iam bound to your free heart,

337
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.630
I do return those talents,

338
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.830
doubled with thanks andservice,

339
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.000
from whose help I derivedliberty.

340
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.770
Oh, by no means, honestVentidius;

341
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:35.970
you mistake my love:

342
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.970
I gave it freely ever;

343
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.930
and there's none can trulysay he gives,

344
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.600
if he receives.

345
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.830
If our betters play atthat game,

346
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.030
we must not dare toimitate them.

347
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.000
Faults that are rich arefair.

348
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.370
A noble spirit.

349
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.100
Nay, my lord.

350
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.270
Ceremony was but devisedat first

351
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.600
to set a gloss on faintdeeds,

352
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.500
hollow welcomes, recantinggoodness,

353
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.370
sorry ere 'tis shown;

354
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.470
But where there is truefriendship, there needs none.

355
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.830
Pray, sit;

356
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.930
more welcome are ye to myfortunes

357
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.330
than my fortunes are tome.

358
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.430
My lord, we have alwaysconfessed it.

359
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.600
Oh, confessed it!

360
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.900
Hanged it, have you not?

361
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.630
Oh, Apemantus, you arewelcome.

362
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.000
No, you shall not make mewelcome.

363
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.030
I come to have thee thrustme out of doors.

364
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.500
Fie, thou art a churl;

365
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.100
you've a humor there doesnot become a man:

366
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.670
'tis much to blame.

367
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.870
They say, my lords, "irafuror brevis est;"

368
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.630
but yond man is everangry.

369
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.570
Go, let him have a tableby himself,

370
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.500
for he does neither affectcompany,

371
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.670
nor is he fit for it, indeed.

372
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.400
Let me stay at thineapperil, Timon.

373
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.630
I come to observe;

374
00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:59.030
I give thee warning on it.

375
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.630
I take no heed of thee;

376
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.730
Thou art an Athenian,therefore welcome:

377
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.230
I myself would have nopower;

378
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.870
prithee, let my meat makethee silent.

379
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.230
I scorn thy meat;

380
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.330
'twould choke me, for Ishould ne'er flatter thee.

381
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:14.300
O you gods, what a numberof men eats Timon,

382
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.400
and he sees 'em not!

383
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:20.170
It grieves me to see somany

384
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.400
dip their meat in oneman's blood;

385
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.030
and all the madness is, hecheers them up too.

386
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.800
I wonder men dare trustthemselves with men:

387
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.730
Methinks they should invitethem without knives;

388
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.100
good for their meat, andsafer for their lives.

389
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.330
There's much example forit;

390
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.770
the fellow that sits next him,now parts bread with him,

391
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.700
pledges the breath of himin a divided draught,

392
00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.400
is the readiest man tokill him.

393
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.900
It has been proved.

394
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.070
If I were a huge man, Iwould fear to drink at meals

395
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.670
lest they should spy mywindpipe's dangerous notes:

396
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.300
Great men should drink withharness on their throats.

397
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.470
My lords, in heart.

398
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.300
And let the health goround.

399
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.570
Let it flow this way, mygood lord.

400
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:13.570
Flow this way!

401
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.570
A brave fellow!

402
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.300
He keeps his tides well.

403
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.500
Those healths will makethee and thy state lookill, Timon.

404
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.000
Here's that which is tooweak to be a sinner,

405
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.570
honest water,

406
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.900
which ne'er left man inthe mire:

407
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.530
It and my food are equals;

408
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.370
there's no odds.

409
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:36.430
Feasts are too proud togive thanks to the gods.

410
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.830
Immortal gods, I craveno pelf;

411
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.830
I pray for no man butmyself.

412
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.000
Grant I may never prove sofond

413
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
to trust man on his oathor bond;

414
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.570
or a harlot, for herweeping;

415
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.300
or a dog, that seemsa-sleeping;

416
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.030
or a keeper with myfreedom;

417
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.970
or my friends, if I shouldneed 'em.

418
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.670
Amen.

419
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.200
So fall to it.

420
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.600
Rich men sin, and I eatroot.

421
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.470
Much good dich thy goodheart, Apemantus.

422
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.030
All!

423
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.430
May it please Your Honor.

424
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.470
Lord Lucius, out of hisfree love,

425
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.230
hath presented to you fourmilk-white horses

426
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.500
trapped in silver.

427
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.670
I shall accept themfairly.

428
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.970
Let the presents beworthily entertained.

429
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.430
Please you, my lord,

430
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.400
Lord Lucullus entreatsyour company tomorrow

431
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.570
to hunt with him,

432
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.270
and has sent Your Honortwo brace of greyhounds.

433
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.170
I'll hunt with him.

434
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:11.630
Let them be well received,not without fair reward.

435
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.230
Captain Alcibiades, yourheart's in the field now.

436
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.570
My heart's ever at yourservice, my good lord.

437
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.170
Had you rather be at abreakfast of enemies

438
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.030
than a dinner of friends?

439
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.000
So they were bleeding-new,my lord,

440
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.130
there's no meat like them:

441
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.730
I could wish my bestfriend at such a feast.

442
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.370
Would all those flattererswere thy enemies then,

443
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.770
that then thou mightst kill'em and bid me to 'em!

444
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.770
Might we but have thathappiness, my lord,

445
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.430
that you would once useour hearts,

446
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.930
whereby we might expresssome part of our zeals,

447
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.970
we should think ourselvesforever perfect.

448
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.070
No doubt, my good friends,but the gods themselves

449
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.670
have provided I shall havemuch help from you.

450
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.630
How had you been myfriends else?

451
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.870
Why have you that charitabletitle from thousands,

452
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:07.200
did not you chiefly belongto my heart?

453
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.930
I have told more of you tomyself

454
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.030
than you can with modestyspeak in your own behalf;

455
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.570
and thus far, I confirmyou.

456
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:21.070
O you gods, think I, whatneed we have any friends,

457
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.930
should we ne'er have needof 'em?

458
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.570
They're the most needlesscreatures living,

459
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.500
should we ne'er have useof 'em,

460
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.770
and should most resemblesweet instruments

461
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.700
hung up in cases that keeptheir sounds to themselves.

462
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.870
Why, I have often wishedmyself poorer,

463
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.600
that I might come nearerto you.

464
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.070
We're born to do benefits:

465
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:46.630
and what better or properercan we call our own

466
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.530
than the riches of ourfriends?

467
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.370
O, what a precious comfort'tis,

468
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.600
to have so many, likebrothers,

469
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.370
commanding one another'sfortunes.

470
00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.270
Oh, joy's even made a wayere it can be born.

471
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.130
Mine eyes cannot hold outwater, methinks.

472
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.830
To forget their faults, Idrink to you.

473
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.130
Thou weepest to make themdrink, Timon.

474
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.800
Joy had the likeconception in our eyes,

475
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.430
and that instant, like ababe, sprung up.

476
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.600
I laugh to think that babea bastard.

477
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.200
I promise you, my lord,you moved me much.

478
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.230
Much!

479
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:29.630
How now? What means thattrump?

480
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.770
Please you, my lord, thereare certain ladies

481
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.300
most desirous ofadmittance.

482
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.770
Ladies!

483
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.000
What are their wills?

484
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.670
There comes with them aforerunner, my lord,

485
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.470
which bears that office, tosignify their pleasures.

486
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.070
Well, let them have kindadmittance.

487
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.570
Music, make their welcome.

488
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:19.800
Hail, hail, hail to thee,worthy Timon,

489
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:30.100
and to all that of hisbounties taste!

490
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:39.270
The five best sensesacknowledge thee their patron;

491
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:49.770
and come freely to gratulatethy plenteous bosom:

492
00:24:49.770 --> 00:25:01.100
and come freely to gratulatethy plenteous bosom:

493
00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.230
There, taste, touch, all,

494
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.370
there, taste, touch, all,

495
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.700
pleased from thy tablerise;

496
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.670
pleased from thy tablerise;

497
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.030
pleased from thy tablerise;

498
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.300
pleased from thy tablerise;

499
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:22.530
They only now come but tofeast thine eyes.

500
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:30.330
They only now come but tofeast thine eyes.

501
00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.700
You see, my lord, howample you are beloved?

502
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.300
Hoy-day, what a sweep ofvanity comes this way!

503
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.530
They dance.

504
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:45.270
They are mad women.

505
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.030
Like madness is the gloryof this life.

506
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.530
As this pomp shows to alittle oil and root.

507
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.700
We make ourselves fools todisport ourselves;

508
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.970
and spend our flatteriesto drink those men

509
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.270
upon whose age we void itup again

510
00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:02.730
with poisonous spite andenvy.

511
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:05.500
Who lives that's notdepraved or depraves?

512
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.670
Who dies that bears notone spurn to their graves

513
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.000
of their friends' gift?

514
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.270
I should fear that thosethat dance before me now

515
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.570
would one day stamp uponme.

516
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.470
It has been done.

517
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.700
Men shut their doorsagainst a setting sun.

518
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.600
You have done our pleasuresmuch grace, fair ladies,

519
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.270
set a fair fashion on ourentertainment.

520
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.500
I am to thank you for it.

521
00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.100
My lord, you take us evenat the best.

522
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.570
'Faith, for the worst isfilthy;

523
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.470
and would not hold taking,I doubt me.

524
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.370
Flavius, the little casketbring me hither.

525
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.330
Yes, my lord.

526
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.800
More jewels yet!

527
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.630
There is no crossing himin his humor;

528
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:28.630
Else I should tell him

529
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:29.930
well, in faith I should

530
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.430
when all's spent,

531
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.570
he would be crossed then,he could.

532
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.670
'Tis pity bounty had noteyes behind,

533
00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.730
that man might ne'er bewretched for his mind.

534
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:46.870
Ah, Flavius.

535
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.170
My lord, honor me so muchas to advance this jewel;

536
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.430
accept it and wear it,kind my lord.

537
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.600
I am so far already inyour gifts

538
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.930
So are we all.

539
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.330
I beseech Your Honor,vouchsafe me a word;

540
00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.500
it does concern you near.

541
00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.630
Near!

542
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.830
Why, then, another timeI'll hear:

543
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.730
What will this come to?

544
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.330
He commands us to provideand give great gifts,

545
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:25.230
and all out of an emptycoffer:

546
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:26.830
Nor will he know hispurse, or yield me this,

547
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.630
to show him what a beggarhis heart is,

548
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.870
being of no power to makehis wishes good.

549
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.730
His promises fly so beyondhis state

550
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.330
that what he speaks is allin debt;

551
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.030
he owes for every word.

552
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.900
He is so kind that he nowpays interest for it;

553
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.700
his land's put to theirbooks.

554
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.570
Well, would I were gentlyput out of office

555
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:43.300
before I were forced out.

556
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.200
Happier is he that has nofriend to feed

557
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.400
than such that do evenenemies exceed.

558
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.270
I bleed inwardly for mylord.

559
00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.170
You do yourselves too muchwrong,

560
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.230
you bate too much of yourown merits:

561
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.930
Here, my lord, a token ofour love.

562
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.130
With more than commonthanks I will receive it.

563
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.870
O, he is the very soul ofbounty!

564
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.370
Now I do remember, mylord,

565
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.830
you gave good words theother day

566
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.500
of a bay courser I rodeon:

567
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.270
it is yours, because youliked it.

568
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.870
Oh, I beseech you, pardonme, my lord, in that.

569
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.170
You may take my word.

570
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.600
I know no man can justly praisebut what he does affect:

571
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.600
I weigh my friend'saffection with mine own;

572
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.600
I'll tell you true.

573
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600
I'll call to you.

574
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.700
Oh, none so welcome.

575
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.830
I take all and yourseveral visitations sokind to heart,

576
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:30.470
'tis not enough to give;

577
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.230
methinks I could dealkingdoms to my friends

578
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.530
and ne'er be weary.

579
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:39.430
Alcibiades, thou art a soldier,therefore seldom rich;

580
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:42.770
It comes in charity tothee:

581
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.830
for all thy living isamongst the dead.

582
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.670
All the lands thou hastlie in a pitched field.

583
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.570
Ay, defiled land, my lord.

584
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:52.500
We are so virtuouslybound.

585
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.570
And I to you.

586
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.430
So infinitely endeared

587
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.230
So I to you.

588
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.100
Lights, more lights!

589
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.130
The best of happiness,honor and fortunes,

590
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.370
keep with you, Lord Timon!

591
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:09.300
Ready for his friends.

592
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.230
What a coil's here.

593
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:12.730
Serving of becks andjutting-out of bums.

594
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.430
I doubt whether their legsbe worth the sums

595
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:15.870
that are paid for them.

596
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:18.000
Friendship's full ofdregs.

597
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.800
Methinks false hearts shouldnever have sound legs,

598
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.430
thus honest fools lay outtheir wealth on curtsies.

599
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.600
Now, Apemantus, if thouwert not sullen,

600
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.930
I would be good to thee.

601
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.070
No, I'll nothing:

602
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.730
for if I should be bribedtoo,

603
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.700
there would be none leftto rail upon thee,

604
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.070
and then thou wouldst sinthe faster.

605
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.470
Thou givest so long,Timon,

606
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:48.400
I fear me thou wilt giveaway thyself in papershortly:

607
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.330
what need these feasts,pomps and vainglories?

608
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:54.430
Nay, and you begin to railupon society once,

609
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.130
I am sworn not to giveregard to you.

610
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.130
Farewell.

611
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.300
Come again with better music.

612
00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.700
So thou wilt not hear me now;

613
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:01.900
thou shalt not then:

614
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.300
I'll lock thy heaven fromthee.

615
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.270
Oh, that men's ears shouldbe to counsel deaf,

616
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.830
but not to flattery.

617
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.070
Here, my lord.

618
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.530
Haste you to Lord Timon;

619
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.770
Importune him for mymoneys;

620
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.000
be not ceased by slightdenial,

621
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.030
nor then silenced when

622
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.700
"Commend me to yourmaster,"

623
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.130
and the cap plays in theright hand, thus.

624
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.900
But tell him, my uses cryto me,

625
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.730
I must serve my turn outof mine own.

626
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.270
His days and times arepast

627
00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.970
and my reliance on hisfracted dates

628
00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.700
have smit my credit:

629
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.970
I love and honor him,

630
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:05.700
but I must not break myback to heal his finger.

631
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.000
Immediate are my needs,

632
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.070
and my relief must not betossed and turned to mein words,

633
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.900
but find supply immediate.

634
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.500
Get you gone.

635
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:15.500
Put on a most importunateaspect,

636
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.670
a visage of demand, for, Ido fear,

637
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.730
when every feather sticksin his own wing,

638
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.630
Lord Timon will be left anaked gull,

639
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.730
which flashes now aphoenix.

640
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:25.730
Get you gone.

641
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:26.730
I go, sir.

642
00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:27.870
Take the bonds along withyou,

643
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:28.870
I will, sir.

644
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.230
Have the dates incontempt.

645
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.970
Go.

646
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.000
No care, no stop!

647
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.130
So senseless of expense,

648
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.900
that he will neither knowhow to maintain it,

649
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.530
nor cease his flow ofriot.

650
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.200
Takes no account howthings go from him,

651
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.530
nor resumes no care ofwhat is to continue.

652
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:50.100
Never mind was to be sounwise, to be so kind.

653
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.430
Oh, what shall be done?

654
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.730
He will not hear, tillfeel.

655
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:57.500
I must be round with him,now he comes from hunting.

656
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.670
Fie, fie, fie!

657
00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.730
Good even.

658
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.800
What, you come for money?

659
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.430
Is it your business too?

660
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:03.600
'Tis, and yours?

661
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.600
Would we were alldischarged!

662
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.600
I fear it.

663
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.900
Here comes the lord.

664
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.500
So soon as dinner's done,

665
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.800
we'll forth again, myAlcibiades.

666
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800
With me?

667
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.970
What is your will?

668
00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.670
My lord, here is a note ofcertain dues.

669
00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.900
Dues?

670
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.100
Whence are you?

671
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.330
Of Athens here, my lord.

672
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:21.500
Go to my steward.

673
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.600
Please it, Your Lordship,

674
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.830
he has put me out to thesuccession

675
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.330
of new days this month.

676
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.570
My master is awaked togreat occasion

677
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:27.930
to call upon his own,

678
00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.030
and humbly prays you that,with your other noble parts,

679
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.770
you'll suit in giving himhis right.

680
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:34.170
Mine honest friend, Iprithee, but repair to menext morning.

681
00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.170
Nay, good my lord!

682
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.630
Contain thyself, goodfriend.

683
00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.630
One Varro's servant, mygood

684
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.630
From Isidore;

685
00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.070
he humbly prays yourspeedy payment.

686
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.530
If you did know, my lord,my master's wants

687
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.070
'Twas due on forfeiture, mylord, six weeks and past.

688
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.370
Give me breath!

689
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.870
My lords, I beseech you,keep on;

690
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:50.430
I'll wait upon youinstantly.

691
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.570
Come hither, I pray you.

692
00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.800
I beseech you, how goesthe world

693
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.930
that I am thus encounteredwith clamorous demands

694
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.000
of debt, broken bonds,

695
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.170
and the detention oflong-since-due debtsagainst my honor?

696
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.300
Please you, gentlemen,

697
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:09.770
the time is unagreeable tothis business.

698
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.830
Your importunacy ceasetill after dinner,

699
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.200
that I may make HisLordship understand

700
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.670
wherefore you are notpaid.

701
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.970
Do so, my friends.

702
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:19.000
Pray, you're welcome here.

703
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.200
I'll speak with you anon.

704
00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.570
You make me marvel.

705
00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.700
Wherefore ere this time

706
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.300
you had not fully laid mystate before me,

707
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.870
that I might so have ratedmy expense,

708
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.170
as I had leave of means?

709
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.730
You would not hear me; atmany leisures, I proposed.

710
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.330
Go to!

711
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.170
Perchance some singlevantages you took

712
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.300
when my indisposition putyou back,

713
00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.030
and that unaptness madeyour minister,

714
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.600
thus to excuse yourself.

715
00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.030
Oh, my good lord, at many timesI brought in my accounts,

716
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.330
laid them before you.

717
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.400
You would throw them off

718
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.670
and say you found them inmine honesty.

719
00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:00.800
When, for some triflingpresent, you have bid mereturn so much,

720
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.770
I have shook my head andwept;

721
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.200
Yea, against the authorityof manners,

722
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.430
prayed you to hold yourhand more close.

723
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.730
I have endured not seldom,nor no slight checks,

724
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.570
when I have prompted youin the ebb of your estate

725
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.300
and your great flow ofdebts.

726
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.930
My loved lord, though youhear now too late

727
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:16.430
yet now's a time

728
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.630
the greatest of yourhaving lacks a half

729
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.930
to pay your present debts.

730
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.800
Let all my lands be sold.

731
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.400
'tis all engaged, someforfeited and gone;

732
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.130
and what remains willhardly stop the mouth ofpresent dues.

733
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.200
The future comes apace.

734
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.370
What shall defend theinterim?

735
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.470
And at length, how goesour reckoning?

736
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.530
To Lacedaemon did my landextend.

737
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.130
O my good lord, the worldis but a word.

738
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.830
Were it all yours to giveit in a breath,

739
00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.870
how quickly were it gone!

740
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.000
You tell me true?

741
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.330
If you suspect myhusbandry or falsehood,

742
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.800
call me before theexactest auditors

743
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.070
and set me on the proof.

744
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.700
So the gods bless me,

745
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.230
when all our offices havebeen oppressed withriotous feeders,

746
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.400
when our vaults have weptwith drunken spilth of wine,

747
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.200
when every room was blazedwith lights

748
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.100
and brayed withminstrelsy,

749
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.730
I have retired me to awasteful cock

750
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:02.730
and set mine eyes at flow.

751
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:03.900
Prithee, no more.

752
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.130
Heavens, have I said, thebounty of this lord!

753
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.430
How many prodigal bitshave slaves and peasants

754
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.500
this night englutted!

755
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.170
Who is not Timon's?

756
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.630
What heart, head, sword, force,means, but is Lord Timon's?

757
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:18.670
Great Timon, noble,worthy, royal Timon!

758
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:22.230
Ah, when the means aregone that buy this praise,

759
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.830
the breath is gone whereofthis praise is made.

760
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.770
Feast-won, fast-lost;

761
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.030
one cloud of winter showers,these flies are couched.

762
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.530
Come, sermon me nofurther.

763
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:38.000
No villainous bounty yethath passed my heart;

764
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.630
unwisely, not ignobly,have I given.

765
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:45.330
Why dost thou weep?

766
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.230
Has thou the conscience lackto think I shall lack friends?

767
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.930
Secure thy heart;

768
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.070
if I would broach thevessels of my love,

769
00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:57.500
and try the arguments ofhearts by borrowing,

770
00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.470
men and men's fortunescould I frankly use

771
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.100
as I can bid thee speak.

772
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.300
Assurance bless yourthoughts!

773
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.500
And, in some sort, thesewants of mine are crowned,

774
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.830
that I account themblessings;

775
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.400
for by these shall I tryfriends.

776
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.230
You shall see how youmistake my fortunes;

777
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.370
I am wealthy in myfriends.

778
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.570
Within there!

779
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.570
Flaminius!

780
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.630
My lord?

781
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.630
Servilius!

782
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.670
My lord?

783
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.070
I will dispatch youseverally;

784
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:33.030
To Lord Lucius, you;

785
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.830
to Lord Lucullus, you.

786
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.200
I hunted with His Honortoday.

787
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.500
To Sempronius, you.

788
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.230
Commend me to their loves,and, I am proud, say,

789
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.770
that my occasions havefound time to use 'em

790
00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.530
toward a supply of money.

791
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:53.230
Let the request be...fifty talents?

792
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.500
As you have said, my lord.

793
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.900
Lord Lucius and Lucullus,hmm?

794
00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:59.300
And go you, sir, to thesenators

795
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.530
of whom, even to thestate's best health,

796
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.230
I have deserved thishearing

797
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.830
bid 'em send of the instanta thousand talents to me.

798
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.070
I have been bold

799
00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:08.800
for that I knew it themost general way

800
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.100
to them to use your signetand your name;

801
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.370
but they do shake theirheads,

802
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:16.630
and I am here no richer inreturn.

803
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.470
It is true?

804
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.070
Can it be?

805
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.030
They answer, in a jointand corporate voice,

806
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:25.130
that now they are at fall,want treasure,

807
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.130
cannot do what they would;

808
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.130
are sorry you arehonorable

809
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:29.400
but yet they could havewished

810
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.470
they know not somethinghath been amiss

811
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.730
a noble nature may catch awrench

812
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.970
would all were well  'tispity;

813
00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:37.730
and so, intending otherserious matters,

814
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.700
after distasteful looksand these hard fractions,

815
00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.200
with certain half-caps andcold-moving nods

816
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.570
they froze me intosilence.

817
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:50.370
You gods, reward them!

818
00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.030
Prithee, man, lookcheerly.

819
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:02.530
These old fellows have theiringratitude in them hereditary.

820
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:08.000
Their blood is caked, 'tiscold, it seldom flows;

821
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
'tis lack of kindly warmththey are not kind;

822
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.400
and nature, as it growsagain toward earth,

823
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.800
is fashioned for thejourney, dull and heavy.

824
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.230
Go to Ventidius.

825
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.600
Prithee, be not sad.

826
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.800
Ingeniously I speak.

827
00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.970
No blame belongs to thee.

828
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.770
Ventidius lately buriedhis father,

829
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:33.700
by whose death he's steppedinto a great estate.

830
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.030
When he was poor, imprisoned,and in scarcity of friends,

831
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.900
I cleared him with fivetalents.

832
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.400
Greet him from me;

833
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.630
bid him suppose some goodnecessity touches his friend,

834
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:45.100
which craves to be rememberedwith those five talents.

835
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.930
That had, give it these fellowsto whom 'tis instant due.

836
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.130
Ne'er speak, or think,that Timon's fortunes

837
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.770
amongst his friends can sink.

838
00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.400
I would I could not think it.

839
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.100
That thought isbounty's foe;

840
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.000
being free itself, itthinks all others so.

841
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:37.500
Flaminius, honest Flaminius;

842
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.000
you are very respectivelywelcome, sir.

843
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.330
And how does thathonorable, complete,

844
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.230
free-hearted gentleman ofAthens,

845
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.930
thy very bountiful goodlord and master?

846
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.600
His health is well sir.

847
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.630
I am right glad that hishealth is well, sir.

848
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.800
And what hast thou thereunder thy cloak, prettyFlaminius?

849
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.430
'Faith, nothing but anempty box, sir;

850
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.870
Which, in my lord'sbehalf,

851
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.130
I come to entreat YourHonor to supply;

852
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.100
who, having great and instantoccasion to use fifty talents,

853
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.830
hath sent to Your Lordshipto furnish him,

854
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.200
nothing doubting yourpresent assistance therein.

855
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.470
La, la!

856
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:20.800
La, la, la!

857
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.370
"Nothing doubting," says he?

858
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.130
Alas, good lord!

859
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:26.870
A noble gentleman 'tis,

860
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.530
if he would not keep sogood a house.

861
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.700
Many a time and often Ihave dined with him,

862
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.500
and told him on it, and comeagain to supper to him,

863
00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.330
of purpose to have himspend less,

864
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.070
and yet he would embraceno counsel,

865
00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.970
take no warning by mycoming.

866
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.500
Every man has his fault,and honesty is his.

867
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.630
I had told him on it,

868
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.700
but I could ne'er get himfrom it.

869
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.070
Flaminius, I have notedthee always wise.

870
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.530
Your Lordship speaks yourpleasure.

871
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.430
I have observed theealways for a towardlyprompt spirit

872
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.670
give thee thy due

873
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.600
and one that knows whatbelongs to reason;

874
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.670
and canst use the time well,if the time use thee well.

875
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.830
Good parts in thee.

876
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.100
Draw nearer, honestFlaminius.

877
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:10.170
Thy lord's a bountifulgentleman.

878
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.630
But thou art wise;

879
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.770
and thou knowest wellenough, although thoucomest to me,

880
00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:16.100
that this is no time tolend money,

881
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.770
especially upon barefriendship, without security.

882
00:43:19.770 --> 00:43:24.570
Here's three solidares forthee.

883
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:29.200
Good boy, wink at me, andsay thou sawest me not.

884
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.830
Fare thee well.

885
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.070
Is it possible the worldshould so much differ,

886
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.670
and we alive that lived?

887
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.670
Fly, damned baseness, tohim that worships thee!

888
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.900
Ha!

889
00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.430
Now I see thou art a fooland fit for thy master.

890
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.400
May these add to the numberthat may scald thee!

891
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.470
Let molten coin be thydamnation,

892
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.370
thou disease of a friend,and not himself!

893
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.870
Has friendship such afaint and milky heart,

894
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.800
it turns in less than twonights?

895
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.970
Oh, you gods, I feelmaster's passion!

896
00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.100
This slave, unto his honor,has my lord's meat in him.

897
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.000
Why should it thrive andturn to nutriment,

898
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.830
when he is turned topoison?

899
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.900
Oh, may diseases only workupon it!

900
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.800
And when he's sick todeath, let not that partof nature

901
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.100
which my lord paid for

902
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.900
be of any power to expelsickness,

903
00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.600
but prolong his hour!

904
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:23.600
Servilius!

905
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.700
You are kindly met, sir.

906
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.170
Commend me to thyhonorable virtuous lord,

907
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:30.330
my very exquisite friend.

908
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.200
May it please Your Honor,my lord hath sent

909
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:33.970
Ha! What has he sent?

910
00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.700
I am so much endeared tothat lord;

911
00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.070
he's ever sending.

912
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.570
How shall I thank him,thinkest thou?

913
00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.830
And what has he sent now?

914
00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:46.770
Has only sent his presentoccasion now, my lord;

915
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.000
requesting Your Lordshipto supply his instant use

916
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.130
with so many talents.

917
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:56.070
I know His Lordship is butmerry with me;

918
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.900
he cannot want 5,500talents.

919
00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.870
But in the meantime, hewants less, my lord.

920
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.400
If his occasion were notvirtuous,

921
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.100
I should not urge it halfso faithfully.

922
00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.770
Dost thou speak seriously,Servilius?

923
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:10.200
Upon my soul, 'tis true,sir.

924
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.770
What a wicked beast was Ito disfurnish myself

925
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.530
against such a good time,

926
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.030
when I might have shownmyself honorable.

927
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.970
How unluckily it happened,that I should purchase

928
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:28.630
the day before for alittle part

929
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:33.970
and undo a great deal ofhonor.

930
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:37.500
Servilius, now, before thegods, I am not able to do

931
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.730
the more beast, I say.

932
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.800
I was sending to use LordTimon myself,

933
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.770
But I would not for thewealth of Athens I haddone it now.

934
00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.700
Commend me bountifully toHis good Lordship;

935
00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.600
and I hope His Honor willconceive the fairest of me,

936
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:57.230
because I have no power tobe kind.

937
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:06.000
And tell him this from me,

938
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.070
I count it one of mygreatest afflictions, say,

939
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:16.670
that I cannot pleasure suchan honorable gentleman.

940
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.830
Good Servilius, will youbefriend me so far

941
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.500
as to use mine own wordsto him?

942
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.700
Yes, sir, I shall.

943
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:34.470
I'll look you out a goodturn,

944
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:35.530
Servilius.

945
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.930
Must he needs trouble mein it, hmm,

946
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.270
above all others?

947
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.170
He might have tried LordLucius or Lucullus;

948
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.300
and now Ventidius iswealthy too,

949
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.170
whom he redeemed fromprison.

950
00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.070
all these owe theirestates unto him.

951
00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:00.500
My lord, they've all beentouched and found base metal,

952
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.030
for they have all deniedhim.

953
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.570
How!

954
00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.330
Have they denied him?

955
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.230
Has Ventidius and Lucullusdenied him?

956
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.330
And does he send to me?

957
00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:12.430
Three?

958
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:13.800
Hum!

959
00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:16.970
It shows but little loveor judgment in him.

960
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.870
Must I be his last refuge?

961
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:23.600
His friends, like physicians,thrice give him over.

962
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.500
Must I take the cure uponme?

963
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.070
Has much disgraced me init;

964
00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:32.770
I'm angry at him, thatmight have known my place.

965
00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.330
I see no sense for it,

966
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.970
but his occasions mighthave wooed me first;

967
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.800
for, in my conscience, Iwas the first man

968
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:41.270
that e'er received giftfrom him.

969
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.730
And does he think sobackwardly of me now

970
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.670
that I'll requite it last?

971
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:48.500
No.

972
00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:51.200
So it may prove an argumentof laughter to the rest,

973
00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.000
and I amongst the lords bethought a fool.

974
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.270
I'd rather than the worthof thrice the sum

975
00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.730
had sent to me first, butfor my mind's sake;

976
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.000
I'd such a courage to dohim good.

977
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.270
But now return, and with theirfaint reply this answer join:

978
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.400
who bates mine honor shallnot know my coin.

979
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:16.730
One of Lord Timon's men.

980
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:17.900
Flaminius!

981
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.100
Sir, a word.

982
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.000
Pray, is my lord ready tocome forth?

983
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.100
No, indeed, he is not.

984
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.230
We attend His Lordship;

985
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.230
pray, signify so much.

986
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.230
I need not tell him that!

987
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.230
He knows you are toodiligent.

988
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:27.270
Is not that his stewardmuffled so?

989
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.400
He goes away in a cloud.

990
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.400
Call him.

991
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:30.570
Ho! Do you hear, sir?

992
00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:31.800
By your leave, sir,

993
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.500
What do ye ask of me, myfriend?

994
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.430
We wait for certain moneyhere, sir.

995
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.430
Ay, if money were ascertain as your waiting,

996
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:38.900
'twere sure enough.

997
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.030
Why then preferred you notyour sums and bills,

998
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.830
when your false masterseat of my lord's meat?

999
00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.570
Then they could smile andfawn upon his debts

1000
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:49.270
and take down the interestinto their gluttonous maws.

1001
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.230
You do yourselves butwrong to stir me up.

1002
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.370
Let me pass quietly.

1003
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:55.930
Believe it, my lord and Ihave made an end;

1004
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.030
I have no more to reckon,he to spend.

1005
00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.270
Ay, but this answer willnot serve.

1006
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.130
If 'twill not serve, 'tisnot so base as you;

1007
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.930
For you serve knaves.

1008
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.770
How, what does hiscashiered worship mutter?

1009
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.730
No matter what; he's poor,and that's revenge enough.

1010
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:08.970
Here comes Servilius;

1011
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:12.600
now we shall know someanswer.

1012
00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.330
If I might beseech you,gentlemen,

1013
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:15.470
to repair some other hour,

1014
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:17.030
I should derivemuch from it;

1015
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.570
for take it of my soul,

1016
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.600
my lord leans wondrouslyto discontent.

1017
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.530
His comfortable temper hasforsook him;

1018
00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.400
he's much out of healthand keeps his chamber.

1019
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.430
Many who keep theirchambers are not sick.

1020
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:28.770
And if it be so far beyondhis health,

1021
00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.600
methinks he should thesooner pay his debts

1022
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.470
and make a clear way tothe gods.

1023
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:34.800
We cannot take this foranswer, sir.

1024
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.400
Aah!

1025
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.770
Are my doors opposedagainst my passage?

1026
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:41.470
Have I been ever free,

1027
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:45.000
and must my house now be myretentive enemy, my jail?

1028
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.600
The place which I have feasted,does it now, like all mankind,

1029
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.670
show me an iron heart?

1030
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:50.730
My lord, here is my bill.

1031
00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:51.730
Here's mine.

1032
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:52.730
And mine, my lord.

1033
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:53.730
Knock me down with 'em.

1034
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:54.730
Cleave me to the girdle.

1035
00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:55.730
Alas, my lord

1036
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.730
Cut my heart in sums.

1037
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:57.730
Mine, fifty talents.

1038
00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:58.730
Tell out my blood!

1039
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:59.730
Five thousand crowns, my lord.

1040
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.730
Five thousand drops pays that.

1041
00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:01.730
What's yours?

1042
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:03.200
Alas, my lord

1043
00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.170
The gods fall upon you!

1044
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:12.470
They have even put mybreath from me, the slaves.

1045
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:14.470
Creditors?

1046
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:15.470
Devils!

1047
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.570
My dear lord

1048
00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:18.630
What if it should be so?

1049
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.930
My lord

1050
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.200
I'll have it so.

1051
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.370
My steward!

1052
00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:26.870
Here, my lord.

1053
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.200
So fitly?

1054
00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.130
Go, bid all my friendsagain,

1055
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:38.870
Lucius, Lucullus, andSempronius.

1056
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.230
All.

1057
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.030
I'll once more feast therascals.

1058
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.130
O my lord, you only speakfrom your distracted soul;

1059
00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.830
there is not so much left tofurnish out a moderate table.

1060
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:50.430
Be it not in thy care.

1061
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.970
Go, I charge thee, invitethem all.

1062
00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:56.870
Let in the tide of knavesonce more;

1063
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.730
my cook and I'll provide.

1064
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:23.030
My lord, you have my voiceto it;

1065
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.600
the fault's Bloody;

1066
00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:26.770
'tis necessary he shoulddie.

1067
00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:29.270
Nothing emboldens sin somuch as mercy.

1068
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:30.270
Most true.

1069
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.070
The law shall bruise him.

1070
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:38.600
Honor, health, andcompassion to the senate.

1071
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.400
Now, Captain?

1072
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.370
I am an humble suitor toyour virtues;

1073
00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:47.400
for pity is the virtue ofthe law,

1074
00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:52.130
and none but tyrants useit cruelly.

1075
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:56.230
It pleases time andfortune to lie heavy

1076
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:57.970
upon a friend of mine,who, in hot blood,

1077
00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.270
hath stepped into the law,

1078
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.870
which is past depth tothose that, without heed,

1079
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.100
do plunge into it.

1080
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.200
He is a man, setting his fateaside, of comely virtues.

1081
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:10.630
Nor did he soil the factwith cowardice

1082
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:13.130
an honor in him which buysout his fault

1083
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.500
but with a noble fury andfair spirit,

1084
00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.870
seeing his reputationtouched to death,

1085
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.900
he did oppose his foe.

1086
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.030
And with such sober andunnoted passion,

1087
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.200
he did behoove his anger,

1088
00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.600
ere 'twas spent,

1089
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.900
as if he had but proved anargument.

1090
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:29.500
You undergo too strict aparadox,

1091
00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.670
striving to make an uglydeed look fair.

1092
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:34.400
Your words have took suchpains

1093
00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.870
as if they labored to bringmanslaughter into form

1094
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.700
and set quarrelling uponthe head of valor;

1095
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.970
which indeed is valor misbegotand came into the world

1096
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.930
when sects and factionswere newly born.

1097
00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:49.830
He's truly valiant thatcan wisely suffer

1098
00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:51.630
the worst that man canbreathe

1099
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.130
and make his wrongs hisoutsides,

1100
00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.870
to wear them like hisraiment, carelessly,

1101
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:58.570
and ne'er prefer hisinjuries to his heart,

1102
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.970
to bring it into danger.

1103
00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:03.870
If wrongs be evils andenforce us kill,

1104
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:07.000
what folly 'tis to hazardlife for ill!

1105
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.100
My lord

1106
00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.200
You cannot make gross sinslook clear.

1107
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.230
My lord!

1108
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.430
To revenge is no valor,but to bear.

1109
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:14.500
My lords, then, underfavor,

1110
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.170
pardon me, if I speak likea captain.

1111
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.370
Why do fond men exposethemselves to battle,

1112
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:21.330
and not endure allthreats?

1113
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.530
Sleep upon it, and let the foesquietly cut their throats,

1114
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.470
without repugnancy?

1115
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:27.900
If there be such valor inthe bearing,

1116
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.770
what make we abroad?

1117
00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:32.570
Why then, women are morevaliant that stay at home,

1118
00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:34.500
if bearing carry it,

1119
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.630
and the ass more captainthan the lion,

1120
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:40.930
the fellow loaden withirons wiser than the judge,

1121
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.230
if wisdom be in suffering.

1122
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:50.130
O my lords, as you aregreat, be pitifully good.

1123
00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.530
Who cannot condemnrashness in cold blood?

1124
00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.100
To kill, I grant, is sin'sextremest gust;

1125
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:57.970
but, in defence, by mercy,'tis most just.

1126
00:53:57.970 --> 00:54:00.300
To be in anger is impiety;

1127
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.800
but who is man that is notangry?

1128
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.470
Weigh but the crime withthis.

1129
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.570
You breathe in vain.

1130
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:08.330
In vain!

1131
00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:10.600
His service done atLacedaemon and Byzantium

1132
00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.270
were a sufficient briberfor his life.

1133
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:13.370
What's that?

1134
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:14.630
I say, my lords, he hasdone fair service,

1135
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:16.530
and slain in fight many ofyour enemies.

1136
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.970
How full of valor did he bearhimself in the last conflict,

1137
00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:20.730
and made plenteous wounds!

1138
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:22.430
He has made too muchplenty with 'em;

1139
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:24.230
he's a sworn rioter.

1140
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:25.870
He has a sin that oftendrowns him

1141
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:27.370
and takes his valorprisoner.

1142
00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.570
If there were no foes,

1143
00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.170
that were enough toovercome him.

1144
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.330
In the beastly fury, he hasbeen known to commit outrages

1145
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.300
and cherish factions.

1146
00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.700
It is inferred to us

1147
00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:39.770
that his days are foul andhis drink dangerous.

1148
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:41.830
He dies.

1149
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.900
Hard fate!

1150
00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.970
He might have died in war.

1151
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.700
My lords, if not for anyparts in him

1152
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.430
though his right arm mightpurchase his own time

1153
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:51.700
and be in debt to none

1154
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.330
yet more to move you,

1155
00:54:53.330 --> 00:54:55.330
take my deserts to his,and join 'em both.

1156
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.830
And, for I know yourreverend ages love security,

1157
00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:01.770
I'll pawn my victories,all my honors to you,

1158
00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:03.600
upon his good returns.

1159
00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.670
If, by this crime, he owesthe law his life,

1160
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.300
why, let the war receiveit in valiant gore

1161
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.770
for law is strict, and waris nothing more.

1162
00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:14.800
We are for law.

1163
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.970
He dies.

1164
00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.000
Urge it no more, on heightof our displeasure.

1165
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.300
Friend or brother,

1166
00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.570
he forfeits his own bloodthat spills another.

1167
00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:24.100
Must it be so?

1168
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.470
It must not be.

1169
00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:26.930
My lords, I do beseechyou, know me.

1170
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:27.930
How!

1171
00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:28.930
Call me to yourremembrances.

1172
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.070
What!

1173
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:31.430
I cannot think but thatyour age has forgot me;

1174
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:33.900
it could not else be, Ishould prove so base, to sue,

1175
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.700
and be denied such commongrace.

1176
00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.070
My wounds ache at you.

1177
00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:39.870
Do you dare our anger?

1178
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.630
'Tis in few words, butspacious in effect;

1179
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.570
we banish thee forever.

1180
00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:48.230
Banish me!

1181
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:50.270
Banish your dotage;

1182
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:52.430
banish usury, that makesthe senate ugly.

1183
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:55.170
If, after two days' shine,Athens contain thee,

1184
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.830
attend our weightierjudgment.

1185
00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:02.300
And, not to swell ourspirit, he shall beexecuted presently.

1186
00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.830
Now the gods keep you oldenough;

1187
00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:07.170
that you may live only inbone, that none may lookon you!

1188
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.530
I'm worse than mad.

1189
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:14.530
I have kept back theirfoes,

1190
00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:16.770
while they have told theirmoney

1191
00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:19.270
and let out their coinupon large interest,

1192
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:22.900
I myself rich only inlarge hurts.

1193
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:27.200
All those for this?

1194
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.370
Is this the balsam thatthe usuring senate

1195
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.570
pours into captains'wounds?

1196
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:35.200
Banishment.

1197
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.670
It comes not ill;

1198
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.970
I hate not to be banished;

1199
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:42.730
it is a cause worthy myspleen and fury

1200
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.300
that I may strike atAthens.

1201
00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.770
I'll cheer up mydiscontented troops

1202
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:51.100
and lay for hearts.

1203
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:55.770
'Tis honor with most landsto be at odds;

1204
00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:59.700
soldiers should brook aslittle wrongs as gods.

1205
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.930
The good time of day toyou, sir.

1206
00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:17.130
I also wish it to you.

1207
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:22.070
I think this honorable lorddid but try us this other day.

1208
00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.100
Upon that were my thoughtstiring,

1209
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:26.600
when we encountered.

1210
00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.000
I hope it is not so lowwith him

1211
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.800
as he made it seem in thetrial of his several friends.

1212
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.900
It should not be,

1213
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:39.030
by the persuasion of hisnew feasting.

1214
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:41.900
I should think so.

1215
00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:44.900
He hath sent me an earnestinviting,

1216
00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:49.370
which many my near occasionsdid urge me to put off;

1217
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.000
but he hath conjured mebeyond them,

1218
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.770
and I must needs appear.

1219
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:57.730
In like manner was I in debtto my importunate business,

1220
00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:02.000
but he would not hear myexcuse.

1221
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:06.070
I am sorry, when he sentto borrow of me,

1222
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:08.370
that my provision was out.

1223
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.700
I am sick of that grieftoo,

1224
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.830
as I understand how allthings go.

1225
00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.800
Every man here's so.

1226
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.330
What would he haveborrowed of you?

1227
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.400
A thousand pieces.

1228
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.200
He sent to me, sir

1229
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.400
Here he comes.

1230
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:35.730
With all my heart,gentlemen both.

1231
00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:37.100
How fare you?

1232
00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.070
Ever at the best, hearingwell of Your Lordship.

1233
00:58:41.070 --> 00:58:42.670
The swallow follows notsummer

1234
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:45.200
more willing than we, YourLordship.

1235
00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.400
Nor more willingly leaveswinter;

1236
00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.830
such summer-birds are men.

1237
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:58.900
Our dinner will notrecompense this long stay.

1238
00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.670
Feast your ears with themusic awhile,

1239
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.930
if they will fare so harshlyof the trumpet's sound;

1240
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:10.470
we will to it presently.

1241
00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.800
I hope it remains notunkindly with Your Lordship

1242
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.630
that I returned you anempty messenger.

1243
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.300
O, sir, let it not troubleyou.

1244
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:39.370
My noble lord

1245
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:41.200
My good friend, whatcheer?

1246
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:45.070
My most honorable lord, Iam even sick of shame that,

1247
00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:47.070
when this other day YourLordship sent to me,

1248
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:49.230
I was so unfortunate abeggar.

1249
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.670
Think not on it.

1250
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:53.300
If you had sent but twohours before

1251
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.500
Let it not cumber yourbetter remembrance.

1252
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.400
Come, bring in alltogether.

1253
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:09.730
All covered dishes.

1254
01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:11.330
Royal cheer, I warrantyou.

1255
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.600
I doubt not that,

1256
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.000
if money and the seasoncan yield it.

1257
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
How do you?

1258
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.100
What's the news?

1259
01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.170
Alcibiades is banished.

1260
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.300
Hear you of it?

1261
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:22.070
Alcibiades banished.

1262
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:23.630
'Tis so; be sure of it.

1263
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:24.630
How, how?

1264
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:26.330
I pray you, upon what?

1265
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.070
My worthy friends, willyou draw near?

1266
01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:29.330
I'll tell you more anon.

1267
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.070
Here's a noble feasttoward.

1268
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:33.300
This is the old man still.

1269
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.400
Will it do? Will it do?

1270
01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400
It does.

1271
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.000
But time will, and so

1272
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.400
I do conceive.

1273
01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:48.000
Each man to his stool,with that spur as he would

1274
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
to the lip of hismistress.

1275
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.030
Your diet shall be in allplaces alike.

1276
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.900
Make not a city feast ofit, to let the meat cool

1277
01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.700
ere we can agree upon thefirst place.

1278
01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.530
Sit, sit.

1279
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:04.070
The gods require ourthanks.

1280
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.070
You great benefactors,

1281
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:16.730
sprinkle our society withthankfulness.

1282
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:21.270
For your own gifts, letyourselves be praised.

1283
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:26.270
But reserve still to give,lest your deities be despised.

1284
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:29.100
Lend to each man enough,

1285
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.970
that one need not lend toanother;

1286
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.030
for, were your godheads toborrow of men,

1287
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.000
men would forsake thegods.

1288
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.270
Let the meat be beloved

1289
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:41.370
more than the man thatgives it.

1290
01:01:41.370 --> 01:01:45.030
Let no assembly of twenty bewithout a score of villains.

1291
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:48.100
if there sit twelve womenat the table,

1292
01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.200
let a dozen of them be asthey are.

1293
01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:56.130
The rest of your fees, yougods

1294
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.300
the senators of Athens,

1295
01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.830
together with the commonlag of people

1296
01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:00.370
what is amiss in them,

1297
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:04.770
you gods, make suitablefor destruction.

1298
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:09.100
For these, my present friends,as they are nothing to me,

1299
01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:10.530
so in nothing bless them,

1300
01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:13.170
and to nothing are theywelcome.

1301
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.930
Uncover, dogs, and lap.

1302
01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:34.370
What does His Lordshipmean?

1303
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:36.230
I know not.

1304
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:37.900
May you a better feastnever behold,

1305
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.900
you knot of mouth-friends.

1306
01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:45.130
Smoke and lukewarm wateris your perfection.

1307
01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:46.530
This is Timon's last;

1308
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:49.930
who, stuck and spangledwith your flatteries,

1309
01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:53.400
washes it off, andsprinkles in your faces

1310
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.100
your reeking villainy.

1311
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.430
Live loathed and long,

1312
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:06.370
most smiling, smooth,detested parasites,

1313
01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:13.370
courteous destroyers,affable wolves, meek bears,

1314
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:20.130
you fools of fortune,trencher-friends,

1315
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:25.630
cap and knee slaves,vapors, minute-jacks!

1316
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:32.730
Of man and beast the infinitemalady crust you quite o'er!

1317
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:35.430
What, dost thou go?

1318
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.970
All in motion soft!

1319
01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:39.000
Take thy physic firstthou too

1320
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.770
and thou

1321
01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:43.400
Stay, I'll lend theemoney, borrow none.

1322
01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.730
Henceforth be no feast,

1323
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:49.330
whereat a villain's not awelcome guest.

1324
01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:52.330
Burn, house!

1325
01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:55.430
Sink, Athens!

1326
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.100
Henceforth hated be ofTimon

1327
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.070
man and all humanity!

1328
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:06.400
Matrons, turn incontinent!

1329
01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.200
Obedience, fail inchildren!

1330
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.300
Slaves and fools,

1331
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:14.270
pluck the grave wrinkledsenate from the bench,

1332
01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:17.500
and minister in theirsteads!

1333
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.930
To general filths convertof the instant,

1334
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:24.070
green virginity, do it inyour parents' eyes!

1335
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:27.000
Bankrupts, hold fast;

1336
01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.430
rather than render back,out with your knives,

1337
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.470
and cut your trusters'throats!

1338
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.630
Bound servants, steal!

1339
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.530
Large-handed robbers yourgrave masters are,

1340
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:39.630
and pill by law.

1341
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:43.130
Maid, to thy master's bed;

1342
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:45.900
thy mistress is of thebrothel!

1343
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.200
Son of sixteen, pluck thelined crutch

1344
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.300
from thy old limping sire,with it, beat out his brains!

1345
01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.870
Piety and fear, religionto the gods,

1346
01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:01.970
peace, justice, truth,domestic awe, night-rest,

1347
01:05:01.970 --> 01:05:05.170
neighborhood, instruction,manners,

1348
01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.730
mysteries, trades,

1349
01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:09.670
decline to yourconfounding contraries,

1350
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:12.630
and let confusion live!

1351
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:15.400
Plagues, incident to men,

1352
01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:18.600
your potent and infectiousfevers heap on Athens,

1353
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.570
ripe for stroke!

1354
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:25.270
Thou cold sciatica,cripple our senators,

1355
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:28.800
that their limbs may haltas lamely as their manners.

1356
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.300
Lust and liberty creepinto the minds and marrowsof our youth,

1357
01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.400
that 'gainst the stream ofvirtue they may strive,

1358
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.500
and drown themselves inriot!

1359
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.200
Itches, blains, sow allthe Athenian bosoms;

1360
01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.170
and their crop be generalleprosy!

1361
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:51.770
Breath infect breath, thattheir society,

1362
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:55.200
as their friendship, maybe merely poisoned!

1363
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.500
Nothing I'll bear fromthee but nakedness,

1364
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.230
thou detestable town!

1365
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:08.630
Take thou that withmultiplying bans!

1366
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:09.900
The gods confound

1367
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.970
hear me, you good godsall

1368
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.470
the Athenians both withinand out that wall!

1369
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:21.930
And grant, as Timon grows,his hate may grow

1370
01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:26.770
to the whole race ofmankind, high and low!

1371
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:28.300
Amen.

1372
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:40.800
Hear you!

1373
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:44.730
Master steward?

1374
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:52.930
Where's our master?

1375
01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400
Are we undone?

1376
01:06:57.630 --> 01:07:00.470
Cast off? Nothingremaining?

1377
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:04.400
Alack, my fellows, whatshould I say to you?

1378
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.500
Let me be recorded by therighteous gods,

1379
01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.130
I am as poor as you.

1380
01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.700
Such a house broke?

1381
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:11.370
So noble a master fallen?

1382
01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.170
All gone, and not onefriend to take his fortuneby the arm,

1383
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:15.370
and go along with him?

1384
01:07:15.370 --> 01:07:17.570
As we do turn our backfrom our companion

1385
01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:18.600
thrown into his grave,

1386
01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.730
so his familiars to hisburied fortunes

1387
01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:21.900
slink all away,

1388
01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.300
leave their false vows inhim,

1389
01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.870
like empty purses picked;

1390
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.100
and his poor self, adedicated beggar to the air,

1391
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:29.200
with his disease ofall-shunned poverty,

1392
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:31.330
walks, like contempt,alone.

1393
01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:34.730
More of our fellows.

1394
01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:37.500
All broken implements of aruined house.

1395
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.230
Yet do our hearts wearTimon's livery;

1396
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.730
that see I by our faces;

1397
01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:46.700
we are fellows still,serving alike in sorrow.

1398
01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.670
Leaked is our bark, andwe, poor mates,

1399
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.270
stand on the dying deck,hearing the surges threat.

1400
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:53.270
We must all part into thissea of air.

1401
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.200
Good fellows all, thelatest of my wealth

1402
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.000
I'll share amongst you.

1403
01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.870
Wherever we shall meet,for Timon's sake,

1404
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:00.530
let's yet be fellows;

1405
01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:02.300
let's shake our heads andsay,

1406
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.930
as 'twere a knell unto ourmaster's fortune,

1407
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:06.270
"We have seen betterdays."

1408
01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:07.630
Let each take some;

1409
01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:09.700
nay, put out all yourhands.

1410
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.870
Not one word more.

1411
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:17.170
Thus part we rich insorrow, parting poor.

1412
01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:20.770
Oh, the fierce wretchednessthat glory brings us.

1413
01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.870
Who would not wish to befrom wealth exempt,

1414
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:26.670
since riches point tomisery and contempt?

1415
01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.230
Who would be so mockedwith glory?

1416
01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:30.800
Or to live but in a dreamof friendship?

1417
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.700
To have his pomp and allwhat state compounds

1418
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:37.130
but only painted, like hisvarnished friends?

1419
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:40.630
Poor honest lord, broughtlow by his own heart,

1420
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:43.000
undone by goodness.

1421
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.700
Strange, unusual blood,when man's worst sin is

1422
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.800
he does too much good.

1423
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.500
Who, then, dares to behalf so kind again?

1424
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:54.330
For bounty, that makesgods, does still mar men.

1425
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:58.400
My dearest lord, blessed,to be most accursed,

1426
01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:01.200
rich, only to be wretched,

1427
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.200
thy great fortunes are madethy chief afflictions.

1428
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.630
Alas, kind lord.

1429
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:08.900
He's flung in rage

1430
01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.770
from this ingrateful seatof monstrous friends,

1431
01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.430
nor has he with him tosupply his life,

1432
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:14.370
or that which cancommand it.

1433
01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:16.900
I'll follow and inquirehim out.

1434
01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.200
I'll ever serve his mindwith my best will;

1435
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:23.430
whilst I have gold, I'llbe his steward still.

1436
01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:28.770
O blessedbreeding sun,

1437
01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:33.430
draw from the earth rottenhumidity;

1438
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:38.700
below thy sister's orb,infect the air!

1439
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:41.170
Twin brothers of one womb,

1440
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.830
whose procreation,residence, and birth

1441
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:47.000
scarce is dividant,

1442
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.930
touch them with severalfortunes;

1443
01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:54.200
the greater scorns thelesser.

1444
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.200
Not nature, to whom allsores lay siege,

1445
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.870
can bear great fortune,

1446
01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:03.970
but by contempt of nature.

1447
01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:09.130
Raise me this beggar, denyit that lord;

1448
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:13.300
the senator shall bearcontempt hereditary,

1449
01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:18.000
the beggar, native honor.

1450
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.630
It is the pasture lards,the brother's sides,

1451
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:25.030
the want that makes himlean.

1452
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:28.400
Who dares, who dares,

1453
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.470
in purity of manhood standupright,

1454
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:33.870
and say, "This man's aflatterer"?

1455
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:37.630
If one be, so are theyall;

1456
01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:41.930
for every grise of fortuneis smoothed by that below.

1457
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:44.230
The learned pate ducks tothe golden fool.

1458
01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:46.600
All is oblique;

1459
01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.170
there's nothing level inour cursed natures,

1460
01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:51.970
but direct villainy.

1461
01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:54.500
Therefore, be abhorred

1462
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.300
all feasts, societies,throngs of men.

1463
01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:08.700
His semblable, yea,himself, Timon disdains.

1464
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.630
Destruction fang mankind!

1465
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:21.530
Earth, yield me roots.

1466
01:12:21.530 --> 01:12:23.900
Who seeks for better ofthee,

1467
01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.530
sauce his palate with thymost operant poison.

1468
01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.900
What is here?

1469
01:12:39.730 --> 01:12:41.170
Gold?

1470
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:50.970
Yellow, glittering,precious gold?

1471
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:57.300
No, gods, I'm no idlevotarist!

1472
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.370
Roots, you clear heavens!

1473
01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:09.370
Thus much of this willmake black white,

1474
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:14.600
foul fair, wrong right,base noble,

1475
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:18.770
old young, coward valiant.

1476
01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.270
Ha, you gods!

1477
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:22.370
What this?

1478
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:30.800
Why, this will lug your priestsand servants from your sides,

1479
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.230
pluck pillows from beneathstout men's heads.

1480
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:39.570
This yellow slave willknit and break religions,

1481
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:43.000
bless the accursed, makethe hoar leprosy adored,

1482
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.900
place thieves and give themtitle, knee and approbation

1483
01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.670
with senators on thebench.

1484
01:13:50.670 --> 01:13:55.430
Why, this is it that makes thewappened widow wed again;

1485
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:58.670
she whom the spital-houseand ulcerous sores

1486
01:13:58.670 --> 01:13:59.930
would cast the gorge at,

1487
01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:06.830
this embalms and spices tothe April day again.

1488
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:11.530
Come, damned earth, thoucommon whore of mankind,

1489
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:14.700
that puttest odds amongthe route of nations,

1490
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:17.470
I will make thee do thyright nature.

1491
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.600
Ha!

1492
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600
A drum?

1493
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:26.900
Thou art quick, but yetI'll bury thee.

1494
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.030
Thou go, strong thief,

1495
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:33.370
when gouty keepers of theecannot stand.

1496
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:38.470
Nay, stay thou out forearnest.

1497
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.370
What art thou there?

1498
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:43.000
Speak.

1499
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.430
A beast, as thou art.

1500
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:48.900
The canker gnaw thy heart,

1501
01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:52.100
for showing me again theeyes of man.

1502
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.170
What is thy name?

1503
01:14:55.170 --> 01:14:59.370
Is man so hateful to theethat art thyself a man?

1504
01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:07.300
I am Misanthropos and hatemankind.

1505
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.300
For thy part, I do wishthou wert a dog

1506
01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:11.730
that I might love theesomething.

1507
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.600
I know thee well;

1508
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.130
but in thy fortunes amunlearned and strange.

1509
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:17.900
I know thee too;

1510
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.400
and more than that I knowthee, I not desire to know.

1511
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.600
Follow thy drum;

1512
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:28.500
with man's blood paint theground, gules, gules.

1513
01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.770
Religious canons, civillaws are cruel;

1514
01:15:30.770 --> 01:15:33.000
what should war be?

1515
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.170
This fell whore of thine hathin her more destruction

1516
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:37.070
than thy sword, for allher cherubim look.

1517
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:39.400
Oh, thy lips rot off!

1518
01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.830
I'll not kiss thee;

1519
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:44.300
then the rot returns tothine own lips again.

1520
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.770
How came the noble Timonto this change?

1521
01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:52.000
As the moon does, bywanting light to give.

1522
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.670
But then renew I couldnot, like the moon;

1523
01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:58.500
there were no suns toborrow of.

1524
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.570
Noble Timon, whatfriendship may I do thee?

1525
01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:05.870
None, but to maintain myopinion.

1526
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:07.430
What is it, Timon?

1527
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:10.970
Promise me friendship, butperform none.

1528
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:14.000
If thou wilt not promise,the gods plague thee,

1529
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.400
for thou art a man.

1530
01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.270
If thou dost perform,confound thee,

1531
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:19.700
for thou art a man!

1532
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:22.700
I have heard in some sortof thy miseries.

1533
01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:24.730
Thou sawest them, when Ihad prosperity.

1534
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:26.500
I see them now;

1535
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.170
then was a blessed time.

1536
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:31.730
As thine is now, held witha brace of harlots.

1537
01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:33.870
Is this the Athenianminion

1538
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.470
the world has voiced soregardfully?

1539
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:37.630
Art thou Timandra?

1540
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:38.700
Yes.

1541
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:41.130
Be a whore still.

1542
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.700
They love thee not thatuse thee;

1543
01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.330
give them diseases, leavingwith thee their lust.

1544
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:50.530
Make use of thy salthours.

1545
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.270
Season the slaves for tubsand baths;

1546
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:56.230
bring down rose-cheeked youthto the tub-fast and diet.

1547
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:57.330
Hang thee, monster!

1548
01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.700
Pardon him, sweetTimandra;

1549
01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.500
his wits are drowned andlost in his calamities.

1550
01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.270
I have but little gold oflate, brave Timon,

1551
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:08.130
the want whereof dothdaily make revolt

1552
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:09.800
in my penurious band.

1553
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.900
I have heard, and grieved,how cursed Athens,

1554
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.200
mindless of thy worth,

1555
01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.670
forgetting thy great deeds,when neighbor states,

1556
01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:21.970
but for thy sword andfortune, trod upon them

1557
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.530
I prithee, beat thy drum,and get thee gone.

1558
01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:26.000
I am thy friend, and pitythee, dear Timon.

1559
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.400
How dost thou pity himwhom thou dost trouble?

1560
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.300
I had rather be alone!

1561
01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.700
Why, fare thee well.

1562
01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.770
Here is some gold forthee.

1563
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:36.230
Keep it; I cannot eat it.

1564
01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.500
When I have laid proudAthens on a heap

1565
01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.500
Warrest thou againstAthens?

1566
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.970
Ay, Timon, and have cause.

1567
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:46.900
The gods confound them allin thy conquest;

1568
01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:50.030
and thee after, when thouhast conquered!

1569
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.100
Why me, Timon?

1570
01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.200
That, by killing ofvillains,

1571
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.500
thou was born to conquermy country.

1572
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.600
Put up thy gold.

1573
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.600
Go on

1574
01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.470
here's gold

1575
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:02.500
go on;

1576
01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.530
be as a planetary plague,

1577
01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:06.500
when Jove will over somehigh-viced city

1578
01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.670
hang his poison in thesick air.

1579
01:18:08.670 --> 01:18:11.530
Let not thy sword skipone.

1580
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.130
Pity not honored age forhis white beard;

1581
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:15.800
he is an usurer.

1582
01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.100
Strike me the counterfeitmatron;

1583
01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.600
it is her habit only thatis honest,

1584
01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.100
herself's a bawd.

1585
01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.470
Let not the virgin's cheek makesoft thy trenchant sword;

1586
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:26.800
for those milk paps, thatthrough the window-bars

1587
01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.900
bore at men's eyes,

1588
01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.370
are not within the leaf ofpity writ,

1589
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:31.930
but set them down horribletraitors.

1590
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:35.600
Spare not the babe, whosedimpled smiles

1591
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.400
from fools exhaust theirmercy;

1592
01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.800
think it a bastard,

1593
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.370
whom the oracle hathdoubtfully pronounced

1594
01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:41.800
the throat shall cut,

1595
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.470
and mince it sans remorse.

1596
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.730
Swear against objects;

1597
01:18:46.730 --> 01:18:49.000
put armor on thine earsand on thine eyes;

1598
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.730
whose proof, nor yells ofmothers, maids, nor babes,

1599
01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:54.400
nor sight of priests inholy vestments bleeding,

1600
01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.330
shall pierce a jot.

1601
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.800
There's gold to pay thysoldiers.

1602
01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.870
Make large confusion;

1603
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.500
and, thy fury spent,confounded be thyself!

1604
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.230
Speak not, be gone.

1605
01:19:05.230 --> 01:19:07.300
Hast thou gold yet?

1606
01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.330
I'll take the gold thougivest me,

1607
01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:10.800
not all thy counsel.

1608
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:17.300
Dost thou, or dost thou not,heaven's curse upon thee!

1609
01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.730
Give us some gold, goodTimon.

1610
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:20.270
Hast thou more?

1611
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.770
Enough to make a whoreforswear her trade,

1612
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:25.200
and to make whores,a bawd.

1613
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.530
Hold up, you sluts, youraprons mountant.

1614
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:33.370
You are not oathable, although,I know, you'll swear,

1615
01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:35.470
terribly swear into strongshudders

1616
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.230
and heavenly agues theimmortal gods that hear you

1617
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:42.230
spare your oaths, I'lltrust to your conditions.

1618
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.170
Be whores still;

1619
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:47.200
and he whose pious breathseeks to convert you,

1620
01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:51.270
be strong in whore, allurehim, burn him up;

1621
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:53.470
let your close firepredominate his smoke,

1622
01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:54.730
and be no turncoats.

1623
01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:57.730
Yet may your pains, sixmonths, be quite contrary.

1624
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:08.200
And thatch your poor thin roofswith burthens of the dead

1625
01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.800
some that were hanged,no matter

1626
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.170
wear them, betray withthem.

1627
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.800
Whore still;

1628
01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.630
paint till a horse maymire upon your face,

1629
01:20:17.630 --> 01:20:19.330
a pox of wrinkles!

1630
01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:20.800
Well, more gold.

1631
01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.130
What then?

1632
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:24.800
Believe it that we'll doanything for gold.

1633
01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.730
Consumptions sow in hollowbones of man;

1634
01:20:27.730 --> 01:20:30.400
strike their sharp shins,and mar men's spurring.

1635
01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:34.870
Crack the lawyer's voice,

1636
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:37.100
that he may never morefalse title plead,

1637
01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:39.370
nor sound his quilletsshrilly.

1638
01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:43.670
Hoar the flamen, who scoldsagainst the quality of flesh,

1639
01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.830
and not believes himself.

1640
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:50.570
Down with the nose, downwith it flat;

1641
01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:52.930
take the bridge quite awayof him that,

1642
01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:56.600
his particular to foresee,smells from the general weal.

1643
01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.730
Make curled-pateruffians bald;

1644
01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:03.230
and let the unscarredbraggarts of the war

1645
01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:04.970
derive some pain from you.

1646
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:07.030
Plague all;

1647
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.900
that your activity maydefeat and quell

1648
01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:10.370
the source of allerection.

1649
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.730
There's more gold.

1650
01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:16.970
Gold.

1651
01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:19.570
Do you damn others, andlet this damn you,

1652
01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:22.100
and ditches grave you all.

1653
01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.000
More counsel with moremoney, bounteous Timon.

1654
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.800
More gold and moremischief first;

1655
01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.230
I've given you earnest.

1656
01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:30.900
Strike up the drum towardsAthens!

1657
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.430
Farewell, Timon.

1658
01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:34.170
If I thrive well, I'llvisit thee again.

1659
01:21:34.170 --> 01:21:36.370
If I hope well, I'll neversee thee more.

1660
01:21:36.370 --> 01:21:37.570
I never did thee harm!

1661
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:39.230
Yes, thou spokest wellof me.

1662
01:21:39.230 --> 01:21:40.270
Callest thou that harm?

1663
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.300
Men daily find it.

1664
01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:47.770
Get thee gone, and takethy beagles with thee.

1665
01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:50.330
We but offend him.

1666
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:51.330
Strike!

1667
01:22:01.730 --> 01:22:05.530
That nature, being sick ofman's unkindness,

1668
01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:08.470
should yet be hungry.

1669
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:11.700
Common mother, thou, whosewomb immeasurable,

1670
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.670
and infinite breast, teemsand feeds all;

1671
01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:19.930
whereof thine proud child,arrogant man, is puffed,

1672
01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:23.600
engenders the black toadand adder blue,

1673
01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.970
the gilded newt andeyeless venomed worm,

1674
01:22:26.970 --> 01:22:31.570
with all the abhorredbirths below crisp heaven

1675
01:22:31.570 --> 01:22:35.300
whereon Hyperion'squickening fire doth shine;

1676
01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.670
yield him, whom all thehuman sons do hate,

1677
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:43.430
from forth thy plenteousbosom, one poor root.

1678
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:47.500
Ensear thy fertile andconceptious womb;

1679
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:51.870
let it no more bring outingrateful man.

1680
01:22:51.870 --> 01:22:58.530
Go great with tigers,dragons, wolves, bears;

1681
01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:00.530
teem with new monsters,

1682
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:02.800
whom thy upward face tothe marbled mansion

1683
01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:04.700
all above hath neverpresented.

1684
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.170
A root!

1685
01:23:12.170 --> 01:23:14.100
Dear thanks!

1686
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:25.970
Dry up thy marrows, vines,and plough-torn leas;

1687
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:27.800
whereof ingrateful man,

1688
01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.800
with liquorish draughtsand morsels unctuous,

1689
01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.670
greases his pure mind,

1690
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:36.570
that from it allconsideration slips.

1691
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:40.400
More man.

1692
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:44.600
Plague, plague!

1693
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:49.530
I was directed hither.

1694
01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:52.770
Men report thou dostaffect my manners

1695
01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:54.730
and dost use them.

1696
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.330
'Tis, then, because thoudost not keep a dog,

1697
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:58.600
whom I would imitate.

1698
01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.130
Consumption catch thee!

1699
01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:03.900
This is in thee a naturebut infected;

1700
01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:09.630
a poor unmanly melancholysprung from change of fortune.

1701
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:11.530
Why this spade?

1702
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:13.470
This place?

1703
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.300
This slave-like habit?

1704
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:19.070
And these looks of care?

1705
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:23.430
Thy flatterers yet wearsilk, drink wine, lie soft;

1706
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:25.730
hug their diseasedperfumes,

1707
01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:27.900
and have forgot that everTimon was.

1708
01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.530
No, no, no!

1709
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:30.800
Shame not this place

1710
01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.530
by putting on the cunningof a carper.

1711
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:35.430
Be thou a flatterer now,

1712
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:38.830
and seek to thrive by thatwhich has undone thee.

1713
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.870
Hinge thy knee, and lethis very breath,

1714
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:44.700
whom thoust observe, blowoff thy cap;

1715
01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:49.730
praise his most vicious strain,and call it excellent.

1716
01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:51.830
Thou wast told thus;

1717
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:54.000
thou gavest thine earslike tapsters

1718
01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.330
that bid welcome to knavesand all approachers.

1719
01:24:58.330 --> 01:25:00.930
'Tis most just that thouturn rascal;

1720
01:25:00.930 --> 01:25:05.230
hadst thou wealth again,rascals should have it.

1721
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:08.230
Do not assume my likeness.

1722
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:09.870
Were I like thee, I'dthrow away myself.

1723
01:25:09.870 --> 01:25:12.870
Thou hast cast away thyself,being like thyself;

1724
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:16.400
a madman so long, now afool.

1725
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.530
What, thinkest that thebleak air,

1726
01:25:19.530 --> 01:25:23.200
thy boisterous chamberlain,will put thy shirt on warm?

1727
01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.230
Will the mossed trees thathave outlived the eagle

1728
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:28.630
page thy heels, and skipwhere thou pointest out?

1729
01:25:28.630 --> 01:25:31.000
Will the cold brook,candied with ice,

1730
01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.430
caudle thy morning taste,

1731
01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:34.630
to cure thy o'er-night'ssurfeit?

1732
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:37.130
Call the creatures whosenaked natures

1733
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:39.230
live in all the spite ofwreakful heaven,

1734
01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:41.070
whose bare unhousedtrunks,

1735
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:43.500
to the conflictingelements exposed,

1736
01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.500
answer mere nature;

1737
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:49.700
bid them flatter thee;

1738
01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.700
oh, thou shalt find

1739
01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.570
A fool of thee.

1740
01:25:52.570 --> 01:25:53.770
Depart.

1741
01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:57.230
I love thee better nowthan e'er I did.

1742
01:25:57.230 --> 01:25:58.870
I hate thee worse.

1743
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:59.870
Why?

1744
01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:01.370
Thou flatterest misery.

1745
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:02.600
I flatter not;

1746
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.200
but say thou art acaitiff.

1747
01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.070
Why dost thou seek me out?

1748
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:10.270
To vex thee.

1749
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:13.400
Always a villain's officeor a fool's.

1750
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.400
Dost please thyself in it?

1751
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.400
Ay.

1752
01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.600
What! A knave too?

1753
01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.400
If thou didst put thissour-cold habit on

1754
01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.730
to castigate thy pride,'twere well.

1755
01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:24.430
But thou dost itenforcedly;

1756
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:29.370
thou wouldst courtier beagain, wert thou not beggar.

1757
01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:32.730
Willing misery outlivesencertain pomp,

1758
01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.370
is crowned before.

1759
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:36.770
The one is filling still,never complete;

1760
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:39.600
the other, at high wish.

1761
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.730
Best state, contentless,hath a distracted

1762
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:45.700
and most wretched being,

1763
01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:51.970
worse than the worst,content.

1764
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:56.770
Thou shouldst desire todie, being miserable.

1765
01:26:56.770 --> 01:27:00.830
Not by his breath that ismore miserable.

1766
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:05.030
Thou art a slave, whomfortune's tender arm

1767
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:06.500
with favor never clasped,

1768
01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.570
but bred a dog.

1769
01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:11.730
Hadst thou, like us fromour first swath,

1770
01:27:11.730 --> 01:27:12.900
proceeded the sweetdegrees

1771
01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.870
that this brief worldaffords to such

1772
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:17.030
as may the passive drudgesof it freely command,

1773
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:21.530
thou wouldst have drownedthyself in general riot;

1774
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.570
melted down thy youth indifferent beds of lust;

1775
01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:26.130
and never learned the icyprecepts of respect,

1776
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:29.430
but followed the sugaredgame before thee.

1777
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:34.600
But myself, who had theworld as my confectionary,

1778
01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.670
the eyes, the tongues, thehearts,

1779
01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:38.230
the mouths of men at duty,

1780
01:27:38.230 --> 01:27:40.630
more than I could frameemployment,

1781
01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:45.730
these that numberless uponme stuck

1782
01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:46.970
as leaves do on the oak,

1783
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.500
with one winter's brushfell from their boughs

1784
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:53.800
and left me open, bare toevery storm that blows.

1785
01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.530
I, to bear this, thatnever knew but better,

1786
01:27:56.530 --> 01:27:57.730
is some burden.

1787
01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.470
Thy nature did commence insufferance,

1788
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:04.270
time hath made thee hardin it.

1789
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:07.100
Why dost thou hate men?

1790
01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.600
They never flattered thee.

1791
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.270
What hast thou given?

1792
01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:14.300
If thou wilt curse, thyfather, that poor rag,

1793
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.470
must be thy subject,

1794
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:17.730
who in spite put stuff tosome she beggar

1795
01:28:17.730 --> 01:28:21.030
and compounded thee poorrogue hereditary.

1796
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:23.530
Hence, be gone!

1797
01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:25.030
If thou hadst not beenborn the worst of men,

1798
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:26.670
thou hadst been a knaveand flatterer.

1799
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.370
Art thou proud yet?

1800
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:30.030
Ay, that I am not thee.

1801
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:32.000
I, that I was no prodigal.

1802
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.400
I, that I am one now.

1803
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:36.830
Were all the wealth I haveshut up in thee,

1804
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.870
I'd give thee leave tohang it.

1805
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:39.870
Get thee gone.

1806
01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.230
That the whole world ofAthens were in this,

1807
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:47.900
thus would I eat it.

1808
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.770
Here; I will mend thyfeast.

1809
01:28:49.770 --> 01:28:51.970
First, mend my company;take away thyself.

1810
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:54.270
So I shall mend mine own,by the lack of thine.

1811
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:56.370
'Tis not well mended so;'tis but botched;

1812
01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:59.700
if 'twere not, I wouldit were.

1813
01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.370
What wouldst thou have toAthens?

1814
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:05.270
Thee thither in awhirlwind.

1815
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:08.770
If thou wilt, tell themthere I have gold.

1816
01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:11.630
Look.

1817
01:29:14.530 --> 01:29:15.870
See?

1818
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:17.200
So I have.

1819
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:21.600
Here is no use for gold.

1820
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.470
The best and truest;

1821
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:26.330
for here it sleeps, anddoes no hired harm.

1822
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:36.200
Where liest at nights,Timon?

1823
01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.200
Under that's above me.

1824
01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.270
Where feedest thou days,Apemantus?

1825
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:43.330
Where my stomach findsmeat;

1826
01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:45.070
or, rather, where Ieat it.

1827
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:47.300
Would poison were obedientand knew my mind.

1828
01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.530
Where wouldst thousend it?

1829
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:49.670
To sauce thy dishes.

1830
01:29:54.130 --> 01:29:56.970
The middle of humanitythou never knewest,

1831
01:29:56.970 --> 01:29:59.930
but the extremity of bothends.

1832
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:02.230
When thou wast in thy giltand thy perfume,

1833
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:05.130
they mocked thee for toomuch curiosity;

1834
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:07.400
in thy rags, thou knowestnone,

1835
01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.530
but art despised for thecontrary.

1836
01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:14.730
There's a medlar for thee;eat it.

1837
01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:16.870
On what I hate I feed not.

1838
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:18.430
Dost hate a medlar?

1839
01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:21.730
Ay, e'en though it looklike thee.

1840
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:24.070
Hadst thou hated medlarssooner,

1841
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:26.200
thou shouldst have lovedthyself better now.

1842
01:30:30.130 --> 01:30:32.030
What man didst thou everknow unthrift

1843
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:35.530
that was beloved after hismeans?

1844
01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.270
Who, without those meansthou speaks of,

1845
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:38.500
didst ever know beloved?

1846
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:39.500
Myself.

1847
01:30:39.500 --> 01:30:40.570
I understand thee;

1848
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:42.370
thou hadst some means tokeep a dog.

1849
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:51.630
What things in the world

1850
01:30:51.630 --> 01:30:57.000
canst thou nearest compareto thy flatterers?

1851
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.800
Women nearest;

1852
01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.130
but men, men are thethings themselves.

1853
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.600
What wouldst thou do withthe world, Apemantus,

1854
01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:12.700
if it lay in your power?

1855
01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.330
Give it the beasts to berid of the men.

1856
01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:20.100
Wouldst thou have thyselffall in the confusion of men

1857
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.630
and live a beast with thebeasts?

1858
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:22.870
Ay, Timon.

1859
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:24.130
A beastly ambition,

1860
01:31:24.130 --> 01:31:28.530
which the gods grant theeto attain to.

1861
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:32.600
Wert thou the lion, thefox would beguile thee;

1862
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.800
wert thou the lamb, thefox would eat thee up.

1863
01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.300
Wert thou the fox, thelion would suspect thee,

1864
01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.100
when peradventure thouwert accused by the ass.

1865
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:46.530
Wert thou the ass, thydullness would torment thee,

1866
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:49.700
and still thou livedst butas a breakfast to the wolf.

1867
01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:53.030
Wert thou the wolf, thygreediness should afflict thee,

1868
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:55.930
and oft thou shouldst hazardthy life for thy dinner.

1869
01:31:55.930 --> 01:32:00.070
Wert thou the unicorn, prideand wrath would confound thee

1870
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.700
and make thine own selfthe conquest of thy fury.

1871
01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.600
Wert thou a bear, thou wouldbe killed by a horse.

1872
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.100
Wert thou a horse, thou wouldstbe seized by a leopard.

1873
01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.800
Wert thou a leopard, thouwert germane to the lion,

1874
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.470
and all the spots of thy kindredwere jurors on thy life.

1875
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:20.370
All thy safety were remotionand thy defence absence.

1876
01:32:20.370 --> 01:32:21.630
What beast couldst thou be

1877
01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:23.970
that were not subject to abeast?

1878
01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:25.570
And what a beast art thoualready

1879
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:27.870
that seest not thy loss intransformation.

1880
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:33.570
If thou couldst please mewith speaking to me,

1881
01:32:33.570 --> 01:32:36.430
thou mightst have hit uponit here.

1882
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:41.070
The commonwealth of Athens isbecome a forest of beasts.

1883
01:32:41.070 --> 01:32:43.570
How has the ass broke the wallthat thou art out of the city?

1884
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:49.600
Yonder comes a poet and apainter.

1885
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.530
The plague of companylight upon thee.

1886
01:32:53.530 --> 01:32:57.030
I will fear to catch itand give way.

1887
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:04.400
When I know not what else todo, I'll see thee again.

1888
01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.300
When there is not elseliving but thee,

1889
01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:08.630
thou shalt be welcome.

1890
01:33:08.630 --> 01:33:11.200
I had rather be a beggar'sdog than Apemantus.

1891
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:15.970
Thou art the cap of allthe fools alive.

1892
01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:17.600
Would thou wert cleanenough to spit upon.

1893
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.670
A plague upon thee.

1894
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:20.230
Thou art too bad to curse.

1895
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.030
All villains that do standby thee are pure.

1896
01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:24.430
There is no leprosy butwhat thou speakest.

1897
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:26.730
If I name thee.

1898
01:33:26.730 --> 01:33:28.670
I'll beat thee, but Ishould infect my hands.

1899
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:30.800
I would my tongue couldrot them off.

1900
01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:34.200
Away, thou issue of amangy dog!

1901
01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.230
Choler does kill me thatthou art still alive;

1902
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:37.230
I swound to see thee.

1903
01:33:37.230 --> 01:33:39.170
Wouldst thou would burst!

1904
01:33:39.170 --> 01:33:41.130
Away, thou tedious rogue!

1905
01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:44.670
I am sorry I shall lose astone by thee.

1906
01:33:44.670 --> 01:33:45.900
Beast!

1907
01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.930
Slave!

1908
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:48.070
Toad!

1909
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:52.930
Rogue, rogue, rogue!

1910
01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:55.870
I am sick of this falseworld

1911
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:59.730
and will love nought but eventhe mere necessities upon it.

1912
01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:04.630
Then, Timon, presentlyprepare thy grave;

1913
01:34:04.630 --> 01:34:07.070
lie where the light foamof the sea

1914
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:09.770
may beat thy grave stonedaily.

1915
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:12.830
Make thine epitaph, thatdeath in me

1916
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:15.300
at other lives may laugh.

1917
01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:20.600
O thou sweet king killer,

1918
01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:24.000
thou dear divorce 'twixtnatural son and sire!

1919
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.200
Thou bright defiler ofHymen's purest bed!

1920
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:30.730
Thou valiant Mars!

1921
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:35.500
Thou ever young, fresh,loved and delicate wooer,

1922
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:37.730
whose blush doth thaw theconsecrated snow

1923
01:34:37.730 --> 01:34:40.270
that lies on Dian's lap!

1924
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:44.800
Thou visible god that solderestclose impossibilities,

1925
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.200
and makest them kiss.

1926
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.130
Thou touch of hearts.

1927
01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:53.200
Think, thy slave manrebels,

1928
01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.830
and by thy virtue set theminto confounding odds,

1929
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:57.670
that beasts may have theworld in empire!

1930
01:34:57.670 --> 01:34:59.970
Would 'twere so!

1931
01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:02.570
But not till I am dead.

1932
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:04.030
I'll say thou hast gold.

1933
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:06.300
Thou wilt be thronged toshortly.

1934
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:09.770
Get back, I prithee!

1935
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:12.830
Live, and love thy misery.

1936
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:16.230
Long live so, and so die.

1937
01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:21.400
I am quit.

1938
01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:23.900
More things like men!

1939
01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:28.030
Eat, Timon, and abhorthem.

1940
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:39.170
Where should he have thisgold?

1941
01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:40.230
It is some poor fragment,

1942
01:35:40.230 --> 01:35:41.670
some slender sort of hisremainder.

1943
01:35:41.670 --> 01:35:42.700
The mere want of gold,

1944
01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:43.770
and the falling-from ofhis friends,

1945
01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:45.270
drove him into thismelancholy.

1946
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:47.130
It is noised he hath amass of treasure.

1947
01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:48.500
Let us make the assayupon him.

1948
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:51.170
If he care not for it, hewill supply us easily;

1949
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:54.770
if he covetously reserveit, how shall us get it?

1950
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:57.200
True; for he bears it notabout him.

1951
01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.070
It's hid.

1952
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:01.730
Is not that he?

1953
01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:02.730
Where?

1954
01:36:02.730 --> 01:36:04.430
It is his description.

1955
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:06.200
What, he?

1956
01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:09.030
I know him.

1957
01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.930
Save thee, Timon.

1958
01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:20.270
Now, thieves?

1959
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:22.830
Soldiers, not thieves.

1960
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:24.470
Both too;

1961
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:25.800
and women's sons.

1962
01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.930
We are not thieves; we aremen that much do want.

1963
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:33.600
Your greatest want is, youwant much meat.

1964
01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.200
Why should you want?

1965
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.570
Behold, the earth hathroots;

1966
01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:43.570
within this mile breakforth a hundred springs;

1967
01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:49.930
the oaks bear mast, thebriers scarlet hips;

1968
01:36:49.930 --> 01:36:52.200
the bounteous housewife,nature,

1969
01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.230
on each bush lays her fullmess before you.

1970
01:36:55.230 --> 01:36:57.030
Want!

1971
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:58.300
Why want?

1972
01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.030
We cannot live on grass,berries, water,

1973
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:04.870
as beasts, birds, andfishes.

1974
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:09.130
Nor on the beasts themselves,the birds, and fishes;

1975
01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:13.370
you must eat men.

1976
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:17.830
Yet thanks I must you con thatyou are thieves professed,

1977
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:20.800
that you work not inholier shapes.

1978
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.570
For there is boundless theftin limited professions.

1979
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:31.270
Rascal thieves, here'sgold.

1980
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:35.800
Go, suck the subtle bloodof the grape,

1981
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.200
till the high fever seetheyour blood to froth,

1982
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:40.630
and so 'scape hanging.

1983
01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:43.130
Trust not the physician;

1984
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:45.970
his antidotes are poison;

1985
01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:49.270
he slays more than yourob.

1986
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:52.730
Take wealth and livestogether;

1987
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:58.700
do villainy, do, since youprotest to do it, like workmen.

1988
01:37:58.700 --> 01:38:02.630
I'll example you withthievery.

1989
01:38:02.630 --> 01:38:06.130
The sun's a thief, and,with his great attraction,

1990
01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.870
robs the vast sea.

1991
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:11.430
The moon's an arrant thief

1992
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:15.770
whose pale fire issnatched from the sun.

1993
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:18.370
The sea's a thief, whoseliquid surge

1994
01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:22.130
resolves the moon intosalt tears.

1995
01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:25.400
The earth's a thief thatfeeds and breeds

1996
01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:29.600
from the composture stolenfrom general excrement.

1997
01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:32.130
Each thing's a thief.

1998
01:38:32.130 --> 01:38:35.570
The laws, your curb andwhip, in their rough power,

1999
01:38:35.570 --> 01:38:38.530
has unchecked theft.

2000
01:38:38.530 --> 01:38:40.830
Love not yourselves.

2001
01:38:40.830 --> 01:38:42.070
Rob one another.

2002
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.100
There's more gold.

2003
01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:48.830
Cut throats.

2004
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:50.570
All that you meet arethieves.

2005
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:53.100
To Athens go, break openshops;

2006
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:56.570
nothing can you steal, butthieves do lose it.

2007
01:38:56.570 --> 01:38:59.100
Steal not less for this Igive you;

2008
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.970
and gold confound youhowsoe'er.

2009
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.430
Amen.

2010
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:06.400
Has almost charmed me frommy profession

2011
01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:07.770
by persuading me to it.

2012
01:39:07.770 --> 01:39:10.000
It is in the malice of mankindthat he thus advises us;

2013
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.170
not to have us thrive inour mystery.

2014
01:39:12.170 --> 01:39:14.570
I'll believe him as an enemyand give over my trade.

2015
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:17.070
Let us first see peace inAthens.

2016
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:22.500
There is no time so miserablea man may be true.

2017
01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:23.670
True.

2018
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:48.070
O you gods.

2019
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:52.830
Is yond despised andruinous man my lord?

2020
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:56.400
Full of decay and failing?

2021
01:39:56.400 --> 01:40:01.200
O monument and wonder ofgood deeds evilly disposed.

2022
01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.070
What an alteration of honorhas desperate want made.

2023
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:06.930
What viler thing upon theearth than friends

2024
01:40:06.930 --> 01:40:10.530
who can bring noblestminds to basest ends.

2025
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:12.400
How rarely does it meetwith this time's guise,

2026
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.470
when man was wished tolove his enemies.

2027
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:17.070
Grant I may ever love, andrather woo

2028
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:20.600
those who would mischiefme than those that do.

2029
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.370
Has caught me in his eye.

2030
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:25.370
I will present my honestgrief unto him;

2031
01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:30.130
and, as my lord, stillserve him with my life.

2032
01:40:30.130 --> 01:40:32.370
My dearest master.

2033
01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:35.070
Away.

2034
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:36.830
What art thou?

2035
01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:39.530
Have you forgot me, sir?

2036
01:40:39.530 --> 01:40:41.370
I have forgot all men;

2037
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:44.170
then, if thou grantestthou art a man,

2038
01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:45.900
I have forgot thee.

2039
01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:48.830
An honest poor servant ofyours.

2040
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:51.500
Then I know thee not.

2041
01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:54.330
I never had honest menabout me, I

2042
01:40:54.330 --> 01:40:57.600
all I kept were knaves, toserve in meat to villains.

2043
01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.830
The gods are witness,

2044
01:40:58.830 --> 01:41:00.600
ne'er did poor stewardwear a truer grief

2045
01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.870
for his undone lord thanmine eyes for you.

2046
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:07.130
Why dost thou weep?

2047
01:41:07.130 --> 01:41:08.170
Come nearer.

2048
01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:15.170
Then I love thee, becausethou art a woman

2049
01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:18.830
and disclaimest flintymankind,

2050
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:24.870
whose eyes do never give butthorough lust and laughter.

2051
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:28.070
Pity's sleeping.

2052
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:30.100
Strange times that weepwith laughing,

2053
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:31.500
not with weeping.

2054
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:33.100
I beg of you to know me,good my lord,

2055
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:34.170
to accept my grief,

2056
01:41:34.170 --> 01:41:35.830
and whilst this poorwealth lasts,

2057
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:38.900
to entertain me as yoursteward still.

2058
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:46.330
Had I a steward so true,so just,

2059
01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:49.970
and now so comfortable?

2060
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:56.530
It almost turns mydangerous nature mild.

2061
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:58.000
Let me behold thy face.

2062
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.000
Surely, this man was bornof woman.

2063
01:42:15.130 --> 01:42:18.200
Forgive my general andexceptless rashness,

2064
01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.370
you perpetual-sober gods.

2065
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:26.400
I do proclaim one honestman

2066
01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.370
mistake me not

2067
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:33.400
but one; no more, I pray,

2068
01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:34.870
and he's a steward.

2069
01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:46.430
How fain I would havehated all mankind.

2070
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:50.370
But thou redeemestthyself.

2071
01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:55.000
But all, save thee, I fellwith curses.

2072
01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:03.200
Methinks thou art morehonest now than wise;

2073
01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.200
for, by oppressing andbetraying me,

2074
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.500
thou mightst sooner gotanother service.

2075
01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:11.430
For many so arrive atsecond masters,

2076
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:16.730
upon their first lord'sneck.

2077
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:19.830
But tell me true

2078
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:24.630
for I must ever doubt,though ne'er so sure

2079
01:43:24.630 --> 01:43:33.500
is not thy kindnesssubtle, covetous, and

2080
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:35.970
and, as rich men dealgifts,

2081
01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:37.870
expecting in return twentyfor one?

2082
01:43:37.870 --> 01:43:39.830
No, no, my most worthymaster;

2083
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:41.670
in whose breast doubt andsuspect, alas,

2084
01:43:41.670 --> 01:43:43.130
are placed too late.

2085
01:43:43.130 --> 01:43:45.500
You should have feared falsetimes when you did feast.

2086
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:48.800
Suspect still comes wherean estate is least.

2087
01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.200
That which I show, heavenknows,

2088
01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:52.730
is merely love, duty and zealto your unmatched mind,

2089
01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:54.300
care of your food andliving;

2090
01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:55.830
and, believe it, my mosthonored lord,

2091
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:57.370
for any benefit that comesto me,

2092
01:43:57.370 --> 01:44:00.830
either in hope or present, I'dexchange for this one wish,

2093
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:03.000
that you had power andwealth to requite me

2094
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.300
by making rich yourself.

2095
01:44:05.300 --> 01:44:10.230
Why, look thee, 'tis so.

2096
01:44:10.230 --> 01:44:12.970
Thou singly honest man,

2097
01:44:12.970 --> 01:44:17.400
the gods out of my miseryhave sent thee treasure.

2098
01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:21.630
Go, live rich and happy;

2099
01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:24.770
but thus conditioned:

2100
01:44:24.770 --> 01:44:27.530
thou shalt build from men;

2101
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:32.230
hate all, curse all, showcharity to none,

2102
01:44:32.230 --> 01:44:34.430
but let the famished fleshslide from the bone,

2103
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:35.900
ere thou relieve thebeggar;

2104
01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:38.830
give to dogs what thoudeniest to men;

2105
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:44.370
let prisons swallow 'em up,debts wither 'em to nothing;

2106
01:44:44.370 --> 01:44:46.630
be men like blasted woods,

2107
01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:49.030
and diseases lick theirfalse bloods.

2108
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:51.300
So, so farewell and thrive.

2109
01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:53.130
Oh, let me stay andcomfort you, my master.

2110
01:44:53.130 --> 01:44:57.530
Fly, whilst thou art blestand free!

2111
01:44:57.530 --> 01:45:01.100
Ne'er see thou man, andlet me ne'er see thee.

2112
01:45:23.370 --> 01:45:24.630
As I took note of theplace,

2113
01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:27.130
it cannot be far where heabides.

2114
01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:28.900
What's to be thought ofhim?

2115
01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.400
Does the rumour hold for truethat he's so full of gold?

2116
01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.600
Certain.

2117
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:34.670
Alcibiades reports it;

2118
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.500
Phrynia and Timandra hadgold of him.

2119
01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:38.870
He likewise enriched poorstraggling soldiers

2120
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:40.070
with great quantity.

2121
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:41.070
Then this breaking of his

2122
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:43.500
has been but a try for hisfriends.

2123
01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:44.630
Nothing else.

2124
01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:46.070
You shall see him a palmin Athens again

2125
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:47.530
and flourish with thehighest.

2126
01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:50.230
Therefore 'tis not amisswe tender our love to him

2127
01:45:50.230 --> 01:45:52.630
in this supposed distressof his.

2128
01:45:52.630 --> 01:45:54.270
It will show honestly inus

2129
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:55.570
and is very likely to loadour purposes

2130
01:45:55.570 --> 01:45:56.830
with what they travailfor,

2131
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:59.330
if it be a just and true reportthat goes of his having.

2132
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:03.470
What have you now topresent unto him?

2133
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:06.000
Nothing at this time butmy visitation.

2134
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.070
Only I will promise him amost excellent piece.

2135
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:10.830
I must serve him so too,

2136
01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:14.670
tell him of an intentthat's coming towards him.

2137
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:15.870
Good as the best.

2138
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:17.930
Promising is the very airof the time.

2139
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:20.630
It opens the eyes ofexpectation.

2140
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:22.630
Performance is ever theduller for his act;

2141
01:46:22.630 --> 01:46:24.830
and, but in the plainer andsimpler kind of people,

2142
01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:27.600
the deed of saying isquite out of use.

2143
01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:30.970
To promise is most courtlyand fashionable.

2144
01:46:30.970 --> 01:46:34.400
Performance is a kind ofwill or testament

2145
01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:37.370
that argues a great sickness inhis judgment that makes it.

2146
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:41.970
I am thinking what I shall saythat I have provided for him,

2147
01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:43.970
it must be a personatingof himself,

2148
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:47.700
a satire against thesoftness of prosperity,

2149
01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.800
with a discovery of theinfinite flatteries

2150
01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.530
that follow youth andopulency.

2151
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.230
Nay, let's seek him.

2152
01:46:54.230 --> 01:46:56.870
Then do we sin against ourown estate,

2153
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:59.870
when we may profit meetand come too late.

2154
01:46:59.870 --> 01:47:01.270
True;

2155
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:03.870
when the day serves, beforeblack-cornered night,

2156
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:06.600
find what thou wantest byfree and offered light.

2157
01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.800
Come.

2158
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:24.870
Hail, worthy Timon!

2159
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:26.900
Our late noble master.

2160
01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:32.400
Have I once lived to seetwo honest men?

2161
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:37.370
Sir, having often of youropen bounty tasted,

2162
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:41.100
hearing you were retired,

2163
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:43.770
your friends fallen off,whose thankless natures

2164
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:45.270
O abhorred spirits

2165
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:47.330
Not all the whips ofheaven are large enough.

2166
01:47:47.330 --> 01:47:48.330
What!

2167
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:51.900
to you, whose star-likenobleness

2168
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:54.930
gave life and influence totheir whole being.

2169
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:58.200
I am rapt and cannot coverthe monstrous bulk

2170
01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.170
of this ingratitude withany size of words.

2171
01:48:01.170 --> 01:48:04.930
Let it go naked; men maysee it the better.

2172
01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:07.730
You that are honest, bybeing what you are,

2173
01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:10.030
make it best seen andknown.

2174
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:13.570
He and myself havetravailed in the great

2175
01:48:13.570 --> 01:48:14.570
and sweetly felt it.

2176
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:16.530
Ay, you are honest men.

2177
01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:20.030
We are hither come tooffer you our service.

2178
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:23.370
Most honest men.

2179
01:48:23.370 --> 01:48:25.200
How shall I requite you?

2180
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.900
Can you eat root and drinkcold water?

2181
01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.000
No?

2182
01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.100
What we can do, we'll do,to do you service.

2183
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.800
You're honest men.

2184
01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:57.570
You've heard that I havegold?

2185
01:48:59.030 --> 01:49:00.900
I am sure you have.

2186
01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:01.900
Speak truth;

2187
01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.600
you're honest men.

2188
01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.370
So it is said, my noblelord;

2189
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:07.070
but therefore came not myfriend nor I.

2190
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:13.070
Ay, good honest men.

2191
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:17.470
Thou drawest the bestcounterfeit in all Athens.

2192
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:19.130
Indeed, thou art the best;

2193
01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:22.330
Thou counterfeitest mostlively.

2194
01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:23.570
So, so, my lord.

2195
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:26.530
Even so, sir, as I say.

2196
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:29.570
And, for thy fiction, why,

2197
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:35.130
thy verse swells withstuff so fine and smooth,

2198
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:38.370
thou art even natural inthine own art.

2199
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:42.370
But, for all this, myhonest-natured friends,

2200
01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:45.870
I must needs say you havea little fault.

2201
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.030
Marry, 'tis not monstrousin you,

2202
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:50.830
neither wish I you takemuch pains to mend.

2203
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:53.530
Beseech Your Honor; makeit known to us.

2204
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:57.500
You'll take it ill.

2205
01:49:57.500 --> 01:49:58.730
Most thankfully, my lord.

2206
01:49:58.730 --> 01:49:59.930
Will you, indeed?

2207
01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:02.170
Doubt it not, worthy lord.

2208
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:09.930
There's never a one of youthat trusts a knave,

2209
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:13.270
but mightily deceives you.

2210
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:14.470
Do we, my lord?

2211
01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:20.600
Ay, and you hear him cog,see him dissemble,

2212
01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.430
know his gross patchery,

2213
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:27.800
love him, feed him, keepin your bosom.

2214
01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.030
Yet remain assured, he's amade-up villain.

2215
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:34.100
I know none such, my lord.

2216
01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.200
Nor I.

2217
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.070
Look you, I love you well;

2218
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:38.870
I'll give you gold;

2219
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:41.970
rid me these villains fromyour companies.

2220
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:45.870
Hang them, stab them,drown them in a draught,

2221
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:47.100
confound them by somecourse,

2222
01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:49.400
come to me; I'll give yougold enough.

2223
01:50:49.400 --> 01:50:51.630
Name them, my lord; let'sknow them.

2224
01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:55.400
You that way and you this,

2225
01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:58.400
each man apart, but two incompany,

2226
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.200
all single and alone,

2227
01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.200
yet an arch-villain keepshim company.

2228
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:17.370
If where thou art twovillains shall not be,

2229
01:51:17.370 --> 01:51:18.570
come not near him.

2230
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:27.700
If thou would not residebut where one villain is,

2231
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:29.600
then him abandon.

2232
01:51:39.370 --> 01:51:43.470
Hence, pack!

2233
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:45.200
You came for gold, youslaves.

2234
01:51:47.130 --> 01:51:48.900
There's gold.

2235
01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.970
You've worked for me;

2236
01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.370
there's payment!

2237
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:53.630
You're an alchemist;

2238
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:55.430
make gold of that.

2239
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:58.100
Out, rascal dogs!

2240
01:52:12.570 --> 01:52:14.730
It is vain that you wouldspeak with Timon;

2241
01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:16.830
for he is set so only tohimself

2242
01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.700
that nothing but himselfwhich looks like man

2243
01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:19.730
is friendly with him.

2244
01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:21.000
Bring us to him.

2245
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.430
It is our part and promiseto the Athenians

2246
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:23.830
to speak with Timon.

2247
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:25.900
At all times, alike menare not still the same.

2248
01:52:25.900 --> 01:52:27.930
'Twas time and griefs thatframed him thus.

2249
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:31.570
Time, with his fairer hand,offering the fortunes

2250
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:33.730
of his former days,

2251
01:52:33.730 --> 01:52:35.470
the former man may makehim.

2252
01:52:35.470 --> 01:52:37.370
Bring us to him, andchance it as it may.

2253
01:52:47.770 --> 01:52:49.600
Lord Timon.

2254
01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:50.730
Timon.

2255
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.200
Look out, and speak tofriends.

2256
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:57.600
The Athenians, by two oftheir most reverend senate,

2257
01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.330
greet thee.

2258
01:52:59.330 --> 01:53:00.800
Speak to them, nobleTimon.

2259
01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:07.300
Thou sun, that comforts,burn.

2260
01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:10.700
Speak, and be hanged.

2261
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:16.670
For each true word, ablister,

2262
01:53:16.670 --> 01:53:20.030
and each false be as acauterizing

2263
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:22.600
to the root o' the tongue,

2264
01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.670
consuming it withspeaking.

2265
01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:37.200
Worthy Timon

2266
01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:42.130
Of none but such as youand you of Timon.

2267
01:53:42.130 --> 01:53:46.200
The senators of Athensgreet thee, Timon.

2268
01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.670
I thank them

2269
01:53:48.670 --> 01:53:50.470
and would send them backthe plague,

2270
01:53:50.470 --> 01:53:52.700
could I but catch it forthem.

2271
01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:56.300
Oh, forget what we are sorryfor ourselves in thee.

2272
01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.630
The senators with oneconsent of love

2273
01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:00.830
entreat thee back toAthens;

2274
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:02.800
who have thought onspecial dignities,

2275
01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:05.900
which vacant lie for thybest use and wearing.

2276
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:07.130
They confess towards thee

2277
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:10.770
forgetfulness too general,gross.

2278
01:54:10.770 --> 01:54:12.570
You witch me in it;

2279
01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:20.600
surprise me to the verybrink of tears.

2280
01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:22.830
Lend me a fool's heart anda woman's eyes,

2281
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:27.030
and I'll beweep thesecomforts, worthy senators.

2282
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:30.170
Therefore, so please theeto return with us

2283
01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:33.100
and of our Athens, thineand ours,

2284
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:37.200
to take the captainship, thoushalt be met with thanks,

2285
01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.530
allowed with absolutepower

2286
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:42.230
and thy good name livewith authority.

2287
01:54:42.230 --> 01:54:45.370
So soon we shall drive back ofAlcibiades the approaches wild,

2288
01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:47.700
who, like a boar toosavage,

2289
01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.700
doth root up his country'speace.

2290
01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:52.670
And shakes his threatening swordagainst the walls of Athens.

2291
01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:53.730
Therefore, Timon

2292
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:59.400
Therefore, I will, sir;

2293
01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.500
therefore, I will, sir;thus.

2294
01:55:05.470 --> 01:55:09.870
If Alcibiades kill mycountrymen,

2295
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:14.570
let Alcibiades know thisof Timon:

2296
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:18.030
that Timon cares not.

2297
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:22.430
But if he sack fair Athens

2298
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:26.430
and take our goodly agedmen by the beards,

2299
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:28.870
giving our holy virgins tothe stain

2300
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:33.270
of contumelious, beastly,mad-brained war,

2301
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:37.530
then let him know, andtell him Timon speaks it.

2302
01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:39.530
In pity of our aged andour youth,

2303
01:55:39.530 --> 01:55:43.900
I cannot choose but tellhim

2304
01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:49.770
that I care not and lethim take it at worst;

2305
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:50.970
for their knives care not,

2306
01:55:50.970 --> 01:55:55.430
while you have throats toanswer.

2307
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:59.830
For myself, there's not awhittle in the unruly camp

2308
01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:01.430
but I do prize it at mylove

2309
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:05.530
before the reverendestthroat in Athens.

2310
01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:10.300
So I leave you to theprotection of the gods,

2311
01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.300
as thieves to keepers.

2312
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:15.070
Stay not; all's in vain.

2313
01:56:15.070 --> 01:56:20.030
Why, I was writing of myepitaph.

2314
01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:26.330
It will be seen tomorrow.

2315
01:56:26.330 --> 01:56:31.700
My long sickness of health andliving now begins to mend,

2316
01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:35.170
and nothing brings me allthings.

2317
01:56:36.970 --> 01:56:40.370
Go; live still;

2318
01:56:40.370 --> 01:56:44.600
be Alcibiades your plague,you his,

2319
01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:45.830
and live so long enough.

2320
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:48.270
We speak in vain.

2321
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:54.700
But yet I love my countryand am not one

2322
01:56:54.700 --> 01:56:56.330
that rejoices in thecommon wreck,

2323
01:56:56.330 --> 01:56:57.930
as common bruit dothput it.

2324
01:56:57.930 --> 01:56:59.630
That's well spoke.

2325
01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:03.000
Commend me to my lovingcountrymen

2326
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.300
These words become your lipsas they pass through them.

2327
01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:07.400
And enter in our ears likegreat triumphers

2328
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.600
in their applauding gates.

2329
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.830
Commend me to them,

2330
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:17.170
and tell them that, toease them of their griefs,

2331
01:57:17.170 --> 01:57:22.770
their fears of hostilestrokes, their aches, losses,

2332
01:57:22.770 --> 01:57:26.200
their pangs of love, withother incident throes

2333
01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.370
that nature's fragilevessel doth sustain

2334
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:30.770
in life's uncertainvoyage,

2335
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:34.330
I will some kindness dothem.

2336
01:57:34.330 --> 01:57:38.230
I'll teach them to preventwild Alcibiades' wrath.

2337
01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:39.330
I like this well;

2338
01:57:39.330 --> 01:57:41.330
he will return again.

2339
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:47.200
I have a tree which growshere in my close

2340
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:51.330
that mine own use invitesme to cut down.

2341
01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:54.900
Shortly must I fell it.

2342
01:57:54.900 --> 01:58:00.770
Tell my friends, tell Athens,in sequence of degree

2343
01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:03.070
from high to lowthroughout,

2344
01:58:03.070 --> 01:58:06.630
that whoso please to stopaffliction,

2345
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:10.900
let him take his haste,come hither,

2346
01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:14.630
ere my tree hath felt theaxe,

2347
01:58:14.630 --> 01:58:16.230
and hang himself.

2348
01:58:17.730 --> 01:58:20.030
I pray you, do mygreeting.

2349
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:21.300
Trouble him no further;

2350
01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:23.670
thus you still shall findhim.

2351
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:26.730
Come not to me again,

2352
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:29.830
but say to Athens,

2353
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:32.970
Timon hath made hiseverlasting mansion

2354
01:58:32.970 --> 01:58:36.470
upon the beached verge ofthe salt flood;

2355
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:40.400
who, once a day, with hisembossed froth,

2356
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:44.070
the turbulent surge shallcover.

2357
01:58:44.070 --> 01:58:48.670
Thither come; let mygravestone be your oracle.

2358
01:58:52.230 --> 01:59:01.730
Lips, let four words go byand language end.

2359
01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:08.700
What is amiss plague andinfection mend.

2360
01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:13.200
Graves only be men'sworks, death their gain.

2361
01:59:16.470 --> 01:59:20.300
Sun, hide thy beams.

2362
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:25.270
Timon hath done his reign.

2363
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:36.630
His discontents are unremovablycoupled to nature.

2364
01:59:36.630 --> 01:59:38.800
Our hope in him is dead.

2365
01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:40.100
Let us return and strain

2366
01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.770
what other means are leftto us in our dear peril.

2367
01:59:43.770 --> 01:59:45.670
It requires swift foot.

2368
01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:47.330
The enemy's drum is heard,

2369
01:59:47.330 --> 01:59:51.200
and fearful scouring dothchoke the air with dust.

2370
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.830
On and prepare.

2371
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:55.200
Ours is the fall, I fear,

2372
01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.830
our foes the snare.

2373
02:00:30.570 --> 02:00:31.900
Till now you have gone on

2374
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:34.000
and filled the time withall licentious measure,

2375
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.800
making your wills thescope of justice;

2376
02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:42.330
till now, myself and such

2377
02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:44.670
as slept within the shadowof your power,

2378
02:00:44.670 --> 02:00:47.200
have wandered with ourtraversed arms,

2379
02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:52.570
and breathed oursufferance vainly.

2380
02:00:52.570 --> 02:00:59.830
Now the time is flush,

2381
02:00:59.830 --> 02:01:02.030
when crouching marrow inthe bearer

2382
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:06.330
strong cries of itself,"No more."

2383
02:01:06.330 --> 02:01:09.200
Now breathless wrong shallsit and pant

2384
02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:13.000
in your great chairs ofease,

2385
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:16.300
and pursy insolence shallbreak his wind

2386
02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:22.200
with fear and horridflight.

2387
02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:27.330
Noble and young, when thy firstgriefs were but a mere conceit,

2388
02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:29.970
ere thou hadst power or wehad cause of fear,

2389
02:01:29.970 --> 02:01:32.600
we sent to thee to givethy rages balm,

2390
02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.730
to wipe out our ingratitude withloves above their quantity.

2391
02:01:36.730 --> 02:01:39.730
So did we woo transformedTimon to our city's love

2392
02:01:39.730 --> 02:01:41.700
by humble message and bypromised means.

2393
02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:43.100
We were not all unkind,

2394
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:46.630
nor all deserve the commonstroke of war.

2395
02:01:46.630 --> 02:01:50.170
These walls of ours werenot erected by their hands

2396
02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:51.730
from whom you havereceived your griefs;

2397
02:01:51.730 --> 02:01:54.200
nor are they such thatthese great towers,

2398
02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:58.670
trophies, and schools shouldfall for private faults inthem.

2399
02:01:58.670 --> 02:02:01.800
Nor are they living thatwere the motives thatyou first went out;

2400
02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.770
shame that they wantedcunning,

2401
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:06.970
in excess hath broke theirhearts.

2402
02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:10.130
March, noble lord, into ourcity with thy banners spread.

2403
02:02:10.130 --> 02:02:13.170
By decimation, and atithed death

2404
02:02:13.170 --> 02:02:16.970
if thy revenges hunger for thatfood which nature loathes

2405
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:18.730
take thou the destinedtenth,

2406
02:02:18.730 --> 02:02:24.070
and by the hazard of the spotteddie, let die the spotted.

2407
02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:26.400
All have not offended;

2408
02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:27.770
for those that were,

2409
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:30.900
it is not square to takeon those that are revenge.

2410
02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:34.670
Crimes, like lands, arenot inherited.

2411
02:02:34.670 --> 02:02:37.030
Then, dear countryman,bring in thy ranks,

2412
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:39.130
but leave without thyrage.

2413
02:02:39.130 --> 02:02:41.300
Spare thy Athenian cradleand those kin

2414
02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.830
which in the bluster ofthy wrath

2415
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:47.000
must fall with those thathave offended.

2416
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.470
Like a shepherd, approachthe fold,

2417
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:53.370
and cull the infected forth,but kill not all together.

2418
02:02:53.370 --> 02:02:56.130
What thou wilt, thou rathershalt enforce it with thy smile

2419
02:02:56.130 --> 02:02:58.130
than hew to it with thysword.

2420
02:02:58.130 --> 02:03:00.130
Set but thy foot againstour rampired gates,

2421
02:03:00.130 --> 02:03:01.430
and they shall ope;

2422
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:03.530
so thou wilt send thygentle heart before,

2423
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:06.370
to say thou'lt enterfriendly.

2424
02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:10.230
Throw thy glove, or anytoken of thine honor else,

2425
02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:12.670
that thou wilt use thesewars as thy redress

2426
02:03:12.670 --> 02:03:14.670
and not as our confusion,

2427
02:03:14.670 --> 02:03:18.170
all thy powers shall maketheir harbor in our town,

2428
02:03:18.170 --> 02:03:20.500
till we have sealed thyfull desires.

2429
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:33.470
Then there's my glove.

2430
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:35.800
Those enemies of Timon'sand mine own

2431
02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:41.770
whom you yourselves shallset out for reproof fall

2432
02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:44.630
and no more.

2433
02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:47.900
And to atone your fears withmy more noble meaning,

2434
02:03:47.900 --> 02:03:49.470
not a man shall pass hisquarter

2435
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:54.300
or offend the stream of regularjustice in your city's bounds,

2436
02:03:54.300 --> 02:03:58.270
but shall be rendered to yourpublic laws at heaviest answer.

2437
02:03:58.270 --> 02:04:02.270
'Tis most nobly spoken.

2438
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:06.130
My noble general, Timon isdead;

2439
02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:08.170
entombed upon the very hemof the sea;

2440
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:10.000
and on his grave-stonethis insculpture,

2441
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.200
which with wax I broughtaway,

2442
02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:18.030
whose soft impression interpretsfor my poor ignorance.

2443
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:24.470
"Here lies a wretched corse,wretched soul bereft.

2444
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:27.330
"Seek not my name.

2445
02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:30.230
"A plague consume youwicked caitiffs left.

2446
02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:34.930
"Here lie I, Timon,

2447
02:04:34.930 --> 02:04:38.670
"who, alive, all livingmen did hate.

2448
02:04:38.670 --> 02:04:42.100
"Pass by and curse thyfill,

2449
02:04:42.100 --> 02:04:46.370
but pass and stay not herethy gait."

2450
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:54.930
These well express in theethy latter spirits.

2451
02:04:54.930 --> 02:04:58.230
Though thou abhorredst inus our human griefs,

2452
02:04:58.230 --> 02:05:01.670
scornedst our brain's flowand those our droplets

2453
02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:04.830
which from niggard naturefall,

2454
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:09.700
yet rich conceit taught theeto make vast Neptune weep

2455
02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:14.830
for aye on thy low grave,on faults forgiven.

2456
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.370
Dead is noble Timon

2457
02:05:26.370 --> 02:05:31.030
of whose memory hereaftermore.

2458
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:32.430
Bring me into your city,

2459
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:37.930
and I will use the olivewith my sword,

2460
02:05:37.930 --> 02:05:44.700
make war breed peace, makepeace stint war,

2461
02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:51.770
make each prescribe to otheras each other's leech.

2462
02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:56.800
