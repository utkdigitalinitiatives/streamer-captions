00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000


2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.630
Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.330
Welcomed and settled to his own desire.

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.100
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.900
Unto Diana there a votaress.

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.070
Now to Marina bend your mind,

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.330
Whom our fast-growing scene must find

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.930
At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.330
In music, letters; who hath gain'd

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
Of education all the grace,

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.700
Which makes her both the heart and place of general wonder.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.130
But, alack, That monster envy, oft the wrack

13
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.400
Of earned praise, Marina's life

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.800
And in this kind our Cleon hath one daughter,

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
and a wench full grown,

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.200
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid hight Philoten:

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.430
and it is said for certain in our story,

19
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.930
she would ever with Marina be:

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk

21
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.670
With fingers long, small, white as milk;

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570
Or when she would with sharp needle wound

23
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.100
The cambric, which she made more sound

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.600
By hurting it; or when to the lute

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.300
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.100
That still records with moan;

27
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.230
or when She would with rich and constant pen

28
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.630
Vail to her mistress Dian;

29
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.100
Still, this Philoten contends in skill

30
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.130
With absolute Marina:

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.800
so with the dove of Paphos might the crow

32
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.870
Vie feathers white. Marina gets all praises,

33
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.230
which are paid as debts,

34
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.370
And not as given. This so darks

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.900
In Philoten all graceful marks,

36
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.430
That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,

37
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.600
A present murderer does prepare for good Marina,

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.670
that her daughter might stand peerless by this slaughter.

39
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.700
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,

40
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.870
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:

41
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.130
And cursed Dionyza hath

42
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.900
The pregnant instrument of wrath prest for this blow.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.270
The unborn event

44
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.070
I do commend to your content:

45
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.670
Only I carry winged time

46
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.500
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;

47
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Which never could I so convey,

48
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.670
Unless your thoughts went on my way.

49
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.970
Dionyza does appear,

50
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.670
With Leonine, a murderer.

51
00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.630
Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:

52
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.370
'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.

53
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.530
Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,

54
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.670
To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,

55
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.070
Which is but cold, nor flaming love thy bosom enslaved

56
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.100
too nicely; nor let pity,

57
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.870
which even women have cast off, melt thee,

58
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.270
but be a soldier to thy purpose.

59
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:30.930
I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.

60
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.700
The fitter, then, the gods should have her.

61
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.270
Here she comes weeping for her only nurses' death.

62
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.830
Thou art resolved?

63
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.200
I am resolved.

64
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.100
No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,

65
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.170
To strew thy green with flowers:

66
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.270
the yellows, blues, the purple violets, and marigolds,

67
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.170
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,

68
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:23.670
While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,

69
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.970
Born in a tempest, when my mother died,

70
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.730
This world to me is like a lasting storm,

71
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.970
Whirring me from my friends.

72
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.330
How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?

73
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.370
How chance my daughter is not with you?

74
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.030
Do not consume your blood with sorrowing:

75
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.670
What, have you a nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed

76
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.630
With this unprofitable woe!

77
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.370
Come, give me your flowers, On the sea march'nt.

78
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.400
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,

79
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.870
And it pierces and sharpens the stomach.

80
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.630
Come Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.

81
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.730
No, I pray you;

82
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.600
I'll not bereave you of your servant.

83
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.370
Come, come;

84
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.600
I love the king your father, and yourself,

85
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.230
With more than foreign heart. We every day

86
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.330
Expect him here: when he shall come and see

87
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.870
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,

88
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.770
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;

89
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.030
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken

90
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.570
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,

91
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.470
Walk, and be cheerful once again;

92
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.570
reserve that excellent complexion, which did steal

93
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.600
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me

94
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.670
I can go home alone.

95
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.830
Well, I will go;

96
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.570
But yet I have no desire to it.

97
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.830
Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.

98
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.170
Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:

99
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.830
Remember what I have said.

100
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.370
I warrant you, madam.

101
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.800
I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:

102
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.730
Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:

103
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.900
What! I must have care of you.

104
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.200
My thanks, sweet madam.

105
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.200
Is this wind westerly that blows?

106
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.330
South-west.

107
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.830
When I was born, the wind was north.

108
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.200
Was't so?

109
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.370
My father, as nurse said, did never fear,

110
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.000
But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling

111
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.200
His kingly hands, haling ropes;

112
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.130
And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea

113
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.400
That almost burst the deck.

114
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.130
When was this?

115
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.530
When I was born:

116
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.900
Never was wind nor waves more violent;

117
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.900
And from the ladder-tackle washes off a canvas-climber.

118
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.730
'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'

119
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.400
And with a dropping industry they skip

120
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.130
From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles,

121
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.700
and the master calls, and trebles their confusion.

122
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.770
Come, say your prayers.

123
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.400
What mean you?

124
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.330
If you require a little space for prayer,

125
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.200
I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,

126
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.800
For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn

127
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.570
To do my work with haste.

128
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.430
Why will you kill me?

129
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.900
To satisfy my lady.

130
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.170
Why would she have me kill'd?

131
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.700
Now, as I can remember, by my troth,

132
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.170
I never did her hurt in all my life:

133
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.230
I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn

134
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.570
To any living creature: believe me, la,

135
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.500
I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:

136
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.970
I trod upon a worm against my will,

137
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.330
But I wept for it. How have I offended,

138
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.930
Wherein my death might yield her any profit,

139
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.300
Or my life imply her any danger?

140
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.400
My commission Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.

141
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.830
You will not do't for all the world, I hope.

142
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.700
You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow

143
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.700
You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,

144
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.030
When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:

145
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.330
Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:

146
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.530
Your lady seeks my life; come you between,

147
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.270
And save poor me, the weaker.

148
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.970
I am sworn,

149
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.830
And will dispatch.

150
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.770
Hold, villain!

151
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.800
A prize! a prize!

152
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.570
Half-part, mates, half-part.

153
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.100
Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.

154
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.700
These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;

155
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.770
And they have seized Marina. Let her go:

156
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.100
There's no hope she will return.

157
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.070
I'll swear she's dead,

158
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.700
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:

159
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.970
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,

160
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.170
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,

161
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:16.370
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

162
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.470
Boult!

163
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.570
Sir?

164
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.530
Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of gallants.

165
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.930
We lost too much money this mart by being too wenchless.

166
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.830
We were never so much out of creatures.

167
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.730
We have but poor three,

168
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.670
and they can do no more than they can do;

169
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.700
and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.

170
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.200
Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for them.

171
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.070
If there be not a conscience to be used in every trade,

172
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.400
we shall never prosper.

173
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.730
Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor bastards,

174
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.230
--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--

175
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.170
Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again.

176
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.870
But shall I search the market?

177
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.700
What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind

178
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.100
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.

179
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:05.570
Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o' conscience.

180
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.630
The poor Transylvanian is dead,

181
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.470
that lay with the little baggage.

182
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.000
Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms.

183
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.730
But I'll go search the market.

184
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.000
Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a

185
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
proportion to live quietly, and so give over.

186
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.230
Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get

187
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.200
when we are old?

188
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.570
O, our credit comes not in like the commodity,

189
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.870
nor the commodity wages not with the danger:

190
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.230
therefore, if in our youths we could pick up

191
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:54.130
some pretty estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.

192
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:59.400
Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods

193
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.500
will be strong with us for giving over.

194
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.430
Come, other sorts offend as well as we.

195
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:09.700
As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.

196
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.370
Neither is our profession any trade;

197
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.100
it's no calling. But here comes Boult.

198
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:25.370
Come your ways. My masters, you say she's a virgin?

199
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.570
O, sir, we doubt it not.

200
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.500
Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:

201
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.200
if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.

202
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.200
Boult, has she any qualities?

203
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.600
She has a good face, speaks well,

204
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.730
and has excellent good clothes: there's no further necessity

205
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:56.030
of qualities can make her be refused.

206
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.800
What's her price, Boult?

207
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.270
I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.

208
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:11.370
Well, follow me, my masters,

209
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.170
you shall have your money presently.

210
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.430
Wife, take her in; instruct her what she has to do,

211
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.330
that she may not be raw in her entertainment.

212
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:43.500
Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her hair,

213
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.270
complexion, height, age, with warrant of her virginity;

214
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.730
and cry 'He that will give most shall

215
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.730
have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap thing,

216
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.230
if men were as they have been.

217
00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.170
Get this done as I command you.

218
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.270
Performance shall follow.

219
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.470
Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!

220
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.470
He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,

221
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.100
Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me

222
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.230
For to seek my mother!

223
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.530
Why lament you, pretty one?

224
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.970
That I am pretty.

225
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.800
Come, the gods have done their part in you.

226
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800
I accuse them not.

227
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.470
You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.

228
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.830
The more my fault To scape his hands

229
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.070
where I was like to die.

230
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.100
Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.

231
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.300
No.

232
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.970
Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all fashions:

233
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.270
you shall fare well; you shall have the

234
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:49.830
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?

235
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.430
Are you a woman?

236
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.800
What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?

237
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.900
An honest woman, or not a woman.

238
00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.630
Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have

239
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:07.200
something to do with you. Come, you're a young foolish sapling,

240
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.400
and must be bowed as I would have you.

241
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.330
The gods defend me!

242
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.100
If it please the gods to defend you by men,

243
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.730
then men must comfort you, men must feed you,

244
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.770
men to stir you up.

245
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.830
Boult's returned.

246
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.870
How now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?

247
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.270
I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;

248
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.470
I have drawn her picture with my voice.

249
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.900
And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the inclination

250
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.030
of the people, especially of the younger sort?

251
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.730
'Faith, they listened to me as they would have

252
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.130
hearkened to their father's testament.

253
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.470
There was a Spaniard's mouth so watered,

254
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.130
that he went to bed to her very description.

255
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.200
We shall have him here to-morrow

256
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.230
with his best ruff on.

257
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.300
To-night, to-night. But, mistress,

258
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.770
Do you know the French knight that cowers i' the hams?

259
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.230
Who, Monsieur Veroles?

260
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.300
Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the proclamation;

261
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.370
but he made a groan at it, and swore

262
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.100
he would see her to-morrow.

263
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.830
Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease hither:

264
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.230
here he does but repair it.

265
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.570
I know he will come in our shadow,

266
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.200
to scatter his crowns in the sun.

267
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.600
Well, if we had of every nation a traveller,

268
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.270
we should lodge them with this sign.

269
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.930
Pray you, come hither awhile.

270
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:52.870
You have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me:

271
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.970
you must seem to do that fearfully

272
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.800
which you commit willingly,

273
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.700
despise profit where you have most gain.

274
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.370
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers:

275
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.470
seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion,

276
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:14.400
and that opinion a mere profit. I understand you not.

277
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.230
O, take her home, mistress, take her home:

278
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.030
these blushes of hers must be quenched

279
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.670
with some present practise.

280
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.930
Thou sayest true, i' faith;

281
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.570
for your bride goes to that with shame

282
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.100
which is her way to go with warrant.

283
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.830
'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress,

284
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.830
if I have bargained for the joint,--

285
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.870
Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.

286
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.130
I may so.

287
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:46.770
Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the

288
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.730
manner of your garments well.

289
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.570
Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.

290
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.000
Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a

291
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.230
sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.

292
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.170
When nature flamed this piece,

293
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.470
she meant thee a good turn;

294
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.030
therefore say what a paragon she is,

295
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.970
and thou hast the harvest out of thine own report.

296
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.300
I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake

297
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.600
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty

298
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.600
stir up the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.

299
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.400
Come your ways; follow me.

300
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.430
If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,

301
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.730
Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.

302
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.870
Diana, aid my purpose!

303
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.630
What have we to do with Diana?

304
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.700
Pray you, will you go with us?

305
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.530
Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?

306
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.900
O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter

307
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.930
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!

308
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.400
I think you'll turn a child again.

309
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.700
Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,

310
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.900
I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,

311
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.670
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess

312
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.230
To equal any single crown o' the earth

313
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:36.400
I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!

314
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.630
Whom thou hast poison'd too:

315
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.330
If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness

316
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.030
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say

317
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.770
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?

318
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.530
That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,

319
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.570
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.

320
00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.970
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?

321
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.670
Unless you play the pious innocent,

322
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.070
And for an honest attribute cry out

323
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.730
'She died by foul play.'

324
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:13.270
O, go to. Well, well,

325
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.500
Of all the faults beneath the heavens,

326
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.130
The gods do like this worst.

327
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.230
Be one of those that think

328
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.130
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,

329
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.630
And open this to Pericles.

330
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.000
I shame to think of what a noble strain you are,

331
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.070
And of how coward a spirit.

332
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.300
To such proceeding

333
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.770
Who ever but his approbation gave,

334
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.370
And not his prime consent,

335
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.230
he did not flow from honourable sources.

336
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.170
Be it so, then:

337
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.500
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,

338
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.630
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.

339
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.300
She did disdain my child, and stood between

340
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.500
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,

341
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.130
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;

342
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.300
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin

343
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.200
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;

344
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.700
And though you call my course unnatural,

345
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.930
You not your child well loving, yet I find

346
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.830
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness

347
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.700
Perform'd to your sole daughter.

348
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.600
Heavens forgive it!

349
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.000
And as for Pericles,

350
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.230
What should he say? We wept after her hearse,

351
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:36.430
And yet we mourn: her monument

352
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.130
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs

353
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.230
In glittering golden characters express

354
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.870
A general praise to her, and care in us

355
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.670
At whose expense 'tis done.

356
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.900
Thou art like the harpy,

357
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.970
Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,

358
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.470
Seize with thine eagle's talons.

359
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.230
You are like one that superstitiously

360
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.500
Do swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:

361
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.430
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.

362
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.170
Thus time we waste, and long leagues make short;

363
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.700
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;

364
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.830
Making, to take your imagination,

365
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.470
From bourn to bourn, region to region.

366
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.270
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you

367
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.400
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,

368
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.470
The stages of our story.

369
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:51.000
Pericles is now again thwarting the wayward seas,

370
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.600
Attended on by many a lord and knight.

371
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.070
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.

372
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.830
Old Helicanus goes along.

373
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.030
Behind is left to govern,  if you bear in mind,

374
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.370
Old Escanes,  whom Helicanus late

375
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.730
Advanced in time to great and high estate,

376
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.300
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought

377
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.270
This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;

378
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:18.830
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--

379
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.230
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.

380
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.470
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;

381
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.930
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.

382
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.800
See how belief may suffer by foul show!

383
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.630
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;

384
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.470
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,

385
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.830
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears o'ershower'd,

386
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:54.230
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears

387
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.700
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:

388
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.030
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears

389
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.800
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,

390
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.800
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.

391
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.370
The epitaph is for Marina writ by wicked Dionyza.

392
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.570
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,

393
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.130
Who wither'd in her spring of year.

394
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.830
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,

395
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.030
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;

396
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.330
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,

397
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.000
The sea, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:

398
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,

399
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.070
Hath The seas' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:

400
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.330
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,

401
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:53.370
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'

402
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.800
No visor does become black villany

403
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.600
So well as soft and tender flattery.

404
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.530
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,

405
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.200
And bear his courses to be ordered

406
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.100
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play

407
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.170
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day

408
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.570
In her unholy service. Patience, then,

409
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.700
And think you now are all in Mytilene.

410
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.470
Did you ever hear the like?

411
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.630
No, nor never shall do in such a place as this,

412
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.370
she being once gone.

413
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.930
But to have divinity preached there!

414
00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.330
did you ever dream of such a thing?

415
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:53.470
No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:

416
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.270
shall's go hear the vestals sing?

417
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.770
I'll do any thing now that is virtuous;

418
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.130
but I am out of the road of rutting for ever.

419
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.430
Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she

420
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.100
had ne'er come here.

421
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.030
Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god

422
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.330
Priapus, and undo a whole generation.

423
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.170
We must either get her ravished, or be rid of her.

424
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.200
When she should do for clients her fitment, and do me the

425
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.500
kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,

426
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.230
her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her knees;

427
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.770
she would make a puritan of the devil,

428
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.470
if he should cheapen a kiss of her.

429
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.730
'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us

430
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.100
of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.

431
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.400
Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!

432
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.500
'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't

433
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.600
but by the way to the pox.

434
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.170
Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.

435
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:16.900
How now! How a dozen of virginities?

436
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.700
Now, the gods to-bless your honour!

437
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.330
I am glad to see your honour in good health.

438
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.770
You may so; 'tis the well for you that your

439
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:35.700
resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!

440
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.500
wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal

441
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.630
withal, and defy the surgeon?

442
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:50.270
We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never

443
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.230
came her like in Mytilene.

444
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.030
If she'ld but do the deed of darkness,

445
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.830
thou wouldst say. Your honour knows what 'tis to say

446
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.800
well enough. Well, call forth, call forth.

447
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.930
For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall

448
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:13.370
see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--

449
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.570
What, prithee?

450
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.400
O, sir, I can be modest.

451
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.770
That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it

452
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.070
gives a good report to a number to be chaste.

453
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:31.000
Here comes that which grows to the stalk;

454
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.830
never plucked yet, I can assure you.

455
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.270
Is she not a fair creature?

456
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:54.200
'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.

457
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.170
Well, here's for you: leave us.

458
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.700
I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and

459
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.430
I'll have done presently.

460
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.870
I beseech you, do.

461
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:12.470
First, I would have you note,

462
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.900
this is an honourable man.

463
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.530
I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.

464
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.000
Next, he's the governor of this country,

465
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.370
and a man whom I am bound to.

466
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.600
If he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed;

467
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.000
but how honourable he is in that, I know not.

468
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.330
Pray you, without any more virginal fencing,

469
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:44.300
will you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.

470
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.100
What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.

471
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.830
Ha' you done?

472
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:57.600
My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some

473
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.930
pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will

474
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:06.200
leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.

475
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.300
Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?

476
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.230
What trade, sir?

477
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.730
Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.

478
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.800
I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.

479
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.230
How long have you been of this profession?

480
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.730
E'er since I can remember.

481
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.600
Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at

482
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.070
five or at seven?

483
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.030
Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.

484
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.230
Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a

485
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.630
creature of sale.

486
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.000
Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,

487
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.970
and will come into 't? I hear say you are of

488
00:31:54.970 --> 00:32:00.900
honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.

489
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.670
Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?

490
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.800
Who is my principal?

491
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.330
Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots

492
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:17.230
of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something

493
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.600
of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious

494
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.270
wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one,

495
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.430
my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly

496
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.630
upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:

497
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.130
come, come.

498
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.130
If you were born to honour, show it now;

499
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.670
If put upon you, make the judgment good

500
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.130
That thought you worthy of it.

501
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.200
How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.

502
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.330
What reason is there in your justice

503
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.630
which hath power over all to undo any?

504
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:52.030
Take you mine honour and you make a gap into fobidden ground

505
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.570
Where after all may tread. If then with violence

506
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.570
you mar this workmanship of heaven

507
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:02.630
you will abuse your justice, kill you honour

508
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:08.470
and leave me impoverished to the world.

509
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.830
Why this same house wherein thou live'st

510
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.300
is a receptacle of all men's sins.

511
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.870
A nurse of wickedness. How can'st thou be anything

512
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.270
but naught that dwells within?

513
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.530
Know you the roof but still will enter here?

514
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.970
Oh my good lord, if there be fire before me

515
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.530
must I straightway run to burn myself

516
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.130
or suppose this house, which two too many

517
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:38.270
feels such houses are should be the doctor's patromony

518
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.730
and the surgeons feeding, follows it that I must needs

519
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:48.970
infect myself to maintain them.

520
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:54.030
My yet good lord, make me your servant

521
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:59.130
and I will obey you. Let me live honest

522
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:05.270
and I am content. Honest.

523
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:20.370
How now, even in this minute let me die.

524
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.630
O, that the gods

525
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.370
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,

526
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.400
Though they did change me to the meanest bird

527
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.500
That flies i' the purer air!

528
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.470
Now surely this is virtue's image rather virtue's self.

529
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:40.530
Come down from heaven awhile to reign on earth

530
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.900
to teach us what we should be.

531
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.570
I did not think thou couldst have spoke so well;

532
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.700
ne'er dream'd thou couldst.

533
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.100
I hither came with thoughts intemperate, foul and deformed.

534
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.570
The which your tears have washed, till they are white.

535
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:29.370
Your speech has mended my corrupted mind.

536
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.900
Hold, here's gold for thee:

537
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.730
Persever in that clear way thou goest,

538
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.830
And the gods strengthen thee!

539
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.270
The good gods preserve you!

540
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:45.200
Lady, to me the very doors and windows savour vilely.

541
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.200
Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue,

542
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.430
and I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.

543
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.830
Hold, here's more gold for thee.

544
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.400
A curse upon him, die he like a thief,

545
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:15.230
That robs thee of thy goodness!

546
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:21.100
If thou dost hear from me, it shall be for thy good.

547
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.830
I beseech your honour, one piece for me.

548
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.630
Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!

549
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.000
Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,

550
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.830
Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!

551
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:47.400
How's this? We must take another course with you.

552
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.730
If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a

553
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.130
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,

554
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:56.200
shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like

555
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.300
a spaniel. Come your ways.

556
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.100
Whither would you have me?

557
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.170
How now! what's the matter?

558
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.330
Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy

559
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.770
words to the Lord Lysimachus.

560
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.370
O abominable!

561
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.030
She makes our profession as it were to stink afore

562
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.270
the face of the gods.

563
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.000
Marry, hang her up for ever!

564
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.730
The nobleman would have dealt with her like a

565
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.430
nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a snowball;

566
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.230
saying his prayers too.

567
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:33.270
Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:

568
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.570
crack the glass of her virginity,

569
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.630
and make the rest malleable.

570
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.430
An if she were thornier ground than she is,

571
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.100
she shall be ploughed.

572
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.030
Hark, hark, you gods!

573
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.030
She conjures: away with her! Would she had never

574
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.370
come within my doors! Marry, hang you!

575
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:04.700
She's born to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?

576
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:11.930
Marry, come up, my dish of chastity

577
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:17.070
with rosemary and bays!

578
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:28.500
Come, mistress; I must have your maiden head taken off

579
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.430
or the common hangman shall execute it.

580
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:36.400
Come your ways. We'll have no more gentlemen driven away.

581
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.970
Come your ways, I say!

582
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.100
Whither wilt thou have me?

583
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.230
To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.

584
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.470
Prithee, tell me one thing first.

585
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.600
Come now, your one thing.

586
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.300
Who does thou think thine enemy to be?

587
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.000
Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.

588
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.300
Neither of these are so bad as thou art,

589
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.400
Since they do better thee in their command.

590
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.130
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend

591
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.970
Of hell would not in reputation change:

592
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.930
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every

593
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.330
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;

594
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.230
To the choleric fisting of every rogue

595
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.570
Thy ear is liable; thy food is such

596
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:24.070
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.

597
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.270
What would you have me do? go to the wars, would you?

598
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.330
Where a man may serve seven years for the loss

599
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.470
of a leg, and have not money enough

600
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.630
to buy him a wooden one?

601
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.770
Do any thing but this thou doest.

602
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.270
Empty old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;

603
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.370
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:

604
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.470
Any of these ways are yet better than this;

605
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:50.530
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,

606
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:56.870
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods

607
00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:00.070
Would safely deliver me from this place!

608
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.430
Here, here's gold for thee.

609
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.530
If that thy master would gain by thee,

610
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.400
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,

611
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.830
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:

612
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.230
And I will undertake all these to teach.

613
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.200
I doubt not but this populous city will

614
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.070
Yield many scholars.

615
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.730
But can you teach all this you speak of?

616
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.170
Prove that I cannot, take me home again,

617
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.430
And prostitute me to the basest groom

618
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.700
That doth frequent your house.

619
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:07.400
Well, I will see what I can do for thee:

620
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.030
if I can place thee, I will.

621
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.730
But amongst honest women.

622
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:18.000
'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.

623
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.130
But since my master and mistress have bought you,

624
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.730
there's no going but by their consent:

625
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.470
therefore I will make them acquainted with your purpose,

626
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.100
and I doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.

627
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:46.730
Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.

628
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.770
