00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000


2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.630
Imagine Pericles arrivedat Tyre,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.330
Welcomed and settled tohis own desire.

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.100
His woeful queen we leaveat Ephesus,

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.900
Unto Diana there avotaress.

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.070
Now to Marina bend yourmind,

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.330
Whom our fast-growingscene must find

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.930
At Tarsus, and by Cleontrain'd

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.330
In music, letters; whohath gain'd

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.170
Of education all thegrace,

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.700
Which makes her both the heartand place of general wonder.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.130
But, alack, That monsterenvy, oft the wrack

13
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.400
Of earned praise, Marina'slife

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Seeks to take off bytreason's knife.

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.800
And in this kind ourCleon hath one daughter,

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.300
and a wench full grown,

17
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.200
Even ripe for marriage-rite;this maid hight Philoten:

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.430
and it is said forcertain in our story,

19
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.930
she would ever with Marina be:

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
Be't when she weaved thesleided silk

21
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.670
With fingers long, small,white as milk;

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570
Or when she would withsharp needle wound

23
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.100
The cambric, which shemade more sound

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.600
By hurting it; or when tothe lute

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.300
She sung, and made thenight-bird mute,

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.100
That still records with moan;

27
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.230
or when She would withrich and constant pen

28
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.630
Vail to her mistress Dian;

29
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.100
Still, this Philotencontends in skill

30
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.130
With absolute Marina:

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.800
so with the dove ofPaphos might the crow

32
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.870
Vie feathers white.Marina gets all praises,

33
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.230
which are paid as debts,

34
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.370
And not as given. This sodarks

35
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.900
In Philoten all gracefulmarks,

36
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.430
That Cleon's wife, withenvy rare,

37
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.600
A present murderer doesprepare for good Marina,

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.670
that her daughter might standpeerless by this slaughter.

39
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.700
The sooner her vilethoughts to stead,

40
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.870
Lychorida, our nurse, isdead:

41
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.130
And cursed Dionyza hath

42
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.900
The pregnant instrument ofwrath prest for this blow.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.270
The unborn event

44
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.070
I do commend to yourcontent:

45
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.670
Only I carry winged time

46
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.500
Post on the lame feet ofmy rhyme;

47
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
Which never could I soconvey,

48
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.670
Unless your thoughts wenton my way.

49
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.970
Dionyza does appear,

50
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.670
With Leonine, a murderer.

51
00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.630
Thy oath remember; thouhast sworn to do't:

52
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.370
'Tis but a blow, whichnever shall be known.

53
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.530
Thou canst not do a thingin the world so soon,

54
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.670
To yield thee so muchprofit. Let not conscience,

55
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.070
Which is but cold, nor flaminglove thy bosom enslaved

56
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.100
too nicely; nor let pity,

57
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.870
which even women havecast off, melt thee,

58
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.270
but be a soldierto thy purpose.

59
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:30.930
I will do't; but yet sheis a goodly creature.

60
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.700
The fitter, then, thegods should have her.

61
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.270
Here she comes weeping forher only nurses' death.

62
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.830
Thou art resolved?

63
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.200
I am resolved.

64
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.100
No, I will rob Tellus ofher weed,

65
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.170
To strew thy greenwith flowers:

66
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.270
the yellows, blues, the purpleviolets, and marigolds,

67
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:15.170
Shall as a carpet hangupon thy grave,

68
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:23.670
While summer-days do last.Ay me! poor maid,

69
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.970
Born in a tempest, when mymother died,

70
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.730
This world to me is like alasting storm,

71
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.970
Whirring me from myfriends.

72
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.330
How now, Marina! why doyou keep alone?

73
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.370
How chance my daughteris not with you?

74
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.030
Do not consume yourblood with sorrowing:

75
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.670
What, have you a nurse of me.Lord, how your favour's changed

76
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.630
With this unprofitablewoe!

77
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.370
Come, give me yourflowers, On the sea march'nt.

78
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.400
Walk with Leonine; the airis quick there,

79
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.870
And it pierces andsharpens the stomach.

80
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.630
Come Leonine, take her bythe arm, walk with her.

81
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.730
No, I pray you;

82
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.600
I'll not bereave you ofyour servant.

83
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.370
Come, come;

84
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.600
I love the king yourfather, and yourself,

85
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.230
With more than foreignheart. We every day

86
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.330
Expect him here: when heshall come and see

87
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.870
Our paragon to all reportsthus blasted,

88
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.770
He will repent the breadthof his great voyage;

89
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.030
Blame both my lord and me,that we have taken

90
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.570
No care to your bestcourses. Go, I pray you,

91
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.470
Walk, and be cheerfulonce again;

92
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.570
reserve that excellentcomplexion, which did steal

93
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.600
The eyes of young andold. Care not for me

94
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.670
I can go home alone.

95
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.830
Well, I will go;

96
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.570
But yet I have no desireto it.

97
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.830
Come, come, I know 'tisgood for you.

98
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.170
Walk half an hour,Leonine, at the least:

99
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.830
Remember what I have said.

100
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.370
I warrant you, madam.

101
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.800
I'll leave you, my sweetlady, for a while:

102
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.730
Pray, walk softly, do notheat your blood:

103
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.900
What! I must have careof you.

104
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.200
My thanks, sweet madam.

105
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.200
Is this wind westerly thatblows?

106
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.330
South-west.

107
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.830
When I was born, the windwas north.

108
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.200
Was't so?

109
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.370
My father, as nurse said,did never fear,

110
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.000
But cried 'Good seaman!'to the sailors, galling

111
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.200
His kingly hands, halingropes;

112
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.130
And, clasping to the mast,endured a sea

113
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.400
That almost burst thedeck.

114
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.130
When was this?

115
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.530
When I was born:

116
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.900
Never was wind nor wavesmore violent;

117
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.900
And from the ladder-tacklewashes off a canvas-climber.

118
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.730
'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'

119
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.400
And with a droppingindustry they skip

120
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.130
From stem to stern: theboatswain whistles,

121
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.700
and the master calls, andtrebles their confusion.

122
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.770
Come, say your prayers.

123
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.400
What mean you?

124
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.330
If you require a littlespace for prayer,

125
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.200
I grant it: pray; but benot tedious,

126
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.800
For the gods are quick ofear, and I am sworn

127
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.570
To do my work with haste.

128
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.430
Why will you kill me?

129
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.900
To satisfy my lady.

130
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.170
Why would she have mekill'd?

131
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.700
Now, as I can remember, bymy troth,

132
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.170
I never did her hurt inall my life:

133
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.230
I never spake bad word,nor did ill turn

134
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.570
To any living creature:believe me, la,

135
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.500
I never kill'd a mouse,nor hurt a fly:

136
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.970
I trod upon a worm againstmy will,

137
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.330
But I wept for it. Howhave I offended,

138
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.930
Wherein my death mightyield her any profit,

139
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.300
Or my life imply her anydanger?

140
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.400
My commission Is not to reasonof the deed, but do it.

141
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.830
You will not do't for allthe world, I hope.

142
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.700
You are well favour'd, andyour looks foreshow

143
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.700
You have a gentle heart. Isaw you lately,

144
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.030
When you caught hurt inparting two that fought:

145
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.330
Good sooth, it show'd wellin you: do so now:

146
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.530
Your lady seeks my life;come you between,

147
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.270
And save poor me, theweaker.

148
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.970
I am sworn,

149
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.830
And will dispatch.

150
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.770
Hold, villain!

151
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.800
A prize! a prize!

152
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.570
Half-part, mates,half-part.

153
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.100
Come, let's have heraboard suddenly.

154
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.700
These roguing thieves servethe great pirate Valdes;

155
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.770
And they have seizedMarina. Let her go:

156
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.100
There's no hopeshe will return.

157
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.070
I'll swear she's dead,

158
00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:01.700
And thrown into the sea.But I'll see further:

159
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.970
Perhaps they will butplease themselves upon her,

160
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.170
Not carry her aboard. Ifshe remain,

161
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:16.370
Whom they have ravish'dmust by me be slain.

162
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.470
Boult!

163
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.570
Sir?

164
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.530
Search the market narrowly;Mytilene is full of gallants.

165
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.930
We lost too much money thismart by being too wenchless.

166
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.830
We were never so muchout of creatures.

167
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:20.730
We have but poor three,

168
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.670
and they can do no morethan they can do;

169
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.700
and they with continual actionare even as good as rotten.

170
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.200
Therefore let's have fresh ones,whate'er we pay for them.

171
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.070
If there be not a conscienceto be used in every trade,

172
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.400
we shall never prosper.

173
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.730
Thou sayest true: 'tis not ourbringing up of poor bastards,

174
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:43.230
--as, I think, I havebrought up some eleven--

175
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.170
Ay, to eleven; andbrought them down again.

176
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.870
But shall I search the market?

177
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.700
What else, man? The stuffwe have, a strong wind

178
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:58.100
will blow it to pieces, theyare so pitifully sodden.

179
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:05.570
Thou sayest true; they're toounwholesome, o' conscience.

180
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.630
The poor Transylvanian is dead,

181
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.470
that lay with thelittle baggage.

182
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.000
Ay, she quickly pooped him; shemade him roast-meat for worms.

183
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.730
But I'll go search the market.

184
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.000
Three or four thousandchequins were as pretty a

185
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
proportion to livequietly, and so give over.

186
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.230
Why to give over, I prayyou? is it a shame to get

187
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.200
when we are old?

188
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.570
O, our credit comes notin like the commodity,

189
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.870
nor the commodity wagesnot with the danger:

190
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.230
therefore, if in ouryouths we could pick up

191
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:54.130
some pretty estate, 'twere notamiss to keep our door hatched.

192
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:59.400
Besides, the sore terms westand upon with the gods

193
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.500
will be strong with us forgiving over.

194
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.430
Come, other sorts offendas well as we.

195
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:09.700
As well as we! ay, andbetter too; we offend worse.

196
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.370
Neither is ourprofession any trade;

197
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.100
it's no calling. Buthere comes Boult.

198
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:25.370
Come your ways. My masters,you say she's a virgin?

199
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.570
O, sir, we doubt it not.

200
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.500
Master, I have gone throughfor this piece, you see:

201
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.200
if you like her, so; if not,I have lost my earnest.

202
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.200
Boult, has she anyqualities?

203
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.600
She has a goodface, speaks well,

204
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.730
and has excellent good clothes:there's no further necessity

205
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:56.030
of qualities can makeher be refused.

206
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.800
What's her price, Boult?

207
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.270
I cannot be bated one doitof a thousand pieces.

208
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:11.370
Well, follow me, my masters,

209
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:15.170
you shall have yourmoney presently.

210
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.430
Wife, take her in; instructher what she has to do,

211
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.330
that she may not be rawin her entertainment.

212
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:43.500
Boult, take you the marks ofher, the colour of her hair,

213
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.270
complexion, height, age, withwarrant of her virginity;

214
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.730
and cry 'He that willgive most shall

215
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:53.730
have her first.' Such amaidenhead were no cheap thing,

216
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.230
if men were as they have been.

217
00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.170
Get this done as I command you.

218
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.270
Performance shall follow.

219
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.470
Alack that Leonine was soslack, so slow!

220
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.470
He should have struck, notspoke; or that these pirates,

221
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.100
Not enough barbarous, hadnot o'erboard thrown me

222
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.230
For to seek my mother!

223
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.530
Why lament you, prettyone?

224
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.970
That I am pretty.

225
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.800
Come, the gods have donetheir part in you.

226
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800
I accuse them not.

227
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.470
You are light into my hands,where you are like to live.

228
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.830
The more my faultTo scape his hands

229
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.070
where I was like to die.

230
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.100
Ay, and you shall live inpleasure.

231
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.300
No.

232
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.970
Yes, indeed shall you, and tastegentlemen of all fashions:

233
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.270
you shall fare well;you shall have the

234
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:49.830
difference of all complexions.What! do you stop your ears?

235
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.430
Are you a woman?

236
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.800
What would you have me be,an I be not a woman?

237
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.900
An honest woman, or not awoman.

238
00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.630
Marry, whip thee, gosling:I think I shall have

239
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:07.200
something to do with you. Come,you're a young foolish sapling,

240
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.400
and must be bowed asI would have you.

241
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.330
The gods defend me!

242
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.100
If it please the godsto defend you by men,

243
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:20.730
then men must comfortyou, men must feed you,

244
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.770
men to stir you up.

245
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.830
Boult's returned.

246
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.870
How now, sir, hast thou criedher through the market?

247
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.270
I have cried her almost tothe number of her hairs;

248
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:42.470
I have drawn her picturewith my voice.

249
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.900
And I prithee tell me, how dostthou find the inclination

250
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.030
of the people, especiallyof the younger sort?

251
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.730
'Faith, they listened tome as they would have

252
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.130
hearkened to theirfather's testament.

253
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:51.470
There was a Spaniard'smouth so watered,

254
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.130
that he went to bed toher very description.

255
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.200
We shall have himhere to-morrow

256
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.230
with his best ruff on.

257
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.300
To-night, to-night.But, mistress,

258
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.770
Do you know the French knightthat cowers i' the hams?

259
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.230
Who, Monsieur Veroles?

260
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.300
Ay, he: he offered to cut acaper at the proclamation;

261
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.370
but he made a groanat it, and swore

262
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.100
he would see herto-morrow.

263
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:16.830
Well, well; as for him, hebrought his disease hither:

264
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.230
here he does but repair it.

265
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.570
I know he will comein our shadow,

266
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.200
to scatter hiscrowns in the sun.

267
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.600
Well, if we had of everynation a traveller,

268
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.270
we should lodge themwith this sign.

269
00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:37.930
Pray you, come hither awhile.

270
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:52.870
You have fortunes comingupon you. Mark me:

271
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.970
you must seem todo that fearfully

272
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.800
which you commit willingly,

273
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.700
despise profit whereyou have most gain.

274
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.370
To weep that you live as ye domakes pity in your lovers:

275
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.470
seldom but that pity begetsyou a good opinion,

276
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:14.400
and that opinion a mereprofit. I understand you not.

277
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.230
O, take her home,mistress, take her home:

278
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.030
these blushes of hersmust be quenched

279
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:20.670
with some present practise.

280
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.930
Thou sayest true, i'faith;

281
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.570
for your bride goesto that with shame

282
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:30.100
which is her way togo with warrant.

283
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.830
'Faith, some do, and somedo not. But, mistress,

284
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.830
if I have bargainedfor the joint,--

285
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.870
Thou mayst cut a morseloff the spit.

286
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.130
I may so.

287
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:46.770
Who should deny it? Come,young one, I like the

288
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.730
manner of your garmentswell.

289
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.570
Ay, by my faith, theyshall not be changed yet.

290
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.000
Boult, spend thou that inthe town: report what a

291
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.230
sojourner we have; you'lllose nothing by custom.

292
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:01.170
When nature flamed this piece,

293
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.470
she meant thee a good turn;

294
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.030
therefore say whata paragon she is,

295
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.970
and thou hast the harvestout of thine own report.

296
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.300
I warrant you, mistress,thunder shall not so awake

297
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.600
the beds of eels as mygiving out her beauty

298
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.600
stir up the lewdly-inclined.I'll bring home some to-night.

299
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.400
Come your ways; follow me.

300
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.430
If fires be hot, knivessharp, or waters deep,

301
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.730
Untied I still my virginknot will keep.

302
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.870
Diana, aid my purpose!

303
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.630
What have we to do with Diana?

304
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.700
Pray you, will you go with us?

305
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.530
Why, are you foolish? Canit be undone?

306
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.900
O Dionyza, such a piece ofslaughter

307
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.930
The sun and moon ne'erlook'd upon!

308
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.400
I think you'll turna child again.

309
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.700
Were I chief lord of allthis spacious world,

310
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.900
I'ld give it to undo thedeed. O lady,

311
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.670
Much less in blood thanvirtue, yet a princess

312
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.230
To equal any single crowno' the earth

313
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:36.400
I' the justice of compare!O villain Leonine!

314
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.630
Whom thou hast poison'dtoo:

315
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.330
If thou hadst drunk to him,'t had been a kindness

316
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.030
Becoming well thy fact:what canst thou say

317
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:46.770
When noble Pericles shalldemand his child?

318
00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.530
That she is dead. Nursesare not the fates,

319
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.570
To foster it, nor ever topreserve.

320
00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.970
She died at night; I'llsay so. Who can cross it?

321
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.670
Unless you play the piousinnocent,

322
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.070
And for an honestattribute cry out

323
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.730
'She died by foul play.'

324
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:13.270
O, go to. Well, well,

325
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.500
Of all the faultsbeneath the heavens,

326
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.130
The gods do like this worst.

327
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.230
Be one of those that think

328
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:22.130
The petty wrens of Tarsuswill fly hence,

329
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.630
And open this to Pericles.

330
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:28.000
I shame to think of whata noble strain you are,

331
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.070
And of how coward aspirit.

332
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.300
To such proceeding

333
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.770
Who ever but hisapprobation gave,

334
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.370
And not his prime consent,

335
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.230
he did not flow fromhonourable sources.

336
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.170
Be it so, then:

337
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:49.500
Yet none does know, butyou, how she came dead,

338
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.630
Nor none can know, Leoninebeing gone.

339
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.300
She did disdain my child,and stood between

340
00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.500
Her and her fortunes: nonewould look on her,

341
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.130
But cast their gazes onMarina's face;

342
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.300
Whilst ours was blurted atand held a malkin

343
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:09.200
Not worth the time of day.It pierced me through;

344
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.700
And though you call mycourse unnatural,

345
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.930
You not your child wellloving, yet I find

346
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.830
It greets me as anenterprise of kindness

347
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.700
Perform'd to your soledaughter.

348
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.600
Heavens forgive it!

349
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.000
And as for Pericles,

350
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.230
What should he say? Wewept after her hearse,

351
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:36.430
And yet we mourn: hermonument

352
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.130
Is almost finish'd, andher epitaphs

353
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.230
In glittering goldencharacters express

354
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.870
A general praise to her,and care in us

355
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:51.670
At whose expense 'tisdone.

356
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.900
Thou art like the harpy,

357
00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.970
Which, to betray, dost,with thine angel's face,

358
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.470
Seize with thine eagle'stalons.

359
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.230
You are like one thatsuperstitiously

360
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.500
Do swear to the gods thatwinter kills the flies:

361
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:13.430
But yet I know you'll doas I advise.

362
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.170
Thus time we waste, andlong leagues make short;

363
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.700
Sail seas in cockles, havean wish but for't;

364
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.830
Making, to take yourimagination,

365
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.470
From bourn to bourn,region to region.

366
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.270
Where our scenes seem tolive. I do beseech you

367
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.400
To learn of me, who standi' the gaps to teach you,

368
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.470
The stages of our story.

369
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:51.000
Pericles is now againthwarting the wayward seas,

370
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.600
Attended on by many a lordand knight.

371
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.070
To see his daughter, allhis life's delight.

372
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.830
Old Helicanus goes along.

373
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:01.030
Behind is left to govern, if you bear in mind,

374
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.370
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late

375
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.730
Advanced in time togreat and high estate,

376
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.300
Well-sailing ships andbounteous winds have brought

377
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.270
This king to Tarsus,--thinkhis pilot thought;

378
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:18.830
So with his steerage shallyour thoughts grow on,--

379
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.230
To fetch his daughterhome, who first is gone.

380
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.470
Like motes and shadows seethem move awhile;

381
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:31.930
Your ears unto your eyesI'll reconcile.

382
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.800
See how belief may sufferby foul show!

383
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.630
This borrow'd passionstands for true old woe;

384
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.470
And Pericles, in sorrowall devour'd,

385
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.830
With sighs shot through, andbiggest tears o'ershower'd,

386
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:54.230
Leaves Tarsus and againembarks. He swears

387
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:57.700
Never to wash his face,nor cut his hairs:

388
00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.030
He puts on sackcloth, andto sea. He bears

389
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.800
A tempest, which hismortal vessel tears,

390
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.800
And yet he rides it out.Now please you wit.

391
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.370
The epitaph is for Marinawrit by wicked Dionyza.

392
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.570
'The fairest, sweet'st,and best lies here,

393
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.130
Who wither'd in her springof year.

394
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.830
She was of Tyrus theking's daughter,

395
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:29.030
On whom foul death hathmade this slaughter;

396
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.330
Marina was she call'd; andat her birth,

397
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.000
The sea, being proud, swallow'dsome part o' the earth:

398
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Therefore the earth,fearing to be o'erflow'd,

399
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.070
Hath The seas' birth-childon the heavens bestow'd:

400
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.330
Wherefore she does, andswears she'll never stint,

401
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:53.370
Make raging battery uponshores of flint.'

402
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.800
No visor does become blackvillany

403
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.600
So well as soft and tenderflattery.

404
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.530
Let Pericles believe hisdaughter's dead,

405
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.200
And bear his courses to beordered

406
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.100
By Lady Fortune; while ourscene must play

407
00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.170
His daughter's woe andheavy well-a-day

408
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.570
In her unholy service.Patience, then,

409
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.700
And think you now are allin Mytilene.

410
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.470
Did you ever hear thelike?

411
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.630
No, nor never shall do insuch a place as this,

412
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.370
she being once gone.

413
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.930
But to have divinitypreached there!

414
00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.330
did you ever dreamof such a thing?

415
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:53.470
No, no. Come, I am for nomore bawdy-houses:

416
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.270
shall's go hear thevestals sing?

417
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.770
I'll do any thing nowthat is virtuous;

418
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.130
but I am out of the roadof rutting for ever.

419
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.430
Well, I had rather thantwice the worth of her she

420
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.100
had ne'er come here.

421
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.030
Fie, fie upon her! she'sable to freeze the god

422
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.330
Priapus, and undo awhole generation.

423
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.170
We must either get herravished, or be rid of her.

424
00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.200
When she should do for clientsher fitment, and do me the

425
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.500
kindness of our profession,she has me her quirks,

426
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.230
her reasons, her master reasons,her prayers, her knees;

427
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.770
she would make apuritan of the devil,

428
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.470
if he should cheapen akiss of her.

429
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.730
'Faith, I must ravish her,or she'll disfurnish us

430
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.100
of all our cavaliers, andmake our swearers priests.

431
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.400
Now, the pox upon hergreen-sickness for me!

432
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.500
'Faith, there's noway to be rid on't

433
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.600
but by the way to the pox.

434
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:05.170
Here comes the LordLysimachus disguised.

435
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:16.900
How now! How a dozen ofvirginities?

436
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.700
Now, the gods to-blessyour honour!

437
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.330
I am glad to see yourhonour in good health.

438
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.770
You may so; 'tis thewell for you that your

439
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:35.700
resorters stand upon soundlegs. How now!

440
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.500
wholesome iniquity haveyou that a man may deal

441
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.630
withal, and defy thesurgeon?

442
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:50.270
We have here one, sir, ifshe would--but there never

443
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.230
came her like in Mytilene.

444
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.030
If she'ld but do thedeed of darkness,

445
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.830
thou wouldst say. Your honourknows what 'tis to say

446
00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:04.800
well enough. Well, callforth, call forth.

447
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.930
For flesh and blood, sir,white and red, you shall

448
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:13.370
see a rose; and she were arose indeed, if she had but--

449
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.570
What, prithee?

450
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.400
O, sir, I can be modest.

451
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.770
That dignifies the renownof a bawd, no less than it

452
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.070
gives a good report to anumber to be chaste.

453
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:31.000
Here comes that whichgrows to the stalk;

454
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.830
never plucked yet,I can assure you.

455
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.270
Is she not a faircreature?

456
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:54.200
'Faith, she would serveafter a long voyage at sea.

457
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.170
Well, here's for you:leave us.

458
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.700
I beseech your honour,give me leave: a word, and

459
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.430
I'll have done presently.

460
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.870
I beseech you, do.

461
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:12.470
First, I would have you note,

462
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:15.900
this is an honourable man.

463
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.530
I desire to find him so, thatI may worthily note him.

464
00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.000
Next, he's the governorof this country,

465
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.370
and a man whom I am bound to.

466
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.600
If he govern the country, youare bound to him indeed;

467
00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:33.000
but how honourable he isin that, I know not.

468
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.330
Pray you, without anymore virginal fencing,

469
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:44.300
will you use him kindly? He willline your apron with gold.

470
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.100
What he will do graciously,I will thankfully receive.

471
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.830
Ha' you done?

472
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:57.600
My lord, she's not pacedyet: you must take some

473
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.930
pains to work her to yourmanage. Come, we will

474
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:06.200
leave his honour and hertogether. Go thy ways.

475
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.300
Now, pretty one, how longhave you been at this trade?

476
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.230
What trade, sir?

477
00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.730
Why, I cannot name't but Ishall offend.

478
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:30.800
I cannot be offended with mytrade. Please you to name it.

479
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.230
How long have you been ofthis profession?

480
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.730
E'er since I can remember.

481
00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.600
Did you go to 't so young?Were you a gamester at

482
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.070
five or at seven?

483
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:44.030
Earlier too, sir, if now Ibe one.

484
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.230
Why, the house you dwellin proclaims you to be a

485
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.630
creature of sale.

486
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.000
Do you know this house tobe a place of such resort,

487
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.970
and will come into 't? Ihear say you are of

488
00:31:54.970 --> 00:32:00.900
honourable parts, and arethe governor of this place.

489
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.670
Why, hath your principal madeknown unto you who I am?

490
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.800
Who is my principal?

491
00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.330
Why, your herb-woman; shethat sets seeds and roots

492
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:17.230
of shame and iniquity. O,you have heard something

493
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.600
of my power, and so standaloof for more serious

494
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:26.270
wooing. But I protestto thee, pretty one,

495
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.430
my authority shall not seethee, or else look friendly

496
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:34.630
upon thee. Come, bring meto some private place:

497
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.130
come, come.

498
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.130
If you were born tohonour, show it now;

499
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:39.670
If put upon you, make thejudgment good

500
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.130
That thought you worthy ofit.

501
00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:43.200
How's this? how's this?Some more; be sage.

502
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.330
What reason is therein your justice

503
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.630
which hath power over all toundo any?

504
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:52.030
Take you mine honour and youmake a gap into fobidden ground

505
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:56.570
Where after all may tread.If then with violence

506
00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:58.570
you mar this workmanshipof heaven

507
00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:02.630
you will abuse yourjustice, kill you honour

508
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:08.470
and leave me impoverishedto the world.

509
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:10.830
Why this same housewherein thou live'st

510
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.300
is a receptacle ofall men's sins.

511
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.870
A nurse of wickedness. Howcan'st thou be anything

512
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.270
but naught that dwells within?

513
00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:25.530
Know you the roof butstill will enter here?

514
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.970
Oh my good lord, ifthere be fire before me

515
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:31.530
must I straightway run to burnmyself

516
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.130
or suppose this house,which two too many

517
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:38.270
feels such houses are shouldbe the doctor's patromony

518
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.730
and the surgeons feeding,follows it that I must needs

519
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:48.970
infect myself to maintain them.

520
00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:54.030
My yet good lord,make me your servant

521
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:59.130
and I will obey you.Let me live honest

522
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:05.270
and I am content. Honest.

523
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:20.370
How now, even in thisminute let me die.

524
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:21.630
O, that the gods

525
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.370
Would set me free fromthis unhallow'd place,

526
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:28.400
Though they did change meto the meanest bird

527
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.500
That flies i' the purerair!

528
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.470
Now surely this is virtue'simage rather virtue's self.

529
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:40.530
Come down from heavenawhile to reign on earth

530
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.900
to teach us what we should be.

531
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:58.570
I did not think thou couldsthave spoke so well;

532
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.700
ne'er dream'd thou couldst.

533
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:09.100
I hither came with thoughtsintemperate, foul and deformed.

534
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.570
The which your tears havewashed, till they are white.

535
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:29.370
Your speech has mended mycorrupted mind.

536
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.900
Hold, here's gold for thee:

537
00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:35.730
Persever in that clear waythou goest,

538
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.830
And the gods strengthenthee!

539
00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.270
The good gods preserveyou!

540
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:45.200
Lady, to me the very doors andwindows savour vilely.

541
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.200
Fare thee well. Thouart a piece of virtue,

542
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.430
and I doubt not but thytraining hath been noble.

543
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.830
Hold, here's more gold forthee.

544
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.400
A curse upon him, die helike a thief,

545
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:15.230
That robs thee of thy goodness!

546
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:21.100
If thou dost hear from me,it shall be for thy good.

547
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.830
I beseech your honour, onepiece for me.

548
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.630
Avaunt, thou damneddoor-keeper!

549
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.000
Your house, but for thisvirgin that doth prop it,

550
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.830
Would sink and overwhelmyou. Away!

551
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:47.400
How's this? We must takeanother course with you.

552
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.730
If your peevish chastity,which is not worth a

553
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.130
breakfast in the cheapestcountry under the cope,

554
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:56.200
shall undo a whole household,let me be gelded like

555
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.300
a spaniel. Come your ways.

556
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.100
Whither would you have me?

557
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.170
How now! what's thematter?

558
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.330
Worse and worse, mistress;she has here spoken holy

559
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.770
words to the LordLysimachus.

560
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.370
O abominable!

561
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.030
She makes our professionas it were to stink afore

562
00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.270
the face of the gods.

563
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.000
Marry, hang her up forever!

564
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.730
The nobleman would havedealt with her like a

565
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.430
nobleman, and she sent himaway as cold as a snowball;

566
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.230
saying his prayers too.

567
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:33.270
Boult, take her away; useher at thy pleasure:

568
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.570
crack the glass ofher virginity,

569
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:40.630
and make the rest malleable.

570
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.430
An if she were thornierground than she is,

571
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.100
she shall be ploughed.

572
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.030
Hark, hark, you gods!

573
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.030
She conjures: away withher! Would she had never

574
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.370
come within my doors!Marry, hang you!

575
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:04.700
She's born to undo us. Will younot go the way of women-kind?

576
00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:11.930
Marry, come up, mydish of chastity

577
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:17.070
with rosemary and bays!

578
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:28.500
Come, mistress; I must haveyour maiden head taken off

579
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.430
or the common hangmanshall execute it.

580
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:36.400
Come your ways. We'll have nomore gentlemen driven away.

581
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.970
Come your ways, I say!

582
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.100
Whither wilt thou have me?

583
00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:50.230
To take from you the jewelyou hold so dear.

584
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.470
Prithee, tell me one thingfirst.

585
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.600
Come now, your one thing.

586
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.300
Who does thou think thineenemy to be?

587
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:03.000
Why, I could wish him to be mymaster, or rather, my mistress.

588
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.300
Neither of these are sobad as thou art,

589
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.400
Since they do better theein their command.

590
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.130
Thou hold'st a place, forwhich the pained'st fiend

591
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.970
Of hell would not inreputation change:

592
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.930
Thou art the damneddoorkeeper to every

593
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:16.330
Coistrel that comesinquiring for his Tib;

594
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:18.230
To the choleric fisting ofevery rogue

595
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.570
Thy ear is liable; thyfood is such

596
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:24.070
As hath been belch'd on byinfected lungs.

597
00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.270
What would you have me do?go to the wars, would you?

598
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:30.330
Where a man may serveseven years for the loss

599
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.470
of a leg, and havenot money enough

600
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:33.630
to buy him a wooden one?

601
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.770
Do any thing butthis thou doest.

602
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.270
Empty old receptacles, orcommon shores, of filth;

603
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.370
Serve by indenture to thecommon hangman:

604
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.470
Any of these ways are yetbetter than this;

605
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:50.530
For what thou professest,a baboon, could he speak,

606
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:56.870
Would own a name too dear.O, that the gods

607
00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:00.070
Would safely deliver mefrom this place!

608
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.430
Here, here's gold forthee.

609
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.530
If that thy master wouldgain by thee,

610
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.400
Proclaim that I can sing,weave, sew, and dance,

611
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.830
With other virtues, whichI'll keep from boast:

612
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.230
And I will undertake allthese to teach.

613
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.200
I doubt not but thispopulous city will

614
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.070
Yield many scholars.

615
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.730
But can you teach all thisyou speak of?

616
00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:48.170
Prove that I cannot, takeme home again,

617
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:50.430
And prostitute me to thebasest groom

618
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:54.700
That doth frequent yourhouse.

619
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:07.400
Well, I will see whatI can do for thee:

620
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.030
if I can place thee, I will.

621
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.730
But amongst honest women.

622
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:18.000
'Faith, my acquaintancelies little amongst them.

623
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.130
But since my master andmistress have bought you,

624
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.730
there's no going butby their consent:

625
00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:29.470
therefore I will make themacquainted with your purpose,

626
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.100
and I doubt not but I shallfind them tractable enough.

627
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:46.730
Come, I'll do for thee whatI can; come your ways.

628
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.770
