WEBVTT

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.000
HOPE.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I WANTED THE TYPE OF STUFF YOU

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
BE AS NICE AS YOU CAN TO

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
THESE KIDS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
THROUGH A LOT.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
DIFFERENT HOMES EVERY TIME,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
LIVING WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
IT WOULD BE PRETTY HARD FOR YOU,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.000
RIGHT?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
* IF YOU NEVER TRY

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW *

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
* JUST WHAT YOU WERE *

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
HELLO.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I'M DIANE SAWYER.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AND WELCOME TO THIS SPECIAL

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
"PRIMETIME."

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
TONIGHT, WE ARE CALLING ALL

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
ANGELS, AND WE HOPE BY THE END

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
WHAT IF WE COULD ALL AGREE THAT

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
BY TOMORROW MORNING SOMETHING

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
MUST CHANGE, THAT OUR NATION'S

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
MOST FRAGILE AND ABUSED CHILDREN

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
WOULD NO LONGER BE BOUNCED

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
AROUND FROM HOME TO HOME IN

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
AMERICA'S FOSTER CARE SYSTEM?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
WHEN ALL THESE CHILDREN WANT IS

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
SOMEONE WHO STAYS FOREVER IN

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
THEIR LIVES.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
AS WE BEGIN A FEW NUMBERS FOR

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
YOU.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
THERE ARE 500,000 CHILDREN IN

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
FOSTER CARE TONIGHT, 20,000 OF

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
THEM AVAILABLE FOR ADOPTION --

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
120,000 OF THEM AVAILABLE FOR

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
ADOPTION.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HAVE MUCH

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
MORE DIFFICULT STRUGGLES AND SO

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
THE FIRST QUESTION WE'RE ASKING

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
IS, WHO WILL HELP SUMMER?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
AN ANXIOUS LITTLE GIRL RIDES

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
IN THE BACK OF A CAR.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
SHE HAS ALREADY LIVED IN FOUR

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
DIFFERENT PLACEMENTS, AND SHE'S

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
JUST 11 YEARS OLD.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
YOU READY?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
INSIDE THE STRANGE NEW PLACE,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
A COUNSELOR ASKS WHETHER SHE'S

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
READY TO TALK ABOUT WHY SHE'S

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
REALLY THERE.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY YOU THINK

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
YOU'RE HERE WITH US?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
OKAY.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
SUMMER, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
SEXUALLY ACTIVE IN THE PAST?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
OKAY.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
MARYHURST IS A RESIDENTIAL

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR GIRLS

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
STRUGGLING WITH THE TOUGHEST

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.000
CHILDHOODS.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
THIS IS ONE OF THE YOUNGEST

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
GIRLS EVER TO ENTER.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.000
OKAY.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY OF --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
HER NAME IS SUMMER.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
SHE IS ALTERNATELY SCARED AND

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
HIGH SPIRITED, SHY AND PLAYFUL.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
HER ROOM WOULD SUGGEST SHE'S

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
JUST ANOTHER AMERICAN PRETEEN.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
ON THE WALL, JESSICA SIMPSON,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
JESSICA ALBA, AND HER CRUSH TOBY

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
KEITH.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
WHY DO YOU LIKE TOBY KEITH?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
'CAUSE HE'S CUTE.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
PLUS I WANT TO MARRY HIM ONE

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
DAY.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
UH-HUH.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
HE'LL PROBABLY BE 70 YEARS

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
OLD.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
JUST LIKE ANY 11-YEAR-OLD

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
GIRL UNTIL YOU HEAR SUMMER'S

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.000
STORY.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
SHE GREW UP IN A HOME WHERE THE

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
KIDS SAY THEIR MOTHER USED

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.000
DRUGS.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
THE HOUSE HAD HOLES IN THE

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
FLOOR.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
AND SO MANY COCKROACHES THEY

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
EMBEDDED INSIDE SUMMER'S EARS

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
AND HAD TO BE SURGICALLY

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
REMOVED.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I COULD FEEL THE COCKROACHES.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
LOT OF DEAD ANIMALS IN THE

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.000
HOUSE.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
SOCIAL WORKERS WENT INTO THE

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
HOME, AND THERE WAS A RAW DEER

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
LAYING ON THE KITCHEN TABLE.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
AND THE KIDS WERE CUTTING PIECES

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
OF THE DEER OFF AND EATING IT

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
RAW.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
YOU COULD SEE EVERY BONE IN

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
MY BODY, EVERY ONE.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
WHERE DID YOU GET RAW DEER

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.000
MEAT?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
IT WAS ON THE ROAD.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
MOM GOT IT.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
AND JUST BROUGHT IT AND LEFT

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
IT WILL THERE?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
SHE WAS SCARED TO DEATH TO BE

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
AROUND ANY MALE FIGURE

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
WHATSOEVER.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
SOCIAL WORKERS SAY SUMMER

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
TOLD THEM HOW SHE'D BEEN BEATEN

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
AND OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY MEN WHO

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
CAME TO SEE HER MOTHER.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
AND YOU WERE HOW OLD?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.000
6.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
AND YOU DON'T LIKE MEN

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
BECAUSE WHAT?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
THEY'RE MEAN.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
THEY JUST ARE.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
THEY'RE BUILT LIKE THAT.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
BUILT TO BE MEAN, BUILT TO BE

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.000
STRONG.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
THE MEYERS WHO HAVE FOSTERED

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
MORE THAN 20 CHILDREN SAY THEY

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
WERE UNPREPARED FOR WHAT SUMMER

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
HAD LEARNED.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
AND SHE WAS STANDING IN THE

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
FLOOR DANCING LIKE -- AS IF SHE

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
WAS DOING A STRIPTEASE IN FRONT

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
OF OUR GRANDSON.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
THEY SAY WHEN SHE PLAYED WITH

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
DOLLS, THEY WERE IN SEXUAL

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.000
POSITIONS.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
WHEN I SAY, WHERE DO YOU SEE

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
THAT?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
WELL, I USED TO SEE MOM AND --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
SO-AND-SO.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
-- SO-AND-SO NAKED ON THE BED

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
ALL TIME.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
THE MOTHER WAS HAVING SEX AND

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
THE KIDS WERE ALL WATCHING.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
AND THE THINGS DONE TO A

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILD CAN TAKE

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
ON A TERRIBLE LIFE OF THEIR OWN.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
SUMMER TELLS ME WHY SHE'S REALLY

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
AT MARYHURST.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
THIS IS NOT MY STORY.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
SHE SAYS SHE'S TRYING HARD TO

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
STOP, BUT SHE'S HAD A PROBLEM,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
TOUCHING OTHER LITTLE KIDS,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
WANTING TO DO TO THEM WHAT WAS

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.000
DONE TO HER.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
BECAUSE I COULD RELAPSE

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
AGAIN.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
YOU THINK SO?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
WHAT SORT OF THING DO YOU

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
THINK MIGHT MAKE YOU DO THAT?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
JUST SEEING A 3-YEAR-OLD.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
AND WHY -- WHY WOULD A YOUNG

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
KID MAKE YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AND DO YOU THINK IT IS

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
SOMETHING THAT YOU DO BECAUSE

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.000
YOU'RE ANGRY OR SOMETHING THAT

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
YOU DO BECAUSE YOU'RE CURIOUS?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
CURIOUS.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
AND SOME BECAUSE ANGRY.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
SOME BECAUSE I WANT TO GET

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
AS PART OF THERAPY, SHE

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
WRITES GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
ABOUT THOSE FANTASIES, CLEARLY

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
THINGS ONLY ADULTS COULD HAVE

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
TAUGHT.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
MAYBE SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE OR

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
EVEN SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
HURTFUL, BUT YOU RIGHT THAT --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
WRITE THAT DOWN AND THEN YOU

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.000
DON'T DO IT.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I SEE.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
SUMMER ALSO WRITES LETTERS,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
NEVER SENT, TO THOSE WHO

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
SEXUALLY ABUSED HER.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
YOU CAN READ IT.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
"DEAR" AND I WON'T SAY THE

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
NAME, "I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.000
FELT --."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
YOU CAN READ IT KIND OF LIKE

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.000
LOWER.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
LIKE LOW.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.000
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT TO

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
KNOW THE STORY OF THESE KIDS

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO HEAR.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
JUDY LAMBETH IS THE PRESIDENT

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
AND CEO OF MARYHURST WHICH IS

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
ONE OF THE FEW CENTERS IN THE

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
COUNTRY DEDICATED TO THE MOST

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
ABUSED AND DAMAGED BOYS AND

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.000
GIRLS.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
THOSE WHOSE PROBLEMS WOULD KEEP

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THEM BOUNCING FROM FOSTER HOME

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
TO FOSTER HOME.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
HERE 600 CHILDREN A YEAR ARE

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
EACH SURROUNDED AND SUPPORTED BY

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A TEAM OF SPECIALISTS.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
STORIES, DON'T YOU JUST DESPAIR

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
AND MOST THE WORLD, IT WOULD BE

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
HARD FOR THEM TO BELIEVE THAT

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
THIS HAPPENS TO CHILDREN AND

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
THAT SOMETIMES AT THE HANDS OF

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.000
THEIR PARENTS.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHO -- OF

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
MEETING THEM AND SEEING THEM,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
YOU SEE THE HOPE.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
HOPE FOR SUMMER.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
IN ART CLASS, COUNSELORS HELP

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
HER MAKE A TEDDY BEAR OF

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.000
PAPIER-MACHE.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
THEN SHE HEAD BACK TO HER ROOM

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
TO BATTLE WITH THESE DEMONS.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I GET MAD, ANGRY, SAD.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.000
FRUSTRATED.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
SHE'S AN 11-YEAR-OLD KID WITH A

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
DISTRACTION.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
YOU HAVE LONG EYELASHES JUST

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
LIKE ME.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
YOU HAVE GORGEOUS EYELASHES.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
YOU REALLY DO.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
ARE THEY FAKE OR REAL?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.000
THEY'RE FAKE.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
THEY ARE?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
UH-HUH.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I WANT TO SEE WHAT THEY LOOK

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.000
LIKE.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
YOU CAN TAKE THEM OFF.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
JUST GO PEEL THEM OFF.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
EW!

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
GOOD MORNING, IT'S MISS AMERICA.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
WELL, SORT OF LIKE THAT.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
YEAH.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.000
NIGHT FALLS AND SUMMER

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
PREPARES TO GO TO SLEEP.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I LIKE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I TURN ON THE MUSIC.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
SHE LIKES MUSIC WHEN SHE

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
SLEEPS, HER FAVORITE LULLABY

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
SHE'S GOING TO SEE HER MOM

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.000
AND DAD.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
SHE STARTS CRYING.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
THE FIRST TIME SHE PRAYS FOR

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
HELP AND THE LORD TAKES THE

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.000
WHEEL.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
* JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL *

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
SUMMER HAS MEMORIES OF WHAT

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
WAS DONE TO HER IN THE DARK.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
SHE SLEEPS ON THE FLOOR WHERE

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
THE LIGHT SEEPS IN UNDER THE

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
DOOR.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
AND FOR TONIGHT, NO ONE CAN

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
SNEAK IN AND HURT HER.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
GOOD NIGHT, SUMMER.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
GOOD NIGHT.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
NICE MEETING YOU.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
YOU TOO.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
* SAVE ME FROM THIS ROAD I'M ON

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL *

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
LATER, A DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENT

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
FOR SUMMER.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
AND BEFORE TONIGHT IS OVER, WE

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
WILL FIND HER BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
BUT AFTER THIS NEXT BREAK,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
CHILDREN WHO RAISE THESE

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
QUESTIONS, HOW MANY CHANCES DO

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
YOU GIVE A PARENT TO CHANGE?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
ESPECIALLY YOU CAN TAKE THE

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
CHILDREN AWAY BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:05.000
AWAY THEIR LOVE.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.000
THIS IS WHITNEY.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I MET HER AT THE LITTLE

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
MARYHURST STORE WHERE A FORMER

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
FOSTER CHILD HAS A PICTURE OP

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
THE WALL.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO SHE

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
WAS?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:13.000
NO IDEA.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
IT'S MARILYN MONROE.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
SHE HAD A TOUGH CHILDHOOD, YOU

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000
KNOW.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
SHE HAD A REALLY TOUGH TIME.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DID.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
PEOPLE LIKE 14-YEAR-OLD

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
WHITNEY, WHO HAS LIVED THE

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF AMERICAN

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
FOSTER CARE.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
LIKE THEY WOULD NAIL MY

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
WINDOW DOWN, AND I WOULD TRY TO

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
JUMP OFF THE ROOF.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE NOBODY

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
WANTED ME.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
DAMAGED KIDS ACTING OUT, AND

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
FOSTER PARENTS WHO DON'T HAVE TO

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
KEEP THEM, SO THE KIDS WERE

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
OFTEN SENT FROM HOME TO HOME,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
SCHOOL TO SCHOOL.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WHITNEY TO FIVE FOSTER CARE

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
PLACEMENTS WHILE SHE WAITS FOR A

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
MOM WHO KEEPS GOING ON AND OFF

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
COCAINE AND OTHER DRUGS.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
WHITNEY HAS EVEN CUT HERSELF,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
CERTAIN SHE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
HER MOTHER'S TROUBLE.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
IT WAS MY DECISION TO SKIP

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.000
SCHOOL.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I CAN BE A VERY SWEET PERSON,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
AND I CAN BE A REALLY MEAN

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
PERSON.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
BUT MOSTLY IT'S ALL SWEET.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
SHE'S INCREDIBLY ATTACHED TO

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
HER MOM AND A LOT OF IT IS

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS SHE'S HAD

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
TO PARENT HER MOM.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
THEN ONE DAY, WHITNEY LEARNS

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THAT HER MOTHER IS NOW IN JAIL,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
AND SHE'LL GET A CHANCE TO SEE

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
HER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000
MONTHS.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
YOU LOOK SO WONDERFUL.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.000
HI.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
HI.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
IN THE FACE OF A LITTLE GIRL,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
SO MUCH YEARNING.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I'LL BE GOING TO MY DRUG

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
PLACE, DRUG REHAB, AND THEN

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AFTER THAT, I'LL BE OUT.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
IT'S LIKE STARTING ALL OVER

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
AGAIN, ANEW.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
WE'RE GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
WE'RE GONNA ACT DIFFERENT.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
WE'RE GONNA BE HAPPY.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
AND SAFE AND DRUG-FREE.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
AND WHITNEY BELIEVES HER ONE

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
MORE TIME.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
BY THE WAY, HER MOTHER IS ALSO A

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
PRODUCT OF FOSTER CARE.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
SAY YOUR PRAYERS EVERY NIGHT.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
AND YOU'RE LOOKING MORE LIKE ME

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
EVERY DAY.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
OKAY.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
I LOVE YOU.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
LOVE YOU.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:18.000
LOVE YOU.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
LATER.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
LATER.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
AS THE GATES SLAM SHUT,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
WHITNEY HEADS OFF TO HER SIXTH

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
FOSTER CARE HOME TO WAIT ONCE

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
MORE.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
BY THE WAY, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
AMONG FOSTER KIDS, POSTTRAUMATIC

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
STRESS IS TWICE THAT OF WAR

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
VETERANS, 52% END UP WITH MENTAL

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
HEALTH PROBLEMS.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN SALEM,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
OREGON, ANOTHER CHILD WITH A

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
STRANGE HISTORY.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.000
CLEANING.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
HE IS A 3-YEAR-OLD WITH

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
ANOTHER MOTHER A METH

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
AMPHETAMINE ADDICT AND ANOTHER

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
SET OF PROMISES.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I'M NOT GOING TO TOUCH THAT

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
[ BLEEP ] EVER AGAIN.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
FATHER FORGIVE ME.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
AND I PROMISE TO THE LORD THAT

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I'LL NEVER TOUCH THAT STUFF

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
AGAIN, AND I'LL GET HELP.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
SHE'S ALREADY HAD THREE

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
THIS IS HER FOURth.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
HE WOULD LICK WATER UP OFF

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.000
THE FLOOR.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I THOUGHT THIS POOR BABY HAS

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
BEEN LEFT ALONE WITH AN ANIMAL.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
THIS IS THE FOSTER MOTHER WHO

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
SAYS WHEN SHE GOT THE

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
3-YEAR-OLD, HE WOULD ROLL ON HIS

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
BACK AND PANT.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
THE MOTHER DENIES IT, BUT WAS

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
HIS REAL CARE-TAKER THE DOG

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
WALKING AROUND THE LIVING ROOM?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
AND HE KEST DOING ALL THESE

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
AUGUST DA-LIKE BEHAVIORS.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
-- DOING ALL THESE DOG-LIKE

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.000
BEHAVIORS.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I HANDED HIM A SPOON AND HE HAD

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.000
NO CLUE.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I'D

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
GET UP, AND HE'D BE SITTING ON

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
THE FRONT PORCH LIKE A DOG AND

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
HE'D WATCH THE TRAFFIC GO BY.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
SO HOW MANY TRANCES WOULD

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
YOU -- CHANCES WOULD YOU GIVE

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
THIS CHILD'S PARENT?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
THIS IS JUDGE ABERNATHY WHO'S

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
SEEN TOO MANY BEFORE AND AFTER

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
FACES OF METHAMPHETAMINE USERS

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
AND SHE'S SEEN THE HOUSES IN

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
WHICH SOME OF THE PARENTS LIVE

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
WITH THEIR KIDS.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THEN THERE'S USUALLY HUMAN

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
POOP ON THE FLOOR.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
NOTHING TO EAT.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
THERE IS DRUG PARAPHERNALIA.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
IT IS A HELL HOLE.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
IT IS A HELL HOLE.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
SO EVEN THOUGH FEDERAL LAW

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
GIVES A PARENT AT LEAST 15

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
MONTHS TO STRAIGHTEN UP AND GET

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
BACK A CHILD, OREGON NOW HAS A

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
LAW THAT ALLOWS TERMINATION OF

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
PARENTAL RATES TO BEGIN RIGHT

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
AWAY, NO EXTRA CHANCES IN THE

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
WORST OF THE METH HOUSES.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I ALWAYS JUST REMIND PEOPLE,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
YOU WERE 7 YEARS OLD.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
WHERE WOULD YOU GO?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
WHO DO YOU TALK TO?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000

STAYED SOBER, HE COULD SEE THEM

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
BOTH HOWARD AND HIS KIDS WERE

SURROUNDED BY HELPING HANDS,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
BECAUSE THEY HAD PARENTS AND I

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
DIDN'T.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
AMANDA WAS 11 WHEN RELATIVES

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
INTRODUCED HER TO DRUGS AND

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
ALCOHOL MASKING THE PAIN,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
CREATING A CRAVING.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
A FAMILY FRIEND HAS INVITED HER

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
TO VISIT.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
AMANDA CALLS TO SAY, COULD YOU

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
HIDE THE PAINKILLERS?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU IF YOU

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
CAN KEEP THEM OUT OF MY SIGHT,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
KEEP THEM LOCKED UP.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I CAN DO THAT.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
IT WOULD HELP A LOT.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
HONEY, YOU KNOW I KNOW WHAT

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
SHE NEEDS FAMILY.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
SHE'S HAD A ROUGH LIFE.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
BUT WE KEPT SEEING GIRLS LIKE

AND THEN SELF-DESTRUCTION.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
THAT YOU DON'T GO TO MARYHURST

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000

SHE CALMLY ANALYZES HERSELF.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I'M A TROUBLED CHILD.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000

MOST FOR ARE THOSE WHO ARE AGING

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000

SHE THINKS SHE IS GOING HOME.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
THAT'S WHAT SHE'S EXPRESSED TO

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
ME.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
WE'VE KNOWN FOR SEVERAL

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
HAPPEN.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000
SALLY AND HER HUSBAND, WAYNE,

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING BECAUSE

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
SHE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED ARE JUST

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
TOO MUCH FOR THEM TO HANDLE.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
THEY HAVE OTHER KIDS IN THE

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
HOUSE.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000

CAMERAS AND MOTION DETECTORS AND

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
THAT TYPE OF THING IN OUR HOME.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
ALL IT TAKES IS ONE CHILD TO

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
MAKE ONE ACCUSATION, AND YOU'VE

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
RUINED A FAMILY.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
THE MEYERS HAVE CONCERN ABOUT

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
WHETHER SUMMER WILL EVER BE ABLE

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
TO COME HOME AGAIN.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
SO WE WATCH AS SUMMER COMES INTO

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
THE ROOM WITH A PRESENT FOR HER

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.000
ADOPTIVE MOM.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
SOMETHING I MADE FOR YOU.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
UNAWARE THAT SHE'S ABOUT TO

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
HEAR CRUSHING NEWS.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
SUMMER, DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
QUESTIONS FOR US TODAY?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.000
YEAH.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
OKAY.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
LIKE START REQUESTING SOME HOME

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.000
PASSES.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT ON

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
HOLD FOR A MINUTE.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
OR?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.000
YOUR SCHOOL REPORTS ARE

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
EXCELLENT.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
BUT SUMMER IS NOT FOOLED BY

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
THE COMPLIMENTS.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
YOU CAN SEE IT IN HER FACE.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
SHE CAN SENSE EVEN BEFORE THE

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
WORDS HER LIFE IS ABOUT TO

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
UNRAVEL.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000
AGAIN.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE ANOTHER

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
THREE MONTHS UNTIL WE DECIDE

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
WHAT CAN BE DONE.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
NO MORE FOSTER HOMES?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I WANT TO GO HOME.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
BUT IT'S UNSAFE AT HOME.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
WHY IS IT UNSAFE?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
WHAT DO YOU DO?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
ACT OUT.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.000
UH-HUH.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
IT'S THAT IMPULSE TOWARD

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
INAPPROPRIATE TOUCHING, THE

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
KIDS, THE MEN IN HER HOME.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
IS IT SAFE FOR THEM TO BRING

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
YOU BACK HOME?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
NO.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
OKAY.i]

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
BUT I WANT TO GO HOME.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING FOR US?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
OKAY.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
BACK OUTSIDE, SUMMER LOOKS

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
FOR COMFORT AS COMFORT FADES.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
TAKE ONE DAY AT A TIME, OKAY?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
OKAY?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
LOOK OVER THERE.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
HMM?

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.000
LOOK OVER THERE.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
LOOK OVER WHERE?

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
THE YELLOW FLOWERS.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
MM-HMM.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
WE WERE CURIOUS ABOUT

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
SUMMER'S BIOLOGICAL MOTHER AND

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
WHAT SHE WOULD SAY ABOUT THE

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
DAMAGE DONE IN SUMMER'S YOUNG

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.000
LIFE.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[ DOG BARKING ]

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
WE FOUND HER, NOT FAR FROM

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
MARYHURST, SUMMER'S BIOLOGICAL

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
MOM, SHOWING THE TOYS FROM HER

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
KIDS AND DENYING THAT SHE

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
NEGLECTED THEM.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
AS FAR AS THE SEXUAL ABUSE

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
PART OF IT, I DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
IT'S COMING FROM.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
TOUCHED SUMMER, IT HAS TO BE

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
SINCE THEY TOOK HER AWAY FROM

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
ME.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
AND WHAT ABOUT THE DRUGS?

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
AND I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
JUST BECAUSE I'M ON CAMERA.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
I GOT HOOKED ON DRUGS PRETTY

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.000
BAD.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
METHAMPHETAMINES WAS ONE OF THE

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
MAJOR THINGS I GOT HOOKED ON.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
AND IT WAS BAD.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
AND DESPITE WHAT SUMMER HAS

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
SAID ABOUT THE HOME AND SUMMER'S

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
STRUGGLES, THE BIOLOGICAL MOTHER

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
SAYS SHE'D LIKE A CHANCE TO BE

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
HER MOM AGAIN.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
I'D DO ANYTHING IN THE WORLD

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
JUST TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
BACK.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
AND BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU, WE

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
THOUGHT WE'D TELL YOU WHAT HAS

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
HAPPENED TO SOME OF THE KIDS YOU

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
MET HERE TONIGHT.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
MANY OF THEM STILL PRAYING FOR

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
SOMEBODY TO LOVE WHO WILL LOVE

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
THEM BACK.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT I'M

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
A REALLY GOOD PERSON, AND I'M

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
EASY TO GET ALONG WITH.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
MY IDEA OF A FAMILY IS A

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
MOTHER AND A FATHER, A

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
STEPFATHER, WHATEVER, THAT CARES

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
FOR YOU AND LOVES YOU AND A

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
BROTHER AND SISTER THAT WANT TO

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
SEE YOU EVERY DAY.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
I HOPE TO BE ADOPTED SO THAT

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
I CAN BECOME LIKE A CHEERLEADER,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
SOCIAL WORKER, SOMEONE WHO CAN

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
ACHIEVE IN HERE LIFE AND NOT BE

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
THE PERSON WHO JUST DOES DRUGS

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
AND SITS AROUND ALL THE TIME.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
AND SUMMER STILL WAITING FOR

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:15.000
WORD ON HER FUTURE.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
**

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
BUT WE HAVE GOOD NEWS, TOO.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
THAT 3-YEAR-OLD WHO SEEMED TO

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
HAVE LEARNED BEHAVIOR FROM THE

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
FAMILY DOG HIS FOSTER MOTHER

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
SAYS HE'S THRIVING.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
I WISH PEOPLE REALIZE WHEN

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
THEY GET THESE CHILDREN AND THEY

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
START SHOWING THEM STRUCTURE,

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
THEY START SHOWING THEM LOVE,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
THE CHANCES OF THE LONG-TERM

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
DISABILITIES REALLY LESSENS.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
IT REALLY DOES.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
AND WHAT AND ISMAEL?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
HE WAS ADOPTED.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
I'M HEALTHIER, HAPPIER.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
IT'S LIKE A NEW START.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
SO WAS TIFFANY.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
AND DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS LITTLE

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.000
FACE?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
LOOK AT ME.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
I STILL TURNED OUT GREAT.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
LITTLE JAMES, ADOPTED BY GAY

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
PARENTS, TWO DADS.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I DIDN'T CARE THAT I HAD TWO

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
DADS.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I JUST CARED THAT THEY LOVED ME.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
THAT'S THE SAME JAMES YOU SAW

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
HERE TONIGHT.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
RAY AND MIKE ARE VERY, VERY

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
LOVING PARENTS.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
AND THEY'VE HELPED ME A LOT.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
A TESTAMENT TO WHAT LOVE CAN

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
DO FOUR YEARS LATER.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS, I

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
SAID, HEY, MAYBE THESE PEOPLE

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
WON'T GIVE UP ON ME.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:40.000

A CHILD WAITING FOR YOU?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000

CHILDREN.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
THESE ARE AMERICA'S FORGOTTEN

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
KIDS, OLDER CHILDREN WHOSE

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
CHANCES OF BEING ADOPTED FALL

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
DRAMATICALLY WITH EVERY NEW

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.000
BIRTHDAY.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
FAMILIES NOT WILLING TO GIVE

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
THEM A HOME AND A CHANCE AT

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
HAPPINESS, BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
OLD.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
NOW THOUGH, THAT PICTURE IS

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
HERE'S ABC'S BOB BROWN.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
SOMETIMES A LENS SEES THINGS

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.000
PEOPLE DON'T.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
SOMETIMES IT SEES THE SUBTLE

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
SPLENDOR IN LANDSCAPES THAT

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
WOULD HAVE VANISHED IN A SECOND

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
FROM A CAR WINDOW.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
SOMETIMES IT SEES POSSIBILITIES

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE GONE

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:43.000
UNNOTICED.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
SHE DID NOT SHOW THAT SIDE OF

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
HERSELF TO ME, UNTIL REALLY THE

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
SECOND THAT I TOOK THAT ONE

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
PICTURE.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
BUT I CHOSE THAT ONE, BECAUSE

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
IT SHOWED HER INNER STRENGTH,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
AND HER DIGINITY.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
AND JUST A REALLY STRONG

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
CHARACTER, THAT YOU SENSED IN

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
HER RIGHT AWAY.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
HAVE NOW HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
JACKIE HAD WHEN SHE LOOKED AT

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
THE PORTRAIT SHE TOOK OF FAYE, A

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
GIRL IN FOSTER CARE.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
IN CITIES THROUGHOUT AMERICA,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
ART GALLERIES AND PUBLIC SPACES

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
HAVE MOUNTED STUNNING

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
EXHIBITIONS OF CHILDREN'S

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
PORTRAITS TAKEN BY SOME OF THE

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS AND BEST

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
PAID PHOTOGRAPHERS.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
THEY'RE ALL WORKING FOR NOTHING

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
USING THEIR TALT ENTS TO BRING

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
OUT QUALITIES THAT OTHERWISE MAY

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
HAVE GONE UNDISCOVERED FOR

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
JACKIE WHO LIVES IN SANTA FE WAS

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
ONE OF THOSE PHOTOGRAPHERS.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
IT SOFTENS YOU UP INSIDE, YOU

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.000
KNOW?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
IT MAKES A SOFT PLACE INSIDE OF

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.000
YOU.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000
AND IT HUMBLES YOU, BECAUSE YOU

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
TAKE FOR GRANTED WHAT YOU HAVE.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
THE PROJECT, WHICH HAS GAINED

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
SO MUCH MOMENTUM, THAT ITS

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
FOUNDER PREFERS TO DESCRIBE IT

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
AS A MOVEMENT, IS CALLED THE

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
HEART GALLERY.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
THE IDEA ORIGINATED ONLY FIVE

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
YEARS AGO IN SANTA FE, WHERE A

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHER SUGGESTED IT

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
TO DIANE GRANIDO OF THE MEXICO

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
YOUTH AND FAMILIES DEPARTMENT.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
SPACE WAS DONATED BY THE GERALD

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
PETER'S GALLERY IN SANTA FE,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
WHICH CONTINUES TO HOST

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:20.000
EXHIBITS.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
BECAUSE OLDER CHILDREN ARE THE

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
MOST DIFFICULT TO PLACE WITH

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
ADOPTIVE FAMILIES, THEY ARE THE

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
FOCUS OF WHAT THE EXHIBIT'S ALL

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:26.000
ABOUT.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
IMPROVING THE RATE OF ADOPTION

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
BY HUMANIZING THE CHILDREN.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
WHAT KINDS OF PICTURES WERE

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
THE TYPICAL PICTURES BEFORE THIS

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
PROJECT CAME INTO BE?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
THE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE THE KIND

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
THAT YOU MIGHT GET TAKEN AT

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:40.000
SCHOOL.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
WHERE THE CHILD HAS HIS OR HER

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
HAIR, YOU KNOW, SLICKED BACK,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
AND THEY'RE PROPPED IN FRONT OF

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
A FAKE BACK DROP.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
IT DOESN'T EXPRESS THE

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
INDIVIDUALALITY OF THE CHILD AT

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:51.000
ALL.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:58.000
THEY'RE ALMOST INTERCHANGEABLE.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
IN THESE EXHIBITS, EVERY

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
PHOTO IS UNIQUE.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
BUT THE REAL MAGIC HAPPENS

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
WHEN PEOPLE TAKE THE TIME TO

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
STOP AND LOOK INTO THE EYES OF

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
EACH CHILD, AND ACTUALLY APPLY

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
TO ADOPT THE CHILD, BECAUSE OF

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
THE CONNECTION THEY FELT WITH

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
THIS PORTRAIT OF THE CHILD.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
THERE ARE MORE THAN 80 HEART

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
GALLERY ORGANIZATIONS IN 40

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
STATES, AND IN SOMEPLACES, THE

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
ADOPTION RATE AFTER AN EXHIBIT

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
IS MORE THAN DOUBLE THE

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
NATIONWIDE RATE OF ADOPTION FROM

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.000
FOSTER CARE.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
IF YOU PUSH THIS BUTTON, THAT

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
STARTS RECORDING.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
NAJLAH FEANNY IS A PHOTO

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
JOURNALIST WHO ASSEMBLED A WHO'S

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
WHO OF PHOTOGRAPHY FOR THE NEW

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
JERSEY HEART GALLERY.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
I WAS STUNNED AT THE

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
EMOTIONAL LEVEL OF SOME OF THESE

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
CHILDREN, HAVING JUST MET A

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
PHOTOGRAPHER, AND AN HOUR LATER

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
SAYING, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
WOW.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
ONE LITTLE GIRL SAID THIS IS

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
BILLY HAD BEEN IN FOSTER CARE

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
NEARLY TEN YEARS WHEN WE MET

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.000
HIM.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO BE

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:55.000
DISCOVERED.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
I'D BE VERY, VERY, VERY

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
HAPPY.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
I'D BE HAPPY MORE THAN ANYTHING.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
BECAUSE I CAN FINALLY GO HOME,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
AND I CAN FINALLY STAY PUT, AND

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
MAKE SOME FRIENDS THAT I CAN

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
ACTUALLY STAY WITH FOR A WHILE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS IN

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
LIFE THAT NOT MANY 13-YEAR-OLD

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
KIDS HAVE SEEN.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
SUCH AS?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
SUCH AS MY PARENTS FIGHTING A

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.000
LOT.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
BEING SEPARATED FROM MY SISTERS.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
YOU HAVE A TWIN?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
UH-HUH.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
BUT YOU DON'T LIVE WITH YOUR

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
TWIN?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
HUH-UH.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
AND IF HE SEES THIS, TELL HIM I

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
LOVE HIM.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM MY MOTHER

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
FOR FIVE YEARS NOW, AND I'VE

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
BEEN IN FOSTER CARE FOR A LONG

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
TIME.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
KIND OF WORRIED ABOUT GETTING A

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
FAMILY AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
BE ABLE TO TREAT ME.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
THE THING THAT CHANGED ME THE

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
MOST, IS TO SEE THESE KIDS

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
REALLY TRYING SO HARD TO FIND

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
PARENTS.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
OPEN YOUR EYES JUST A LITTLE

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
BIT MORE.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
MARTIN SCHOELLER IS A WORLD

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
FAMOUS PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHER.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
NO FIGHTING HERE.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
HIS RECENT SUBJECTS INCLUDE

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
ACADEMY AWARD WINNER, JAMIE

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.000
FOXX.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
NOW HE'S SHOOTING COURTENEY AND

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
VINCENT, BROTHER AND SISTER.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
AND HE HAD HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
MANY OF THESE KIDS DIDN'T SMILE

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
A LOT.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
BUT SCHOELLER KNOWS THAT ONE OF

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
THE HOPED FOR RESULTS IS TO GET

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
SIBLINGS ADOPTED TOGETHER.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
HE WANTS A PICTURE SHOWING THEIR

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:23.000
RELATIONSHIP.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
I THINK IT TOOK ME ABOUT 20

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
MINUTES TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
SMILE OUT OF HIM.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
THAT'S GREAT.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
THAT'S GREAT.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
OKAY, LET'S TAKE YOUR JACKET

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.000
OFF.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
ERICA BERGER SHOOTS

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
CELEBRITIES FOR "PEOPLE

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.000
MAGAZINE."

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
THING FOR ME WHEN I WAS WORKING

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
WITH THEM IS TO TRY TO FIGURE

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
OUT VERY QUICKLY WHAT THEIR MOOD

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
WAS AND THEN GO WITH THAT.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO!

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
AND DAVID BERGMAN, HE WENT

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
FOR ACTION PHOTOS.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
HE WORKS FOR "SPORTS

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.000
ILLUSTRATED."

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
THAT'S G.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
I TRY TO GET THEM JUST TO

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.000
PLAY.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
OH MY GOD, THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
THEY KIND OF FORGET ABOUT THE

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
CAMERA, AND THE LIGHTS AND ALL

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
THE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
AND I CAN JUST CAPTURE THEM IN A

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
FUN MOMENT.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
GO.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
ISAIAH, THE SUBJECT OF THIS

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
BERGMAN PHOTOGRAPH HAS NOW BEEN

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
PLACED WITH A FAMILY.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
NANASHKA ALSO FOUND A FAMILY.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
AFTER THESE PHOTOS WERE

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
EXHIBITED IN NEW JERSEY, THE

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
STATE'S DIVISION OF IMRIEWGHT

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
AND FAMILY SERVICES SAID IT HAD

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
EXPERIENCED A 280% INCREASE IN

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
ADOPTION INQUIRIES FROM 800 TO

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
MORE THAN 3,000, COMPARED TO THE

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
SAME PERIOD THE YEAR BEFORE.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
WILL YOU DO ONE MORE PICTURE?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.000
NICE.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
FAYE WAS 10 YEARS OLD, AND

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
HAD BEEN IN FIVE FOSTER HOMES IN

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
NEW MEXICO WHEN JACKIE WAS

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
RECRUITED TO PHOTOGRAPH HER FOR

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
THE HEART GALLERY.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
FAYE'S EXPERIENCE HAD GIVEN HER

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
AN ACTIVE IMAGINATION AS A KIND

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000
OF PROTECTIVE DEVICE.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
SHE, A LOT OF THE TIME DIDN'T

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
HAVE SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE CARE

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.000
OF HER.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
WHENEVER FAYE HAD A BAD

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
CREAM, SHE TOLD ME.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
SHE WOULD JUST GO BACK AND DREAM

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
IT OVER AGAIN.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
WELL, I USUALLY USE IT TO

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
MAKE UP THINGS, LIKE IF

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
SOMETHING'S NOT GOING RIGHT, I

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
CAN JUST LIKE GO BACK, AND INTO

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
MY IMAGINATION, AND MAKE IT LOOK

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:13.000
BETTER.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
JACKIE AND HER HUSBAND,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
COURTENEY HAVE A TEENAGE SON,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
JACKSON.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
THOUGH THEY HAD DISCUSSED

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
ADOPTING A CHILD, NOTHING HAD

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
COME OF IT.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
UNTIL THE DAY JACKIE

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
PHOTOGRAPHED FAYE, AND HAD TEARS

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
IN HER EYES ON THE DRIVE HOME.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
AND I THINK RIGHT THEN

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
SOMETHING CHANGED INSIDE OF ME,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.000
YOU KNOW?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I KNEW.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
TODAY, THE PORTRAIT OF FAYE

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
THAT HUNG IN THE SANTA FE HEART

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
GALLERY EXHIBIT, HANGS IN HER

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
OWN ROOM, IN THE MA DAY HOUSE.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
AND IN NOVEMBER OF 2005, THE

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
ENTIRE FAMILY, FAYE NOW

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
INCLUDED, TOOK A CONTRIBUTE TO

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
WASHINGTON FOR A NATIONAL EVENT

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:56.000
TO PROMOTE THE HEART GALLERY.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
JACKIE MATAY, AND HER HUSBAND

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
WOUND UP ADOPTING FAYE.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
WHEN I PHOTOGRAPHED FAYE, IT

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
WAS OBVIOUSLY A LIFE CHANGING

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:06.000
MOMENT FOR ME.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
AS THIS MOVEMENT HAS SPREAD,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
SO HAVE THE RESULTS.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
DIANE GRANITO ESTIMATES THAT BY

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
THE END OF 2006, 1,000 CHILDREN

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
WILL BE PLACED WITH FAMILIES,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
DIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THE

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
HEART GALLERY EXHIBITS, AND THE

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
PHOTOGRAPHS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
MOUNDED IN MORE THAN 80 SHOWS.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
NO ONE PRETENDS SUCH ADOPTIONS

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
ARE EASY, ESPECIALLY WITH OLDER

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.000
CHILDREN.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
PARENTS AND CHILD WIND UP

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
TESTING EACH OTHER THROUGH A

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
FOR THE CHILD, ONE KEY TO

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
ADJUSTING IS COME TO GO BELIEVE

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
SHE WON'T BE MOVED AGAIN.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
THAT SHE HAS A FAMILY FOR LIFE.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
SINCE IT'S BEEN ALMOST THREE

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
YEARS NOW, IT'S EASIER TO SEE

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
HOW TIME CHANGES THINGS, AND TO

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
JUST SEE THAT SHE HAS THAT

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
BELIEF NOW, GROWING IN HER, THAT

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.000
WELL, I AM HERE.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
THIS IS MY HOME.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I CAN LAY DOWN ON THE COUCH, AND

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
I CAN PLAY WITH THE DOG, AND I

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
CAN HAVE A WARM PLACE TO SLEEP.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
AND I'LL ALWAYS WAKE UP TO

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
THE SAME PLACE, AND IN MY BED.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
AND PHOTOGRAPHERS, THROUGH

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
THEIR LENSES HAVE SEEN AND

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
CAPTURED PICTURES THAT HAD SO

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
SO

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
OFTEN ESCAPED THE REST OF US, OF

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
CHILDREN WHO WERE NO LONGER

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
VIEWED AS WARDS OF THE STATE,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
BUT AS WORKS OF ART, AND MORE

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
AND MORE FREQUENTLY, AS MEMBERS

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
OF A FAMILY.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I THINK I GOT EVERYTHING I

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:27.000
WANT.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
AND WHAT WAS THAT?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
A LOVING FAMILY.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
BUT MOST OF THE CHILDREN WE

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
SAW BEING PHOTOGRAPHED,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
WHO NEVER FIND A FAMILY, IT'S

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
CALLED AGING OUT.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
RELEASED INTO THE WORLD TO DO

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
THE BEST THEY CAN.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
WHAT KIND OF FAMILY WOULD YOU

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:06.000

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
A FAMILY THAT'S LIKE --

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
THAT'S NOT LIKE ALWAYS FIGHTING

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
EVERY DAY.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
ADDICTION AND GOT HER KIDS BACK,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.000

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000
LOVE HER.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
AS NIGHT FALLS, SKY FACES

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
WHAT HE DREADS THE MOST, GOING

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
BACK TO THE HOME WHERE SHE

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000

EARLIER.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
SKY HAS TO ENFORCE A COURT ORDER

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000
TO TAKE THE CHILDREN AWAY TO

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
FOSTER CARE.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
THIS SHE ABSOLUTELY THE WORST

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
PART OF MY JOB.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT TAKING A

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
CHILD FROM THEIR MOTHER, THAT

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
JUST KIND OF SET -- IT'S OKAY TO

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
BE SAD.

IN THE BACKSEAT OF THIS CAR,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
THEY'RE JUST TINY FRIGHTENED

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
CASUALTIES.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
SHE HANDS THEM OVER TO A

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
STRANGER, TO A FOSTER CARE

PARENT.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
I BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN HAVE

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
A RIGHT TO EDUCATION, MEDICAL

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
IF THAT CAN'T HAPPEN, IN THE

HOME, WITH THEIR NATURAL

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
PARENTS, THEN THEY NEED TO BE

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.000
REMOVED.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000

PER DAY FOR CHILD.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
MANY OF THOSE HOMES ARE

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000

PLACED ON ALL OF US.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
CHILD, BUT IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
FOR BOTH OF US.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000

LONGING TO ADOPT HER.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
SHE HAD A SPARKLING BEDROOM.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
TOYS, AND A PET THAT SLEPT

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.000
PROTECTIVELY OUT OF HER.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
THIS WAS HER MOTHER.

FOSTER PARENTS.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
YOU COULD TELL THAT SARAH WAS

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
EXPOSED TO EXPLOSIVE VIOLENCE.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
SHE KNEW HOW TO CHOKE WITH BOTH

SHE HAD TERRIBLE NIGHTMARES.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:22.000
AGONY.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000

TERRIBLE FEELING.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
WE HAD NO CONFIDENCE THAT SHE

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000
WAS GOING TO A SAFE PLACE.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
