00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:44.999
Hello.<br/>

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:47.999
The subject of tonight's<br/>
program, August Wilson, has

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.918
won every Broadway prize there<br/>
is, including two Pulitzer

00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:53.999
Prizes for plays such as Fences,<br/>
Ma Rainey's Black

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.999
Bottom, and Joe Turner's<br/>
Come and Gone.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.999
August Wilson wasn't born<br/>
into a literary family.

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.999
He wasn't even born<br/>
August Wilson.

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.999
Freddie Kittel, his real name,<br/>
was born and grew up in a

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.999
black ghetto, the Hill District,<br/>
in Pittsburgh.

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.167
His father disappeared when he<br/>
was a baby, and his stepfather

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.999
had spent half his<br/>
life in prison.

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:14.999
Terry Knox's film shot in the<br/>
studios here in London and on

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.999
location in Pittsburgh shows how<br/>
August Wilson has used his

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.999
knowledge of the Hill District<br/>
to tell the story not only of

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.999
his own community, but of the<br/>
entire history of black people

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.125
in the United States throughout<br/>
this century.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:33.999
The fact is that as I was<br/>
growing up in Pittsburgh, I

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.999
could do nothing but write.<br/>

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.209
You say couldn't find a job.<br/>

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.999
I wasn't allowed to--<br/>

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:43.999
so many avenues of participation<br/>
in the society

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.999
that were blocked to me as a<br/>
black male, and they're still

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.999
blocked, and were blocked<br/>
to everyone.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.334
You see, but I could write.<br/>

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:54.751
And no one paid any<br/>
attention to the

00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:55.250
fact that I was writing.<br/>

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.999
No one cared that<br/>
I was writing.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.042
It was something that the<br/>
society permitted me to do.

00:02:00.042 --> 00:02:08.999
<br/>

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:10.876
Pittsburgh is one of<br/>
the richest cities

00:02:10.876 --> 00:02:11.999
in the United States.<br/>

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.999
Many of the great millionaires<br/>
such as Carnegie and Mellon,

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.999
made their fortunes there.<br/>

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.999
But there's another side<br/>
to Pittsburgh.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.999
Early in the century, many black<br/>
Americans, the sons and

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
daughters of newly released<br/>
slaves, began moving

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
northwards in a great migration,<br/>
fleeing from the

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.999
poverty and degradation<br/>
of the South.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.167
They settled in cities like<br/>
Detroit and Chicago and

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:31.999
Pittsburgh.<br/>

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:32.999
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:02:32.999 --> 00:03:16.083
<br/>

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:18.999
My mother came from Spear,<br/>
North Carolina.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.375
And she came from Spear, North<br/>
Carolina to Pittsburgh because

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:23.999
her mother was here.<br/>

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.209
My grandmother, whose name was<br/>
Zonia, which I used in my

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.999
play, Joe Turner's Come and<br/>
Gone, had walked from North

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.459
Carolina to Pittsburgh.<br/>

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.999
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:03:33.999 --> 00:04:01.999
<br/>

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.999
The African-Americans who came<br/>
to Pittsburgh settled in a

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.999
district called The Hill.<br/>

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.999
Now it's run down, torn apart<br/>
by drugs and urban

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:10.999
redevelopment.<br/>

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:12.999
But in its heyday, it was<br/>
as glamorous as Holly.

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.999
<br/>

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:20.999
Of course, then there was a<br/>
lively, creative scene prior

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.999
to the '60s.<br/>

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:25.999
Part of the lower hill at one<br/>
time was called Little Haiti.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.083
The center avenue and<br/>
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:30.999
were called the Crossroads<br/>
of the World.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.999
The number of jazz musicians<br/>
who have come out of

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.626
Pittsburgh is absolutely<br/>
astonishing.

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:41.999
Stanley Clarke, Ahmad Jamal,<br/>
Earl Gardner, Dakota Staton.

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:45.999
Just the name of Georgie Benson,<br/>
Stanley Turrentine

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:47.999
just to name a very few of<br/>
the ones that I know.

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.999
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:58.999
<br/>

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.999
There's still one place left<br/>
where the elegance of the old

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.834
Hill District.<br/>

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:04.999
The Crawford Grill has been one<br/>
of the great jazz venues

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.834
of America.<br/>

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:09.999
August Wilson has come here on<br/>
a return visit to Pittsburgh

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:11.999
to meet up with some of the<br/>
writers he grew up with on the

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.999
hill 30 years ago.<br/>

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:19.792
It was a group of artists who<br/>
came together around the

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:20.999
Halfway Art Gallery.<br/>

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.918
We had poetry readings with jazz<br/>
musicians, and there were

00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:28.999
myself, Nick Vannoy, Rob Penny<br/>
and Charlie Williams. The

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:30.999
painters painted and<br/>
the poets poeted.

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:39.999
<br/>

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.999
This is a poem I wrote<br/>
for my grandfather.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.626
And since I never knew my<br/>
grandfather, and speaking in a

00:05:45.626 --> 00:05:48.584
generational sense, this is<br/>
generational grandfather, so

00:05:48.584 --> 00:05:51.999
it was your grandfather,<br/>
Rob's, he's all of our

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.999
grandfather.<br/>

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.999
His chest stripped open<br/>
to reveal a raven--

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.626
huge with sharp talons.<br/>

00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:01.999
The song stuck in his throat.<br/>

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.999
And beneath the feathers,<br/>
beneath the shudder and rage,

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:09.999
the pages of a book closed and<br/>
the raven took flight.

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:11.999
<br/>

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.709
Bynum Cutler.<br/>

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:15.999
Savage.<br/>

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:17.959
Mule trainer.<br/>

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:18.999
Singer.<br/>

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:20.999
Shaper of wood and iron.<br/>

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.999
Bynum Cutler who spread his feet<br/>
over the nine counties in

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:26.999
North Carolina.<br/>

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:31.999
Seed carried in the wind by the<br/>
wind in the sails of ships

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:34.999
and planted among the king<br/>
break, among Georgia Pine,

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.999
among bowls of cotton, planted<br/>
in the fertile fields of women

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:41.999
who snapped open like<br/>
fresh berries.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:46.459
Like cities in full season<br/>
welcoming its architects and

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:49.999
ennobling them with<br/>
gifts of blood.

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:54.999
August was one of the young men<br/>
who used to frequent our

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.999
gallery there and listen<br/>
to poetry.

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:00.999
At that time he was a pretty<br/>
young man-- this is 1962 I'm

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.999
talking about.<br/>

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.292
And he would come into the<br/>
gallery and listen to such

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:11.667
poets as Charlie Williams,<br/>
Nicholas Vannoy, Gaston Neal,

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:15.999
Aamir Rasheed, poets who would<br/>
come and read on Sunday night

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:17.999
at our art gallery where we<br/>
had a little cultural.

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:21.999
Because at that time the '60s<br/>
were coming right out of the

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:23.999
beat generation and they<br/>
still had a lot of

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.999
coffee houses and stuff.<br/>

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:26.999
So we had like a coffee<br/>
house type

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:28.999
atmosphere where ports read.<br/>

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.792
And August was a young man who<br/>
come along with Rob Penny at

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:34.999
that time and they<br/>
would listen.

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.999
They weren't even allowed<br/>
to read at that time.

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:39.167
They would listen to<br/>
the big guys read.

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.999
<br/>

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:47.999
What that did for us, it gave<br/>
us a place, an art gallery,

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:52.999
which became a gathering place<br/>
for all the artists, the

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:54.999
intellectuals of<br/>
the community.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:58.999
Anyone who had anything to say<br/>
came to the Halfway Art

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:03.999
Gallery, and they discovered<br/>
a group of people who would

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.999
argue with you for sure, but<br/>
who would also support you.

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:10.999
And in this exchange of ideas<br/>
and this discovery of the

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.999
world that we all were<br/>
making at the time.

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:16.999
At the time I met him he was<br/>
actually going through the

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:18.959
process of changing<br/>
from Freddie

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.999
Kittel to August Wilson.<br/>

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:24.999
And August Wilson is<br/>
an identity he

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:25.999
selected for himself.<br/>

00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:29.999
But here again, this is in terms<br/>
of the social movement.

00:08:29.999 --> 00:08:32.999
We were all selecting new<br/>
identities for ourselves.

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:38.999
The world knows that Cassius<br/>
Clay selected Mohammad Ali.

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:42.542
The world knows that during this<br/>
time, black people were

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:45.999
changing their religion, they<br/>
were changing their names--

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:47.999
so-called slave identify.<br/>

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:48.999
1963.<br/>

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:51.999
In that time he's<br/>
writing poetry.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:56.542
He saw himself as a poet, he<br/>
acted as though he was a poet,

00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:59.042
and he wrote as though<br/>
he was a poet.

00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:01.999
And in fact, I saw him<br/>
as a poet now.

00:09:01.999 --> 00:09:02.999
I still do.<br/>

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:04.999
I think he's a very fine<br/>
poet, even today.

00:09:04.999 --> 00:09:11.876
<br/>

00:09:11.876 --> 00:09:14.751
How do we stay alive?<br/>

00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:15.584
Working.<br/>

00:09:15.584 --> 00:09:16.999
We both worked--<br/>

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:22.959
small jobs, being a porter,<br/>
washing dishes.

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:23.999
Hi there.<br/>

00:09:23.999 --> 00:09:30.999
<br/>

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:30.999
OK.<br/>

00:09:30.999 --> 00:09:31.999
How you doing?<br/>

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:33.999
I haven't seen you since<br/>
the other day.

00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:34.999
How have you been?<br/>

00:09:34.999 --> 00:09:35.999
Fabulous.<br/>

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:36.999
Good.<br/>

00:09:36.999 --> 00:09:39.083
Listen, I was just surprised<br/>
to hear about that story

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:41.999
you're doing on August Wilson.<br/>

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:45.999
When I first met August Wilson,<br/>
I was really shocked.

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:48.999
He was cooking at a restaurant<br/>
out in Oakland as a barbecue

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:51.999
man, so I said why don't you<br/>
come by and see me some time?

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:54.999
I was busy in the kitchen one<br/>
day and I looked out here, and

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:57.459
lo and behold, here he was.<br/>

00:09:57.459 --> 00:10:00.999
And I come out of the kitchen, I<br/>
says, did you come to see me

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:01.999
about a job?<br/>

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:03.999
He just nodded his head.<br/>

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:05.999
He really didn't answer.<br/>

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:10.999
I was going to put him to work<br/>
perhaps the same day.

00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:13.999
What he did, he sat in that<br/>
third booth, right where these

00:10:13.999 --> 00:10:16.999
gentlemen are sitting, and he<br/>
took out a notebook, he took

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:19.999
out a pencil and he<br/>
begin to write.

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:21.167
And I got upset.<br/>

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:24.999
When he began to write it<br/>
surprised me because he

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.999
started to write and he<br/>
looked like he wasn't

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:27.999
going to stop writing.<br/>

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:30.375
He wrote and he wrote<br/>
and he wrote.

00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:32.459
And I come out of the<br/>
kitchen and I

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:33.375
stopped him from writing.<br/>

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.959
I say, hey buddy, I said, I<br/>
ain't got no job for you.

00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:37.999
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:59.042
<br/>

00:10:59.042 --> 00:11:02.375
In the late 1960's, black<br/>
frustration at the lack of

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:05.792
progress of the Civil Rights<br/>
Movement led to outbreaks of

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:07.999
violence throughout the major<br/>
cities of the United States,

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:08.999
including Pittsburgh.<br/>

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:16.999
<br/>

00:11:16.999 --> 00:11:19.999
As an artist I felt that<br/>
I had to do something.

00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:25.125
And the way that I best could<br/>
participate was Rod Penny and

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:28.125
myself started a theater<br/>
that we called The

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.999
Black Horizons theatre.<br/>

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:32.999
And we started this theater that<br/>
the particular purpose of

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:36.918
raising the consciousness of<br/>
the people and politicizing

00:11:36.918 --> 00:11:38.999
the community, so that we could<br/>
all better understand

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:42.999
the situation that we found<br/>
ourselves in America, and how

00:11:42.999 --> 00:11:45.999
this related to our historical<br/>
situation.

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:49.999
And what steps we might possibly<br/>
take to alleviate

00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:52.834
that or to acquire some power.<br/>

00:11:52.834 --> 00:11:57.999
<br/>

00:11:57.999 --> 00:12:00.999
The causes go to the heart of<br/>
our society, and that's how

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:03.834
President Johnson put it to his<br/>
recently formed commission

00:12:03.834 --> 00:12:04.999
on Civil Disorder.<br/>

00:12:04.999 --> 00:12:08.999
He has set them the fearful task<br/>
of resolving the bitter

00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.999
legacy of race hatred.<br/>

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:18.999
<br/>

00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:21.459
There are many ways<br/>
of resistance.

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:26.999
I think for me, the guy who<br/>
puts a gun in his hand and

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:31.999
goes down and robs a bank, that<br/>
becomes for me a noble

00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:37.999
and heroic act, you see, because<br/>
he's resisting what a

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:39.999
society has outlined for him.<br/>

00:12:39.999 --> 00:12:42.584
He's resisting the idea<br/>
of being a victim.

00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:45.999
<br/>

00:12:45.999 --> 00:12:49.999
August Wilson's most recent<br/>
play, Two Trains Running is

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:52.209
set in a diner in 1968.<br/>

00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:55.417
The play looks at the pros and<br/>
cons of violent resistance to

00:12:55.417 --> 00:12:57.250
white supremacy.<br/>

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.999
You can't even use the<br/>
words nigger and

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:02.459
gun in the same sentence.<br/>

00:13:02.459 --> 00:13:05.999
You use the words gun and nigger<br/>
in the same sentence

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:07.999
and you are in trouble.<br/>

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:12.999
White man panicked, unless a<br/>
policeman shot the nigger with

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.999
his gun, then that'd<br/>
be all right.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:16.999
Other than that he panicked.<br/>

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:20.999
He ain't had nothing but guns<br/>
for the last 500 years.

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:23.999
You got the atomic bomb<br/>
and everything.

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:27.999
You say the word nigger and gun<br/>
in the same sentence and

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:29.375
they'll try and arrest you.<br/>

00:13:29.375 --> 00:13:34.999
Accuse you of sabotage,<br/>
disturbing the peace, inciting

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:37.999
a riot, plotting to overthrow<br/>
the government or anything

00:13:37.999 --> 00:13:39.999
else they could think of.<br/>

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:40.999
You think I'm lying?<br/>

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:43.667
You go down there at the number<br/>
two police station and

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:47.999
you say, the niggers is tired<br/>
of this mistreatment, and

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:49.999
they're going to<br/>
get some guns.

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:51.999
And you see if they<br/>
don't arrest you.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:55.999
<br/>

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:58.999
In Two Trains Running, the<br/>
protagonist is a bank robber.

00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:01.999
August Wilson's stepfather spent<br/>
23 years in the State

00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:03.000
Penitentiary.<br/>

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.999
<br/>

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:09.999
I, myself, would not go<br/>
out and rob a bank.

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:13.999
I do not sanction anyone going<br/>
out and robbing a bank.

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:16.999
The people who do that,<br/>
I recognize that as a

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:18.999
resistance.<br/>

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:23.626
There's a resistance, for<br/>
instance, in terms of learning

00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:26.999
the language.<br/>

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:28.999
There's a resistance to speaking<br/>
what is known as

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:30.999
proper and correct English.<br/>

00:14:30.999 --> 00:14:32.999
You see, because that's a very<br/>
and creative in their

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:34.999
linguistic--<br/>

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:39.999
linguistic agility is<br/>
very highly prized.

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:43.667
So when blacks do not speak<br/>
the language correctly, I

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:45.501
think that's a form<br/>
of resistance.

00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.999
So it's not just taking or<br/>
putting a gun in your hand and

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:50.999
going out and robbing a bank,<br/>
although I recognize it as a

00:14:50.999 --> 00:14:53.459
form of resistance,<br/>
it's the language.

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:54.999
It's a resistance in terms<br/>
of the language.

00:14:54.999 --> 00:14:57.999
<br/>

00:14:57.999 --> 00:14:59.999
Yeah, where you want that before<br/>
Wendy's, I could tell,

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:00.999
you're real slow.<br/>

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:03.709
They got a job for you at<br/>
John Eagle, cashier.

00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:04.999
You probably be slow<br/>
on that too.

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:07.999
<br/>

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:10.999
My difficulty in terms of<br/>
writing plays was actually

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:11.999
very simple.<br/>

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:14.999
And I couldn't like dialogue<br/>
because I didn't respect the

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:16.999
way the blacks talked.<br/>

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:18.999
I didn't value the way<br/>
the blacks talked.

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:21.999
I thought in order to create art<br/>
out of it that you had to

00:15:21.999 --> 00:15:23.999
change the way they talked.<br/>

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:26.834
And so when I wrote these plays,<br/>
and then I did attempt

00:15:26.834 --> 00:15:29.999
to write plays, I really had<br/>
black characters talking like

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:33.999
Europeans, because I thought<br/>
this is what you had to do.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:36.959
I remember asking Rob Penny one<br/>
time, how do you make your

00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:37.999
characters talk?<br/>

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:40.501
And he said, you don't,<br/>
you listen to them.

00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:42.999
I did not think at the time that<br/>
he'd given me any great

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:43.999
pearl of wisdom.<br/>

00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:45.999
I thought he was trying<br/>
to be smart.

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:48.999
And it wasn't until many years<br/>
later, six or seven years

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:50.999
later, that I actually<br/>
began to listen.

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:54.999
But before I can listen and<br/>
before I could hear the

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:57.999
language of the people, I had<br/>
to learn to value it.

00:15:57.999 --> 00:16:00.999
And that's something that I had<br/>
to discover within myself.

00:16:00.999 --> 00:16:03.999
And once I discovered the value<br/>
and the poetry that was

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:06.999
inherent in the way that blacks<br/>
spoke, then I had no

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:10.999
problem with writing dialogue.<br/>

00:16:10.999 --> 00:16:12.999
It was only after moving to<br/>
Minnesota to live with his new

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:16.999
wife that August Wilson found<br/>
out how to write dialogue with

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.999
a play based on the illegal mini<br/>
cabs or jitneys of the

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:20.999
Hill District.<br/>

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:23.999
Anyway, I visited Pittsburgh<br/>
with my wife and we drove, and

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:27.999
she had never encountered gypsy<br/>
cabs or jitney stations.

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:33.501
And on the way driving back<br/>
home, which is at 959 one mile

00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:39.375
drive, I spent the whole entire<br/>
time explaining to her

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:40.999
what a jitney was.<br/>

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:42.999
These guys would get together<br/>
and they would rent an

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:43.999
abandoned store front.<br/>

00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:48.999
Get a pay telephone in there and<br/>
they would pay $15 a month

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:53.999
dues to work out of there, and<br/>
disseminate the number into

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:54.000
the community.<br/>

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.999
And when you wanted<br/>
transportation you called one

00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:57.999
of the many jitney stations.<br/>

00:16:57.999 --> 00:16:59.751
[PHONE RINGING]<br/>

00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:01.417
<br/>

00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:03.999
Service.<br/>

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:05.999
2024 Grove Place.<br/>

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:07.999
All right, grey car.<br/>

00:17:07.999 --> 00:17:09.999
Your mother still alive?<br/>

00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:12.209
No.<br/>

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:14.999
I gotta get me some<br/>
white flowers.

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:16.999
Yours?<br/>

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:18.999
I never believed in flowers,<br/>
man, you know.

00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:20.999
I never did believe<br/>
in flowers.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:22.959
Even when I was a kid<br/>
I didn't like them.

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:24.999
She would put them on me, I'd<br/>
go to church and I'd tear it

00:17:24.999 --> 00:17:27.999
off right after church.<br/>

00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.999
So when I got back home I was<br/>
very excited and it occurred

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:33.999
to me why don't I write a play<br/>
that is set in a jitney

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:36.999
station that explains this to<br/>
whoever doesn't know it, and

00:17:36.999 --> 00:17:41.999
also you can see the idea that<br/>
the men have created these

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:44.999
jobs out of nothing, and they<br/>
are able to support their

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:46.999
families through that.<br/>

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.999
So I began to work on this<br/>
play called Jitney.

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:55.999
And this was the very first play<br/>
in which I listened to

00:17:55.999 --> 00:17:59.999
the dialogue, as opposed to<br/>
trying to force it into the

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:00.999
mouths of the characters.<br/>

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:03.959
I simply let them talk.<br/>

00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:07.083
I was very excited and very<br/>
surprised with the results of

00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:08.999
what they was able<br/>
to come up with.

00:18:08.999 --> 00:18:11.876
I discovered that I could<br/>
write dialogue.

00:18:11.876 --> 00:18:14.999
And not only could I write<br/>
dialogue, but I would write a

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:17.542
lot of dialogue.<br/>

00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:20.250
Once I got the characters<br/>
talking, it was difficult to

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.999
shut them up.<br/>

00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:23.751
Yeah.<br/>

00:18:23.751 --> 00:18:24.999
Who?<br/>

00:18:24.999 --> 00:18:26.999
No, you got the wrong number.<br/>

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:28.542
Hey, Turnbull, what's<br/>
happening.

00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:28.918
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]<br/>

00:18:28.918 --> 00:18:29.999
ceiling.<br/>

00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:32.584
Boy, I don't know what this<br/>
world is coming to.

00:18:32.584 --> 00:18:33.042
What's up, man?<br/>

00:18:33.042 --> 00:18:34.999
You know McNeil, don't you?<br/>

00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:35.167
Who?<br/>

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:38.999
McNeil, McNeil who live up on<br/>
Webster old lady McNeil?

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:41.999
Got them two boys who clean<br/>
up down at the courthouse.

00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:42.042
McNeil.<br/>

00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:43.292
No, I don't know<br/>
no McNeil, man.

00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:45.999
You know I'm talking, it's<br/>
Scott McNeil-- used to be

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:47.999
Brownie's old lady.<br/>

00:18:47.999 --> 00:18:48.999
Brownie was staying up there<br/>
helping to try to

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:51.375
raise them two boys.<br/>

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:52.999
One of them got an old<br/>
funny-shaped head.

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:53.999
[LAUGHING]<br/>

00:18:53.999 --> 00:18:54.999
Hey, hey.<br/>

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:57.999
Now I know who you<br/>
talkin' about.

00:18:57.999 --> 00:19:00.999
Well the boy come in here a<br/>
little while ago this morning.

00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:01.999
The oldest one.<br/>

00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:05.999
Can't be no more than 18, 19 at<br/>
the most. Asked me to take

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:07.999
him on a trip up to<br/>
the north side.

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:11.999
Then he say he want to stop up<br/>
here on the Whiteside Road.

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:12.999
So I carry him up there.<br/>

00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:14.999
He get out and go into one<br/>
of these houses, come out

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:16.999
carrying a television.<br/>

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:18.250
A TV.<br/>

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.999
And the boy ain't said nothing<br/>
about no television now.

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:21.999
No.<br/>

00:19:21.999 --> 00:19:23.999
Then he want to put it<br/>
in my back seat.

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:23.999
No, tell him.<br/>

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:25.999
I tell him, hell no.<br/>

00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:27.417
You ain't messing<br/>
up my back seat.

00:19:27.417 --> 00:19:27.999
No, man.<br/>

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:30.542
So I help him put<br/>
it in the trunk.

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:35.999
Then he had me carry him<br/>
down to the pawn shop

00:19:35.999 --> 00:19:36.999
on the north side.<br/>

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:37.999
Pawn shop.<br/>

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:40.999
Now I know the boy done stole<br/>
a television, but I ain't

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:42.042
saying nothing.<br/>

00:19:42.042 --> 00:19:42.999
I want my money.<br/>

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:43.999
Yeah.<br/>

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:45.999
Come on back, stopped down<br/>
their path to get some

00:19:45.999 --> 00:19:49.999
tobacco, and the fella sitting<br/>
around happened to mention the

00:19:49.999 --> 00:19:55.999
name of this woman who done<br/>
had her television stolen.

00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:57.999
Don't you know that boy done<br/>
went and stole his

00:19:57.999 --> 00:19:58.999
grandma-ma's television?<br/>

00:19:58.999 --> 00:19:59.999
What?<br/>

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:01.999
The name is Bolger,<br/>
Miss Sarah Bolger.

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:04.999
Now this is old lady<br/>
McNeil's mama.

00:20:04.999 --> 00:20:06.999
I used to carry her to church<br/>
all the time before she

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:07.999
got to old to go.<br/>

00:20:07.999 --> 00:20:09.999
Lord, have mercy.<br/>

00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:12.000
The boy done went and stole his<br/>
grandma-ma's television.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.999
<br/>

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:22.999
Well much of his plays reflect<br/>
the oral tradition coming from

00:20:22.999 --> 00:20:26.999
Africa and the south<br/>
and the north.

00:20:26.999 --> 00:20:30.999
Because August, he listened<br/>
to the people around him.

00:20:30.999 --> 00:20:33.999
He's in the midst of Africans<br/>
and he listened to what

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:35.999
they're saying and how<br/>
they're saying it.

00:20:35.999 --> 00:20:38.626
You know, how colorful the<br/>
language is, how meaningful

00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:41.999
the language is.<br/>

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:45.999
Put afro-isms that are<br/>
inherited within that

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:49.292
dialogue, that conversation,<br/>
going on around him.

00:20:49.292 --> 00:20:51.999
And he has like internalized<br/>
that.

00:20:51.999 --> 00:20:52.999
This is very much<br/>
a part of him.

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:54.999
And listening to the blues<br/>
he could hear the

00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:55.999
same kinds of things.<br/>

00:20:55.999 --> 00:20:58.999
<br/>

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:00.999
The oral tradition<br/>
has just been--

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:02.999
the blues is like oral<br/>
tradition with music.

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:04.709
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:53.876
<br/>

00:21:53.876 --> 00:21:56.999
It was 1965, and I lived across<br/>
the street from St.

00:21:56.999 --> 00:21:59.042
Vincent de Paul store.<br/>

00:21:59.042 --> 00:22:03.999
And music has always<br/>
been important.

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:06.334
At the time I couldn't afford<br/>
to buy new records.

00:22:06.334 --> 00:22:09.999
And I discovered in St. Vincent<br/>
de Paul store these

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:13.999
old 78s that were $0.05<br/>
apiece, and I began to

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:17.999
indiscriminately purchase your<br/>
records, 10 at a time, $0.50,

00:22:17.999 --> 00:22:19.999
I've got 20 songs here.<br/>

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:23.999
And I had an old Victrola that<br/>
played 78 records, and I would

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:26.999
take these records home<br/>
and listen to them.

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:30.999
I became very proficient in the<br/>
popular music of the '30s

00:22:30.999 --> 00:22:33.999
and the '40s by everyone--<br/>

00:22:33.999 --> 00:22:37.999
Peggy Lee, and anyone who was<br/>
singing, or the Hoagy

00:22:37.999 --> 00:22:39.999
Carmichael, Cole Porter,<br/>
et cetera.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:42.999
So I'm listening to Cole Porter,<br/>
Hoagy Carmichael tune,

00:22:42.999 --> 00:22:44.999
"September Song" technically.<br/>

00:22:44.999 --> 00:22:49.999
And then one day in my stack I<br/>
had the yellow label, type

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:53.167
written label by someone<br/>
named Bessie Smith.

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:54.999
[BESSIE SMITH SONG]<br/>

00:22:54.999 --> 00:23:28.999
<br/>

00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:31.999
I was literally stunned<br/>
by what I was hearing.

00:23:31.999 --> 00:23:36.999
It was so drastically different<br/>
from all this other

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.501
music that I had heard.<br/>

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.999
And I somehow knew intuitively<br/>
that this

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:43.999
person, this was mine.<br/>

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:44.999
[BESSIE SMITH SONG]<br/>

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:58.999
<br/>

00:23:58.999 --> 00:24:01.042
And I discovered that, you see,<br/>
if you listen, if you

00:24:01.042 --> 00:24:03.999
don't know anything about<br/>
African people and you

00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:07.999
listened to the blues, that you<br/>
would discover that their

00:24:07.999 --> 00:24:15.999
grace, their logic, their<br/>
morality, their systems of

00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:18.999
social organization, and all<br/>
these things that you would

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:21.667
need to know about a people if<br/>
you didn't know anything about

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.999
them you could discover<br/>
from the music.

00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:26.999
So once I discovered that it's<br/>
all contained in there, I

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:29.999
think the blues is the best<br/>
literature that blacks have

00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:32.999
created since we've been here,<br/>
and there's a lot of

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:35.999
philosophical ideas in there.<br/>

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:37.792
I call it our sacred book.<br/>

00:24:37.792 --> 00:24:43.999
So what I attempted to do is<br/>
to mine that field, to mine

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:47.999
those cultural ideas and<br/>
attitudes and give them to my

00:24:47.999 --> 00:24:49.999
characters in the play.<br/>

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:50.999
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:24:50.999 --> 00:25:32.292
<br/>

00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:36.999
One of the things that's rarest<br/>
in the theater to me is

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:42.999
a really original writing voice<br/>
that sings, that is

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:45.999
theatrical in the best sense.<br/>

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:50.417
And when I first heard Wilson's<br/>
voice it was hearing

00:25:50.417 --> 00:25:53.876
a stage reading the scripts in<br/>
hand of Ma Rainey's Black

00:25:53.876 --> 00:25:56.999
Bottom, the O'Neil playwrights<br/>
conference in Connecticut I

00:25:56.999 --> 00:25:59.999
don't even remember how<br/>
many years ago.

00:25:59.999 --> 00:26:01.999
And it was a very unwieldy<br/>
play, it was

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:02.999
all over the place.<br/>

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:06.999
It was much longer and rougher<br/>
than the play that would

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:09.000
ultimately be professionally<br/>
produced.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.125
But this voice just sang out<br/>
to me into the night.

00:26:14.125 --> 00:26:17.999
It was an electrifying<br/>
experience hearing these

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:21.999
musicians in this room in<br/>
Chicago in the '20s talking

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:22.999
about their lives.<br/>

00:26:22.999 --> 00:26:28.042
<br/>

00:26:28.042 --> 00:26:30.999
Come on, let's rehearse<br/>
this music.

00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:32.999
You ain't gotta rehearse that.<br/>

00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:34.999
Ain't nothing but old<br/>
junk band music.

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:37.999
Any one of them junk<br/>
bands will do.

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:38.999
Don't make me no difference--<br/>

00:26:38.999 --> 00:26:40.999
long as we get paid.<br/>

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.999
Well that ain't what I'm<br/>
talking about, nigger.

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:45.999
I'm talking about art.<br/>

00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:47.999
What's drawing got<br/>
to do with it?

00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:49.999
Where you got this nigger<br/>
from, cousin?

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:52.626
You sound like one of them<br/>
Alabama niggers.

00:26:52.626 --> 00:26:56.999
To criticize Ma Rainey's Black<br/>
Bottom for formlessness is

00:26:56.999 --> 00:27:01.999
like criticizing the music<br/>
that its characters play,

00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:04.999
jazz, for formlessness.<br/>

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:07.999
I'm sure that when jazz first<br/>
came on the scene,

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:12.999
conventional critics said, oh it<br/>
does obey the unities, it's

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:15.999
disorganized, it's all<br/>
over the place.

00:27:15.999 --> 00:27:19.999
Well, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom<br/>
doesn't obey the unities

00:27:19.999 --> 00:27:22.999
because it's written<br/>
like a jazz

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:23.999
session, like a jam session.<br/>

00:27:23.999 --> 00:27:26.999
And so there are musicians<br/>
there, they each have their

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:29.999
riffs, their solos, in the case<br/>
of Ma Rainey herself, her

00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:34.999
arias, only they're verbal<br/>
arias or verbal riffs.

00:27:34.999 --> 00:27:36.999
And in the end they all do<br/>
come together and certain

00:27:36.999 --> 00:27:40.834
soloists take over the piece,<br/>
particularly the trumpet

00:27:40.834 --> 00:27:44.999
player who ends up being the<br/>
dramatic center of the play

00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:47.999
and of the violin incident<br/>
that is the

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.999
culmination of the play.<br/>

00:27:49.999 --> 00:27:51.999
Kind of I can look at<br/>
you all and see what

00:27:51.999 --> 00:27:53.999
kind of band you is.<br/>

00:27:53.999 --> 00:27:56.999
I could look at Toledo and see<br/>
what kind of band it is.

00:27:56.999 --> 00:27:59.292
Toledo ain't said nothing<br/>
to you now.

00:27:59.292 --> 00:28:01.667
Don't let your leader<br/>
get started.

00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:03.999
You can't even spell music,<br/>
much less play it.

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:09.375
<br/>

00:28:09.375 --> 00:28:11.459
Wha'chu talkin' about?<br/>

00:28:11.459 --> 00:28:12.999
I can spell music.<br/>

00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:15.999
I got a dollar say I<br/>
can spell it. $50.

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:16.999
Where your dollar.<br/>

Go ahead, spell it.<br/>

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:30.959
It's a bet then.<br/>

00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:31.999
talkin' about I can't spell.<br/>

00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:33.834
Go ahead then.<br/>

00:28:33.834 --> 00:28:34.250
Music, spell it.<br/>

No, no, no.<br/>

00:28:57.999 --> 00:28:59.999
Leave that money alone,<br/>
you ain't spelt it.

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:00.999
Wha'chu mean, I ain't<br/>
spelled it.

00:29:00.999 --> 00:29:02.999
I said M-U-S-I-K.<br/>

00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:03.999
That ain't how you spell it.<br/>

00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:05.999
That ain't how you spell it.<br/>

00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:07.999
It's M-U-S-I-C.<br/>

00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:09.999
C, nigger, not K--<br/>

C.<br/>

<br/>

00:29:24.999 --> 00:29:29.999
I have an image of a man, a<br/>
large man, holding a baby in

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:33.999
his arms in this incredibly<br/>
brilliant,

00:29:33.999 --> 00:29:35.999
starry moonlit night.<br/>

00:29:35.999 --> 00:29:37.999
And he's talkin' to somebody<br/>
saying, I'm standing out here

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:41.999
with my daughter in my arms. She<br/>
ain't nothing but a wee,

00:29:41.999 --> 00:29:42.999
little bitty little thing.<br/>

00:29:42.999 --> 00:29:45.999
She don't know nothin' about<br/>
growing this business.

00:29:45.999 --> 00:29:49.083
She innocent and she<br/>
ain't got no mama.

00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:51.709
And at the time that he said<br/>
that, I had no idea who he was

00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:52.999
talking to.<br/>

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:54.999
<br/>

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:56.999
That's sort of how I<br/>
got into that play.

00:29:56.999 --> 00:29:59.999
But really I wrote the play<br/>
because I thought that my

00:29:59.999 --> 00:30:03.999
generation of blacks didn't know<br/>
enough about our parents

00:30:03.999 --> 00:30:06.999
because they shielded us from a<br/>
lot of things, a lot of what

00:30:06.999 --> 00:30:08.999
their life experiences<br/>
had been.

00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:12.999
And more importantly, a lot of<br/>
the reasons why they made the

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.999
choices that they made in their<br/>
lives, which has come to

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:17.999
affect our lives.<br/>

00:30:17.999 --> 00:30:20.999
The reason why my mother Frances<br/>
left North Carolina to

00:30:20.999 --> 00:30:23.999
come the Pittsburgh she<br/>
do not share with me.

00:30:23.999 --> 00:30:26.999
I thought that if I knew these<br/>
things then I'd have a better

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:29.751
understanding of who I am in the<br/>
world because then I can

00:30:29.751 --> 00:30:32.083
see how various choices that<br/>
she made relates to me.

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:40.999
Bright pleasure of the southland<br/>

and want depends.<br/>

00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:45.918
A bumper crop this year, and<br/>
now all depends on cotton

00:30:45.918 --> 00:30:47.999
prices as it's cotton picking<br/>
in the field.

00:30:47.999 --> 00:30:52.667
<br/>

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:55.999
Now you know why it's way down<br/>
south in the land of cotton.

00:30:55.999 --> 00:30:58.999
The economics of Dixie, also its<br/>
life most characteristic.

<br/>

00:31:07.959 --> 00:31:12.876
For instance, in Fences, if Troy<br/>
has a value for work, if

00:31:12.876 --> 00:31:14.999
he will not allow his son to<br/>
play football because he wants

00:31:14.999 --> 00:31:16.999
him to keep his job<br/>
at the A&P.

00:31:16.999 --> 00:31:19.999
And we found out that because<br/>
Try did not have a job, he

00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:21.292
ended up in a penitentiary.<br/>

00:31:21.292 --> 00:31:23.999
And suddenly we're able to<br/>
understand when he says you

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:25.999
get your butt down there to the<br/>
A&P and get your job back,

00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:27.999
we're better able to<br/>
understand that.

00:31:27.999 --> 00:31:29.999
Yo mama tell me you done gone<br/>
and got recruited by one of

00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:32.375
them college football teams,<br/>
is that right?

00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:32.999
Yeah.<br/>

00:31:32.999 --> 00:31:35.999

gonna be comin' by

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:37.999
to talk to you and get you to<br/>
sign the permission papers.

00:31:37.999 --> 00:31:38.999
I thought you was supposed<br/>
to be working

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:40.999
down that there A&P.<br/>

00:31:40.999 --> 00:31:41.999
Ain't you supposed<br/>
to be working

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:42.999
down there after school?<br/>

00:31:42.999 --> 00:31:45.999
Mr. Stawicki say he gonna hold<br/>
my job for me 'til after the

00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:46.542
football season.<br/>

00:31:46.542 --> 00:31:47.999
If they start next week<br/>
I can work weekends.

00:31:47.999 --> 00:31:50.999
I thought we had a understanding<br/>
about that

00:31:50.999 --> 00:31:51.999
football stuff.<br/>

00:31:51.999 --> 00:31:54.999
You supposed to be keepin' up<br/>
with your chores, and holding

00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:56.999
down that job at the A&P.<br/>

day on a Saturday.

00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:01.999

and now you're telling

00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:03.334

00:32:05.999 --> 00:32:08.501
And I ain't no needing nobody<br/>
comin' around here to talk to

00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.999
me about signin' nothin'.<br/>

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:11.999
Hey pop, you can't do that.<br/>

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:13.999

from North Carolina.

he coming from.

you get nowhere with that

Now you go on and get your book<br/>
learnin' so you can work

00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:25.999
your way up in that A&P or learn<br/>
how to fix cars or build

00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:27.709
houses or something.<br/>

00:32:27.709 --> 00:32:30.375
Get you a trade, that way you<br/>
got somethin' can't nobody

00:32:30.375 --> 00:32:31.876
take away from you.<br/>

00:32:31.876 --> 00:32:34.999

to some good use besides

00:32:34.999 --> 00:32:36.999

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:37.999
Yes sir.<br/>

00:32:37.999 --> 00:32:43.999
Fences is the most conventional<br/>
Wilson play, and

00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:46.999
I must say, to me, the<br/>
least interesting,

00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:47.999
although I liked it.<br/>

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:51.417
In white American terms it's the<br/>
most conventional because

00:32:51.417 --> 00:32:56.250
it deals with a father-son<br/>
conflict about values.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:01.999
Now in the case of Fences, the<br/>
values have to do with a

00:33:01.999 --> 00:33:05.999
father's black American<br/>
experience and a son's new

00:33:05.999 --> 00:33:07.999
ideas about that<br/>
same experience

00:33:07.999 --> 00:33:09.999
which challenges father's.<br/>

00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:13.667
But still, the overall framework<br/>
of that debate

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:16.999
resembles that between fathers<br/>
and sons-- you know, Betts

00:33:16.999 --> 00:33:19.999
plays and Miller plays, even in<br/>
a Williams play like Cat on

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:20.999
a Hot Tin Roof.<br/>

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:24.334
In an O'Neill play like Long<br/>
Day's Journey Into Night.

00:33:24.334 --> 00:33:29.417
I think one thing that makes<br/>
Fences somewhat more

00:33:29.417 --> 00:33:33.999
interesting than that formula<br/>
is that in it, and in its

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:40.542
subsidiary characters, Wilson<br/>
gives a very interesting

00:33:40.542 --> 00:33:44.709
documentary portrait of what<br/>
urban black American life was

00:33:44.709 --> 00:33:48.999
like in that quiet just before<br/>
the storm, just before race

00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:52.999
relations would heat up and<br/>
the modern Civil Rights

00:33:52.999 --> 00:33:54.584
Movement, as we know<br/>
it was born.

00:33:54.584 --> 00:33:57.292
And it's fascinating to me that<br/>
he freezes the play in

00:33:57.292 --> 00:34:01.626
time there before everything<br/>
really starts exploding.

The big throw is high and<br/>
Logan beats the relay to

00:34:15.999 --> 00:34:18.999
first. The Braves are on the<br/>
war path, and big slugger

Eddie Mathews is up.<br/>

00:34:21.999 --> 00:34:24.999
In 1957, professional baseball<br/>
was suffering from an

00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:26.999
unofficial [UNINTELLIGIBLE].<br/>

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:29.999
Troy Maxson, the hero of Fences,<br/>
had been forced out of

00:34:29.999 --> 00:34:33.999
the game, and spent his life<br/>
as a garbage collector.

00:34:33.999 --> 00:34:36.751
Why don't you let the boy go<br/>
ahead and play football, Troy?

00:34:36.751 --> 00:34:37.999
Ain't no harm in that.<br/>

00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:39.999
He's just trying to be like<br/>
you with the sport.

00:34:39.999 --> 00:34:42.918
I don't want him<br/>
to be like me.

00:34:42.918 --> 00:34:46.334
I want him to move as far away<br/>
from my life as I can get.

00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:49.999
You da only decent thing that<br/>
ever happened to me.

00:34:49.999 --> 00:34:51.999
I wish him that.<br/>

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:54.999
But I don't wish him a thing<br/>
else from my life.

00:34:54.999 --> 00:34:57.999

wasn't gonna get involved

00:34:57.999 --> 00:34:58.999
in no sports.<br/>

00:34:58.999 --> 00:35:01.999
Not after what they do<br/>
to me in the sports.

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:05.042
Troy, why don't you admit you<br/>
were too old to play in the

00:35:05.042 --> 00:35:05.999
major leagues.<br/>

00:35:05.999 --> 00:35:07.999

you admit that?

The world is changing around you<br/>
and you can't even see it.

I do the best I can.<br/>

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:32.999
I go out, make my way, find<br/>
the strength to carry me

00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:44.999
<br/>

00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:51.999
I think probably the closest<br/>
to a man like that would be

00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:57.834
Charlie Burly for me who was a<br/>
prize fighter in the '40s.

00:35:57.834 --> 00:35:59.999
They called him the uncrowned<br/>
champion.

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:03.709
In Berkshire was 100 best<br/>
boxers of all time.

00:36:03.709 --> 00:36:05.999
That was a lot of boxers.<br/>

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:07.999
We were talkin' about that, and<br/>
he lived directly across

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:08.999
the street from me.<br/>

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:12.999
And since I grew up without a<br/>
father, he was really a very

00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:17.999
strong male image for<br/>
me in my life.

00:36:17.999 --> 00:36:22.999
And the fact that he went and<br/>
knocked people out only added

00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:28.999
to the intrigue and mystique<br/>
of the male being conquer.

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:37.999
<br/>

00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:40.375
They still talk about 'cha<br/>
out in Minnesota.

00:36:40.375 --> 00:36:41.584
Minnesota, yeah.<br/>

00:36:41.584 --> 00:36:42.792
Yeah, when you was out there.<br/>

00:36:42.792 --> 00:36:45.999
They tell me he was out there<br/>
knocking out heavy weight.

00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:48.250
The only thing I'm so<br/>
sorry they just

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.999
wouldn't give me a chance.<br/>

00:36:50.999 --> 00:36:53.999
I mean at the title.<br/>

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:56.999
Yeah, but from what I know<br/>
you're not bitter about that.

00:36:56.999 --> 00:36:57.999
No, I'm not.<br/>

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:00.999
It's the way it was supposed<br/>
to be, I imagine.

00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:06.709
<br/>

00:37:06.709 --> 00:37:08.999
When you quit the fightin' you<br/>
started working for the city.

00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:09.999
Yeah.<br/>

00:37:09.999 --> 00:37:12.999
33 years straining.<br/>

00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:16.999
Well it changed a little bit<br/>
afterward, like they gettin'

00:37:16.999 --> 00:37:18.999
in off the street now.<br/>

00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:20.999
But we had to go back<br/>
and get it.

00:37:20.999 --> 00:37:22.709
You had to go back<br/>
in the houses.

00:37:22.709 --> 00:37:26.667
And a strain to bring<br/>
it out on your back.

00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:29.999
And it was rough then.<br/>

00:37:29.999 --> 00:37:31.999
I fooled them, Rose.<br/>

00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:32.999
I bunted.<br/>

00:37:32.999 --> 00:37:36.999
When I found you and Cory and a<br/>
halfway decent job, I would

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:38.999
say, couldn't nothing<br/>
touch me.

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:40.999
I wasn't gonna get<br/>
that last strike.

00:37:40.999 --> 00:37:42.999
I wasn't goin' back to<br/>
the penitentiary.

00:37:42.999 --> 00:37:44.999
I wasn't gonna lay in the street<br/>
with a bottle of wine.

00:37:44.999 --> 00:37:46.999
I was safe.<br/>

00:37:46.999 --> 00:37:49.999
I had me a family, a job.<br/>

00:37:49.999 --> 00:37:51.999
I wasn't gonna strike<br/>
out no more.

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:54.999
I was on first base waiting for<br/>
one of them boys to knock

00:37:54.999 --> 00:37:56.999
me in to get me home.<br/>

00:37:56.999 --> 00:37:58.999
You should have stayed<br/>
in my bed, Troy.

00:37:58.999 --> 00:38:01.999
Then when I saw that gal, she<br/>
firmed up my backbone, and I

00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:06.751
got to thinkin', if I tried<br/>
maybe I could steal second.

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:07.999
You understand what<br/>
I'm saying?

00:38:07.999 --> 00:38:10.999
After 18 years I wanted<br/>
to steal second.

00:38:10.999 --> 00:38:12.999
You should have held me tight.<br/>

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:14.000
You should have grabbed<br/>
me and held on.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.999
I stood on first base for 18<br/>
years and I thought, well, God

00:38:19.999 --> 00:38:21.999
dammit, go on for it.<br/>

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:23.999
We're not talkin'<br/>
about baseball.

00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:26.999
We're talkin' about you goin'<br/>
off to lay in bed with another

00:38:26.999 --> 00:38:28.999
woman, and then bring<br/>
it home to me.

00:38:28.999 --> 00:38:29.999
That's what we're<br/>
talkin' about.

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:31.999
We ain't talkin' about<br/>
no baseball.

00:38:31.999 --> 00:38:33.999
Rose, you're not listenin'<br/>
to me.

00:38:33.999 --> 00:38:36.999
I'm trying the best I can<br/>
to explain it to you.

00:38:36.999 --> 00:38:39.999
It ain't easy for me to admit<br/>
I've been standing in the same

00:38:39.999 --> 00:38:41.959
place for 18 years.<br/>

00:38:41.959 --> 00:38:42.999
I've been standing with ya.<br/>

00:38:42.999 --> 00:38:44.999
I've been right there<br/>
with you, Troy.

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:46.584
I have a life too.<br/>

00:38:46.584 --> 00:38:48.999
I gave 18 years of my<br/>
life to stand in the

00:38:48.999 --> 00:38:49.999
same spot with you.<br/>

00:38:49.999 --> 00:38:52.999
Even if the language can be<br/>
specifically African and some

00:38:52.999 --> 00:38:56.876
of the issues are, or many of<br/>
the issues are very specific

00:38:56.876 --> 00:39:00.999
to black American experience,<br/>
first of all, one thing he

00:39:00.999 --> 00:39:05.999
shows is that what's part of<br/>
black American experience is

00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:07.999
part of white American<br/>
experience.

00:39:07.999 --> 00:39:08.999
We're all in it together.<br/>

00:39:08.999 --> 00:39:11.999
His plays have a great<br/>
interconnectedness to the

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:13.999
larger history of the<br/>
United States.

00:39:13.999 --> 00:39:18.999
At the same time they have<br/>
such universal themes as

00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:23.999
family, and parents and<br/>
children, husbands and wives.

00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:29.999
And broader values that<br/>
relate to all people.

00:39:29.999 --> 00:39:32.999
I owed you everything I had.<br/>

00:39:32.999 --> 00:39:37.999
Every part of me I could<br/>
find to give you.

00:39:37.999 --> 00:39:41.999
And upstairs in that room with<br/>
the darkness falling in on me,

00:39:41.999 --> 00:39:46.999
I gave everything I had to try<br/>
and erase the doubt that you

00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:50.999
wasn't the finest man<br/>
in the world.

00:39:50.999 --> 00:39:54.999
And wherever you was goin' I<br/>
wanted to be there with you

00:39:54.999 --> 00:39:57.667
'cause you was my husband.<br/>

00:39:57.667 --> 00:40:00.999
'Cause that's the only<br/>
way I was gonna

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:03.999
survive as your wife.<br/>

00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:06.999
You always talk about what<br/>
you give and what you

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:08.292
don't have to give.<br/>

00:40:08.292 --> 00:40:10.501
But you take too.<br/>

00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:14.999
You take and you don't even<br/>
know nobody's giving.

00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:17.999
<br/>

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:23.999
But I think Fences for August,<br/>
I think he wrote that in one

00:40:23.999 --> 00:40:27.999
respect to prove something to<br/>
those who said that he didn't

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:29.999
know how to write to play.<br/>

00:40:29.999 --> 00:40:33.999
And that was referring to the<br/>
kind of more accepted,

00:40:33.999 --> 00:40:38.999
traditional, white way of<br/>
writing a play with a single

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:42.999
protagonist. Whereas for<br/>
August's experience has always

00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:44.999
been a more collective<br/>
experience or group

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:46.834
experience.<br/>

00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:50.667
And that's reflected in plays<br/>
like The Piano Lesson and Two

00:40:50.667 --> 00:40:54.250
Trains Running and Joe Turner.<br/>

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.999
Joe Turner's Come and<br/>
Gone is set in the

00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:58.999
Hill District in 1911.<br/>

00:40:58.999 --> 00:41:01.999
A mysterious stranger, Harold<br/>
Loomis arrives with his

00:41:01.999 --> 00:41:03.999
daughter at a boarding house.<br/>

00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:06.292
The play explores not only his<br/>
personal history, but the

00:41:06.292 --> 00:41:07.999
history of his entire race.<br/>

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:10.999
<br/>

00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:13.751
I listen to music because I<br/>
write, and I happened by

00:41:13.751 --> 00:41:15.375
chance to be listening to W.C.<br/>

00:41:15.375 --> 00:41:21.999
Handy singing a song called "Joe<br/>
Turner's Come and Gone."

00:41:21.999 --> 00:41:24.667
Joe Turner was the brother of<br/>
Pete Turner who was the

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:25.999
governor of the State<br/>
of Tennessee.

00:41:25.999 --> 00:41:28.999
And he had a chain with 40 links<br/>
to it, and he would go

00:41:28.999 --> 00:41:34.999
out and lure men, swoop down on<br/>
them and haul them off to

00:41:34.999 --> 00:41:36.999
his plantation to work.<br/>

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:41.999
Then I realized that I could use<br/>
that as a metaphor for the

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:42.999
200-some years of slavery.<br/>

00:41:42.999 --> 00:41:43.375
[SINGING]<br/>

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:44.999
--Turner's come and gone.<br/>

00:41:44.999 --> 00:41:47.999
Will you come on and play<br/>
if you gonna play?

00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:52.999
I'm gonna play as soon as<br/>
I figure out what to do.

00:41:52.999 --> 00:41:54.999
You can't figure out<br/>
if you want to sing

00:41:54.999 --> 00:41:56.999
or you want to play.<br/>

00:41:56.999 --> 00:42:00.042
That's a song the women sing<br/>
down around Memphis.

00:42:00.042 --> 00:42:02.999
Women down there made<br/>
up that song.

00:42:02.999 --> 00:42:15.999
I picked it up down there<br/>
about 15 years ago.

00:42:15.999 --> 00:42:16.999
Evenin', Mr. Loomis.<br/>

00:42:16.999 --> 00:42:19.999
<br/>

00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:22.999
But then what happens with the<br/>
play is you get caught up in

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:25.999
all sorts of individual stories<br/>
of people coming and

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:27.999
going in this boarding house,<br/>
which is sort of a weigh

00:42:27.999 --> 00:42:31.999
station for southern blacks who<br/>
have come north looking

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:35.834
for work as America's<br/>
industrialized.

00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:41.918
And percolating underneath that<br/>
is a relationship between

00:42:41.918 --> 00:42:44.999
the mysterious stranger and a<br/>
man at the boarding house that

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:48.042
ends up taking over the play<br/>
and his relationship that

00:42:48.042 --> 00:42:51.999
leads the stranger to discover<br/>
his African roots.

00:42:51.999 --> 00:42:53.834
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:42:53.834 --> 00:42:56.999
<br/>

00:42:56.999 --> 00:42:59.999
South Africans when they came<br/>
to America had their

00:42:59.999 --> 00:43:01.999
own ideas of God.<br/>

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:04.999
Their own ideas of religion,<br/>
and et cetera.

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:06.999
And all these things were<br/>
taken away from them and

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:10.999
replaced with the image of a<br/>
white man, which is the same

00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:13.999
image that has enslaved<br/>
and oppressed you.

00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:15.375
Why did God made you?<br/>

00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:20.999
God made me to serve my master<br/>
and bring in the crop, and to

00:43:20.999 --> 00:43:21.999
make a good cotton crop.<br/>

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.999
This is what the<br/>
early Christian

00:43:23.999 --> 00:43:25.999
church taught blacks.<br/>

00:43:25.999 --> 00:43:27.999
So I think in that sense that<br/>
they have not given them the

00:43:27.999 --> 00:43:29.751
tools for liberation.<br/>

00:43:29.751 --> 00:43:30.999
And that since they<br/>
have failed.

00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:30.999
Good evening.<br/>

00:43:30.999 --> 00:43:32.999
Praise the Lord.<br/>

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:33.999
[APPLAUSE]<br/>

00:43:33.999 --> 00:43:35.999
<br/>

00:43:35.999 --> 00:43:38.999
You got to do it<br/>
as a good man.

00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:40.999
Thou will shout!<br/>

00:43:40.999 --> 00:43:42.999
The people in the boarding<br/>
house are celebrating the

00:43:42.999 --> 00:43:46.999
power of the Holy Ghost. Harold<br/>
Loomis challenges them,

00:43:46.999 --> 00:43:49.999
and falling into a trance,<br/>
offers them a new spiritual

00:43:49.999 --> 00:43:52.999
vision, summoning up the<br/>
spirits of African who

00:43:52.999 --> 00:43:53.999
perished in the slave trade.<br/>

00:43:53.999 --> 00:44:00.999
<br/>

00:44:00.999 --> 00:44:01.999
Stop it.<br/>

00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:05.999
You'all sitting up there saying<br/>
about the Holy Ghost.

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:09.999
What's so holy about the Holy<br/>
Ghost. You're singin' and

00:44:09.999 --> 00:44:12.999
you're singin'.<br/>

00:44:12.999 --> 00:44:15.501
You think the Holy Ghost<br/>
is coming up.

00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:17.417
You're singin' for the<br/>
Holy Ghost to come?

00:44:17.417 --> 00:44:20.999
Well what he gonna do?<br/>

00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:23.999
He gonna come with tongue,<br/>
with fire to

00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:25.999
burn your wooly head.<br/>

00:44:25.999 --> 00:44:28.999
He gonna pound to the Holy Ghost<br/>
and get burnt, wha'chu

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.834
gonna do then?<br/>

00:44:30.834 --> 00:44:34.999
<br/>

00:44:34.999 --> 00:44:37.999
Why God gotta be so big?<br/>

00:44:37.999 --> 00:44:39.792
Huh?<br/>

00:44:39.792 --> 00:44:43.042
Why you gotta be<br/>
bigger than me?

00:44:43.042 --> 00:44:45.999
How much bigger is that?<br/>

00:44:45.999 --> 00:44:48.334
Loomis has a new dispensation.<br/>

00:44:48.334 --> 00:44:50.999
You see, Loomis is saying hey,<br/>
you guys have got it wrong.

00:44:50.999 --> 00:44:53.999
He said because I have just<br/>
witnessed something.

00:44:53.999 --> 00:44:56.999
I have just seen something.<br/>

00:44:56.999 --> 00:44:59.999
And what I have seen is I have<br/>
seen bones rise up out of the

00:44:59.999 --> 00:45:05.999
water and walk across the water<br/>
and then be washed up on

00:45:05.999 --> 00:45:10.999
the land and take one flesh and<br/>
walk down the road, and

00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:12.999
they are around here now.<br/>

00:45:12.999 --> 00:45:16.999
And they are men just<br/>
like you and me.

00:45:16.999 --> 00:45:19.209
They are black like<br/>
you and me.

00:45:19.209 --> 00:45:21.501
They came out of the<br/>
ocean and they are

00:45:21.501 --> 00:45:24.375
walking around here now.<br/>

00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:30.751
These are, to my mind, all the<br/>
Africans who were lost during

00:45:30.751 --> 00:45:35.542
the middle passage, and whose<br/>
bones to this day, actual

00:45:35.542 --> 00:45:37.751
bones wrestle on the floor<br/>
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:39.709
Tell me about them bones,<br/>
Harold Loomis.

00:45:39.709 --> 00:45:41.125
Tell me what you see.<br/>

00:45:41.125 --> 00:45:45.792
I come to this place, there's<br/>
water that's bigger than the

00:45:45.792 --> 00:45:49.999
whole world, and I looked down<br/>
and I seen these bones risin'

00:45:49.999 --> 00:45:50.999
up out of the water.<br/>

00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:54.999
Rise up and begin to<br/>
walk on top of it.

00:45:54.999 --> 00:45:56.999
With nothin' but bones<br/>
and they're walkin'

00:45:56.999 --> 00:45:56.999
on top of the water.<br/>

00:45:56.999 --> 00:45:59.083
Walk without a stinkin' doubt.<br/>

00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:01.999
Walkin' on top of the water.<br/>

00:46:01.999 --> 00:46:02.999
Just marchin' in line.<br/>

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:04.999
A whole heap of 'em.<br/>

00:46:04.999 --> 00:46:06.999
They come up out of the water<br/>
and started marchin'.

00:46:06.999 --> 00:46:09.042
With nothin' but bones<br/>
and they walkin'

00:46:09.042 --> 00:46:09.999
on top of the water.<br/>

00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:10.999
One after another.<br/>

00:46:10.999 --> 00:46:13.999
They just come up out of the<br/>
water and started to walk.

00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:16.999
Walkin' on the water without<br/>
sinkin' down.

00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:18.999
They just walkin' and walkin'.<br/>

00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:20.999
Then what happened,<br/>
Harold Loomis?

00:46:20.999 --> 00:46:24.999
The exchange I guess is one way<br/>
to put in between Bynum

00:46:24.999 --> 00:46:26.501
and Loomis.<br/>

00:46:26.501 --> 00:46:27.999
It can be looked at<br/>
several ways.

00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:30.999
One for me is the baptism and<br/>
there's a naming of them.

00:46:30.999 --> 00:46:34.751
I can't recall how many times,<br/>
and it's very purposeful, that

00:46:34.751 --> 00:46:36.999
Bynum says Harold Loomis, and<br/>
that he is, in effect, naming

00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:40.751
him and baptizing him and<br/>
calling him forth and asking

00:46:40.751 --> 00:46:43.999
him to stand up as one<br/>
of these bones people

00:46:43.999 --> 00:46:44.292
and to stand up.<br/>

00:46:44.292 --> 00:46:46.999
And the way that they accomplish<br/>
that, in the sense

00:46:46.999 --> 00:46:49.999
of Bynum is seeing the same<br/>
vision, so that each part is

00:46:49.999 --> 00:46:53.417
telling the story and it becomes<br/>
a call and response in

00:46:53.417 --> 00:46:55.375
which I get a call, you<br/>
give a response.

00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:58.999
And your response maybe leads me<br/>
to my call, and my call is

00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:00.501
part of your responses.<br/>

00:47:00.501 --> 00:47:02.584
So that the whole thing becomes<br/>

00:47:02.584 --> 00:47:04.999
part of the same thing.<br/>

00:47:04.999 --> 00:47:10.751
It's a very African<br/>
way of expression.

00:47:10.751 --> 00:47:14.834
Wha'chu waitin' on,<br/>
Harold Loomis?

00:47:14.834 --> 00:47:17.999
I'm waitin' on the breath<br/>
to get into my body.

00:47:17.999 --> 00:47:19.250
The breath's comin' in<br/>
to ya, Harold Loomis.

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.999
Wha'chu bonna do now?<br/>

00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:22.999
The wind is blowin' the<br/>
breath into my body.

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:24.751
I could feel it.<br/>

00:47:24.751 --> 00:47:25.999
I'm startin' to breath again.<br/>

00:47:25.999 --> 00:47:28.999
Wha'chu gonna do,<br/>
Harold Loomis?

00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:30.999
I'm gonna stand up.<br/>

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:32.417
I got to stand up.<br/>

00:47:32.417 --> 00:47:33.999
I can't lay here no more.<br/>

00:47:33.999 --> 00:47:37.999
All the breath is comin' into my<br/>
body and I got to stand up.

00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:39.999
Everybody standin'<br/>
at the same time.

00:47:39.999 --> 00:47:42.999
The ground's startin'<br/>
to shake.

00:47:42.999 --> 00:47:45.999
It's a great shake.<br/>

00:47:45.999 --> 00:47:51.918
The world's bustin' in half into<br/>
the sky's gettin' opened.

00:47:51.918 --> 00:47:53.083
My leg.<br/>

00:47:53.083 --> 00:47:54.999
My leg won't stand up.<br/>

00:47:54.999 --> 00:47:56.999
Everybody standin' and walkin'<br/>
towards the road.

00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:57.999
Wha'chu gonna do<br/>
Harold Loomis?

00:47:57.999 --> 00:47:59.999
My leg won't stand up.<br/>

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:01.999
They're shakin' hands and saying<br/>
goodbye to each other

00:48:01.999 --> 00:48:03.999
and walkin' every which<br/>
way down the road.

00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:04.999
I got to stand up.<br/>

00:48:04.999 --> 00:48:06.999
They walkin' around here<br/>
now, Harold Loomis.

00:48:06.999 --> 00:48:09.751
Men just like you and me walk<br/>
right out of the water.

00:48:09.751 --> 00:48:10.999
Got to stand up.<br/>

00:48:10.999 --> 00:48:11.999
They're walkin' Harold Loomis.<br/>

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:12.999
They walkin' 'round here now.<br/>

00:48:12.999 --> 00:48:15.999
I got to stand up, get<br/>
on up that road.

00:48:15.999 --> 00:48:17.999
Come on, Harold Loomis,<br/>
come on!

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:20.250
My leg won't stand up.<br/>

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:22.209
My leg won't stand up!<br/>

00:48:22.209 --> 00:48:25.999
<br/>

00:48:25.999 --> 00:48:31.999
The African who arrives chained<br/>
and malnourished in

00:48:31.999 --> 00:48:36.999
the hulls of a 350 ton<br/>
Portuguese vessel has not

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:39.999
disappeared, has not vanished<br/>
off the face of the earth.

00:48:39.999 --> 00:48:44.999
That he is, in effect, still<br/>
continues to live within

00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:48.209
myself, within every black<br/>
person in America.

00:48:48.209 --> 00:48:51.999
There's at least one heartbeat<br/>
that is fueled by

00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:52.999
the blood of Africa.<br/>

00:48:52.999 --> 00:48:55.999
We found ourselves in the world<br/>
that did not recognize

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:58.459
our language or our customs,<br/>
did not recognize our Gods,

00:48:58.459 --> 00:49:01.999
and ultimately, did not<br/>
recognize our humanity.

00:49:01.999 --> 00:49:05.000
Once you understand that you<br/>
have an intrinsic sense of

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.999
self-worth, the way your ideas<br/>
and morality, your concepts of

00:49:10.999 --> 00:49:14.999
justice and beauty, your eating<br/>
habits, your ideas of

00:49:14.999 --> 00:49:15.999
pleasure and pain.<br/>

00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:19.292
All of these things go into your<br/>
mythology, your history.

00:49:19.292 --> 00:49:22.999
All of these things go into<br/>
making up of a culture, and I

00:49:22.999 --> 00:49:24.999
think it's crucial<br/>
that we, as black

00:49:24.999 --> 00:49:26.959
Americans, keep that alive.<br/>

00:49:26.959 --> 00:49:29.999
Now what the society has told us<br/>
that if you are willing to

00:49:29.999 --> 00:49:32.999
deny that, if you are willing<br/>
to deny the fact that you're

00:49:32.999 --> 00:49:36.999
African, if you're willing to<br/>
give up your culture and adopt

00:49:36.999 --> 00:49:39.999
the cultural values of the<br/>
dominant society, which is

00:49:39.999 --> 00:49:42.999
European, then you<br/>
can participate

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:43.999
better in American society.<br/>

00:49:43.999 --> 00:49:45.999
You can go to school and you'll<br/>
get decent jobs and

00:49:45.999 --> 00:49:47.999
have decent housing,<br/>
et cetera.

00:49:47.999 --> 00:49:49.999
But that's at a tremendous<br/>
cost. That's

00:49:49.999 --> 00:49:50.999
at the loss of self.<br/>

00:49:50.999 --> 00:49:56.209
And I think the vast majority<br/>
of the 35 million blacks in

00:49:56.209 --> 00:49:58.999
America have rejected that<br/>
social contract.

00:49:58.999 --> 00:50:00.999
They want another social<br/>
contract that will allow them

00:50:00.999 --> 00:50:04.999
to participate in society as<br/>
African people with their

00:50:04.999 --> 00:50:06.000
culture in tact.<br/>

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.999
[MUSIC]<br/>

00:50:07.999 --> 00:52:12.000
<br/>
