00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470


2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.470
Now, Antony, our hopes areanswered.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.570
You said the enemy would notcome down,

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.970
but keep the hills and upperregions.

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.100
It proves not so.

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.300
Their battles are at hand;

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.830
they mean to warn us at Philippihere,

8
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.730
answering before we do demand ofthem.

9
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.530
Tut, I am in their bosoms, and Iknow wherefore they do it.

10
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.030
They could be content to visitother places,

11
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.830
and come down with fearfulbravery,

12
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.970
thinking by this face to fastenin our thoughts

13
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.070
that they have courage; but 'tisnot so.

14
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.230
Prepare you, generals.

15
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.270
The enemy comes on in gallantshow;

16
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.730
their bloody sign of battle ishung out,

17
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.800
and something to be doneimmediately.

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.200
Octavius, lead your battlesoftly on,

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.700
upon the left hand of the evenfield.

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.500
Upon the right hand I, keep thouthe left.

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.170
Why do you cross me in thisexigent?

22
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.130
I do not cross you, but I willdo so.

23
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.830
They stand, and would haveparley.

24
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.570
Stand fast, Titinius; we mustout and talk.

25
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.230
Mark Antony, shall we give signof battle?

26
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.330
No, Caesar, we will answer ontheir charge.

27
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.570
Make forth, the generals wouldhave some words.

28
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.900
Stir not until the signal.

29
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.130
Words before blows.

30
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.270
Is it so, countrymen?

31
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.000
Not that we love words better,as you do.

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.870
Good words are better than badstrokes, Octavius.

33
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.600
In your bad strokes, Brutus, yougive good words.

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.300
Witness the hole you made inCaesar's heart,

35
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.470
crying, "Long live. Hail,Caesar."

36
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.200
Antony, the posture of yourblows are yet unknown;

37
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.200
but for your words, they rob theHybla bees,

38
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.670
and leave them honeyless.

39
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.530
Not stingless too.

40
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.330
O, yes, and soundless too, foryou have stol'n their buzzing,

41
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.230
Antony, and very wisely threatbefore you sting.

42
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.370
Villains, you did not so whenyour vile daggers

43
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.370
hack'd one another in the sidesof Caesar.

44
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.770
You show'd your teeth like apes,and fawn'd like hounds,

45
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.670
and bow'd like bondmen, kissingCaesar's feet;

46
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.800
whilst damned Casca, like a cur,

47
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400
behind struck Caesar on theneck.

48
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.300
O you flatterers!

49
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.530
Flatterers?

50
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.970
Now, Brutus, thank yourself.

51
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.070
This tongue had not offended sotoday,

52
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.570
if Cassius might have ruled.

53
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.130
Come, come, the cause.

54
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.230
If arguing make us sweat,

55
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.400
the proof of it will turn toredder drops.

56
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.170
Look, I draw a sword againstconspirators;

57
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.200
when think you that the swordgoes up again?

58
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.170
Never, till Caesar's three andtwenty wounds be well avenged,

59
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.570
or till another Caesar

60
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.600
have added slaughter to thesword of traitors.

61
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.000
Caesar, thou canst not die bytraitors' hands,

62
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.170
unless thou bring'st them withthee.

63
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.270
So I hope, I was not born to dieon Brutus' sword.

64
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.330
O, if thou wert the noblest ofthy strain, young man,

65
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.070
thou couldst not die morehonorable.

66
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.800
A peevish school boy, worthlessof such honor,

67
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.470
join'd with a masker and areveler.

68
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.800
Old Cassius still.

69
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.530
Come, Antony, away.

70
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.200
Defiance, traitors, hurl we inyour teeth.

71
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.930
If you dare fight today, come tothe field;

72
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.630
if not, when you have stomachs.

73
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.870
Messala.

74
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.130
What says my general?

75
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.800
Messala...

76
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.170
this is my birthday.

77
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.170
At this very day was Cassiusborn.

78
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.130
Give me thy hand, Messala.

79
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.500
Be thou my witness that, againstmy will, as Pompey was,

80
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.630
am I compell'd to set upon onebattle all our liberties.

81
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.300
You know that I held Epicurusstrong, and his opinion.

82
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.900
Now I change my mind, and partlycredit things that do presage.

83
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.370
Coming from Sardis,

84
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.630
upon our former ensign twomighty eagles fell,

85
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.370
and there they perch'd,

86
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.300
gorging and feeding from oursoldiers' hands,

87
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.930
who to Philippi here consortedus.

88
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.100
This morning are they fled awayand gone,

89
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.470
and in their steads do ravens,crows, and kites

90
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.970
fly o'er our heads

91
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.000
and downward look on us, as wewere sickly prey.

92
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.530
Their shadows seem a canopy mostfatal,

93
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.030
under which our army lies, readyto give up the ghost.

94
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.430
Believe not so.

95
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.730
I but believe it partly, for Iam fresh of spirit

96
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.100
and resolved to meet all perilsvery constantly.

97
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.670
Now, most noble Brutus,

98
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.930
the gods today stand friendlythat we may,

99
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.400
lovers in peace, lead on ourdays to age.

100
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.330
But, since the affairs of menrest still incertain,

101
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.930
let's reason with the worst thatmay befall.

102
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.770
If we do lose this battle, thenis this the last time

103
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.570
that you and I will speaktogether?

104
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.400
What are you then determined todo?

105
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.030
Even by the rule of thatphilosophy by which

106
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.270
I did blame Cato for the deathwhich he did give himself--

107
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.330
I know not how, but I do find itcowardly and vile,

108
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.030
for fear of what might fall, soto prevent the time of life--

109
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.970
arming myself with patience tostay the providence

110
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.830
of some high powers that governus below.

111
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.900
Then, if we do lose this battle,

112
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.870
you are contented to be led intriumph

113
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.130
through the streets of Rome?

114
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.730
No, Cassius, no.

115
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.430
Think not, thou noble Roman,

116
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.570
that ever Brutus will go boundto Rome;

117
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.270
he bears too great a mind.

118
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.930
But this same day must end thatwork the ides of March begun.

119
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.070
And whether we shall meet againI know not.

120
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.930
Therefore our everlastingfarewell take.

121
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.470
Forever and forever farewell,Cassius.

122
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.500
If we do meet again, why, weshall smile;

123
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.970
If not, why then this partingwas well made.

124
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:48.600
Forever and forever farewell,Brutus.

125
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.030
If we do meet again, we'll smileindeed;

126
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.030
if not, 'tis true this partingwas well made.

127
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.570
Why then, lead on.

128
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.770
O, that a man might know

129
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.230
the end of this day's businessere it come.

130
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.400
But it sufficeth that the daywill end,

131
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.770
and then the end is known.

132
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.100
Ride, ride, Messala, ride,

133
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.730
and give these bills unto thelegions on the other side.

134
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.230
Let them set on at once,

135
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.730
for I perceive but cold demeanorin Octavia's wing,

136
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.070
and sudden push gives them theoverthrow.

137
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.630
Ride, ride, Messala!

138
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.800
Let them all come down!

139
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:45.530
O, look, Titinius, look, thevillains fly.

140
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.300
Myself have to mine own turn'denemy.

141
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.970
This ensign here of mine wasturning back;

142
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.770
I slew the coward, and did takeit from him.

143
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.900
O Cassius, Brutus gave the wordtoo early,

144
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.800
who, having some advantage onOctavius, took it too eagerly.

145
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.100
His soldiers fell to spoil,

146
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.670
whilst we by Antony are allenclosed.

147
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.570
Fly further off, my lord, flyfurther off;

148
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.930
Mark Antony is in your tents, mylord;

149
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.870
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius,fly far off.

150
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.330
This hill is far enough.

151
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.070
Look, look, Titinius:

152
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.370
are those my tents where Iperceive the fire?

153
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.870
They are, my lord.

154
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.370
Titinius, if thou lovest me,

155
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.200
mount thou my horse and hide thyspurs in him,

156
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.300
till he have brought thee up toyonder troops and here again,

157
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.530
that I may rest assured whetheryond troops be friend or enemy.

158
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.430
I will be here again, even witha thought.

159
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.200
Go, Pindarus, get higher on thathill;

160
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.270
my sight was ever thick; regardTitinius,

161
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.530
and tell me what thou notestabout the field.

162
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.370
This day I breathed first: timeis come round,

163
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.930
and where I did begin, thereshall I end;

164
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.170
my life is run his compass.

165
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.970
Sirrah, what news?

166
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.330
O my lord!

167
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.630
What news?

168
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.630
Titinius is enclosed round aboutwith horsemen,

169
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.970
that make to him on the spur;yet he spurs on!

170
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.070
Now they are almost on him!

171
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.930
Now, Titinius!

172
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.100
Now some light.

173
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:16.770
O, he lights too.

174
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.900
He's ta'en.

175
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.330
And, hark.

176
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.600
They shout for joy.

177
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.600
Come down; behold no more.

178
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:37.170
O, coward that I am, to live solong,

179
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.130
to see my best friend ta'enbefore my face.

180
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.170
Come hither, Sirrah.

181
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.770
In Parthia did I take theeprisoner,

182
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:57.370
and then I swore thee, saving ofthy life,

183
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.870
that whatsoever I did bidst theedo,

184
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.130
thou shouldst attempt it.

185
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.530
Come now, keep thine oath;

186
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:09.270
now be a freeman, and with thisgood sword,

187
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:12.370
that ran through Caesar'sbowels, search this bosom.

188
00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:18.170
Stand not to answer: here, takethou the hilts;

189
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.000
and when my face is cover'd...

190
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:29.030
as 'tis now, guide thou thesword.

191
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.930
Caesar...

192
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.970
thou art...

193
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.830
even with the sword that kill'dthee.

194
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:18.200
So, I am free,

195
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.430
yet would not so have been,durst I have done my will.

196
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.130
O Cassius.

197
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.930
Far from this country Pindarusshall run,

198
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.530
where never Roman shall takenote of him.

199
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.530
It is but change, Titinius,

200
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.200
for Octavius is overthrown bynoble Brutus' power,

201
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.770
as Cassius' legions are byAntony.

202
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.630
Then these tidings would wellcomfort Cassius.

203
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.000
Where did you leave him?

204
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.370
All disconsolate, with Pindarushis bondman, on this hill.

205
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.730
Is not that he that lies uponthe ground?

206
00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:06.000
He lies not like the living.

207
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.970
O my heart.

208
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.370
Is not that he?

209
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:21.100
No, this was he, Messala, butCassius is no more.

210
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:28.770
O setting sun, as in thy redrays thou dost sink to night,

211
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:34.370
so in his red blood doesCassius' day set,

212
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:37.900
the sun of Rome is set.

213
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:45.100
Our day is gone; clouds, dews,and dangers come;

214
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.430
our deeds are done.

215
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:52.430
Mistrust of my success hath donethis deed.

216
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.930
Mistrust of good success hathdone this deed.

217
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:02.600
O hateful error, melancholy'schild,

218
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.070
why dost thou show to the aptthoughts of men

219
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.670
the things that are not?

220
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:12.730
O error, soon conceived, thounever comest unto a happy birth,

221
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.900
but kill'st the mother thatengender'd thee.

222
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.000
What, Pindarus!

223
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.070
Where art thou, Pindarus?

224
00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.070
Seek him, Titinius, whilst I goto meet the noble Brutus,

225
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.630
thrusting this report into hisears.

226
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.130
I may say "thrusting" it,

227
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.670
for piercing steel and dartsenvenomed

228
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.430
shall be as welcome to the earsof Brutus

229
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.500
as tidings of this sight.

230
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.800
Hie you, Messala.

231
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.600
I will seek for Pindarus thewhile.

232
00:14:55.900 --> 00:15:01.170
Why didst thou send me forth,brave Cassius?

233
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.500
Did I not meet thy friends?

234
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.570
And did not they put on my browthis wreath of victory,

235
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.870
and bid me give it thee?

236
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.370
Didst thou not hear theirshouts?

237
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:27.430
Alas, thou hast misconstruedeverything.

238
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:33.030
But, hold thee,

239
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.870
take thou this garland on thybrow;

240
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.800
thy Brutus bid me give it thee,and I will do his bidding.

241
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:51.300
Brutus, come apace, and see howI regarded Caius Cassius.

242
00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:03.770
By your leave, gods, this is aRoman's part.

243
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:13.600
Come, Cassius' sword, and findTitinius' heart.

244
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:28.100
Where, where, Messala, doth hisbody lie?

245
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.070
Lo, yonder, and Titiniusmourning it.

246
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.200
Titinius' face is upward.

247
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.970
He is slain.

248
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.570
O Julius Caesar, thou art mightyyet.

249
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.300
Thy spirit walks abroad,

250
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.430
and turns our swords in our ownproper entrails.

251
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.600
Brave Titinius.

252
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.030
Look whe'er he have not crown'ddead Cassius.

253
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:21.530
Are yet two Romans living suchas these?

254
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:26.770
The last of all the Romans, farethee well.

255
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:30.370
It is impossible that Romeshould ever breed thy fellow.

256
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.530
Friends, I owe more tears tothis dead man

257
00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.070
than you shall ever see me pay.

258
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:55.900
I shall find time, Cassius, Ishall find time.

259
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.670
Come therefore, and to Thasossend his body;

260
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.030
his funerals shall not be in ourcamp, lest it discomfort us.

261
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.730
Lucilius, come, and come, youngCato; let us to the field.

262
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.930
Labio and Flavios, set ourbattles on.

263
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.770
'Tis three o'clock, and Romans,yet ere night

264
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.930
we shall try fortune in a secondfight.

265
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:25.200
Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold upyour heads!

266
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.430
What bastard doth not?

267
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.570
Who will go with me?

268
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.430
I will proclaim my name aboutthe field.

269
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.430
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

270
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.830
A foe to tyrants, and mycountry's friend.

271
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.070
I am the son of Marcus Cato!

272
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.430
And I am Brutus!

273
00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.500
Marcus Brutus, I!

274
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.900
Brutus, my country's friend;know me for Brutus.

275
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.430
O young and noble Cato, art thoudown?

276
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.730
Why, now thou diest as bravelyas Titinius,

277
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:17.470
and mayst be honor'd, beingCato's son.

278
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.830
Yield, or thou diest.

279
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.970
Only I yield to die.

280
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.930
There is so much that thou wiltkill me straight:

281
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.300
kill Brutus, and be honor'd inhis death.

282
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.400
We must not.

283
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.500
A noble prisoner.

284
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.600
Room, ho!

285
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.870
Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.

286
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:32.970
I'll tell the news.

287
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.070
Here comes the general.

288
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.800
Brutus is ta'en, Brutus ista'en, my lord.

289
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.170
Where is he?

290
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.470
Safe, Antony, Brutus is safeenough.

291
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.030
I dare assure thee that no enemy

292
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.070
shall ever take alive the nobleBrutus;

293
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.130
the gods defend him from sogreat a shame.

294
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.430
When you do find him, or aliveor dead,

295
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.070
he will be found like Brutus,like himself.

296
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.770
This is not Brutus, friends,

297
00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.930
but, I assure you, a prize noless in worth.

298
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.300
Keep this man safe, give him allkindness;

299
00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.500
I had rather have such men myfriends than enemies.

300
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.930
Go on, and see whether Brutus bealive or dead,

301
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.970
and bring us word unto Octavius'tent

302
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.070
how everything is chanced.

303
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:40.230
Come hither, poor remains offriends, rest here.

304
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.030
Statilius show'd the torchlight,but, my lord, he came not back.

305
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.700
He is or ta'en or slain.

306
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.730
Sit thee down, Clitus.

307
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:55.900
Slaying is the word: it is adeed in fashion.

308
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:00.470
Hark thee, Clitus.

309
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.030
What, I, my lord?

310
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.870
No, not for all the world.

311
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.030
Peace then, no word.

312
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.400
I'd rather kill myself.

313
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.230
Hark thee, Dardanius.

314
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.170
Shall I do such a deed?

315
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.300
O Dardanius.

316
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.630
O Clitus.

317
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.930
What ill request did Brutus maketo thee?

318
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.830
To kill him, Clitus.

319
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.430
Now is that noble vessel full ofgrief,

320
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.730
that it runs over even at hiseyes.

321
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.970
Come hither, good Volumnius,list a word.

322
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.330
What says my lord?

323
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:25.700
Why, this, Volumnius: the ghostof Caesar hath appear'd to me

324
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.430
two several times by night;

325
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:36.570
at Sardis once, and this lastnight here in Philippi fields.

326
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:38.200
I know my hour is come.

327
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.370
Not so, my lord.

328
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.130
Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.

329
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.330
Thou seest the world, Volumnius,how it goes;

330
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:54.470
our enemies have beat us to thepit;

331
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.400
It is more worthy that we shouldleap in ourselves

332
00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.500
than tarry till they push us.

333
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:07.130
Good Volumnius,

334
00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:12.000
thou know'st that we two went toschool together;

335
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.570
even for that our love of old, Iprithee,

336
00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.000
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilstI run on it.

337
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.570
That's not an office for afriend, my lord.

338
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:35.070
Fly, my lord, fly, there is notarrying here.

339
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:38.270
Farewell to you, and you, andyou, Volumnius.

340
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:41.630
Strato, thou hast been all thiswhile asleep;

341
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.830
farewell to thee too, Strato.

342
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.830
Countrymen, my heart doth joy

343
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:56.100
that yet in all my life I foundno man but he was true to me.

344
00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.370
I shall have glory by thislosing day,

345
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.630
more than Octavius and MarkAntony

346
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.400
by this vile conquest shallattain unto.

347
00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.100
So, fare you well at once,

348
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.000
for Brutus' tongue hath almostended his life's history.

349
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.430
Night hangs upon mine eyes,

350
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:25.870
my bones would rest that havebut labor'd

351
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.770
to attain this hour.

352
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.130
Fly, my lord, fly.

353
00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:33.600
Hence, I will follow.

354
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:40.930
I prithee, Strato, stay thou bythy lord.

355
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.500
Thou art a fellow of a goodrespect;

356
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.270
thy life hath had some smatch ofhonor in it.

357
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:53.730
Hold then my sword, and turnaway thy face,

358
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.130
while I do run upon it.

359
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.770
Wilt thou, Strato?

360
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:11.800
Give me your hand first.

361
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.400
Fare you well, my lord.

362
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.030
Farewell, good Strato.

363
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.330
Caesar, now be still;

364
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.300
I kill'd not thee with half sogood a will.

365
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.070
What man is that?

366
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:03.630
My master's man.

367
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.730
Strato, where is thy master?

368
00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:10.400
Free from the bondage you arein, Messala:

369
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.130
the conquerors can but make afire of him;

370
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.600
for Brutus only overcamehimself,

371
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.430
and no man else hath honor byhis death.

372
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.000
So Brutus should be found.

373
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.570
I thank thee, Brutus,

374
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.000
that thou hast proved Lucilius'saying true.

375
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.830
All that served Brutus, I willentertain them.

376
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:34.870
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thytime with me?

377
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.000
Ay, if Messala will prefer me toyou.

378
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.300
Do so, good Messala.

379
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.330
How died my master, Strato?

380
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.230
I held the sword, and he did runon it.

381
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.570
Octavius, then take him tofollow thee

382
00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.870
that did the latest service tomy master.

383
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:14.170
This was the noblest Roman ofthem all.

384
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.100
All the conspirators, save onlyhe,

385
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.570
did that they did in envy ofgreat Caesar;

386
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:26.030
he only, in a general honestthought and common good to all,

387
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.600
made one of them.

388
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.200
His life was gentle, and theelements so mix'd in him

389
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.400
that Nature might stand up andsay to all the world,

390
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.900
"This was a man."

391
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.470
According to his virtue

392
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.770
let us use him with all respectand rites of burial.

393
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.570
Within my tent his bones tonightshall lie,

394
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:54.300
most like a soldier, orderedhonorably.

395
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.600
So call the field to rest, andlet's away,

396
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.630
to part the glories of thishappy day.

397
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
