00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.900


2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.000
You're well met once again.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.830
So are you.

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.000
You come to take your stand here,

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.270
and behold The Lady Anne

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.430
pass from her coronation?

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.500
'Tis all my business.

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.770
At our last encounter,

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.670
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.270
'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;

11
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.530
This, general joy.

12
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.770
'Tis well: the citizens, I am sure,

13
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.400
have shown at full their royal minds

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.830
As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward

15
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.300
In celebration of this day with shows,

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.370
Pageants and sights of honour.

17
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.300
Never greater,

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.730
Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.

19
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.370
May I be bold to ask at what that contains,

20
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.030
That paper in your hand?

21
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.170
Yes; 'tis the list

22
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.100
Of those that claim their offices this day

23
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.070
By custom of the coronation.

24
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.770
The Duke of Suffolk is the first,

25
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.470
and claims to be high-steward;

26
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.030
next, the Duke of Norfolk,

27
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.600
He to be earl marshal:

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.670
you may read the rest.

29
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.870
I thank you, sir:

30
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.700
had I not known those customs,

31
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.630
I should have been beholding to your paper.

32
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.630
But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,

33
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.170
The princess dowager? how goes her business?

34
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.500
That I can tell you too.

35
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.330
The Archbishop of Canterbury,

36
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.670
accompanied with other learned and reverend fathers

37
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.600
of his order,

38
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.330
Held a late court at Dunstable,

39
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.800
six miles off from Ampthill where the princess lay;

40
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.570
to which she was often cited by them,

41
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.700
but appear'd not:

42
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.230
And, to be short, for not appearance

43
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.800
and the king's late scruple,

44
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.070
by the main assent of all these learned men

45
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.370
she was divorced,

46
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.630
And the late marriage made of none effect

47
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.730
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,

48
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.300
Where she remains now sick.

49
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.900
Alas, good lady!

50
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.200
(trumpets sound)

51
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.100
The trumpets sound!

52
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Stand close, the queen is coming!

53
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.300
A royal train, believe me. These I know:

54
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.930
Who's that that bears the sceptre?

55
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.400
Marquess Dorset:

56
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.430
And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.

57
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.570
A bold brave gentleman.

58
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.700
That should be the Duke of Suffolk?

59
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.770
'Tis the same: high-steward.

60
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.400
And that my Lord of Norfolk?

61
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.030
Yes;

62
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.200
Heaven bless thee!

63
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.830
Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.

64
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.200
Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;

65
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.930
Our king has all the Indies in his arms,

66
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.130
And more and richer, when he strains that lady:

67
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.970
I cannot blame his conscience.

68
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.030
They that bear the cloth of honour over her,

69
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.870
are four barons of the Cinque-ports.

70
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.470
Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.

71
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.470
I take it, she that carries up the train

72
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.570
Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.

73
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.500
It is; and all the rest are countesses.

74
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.570
Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;

75
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.170
And sometimes falling ones.

76
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.100
No more of that.

77
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.070
How does your grace?

78
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.000
O Griffith, sick to death!

79
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.230
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,

80
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.030
Willing to leave their burthen.

81
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.430
Reach a chair:

82
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.900
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.

83
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.800
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith,

84
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.770
as thou led'st me,

85
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.330
That the great child of honour,

86
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.970
Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?

87
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.730
Yes, madam; but I think your grace,

88
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.400
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.

89
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.670
Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:

90
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.130
If well, he stepp'd before me,

91
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.300
happily for my example.

92
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.200
Well, the voice goes, madam:

93
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.100
For after the stout Earl Northumberland

94
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.670
Arrested him at York,

95
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.070
and brought him forward,

96
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.400
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,

97
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.930
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill

98
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.130
He could not sit his mule.

99
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.330
Alas, poor man!

100
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.330
At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,

101
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.900
Lodged in the abbey;

102
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.030
where the reverend abbot,

103
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.400
With all his covent,

104
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.100
honourably received him;

105
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.300
and, three nights after this,

106
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.100
About the hour of eight,

107
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.970
which he himself Foretold should be his last,

108
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.770
He gave his honours to the world again,

109
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.270
His blessed part to heaven,

110
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.430
and slept in peace.

111
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.100
So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!

112
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.700
Yet thus far, Griffith,

113
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.170
give me leave to speak him,

114
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.770
And yet with charity.

115
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.670
He was a man of an unbounded stomach,

116
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.200
ever ranking himself with princes;

117
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.300
one that, by suggestion,

118
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.200
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;

119
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.770
His own opinion was his law:

120
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.000
i' the presence he would say untruths;

121
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.700
and be ever double both in his words and meaning:

122
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.800
he was never, but where he meant to ruin,

123
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.700
pitiful: his promises were,

124
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.200
as he then was, mighty;

125
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.600
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:

126
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.570
Noble madam,

127
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.500
Men's evil manners live in brass;

128
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.700
their virtues we write in water.

129
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.270
May it please your highness

130
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.630
To hear me speak his good now?

131
00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.600
Yes, good Griffith;

132
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.370
I were malicious else.

133
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.170
This cardinal,

134
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.430
Though from an humble stock,

135
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.470
undoubtedly was fashion'd to much honour

136
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.230
from his cradle.

137
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.730
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;

138
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.000
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:

139
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.370
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;

140
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.570
But to those men that sought him

141
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.530
sweet as summer.

142
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.830
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;

143
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.070
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,

144
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.730
And found the blessedness of being little:

145
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.770
And, to add greater honours to his age

146
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.770
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

147
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.670
After my death I wish no other herald,

148
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.630
No other speaker of my living actions,

149
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.600
To keep mine honour from corruption,

150
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.600
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.

151
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.800
Whom I most hated living,

152
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.730
thou hast made me,

153
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.830
With thy religious truth and modesty,

154
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.230
Now in his ashes honour:

155
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.170
peace be with him!

156
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.830
Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:

157
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.070
I have not long to trouble thee.

158
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.470
Good Griffith, cause the musicians

159
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.700
play me that sad note

160
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.670
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating

161
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:37.370
On that celestial harmony I go to.

162
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.500
She is asleep:

163
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.670
good wench, let's sit down quiet,

164
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.530
For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.

165
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.600
Spirits of peace, where are ye?

166
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:49.800
are ye all gone,

167
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.300
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?

168
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.170
Madam, we are here.

169
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.330
It is not you I call for:

170
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.170
Saw ye none enter since I slept?

171
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.730
None, madam.

172
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.100
No? Saw you not, even now,

173
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.930
a blessed troop invite me to a banquet;

174
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:10.870
whose bright faces

175
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.330
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?

176
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.300
They promised me eternal happiness;

177
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.970
And brought me garlands, Griffith,

178
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.070
which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear:

179
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.100
I shall, assuredly.

180
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.400
I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams

181
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.170
Possess your fancy.

182
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.900
Bid the music leave,

183
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.530
They are harsh and heavy to me.

184
00:10:58.770 --> 00:10:59.770
Do you note

185
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.130
How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?

186
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.100
How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,

187
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.000
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!

188
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.830
She is going, wench: pray, pray.

189
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.800
Heaven comfort her!

190
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.600
An't like your grace,

191
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.070
You are a saucy fellow:

192
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.200
Deserve we no more reverence?

193
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.770
You are to blame,

194
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.000
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,

195
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.600
To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.

196
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.230
I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;

197
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.800
My haste made me unmannerly.

198
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.030
There is staying a gentleman,

199
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:43.600
sent from the king, to see you.

200
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.870
Admit him entrance, Griffith:

201
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.730
but this fellow let me ne'er see again.

202
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.770
If my sight fail not,

203
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.870
You should be lord ambassador

204
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.100
from the emperor, my royal nephew,

205
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.100
and your name Capucius.

206
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.430
Madam, the same; your servant.

207
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.570
O, my lord,

208
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.630
The times and titles now

209
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.630
are alter'd strangely with me

210
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.870
since first you knew me.

211
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.730
But, I pray you,

212
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.000
What is your pleasure with me?

213
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.230
Noble lady,

214
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.270
First mine own service to your grace;

215
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.870
the next, the king's request

216
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.330
that I would visit you;

217
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.670
Who grieves much for your weakness,

218
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.570
and by me sends you his princely commendations,

219
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:49.970
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.

220
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.270
O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;

221
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:59.430
'Tis like a pardon after execution:

222
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.000
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;

223
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.570
But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.

224
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.100
How does his highness?

225
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.170
Madam, in good health.

226
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.000
So may he ever do! and ever flourish,

227
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.600
When I shal l dwell with worms,

228
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.870
and my poor name banish'd the kingdom!

229
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.600
Patience, is that letter, I caused you write

230
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.730
yet sent away?

231
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.100
No, madam.

232
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.170
Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver

233
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.370
This to my lord the king.

234
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.470
Most willing, madam.

235
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.230
In which I have commended to his goodness

236
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.130
The model of our chaste loves,

237
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.270
his young daughter;

238
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.630
The dews of heaven fall thick

239
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.730
in blessings on her!

240
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.830
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding

241
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.670
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,

242
00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.800
I hope she will deserve well,

243
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.670
and a little to love her for her mother's sake,

244
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:10.370
that loved him, heaven knows how dearly.

245
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:15.500
My next poor petition is,

246
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.830
that his noble grace would have some pity

247
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.770
Upon my wretched women,

248
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.770
that so long have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:

249
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.730
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,

250
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.530
And now I should not lie,

251
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.830
but will deserve for virtue

252
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.700
and true beauty of the soul,

253
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.330
For honesty and decent carriage,

254
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.830
A right good husband,

255
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.300
let him be a noble

256
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.930
and, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.

257
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.330
The last is, for my men;

258
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.700
they are the poorest,

259
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.800
But poverty could never draw 'em from me;

260
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.970
That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,

261
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.000
And something over to remember me by:

262
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.070
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life

263
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:11.870
And able means, we had not parted thus.

264
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.630
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,

265
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.300
By that you love the dearest in this world,

266
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.500
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,

267
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.430
Stand these poor people's friend,

268
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.430
and urge the king to do me this last right.

269
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.400
By heaven, I will,

270
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.070
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

271
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.300
I thank you, honest lord.

272
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:49.200
Remember me in all humility unto his highness:

273
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.270
Say his long trouble

274
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.800
now is passing out of this world;

275
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.100
tell him, in death I bless'd him,

276
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.370
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim.

277
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.370
Farewell, my lord.

278
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:22.600
Griffith, farewell.

279
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:26.670
Nay, Patience,

280
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.670
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;

281
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.670
Call in more women.

282
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:34.170
When I am dead, good wench,

283
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.400
Let me be used with honour:

284
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.200
strew me over with maiden flowers,

285
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.470
that all the world may know I was a chaste wife

286
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.830
to my grave:

287
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.970
embalm me, then lay me forth:

288
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.030
although unqueen'd,

289
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:58.400
yet like a queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.

290
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.800
I can no more.

291
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.930
