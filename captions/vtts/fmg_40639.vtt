ON A REMARKABLE EXPEDITION.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.370
TO STUDY THE HISTORY OF THIS
ICE.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.970
THE GERMAN AND RUSSIAN TEAM
HAD BEEN PREPARING FOR YEARS,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.900
HERE IN THE FAR NORTH EAST OF
RUSSIA, CLOSE TO THE DATE

HUGE METEORITE.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870
WHEN THE FIREBALL IMPACTED, IT
MELTED THE ROCKS AND FORMED A

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.200
GIANT CRATER WHICH FILLED OVER
MILLIONS OF YEARS WITH WATER,

DUST, AND SEDIMENT.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.130
THESE COULD TELL US MORE ABOUT
THE FORMATION OF THE EARTH.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.500
THEY REVEAL CLIMATE CHANGES,
WHAT PLANTS AND ANIMALS LIVED

THE WEATHER WAS UNSETTLED.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.000
THE SCIENTISTS HAD TO WAIT A
WEEK BEFORE THE METEOROLOGICAL

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.730

WHERE WE HAVE TWO HOUSES.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.870
ONE OF THEM WILL BE FOR IT'S,
A LITTLE BIT LATER WE WILL

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.700
MOVE IT TO THE SIDE WHERE
THERE WILL BE A DRILL

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.530
RIG AND IT WILL BE FOR
CORE HANDLING FOR US AND

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.130
JUST FOR WARM FOR US
JUST TO SURVIVE.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:23.470

BECAME DEEP CREVASSES.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.600
PERMAFROST IS ICE INSIDE THE

FROM WEATHERING.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.670
BUT WHEN THE PERMAFROST MELTS,
WATER IS FORMED.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.470
THAT CAN BUILD UP PRESSURE
THAT CAUSES WHOLE SECTIONS OF

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.700
ROCK TO BREAK AWAY.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.670
THERE CAN BE ROCK FALLS AND
MUD SLIDES.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.800
THEY'RE CAUSED BY THE
WATER PRESSURE FROM

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.430
MELTED PERMAFROST.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.270

MELT WATER CAN'T FLOW AWAY.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:48.770
WITHOUT THE PERMAFROST TO SEAL
A MOUNTAIN, WATER SOAKS IN.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.670
AS THE CLIMATE CHANGES, THE
MELT WATER FROM THE GLACIERS

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.400
AND THE ICE IN THE MOUNTAINS
HAS BECOME A PROBLEM.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.770
AND IT'S UNPRECEDENTED.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.530
HANS RUDOLF KEUSEN
HAS INSTALLED SENSORS AND VIDEO

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.030
CAMERAS IN THE MOUNTAINS
AROUND GRINDELWALD.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:08.600
ONE OF THEM RECORDED DRAMATIC
IMAGES IN 2008.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.000
THERE HAD NEVER BEEN A LAKE
HERE, SUDDENLY, THE WATER FROM

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.200
THAWING SNOW ON THE SURFACE
AND MELTING PERMAFROST FROM

THE LAKE FILLED UP OVER SIX
MONTHS.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:29.000
AND EMPTIED AGAIN OVERNIGHT
WITHIN MINUTES.

SYSTEM WORKS WELL WITH

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.430
MEASUREMENTS FROM THE LAKE AND
OBSERVATIONS FROM UP HERE.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.970
THE FLOOD WATERS COULD BECOME
SO MASSIVE THAT ONE WOULDN'T

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.930
BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEM IN THE
VALLEYS AND THEY WOULD CAUSE

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.730
GREAT DAMAGE.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:48.430
WE HAVE TO TRY TO PREVENT
THAT.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.470
THE JUNGFRAUJOCH OFTEN CALLED
"THE TOP OF EUROPE" IS A MAJOR

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.070
TOURIST ATTRACTION IN THE
REGION.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.030
KEUSEN MONITORS
THE DANGER HERE.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.130
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN RISING FOR

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.930
A CENTURY WITH THE RESULT THAT
THIS SADDLE BETWEEN THE MONCH

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.130
AND JUNGFRAU MOUNTAINS IS
THREATENED.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.830
AT PRESENT, IT'S 3,471 METERS
HIGH.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.970
BUT IF THE ICE CONTINUES
MELTING, THAT FIGURE WILL HAVE

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.570
TO BE CORRECTED.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.630
THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHRINKING.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.830
KEUSEN PAYS CLOSE ATTENTION TO
ROCK FACES EXPOSED TO THE SUN.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.970
THIS IS WHERE THAWING STARTS
AND THE GREATEST DANGER LIES.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.270
ONE TOURIST TUNNEL IN
THE JUNGFRAUJOCH HAD TO

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.930
BE CLOSED.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.000
THE NEW TUNNEL WAS OPENED JUST
A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.600
BUT IT'S DAYS ARE ALREADY
NUMBERED.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.970
KEUSEN HAS INSISTED ON SAFETY
NETS AND TOURISTS ARE STILL

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:06.170
ALLOWED IN, FOR THE TIME
BEING.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:23.970
>> TWO YEARS AGO WE DISCOVERED
THE FIRST CRACKS WITH WATER

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:29.030
PERMEATING AND ICICLES
FORMING.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:34.200
HANS RUDOLF KEUSEN SAYS THESE
SIGNS ARE TYPICAL.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.170
YOU SEE, NEW CRACKS HERE
LETTING WATER THROUGH.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.770
THAT'S THE MELTING PERMAFROST
AND IT SEEPS RIGHT INTO

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.200
THE MOUNTAIN.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.770
THE WARMTH COMES FROM OUTSIDE
FROM THE SUN RAYS ON THE

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.170
SOUTH SIDE.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.900
AND THE PERMAFROST THAWS
DEEPER AND DEEPER INSIDE

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.830
THE MOUNTAIN.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.300
IF THE ROCK REMAINED FROZEN,
THERE'D BE NO DANGER TO

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.770
THE TOURISTS HERE IN COMING
DECADES, BUT THE MELTING ICE

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.900
IS CAUSING THE ROCK TO
CRUMBLE.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.200
AT A DEPTH OF 15 METERS,
KEUSEN'S EXTENSOMETERS

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.300
SCAN THE MOUNTAIN.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.530
THERE ARE STRING GAUGES THAT
MEASURE DISPLACEMENT WITHIN A

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.830
FRACTION OF A MILLIMETER.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.700
THE DATA IS PUBLISHED ONLINE.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.170
IF THE DISPLACEMENTS BECOME
TOO GREAT, HANS RUDOLF KEUSEN

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.170
WILL HAVE TO STOP TOURISTS
COMING ON TO THE JUNGFRAUJOCH.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:25.200
THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT
600,000 VISITORS A YEAR.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.870
THEY TRAVEL UP HERE ON
EUROPE'S HIGHEST RAILWAY TO

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.170
VIEW MOUNT JUNGFRAU.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:35.630
THE PEAK IS OVER 4,000 METERS.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.830
KEUSEN HAS BEEN WORKING HERE
FOR OVER 25 YEARS.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.700
THE GEOLOGICAL DATA HE HAS
COLLECTED IS ALARMING.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:50.330
THE RAILWAY STATION HAS HAD TO
BE PROPPED UP SEVERAL TIMES.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.770
>> I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE
MOUNTAIN IS OPENING UP.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.000
THAT THESE CRACKS ARE WIDENING
ABOUT 1 MILLIMETER A YEAR.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.700
THAT MAY NOT SEEM MUCH, BUT
IT'S A TREND.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.700
WHENEVER TEMPERATURES RISE, IT
OPENS MORE.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.400
IT'S GETTING WORSE.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.230
AND I DON'T SEE ANY INDICATION
THAT IT'S NOW SUDDENLY GOING

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.000
TO STOP.

HERE IN CHUKOTKA, CLOSE TO THE
ARCTIC OCEAN.

FORTY CENTIMETERS THICK,

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.430
SO WE CAN WALK ON IT.

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:40.630
WE'LL SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
FURTHER ON.

SAFETY WAS, OF COURSE,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.070
TOP PRIORITY.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.130
IF ONE OF THEM HAD AN
ACCIDENT, OR THE ICE GAVE WAY,

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:52.130
IT COULD'VE BEEN DAYS BEFORE
HELP ARRIVED.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.270
THE CURRENT QUALITY OF THE
WATER PROVIDED THEM WITH A

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.030
REFERENCE VALUE.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.500
LATER, THEY WOULD COMPARE IT
WITH THE WATER THEY EXTRACTED

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.300
WHEN DRILLING.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.970
THAT WOULD THROW LIGHT ON THE
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREVIOUS

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.270
AGES AND THE PRESENT.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:11.870
THEY PLAN TO TAKE SAMPLES FROM
AS DEEP AS 140 METERS.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.300
>> THIS IS JUST FOR THE CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS, BUT IN THE FIRST 20

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.200
METERS WE ALSO FIND ALGAE, AND
WE ASSUME THAT BY DRILLING INTO

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.530
THE PERMAFROST, WE'LL ALSO FIND
LAKE SEDIMENTS IN WHICH THESE

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.370
ALGAE ARE CONSERVED FROM THE
PAST.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.800
AND WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THE
PRESENT SYSTEM, THAT'S WHY

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.400
WE'VE TAKEN THIS SAMPLE, WE'LL
BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO SAY

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.130

THAT A METEORITE HAS CRASHED

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.070
INTO THIS ROCK.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.300
IN THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, THE
ROCK MELTED.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.930
IT HAS SINCE CRYSTALLIZED
AGAIN, BUT SO FINE AND SO

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.130
BLACK THAT YOU CAN'T RECOGNIZE
ANY OTHER COLORS.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.870
THEY CAN ONLY BE SEEN THROUGH
A MICROSCOPE.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.500
THE BLACK IS THE SOLIDIFIED
MOLTEN MASS THAT OCCURRED

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.070
THROUGH THE IMPACT.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.800
THIS STONE IS CALLED
IMPACTITE.

METEORITE STRUCK.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.130
IT WAS 3.6 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.030
AND SINCE THEN, THERE'S BEEN
THIS POOL WHICH INTERESTS US

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.670
SO MUCH.

>> Narrator: THE ICE WAS ONLY
TEN CENTIMETERS THICK.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.570
THE SCIENTISTS DECIDED NOT TO
TAKE THE RISK.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:56.100
IN A FEW WEEKS, THE LAKE
WOULD'VE FROZEN SO THOROUGHLY

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:01.070

ALWAYS DRILLING RELATED TO THE
VERY HARD AND HEAVY TECHNIQUE

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.970
AND YOU NEED BIG TRUCKS TO
OPERATE WITH IT.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:41.300
QUITE A NUMBER OF CREW, QUITE
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR IT, SO

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.070
IT TAKES SOME TIME TO TELL THE
MEN WHAT TO DO, REALLY.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:56.230

TRACK VEHICLES HAULING THE
EQUIPMENT OVER THE ICE.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.500

1000 TONS OF FUEL, A
LABORATORY, AND A WORKSHOP.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.200
DEEP SNOW MADE THE GOING
TOUGH.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.670
IT TOOK TWO DAYS TO MOVE THE

DRILLING POSITION.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.930
IN ADDITION TO THE RIG, A
GENERATOR AND A LABORATORY HAD

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:00.570
TO BE TRANSPORTED TO THE LAKE.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.170
THE GERMAN-RUSSIAN EXPEDITION
TEAM WERE HOPING TO FIND

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:07.070
IMPORTANT EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE
CHANGE.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.570
IN WARM PERIODS, THERE MUST
HAVE BEEN WATER HERE.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:16.270
IN COLD TIMES, ICE AND DEBRIS.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.600
THE GERMAN SCIENTISTS HAD TO
BE SHOWN HOW THE RIG WORKS.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.600
AT THIS STAGE, THEY ONLY HAD A
VAGUE IDEA OF THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.830
>> IT WASN'T ALWAYS CLEAR
IN THE INITIAL DISCUSSIONS

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.930
WHAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE
USED, BUT WE HAVE HERE A

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.130
METHOD THAT FACILITATES VERY
FAST AND VERY CLEAN DRILLING.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:50.530
IT USES COMPRESSED AIR.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.500
THAT MEANS THE CORE, WHICH WE
WILL LATER HOLD IN OUR HANDS,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.670
WILL BE SO CLEAN THAT
WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXAMINE

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.230
IT IMMEDIATELY.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.200
WE WON'T HAVE TO CLEAN IT
FIRST.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.930
THAT'S VERY PROMISING.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.900
WE EXPECT THE CORE TO BE GOOD.

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:09.270
>> Narrator: BY DRILLING
TO A DEPTH OF 100 METERS,

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.700
THE SCIENTISTS HOPE TO BRING
THE EVENTS OF MORE THAN A

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.900
MILLION YEARS TO LIGHT.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.800
BUT FIRST, THEY'D HAVE TO
SPEND A FEW MORE DAYS TESTING

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.600
THEIR EQUIPMENT.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.230
AT NEARLY 3000 METERS,
THE ZUGSPITZE IS GERMANY'S

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.930
HIGHEST MOUNTAIN.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.600
THE EFFECTS OF MELTING ICE ON
THE GEOGRAPHY OF CENTRAL

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.330
EUROPE ARE MOST NOTICEABLE
HERE.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:45.900
SOME 3,700 YEARS AGO, 400
MILLION CUBIC METERS OF ROCK

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.700
BROKE AWAY FROM THE NORTH FACE
OF THE ZUGSPITZE AND BURIED

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.630
EVERYTHING IN THEIR PATH.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.430
SCIENTISTS POINT OUT THAT THE
EARTH WAS EXPERIENCING WARM

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:59.900
TEMPERATURES THEN LIKE THOSE
OF TODAY.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:05.500
COULD THAT NATURAL DISASTER
REOCCUR?

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:14.730
?

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.900
>> Narrator: MIKAEL KARTPLOTTER
AND HIS COLLEAGUES FROM THE

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:25.200
UNIVERSITY OF BONN, ARE TRYING
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.470
>> ALL WE SEE HERE IS VERY SMALL
INCIDENTS, WE CALL THIS A

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.730
TRANSIENT SYSTEM.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:36.170
THAT MEANS, THE SYSTEM IS
CHANGING AT THIS MOMENT.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.330
AND WE CAN OBSERVE WHAT
PARAMETERS DECIDE IF THEY'LL

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.800
BIT OF PERMAFROST OT WHETHER
THE PERMAFROST WILL DISAPPEAR.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.100
IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE SYSTEM
AND THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.770
FOR US ABOUT THE ZUGSPITZE.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.300
?

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.030
>> Narrator: THERE ARE STILL
MANY GLACIERS IN THE MOUNTAINS

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.330
AROUND THE ZUGSPITZE, BUT
THEY'VE BEEN MELTING RAPIDLY

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:59.870
IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.970
IF THEY CONTINUE CONTRACTING
AT THE SAME RATE, THEY'LL HAVE

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.400
DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER TEN.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.530
THAT POSES AN ACUTE THREAT TO
TOURISM, THE INFRASTRUCTURE,

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.530
AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE
REGION.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.230
MIKAEL KARTPLOTTER AND HIS
COLLEAGUES MEASURE THE ICE

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.170
CONTENT OF THE ROCK.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.030
THE RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE
ELECTRICAL CONTACTS SHOWS THEM

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.130
WHEN AND BY HOW MUCH THE
FROZEN CORE RECEDES IN SUMMER

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.570
AND GROWS AGAIN IN WINTER.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:34.130
THEY USE AN OLD TUNNEL THAT
ONCE LINKED TWO SKI AREAS.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.970
THE GEOLOGISTS HAVE SET
THEIR ELECTRODES ALL OVER

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.630
THE MOUNTAIN.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.670
EVENTUALLY, THEY HOPE TO
OBTAIN A KIND OF X-RAY IMAGE

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.770
OF THE ZUGSPITZE SHOWING
THE FROST WHICH SURVIVES

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.330
THE SUMMER.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.570
>> WE'VE MEASURED THE
TEMPERATURES ON THE OUTSIDE,

00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:00.630
WE ALSO HAVE TEMPERATURES
SENSORS IN THE TUNNEL ITSELF.

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.000
WE CAN MEASURE THE TEMPERATURE
OF THE WALLS, BUT WE DON'T

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.800
KNOW HOW WARM IT IS AT A DEPTH
OF 5 OR 10 METERS.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.400
THAT'S WAHT WE WANT TO FIND
OUT.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.330
SO WE'VE EMBEDDED 160
ELECTRODES IN THE ROCK.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.070
WE CAN FEED ELECTRICITY TO ANY
ONE OF THEM AND THEN MEASURE

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.370
HOW MUCH OF IT REACHES THE
NEXT ELECTRODE.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:19.530
THAT WAY, WE CAN SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING INSIDE THE ROCK.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.600
>> Narrator: MIKAEL KARTPLOTTER
REPEATS THE EXPERIMENT AT

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.600
VARIOUS TIMES OF THE YEAR.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.100
HE'S ALREADY EXPECTING MASSIVE
LANDSLIDES IN THE NEXT

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.700
FEW YEARS.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.130
THE GEOLOGISTS INTENDED TO
INSTALL ON THE ZUGSPITZE THAT

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.800
WILL CONTINUOUSLY TRANSMIT
DATA TO THEIR LABORATORY

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.230
IN BONN.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:40.100
AN OLD SIDE TUNNEL LEADS
DIRECTLY INTO THE ROCK FACE.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.200
>> BEHIND ME, IS THE NORTH FACE
OF THE ZUGSPITZE AND THIS IS

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.230
ONE OF THE LAST EXAMPLES OF
PERMAFROST IN THE ZUGSPITZE.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.300
THE CORE'S OF THE VERY STEEP
NORTHERN ROCK FACE BEHIND ME,

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.370
WHICH LOSES A LOT OF HEAT IN
WINTER.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.770
THAT'S WHY THIS IS ONE OF THE
VERY FEW REMAINING PERMAFROST

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.330
AREAS IN THE MOUNTAIN.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.030
>> Narrator: AT AN ELEVATION OF
2,900 METERS, THE SCIENTISTS

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:06.500
EMERGE FROM THE MOUNTAIN
WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.970
BATTERIES, CABLE DRUMS,
TEMPERATURE SENSORS AND

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.370
WEATHER PROOF CASINGS.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.070
HERE ON THE SUMMIT THEY INTEND
TO INSTALL THEM ON THIS

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.870
ROCK FACE.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.770
EVEN IN WINTER, THE SNOW SOON
MELTS HERE.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.730
SNOW INSULATES THE MOUNTAIN
AND WOULD DISTORT THE RESULTS

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:26.030
THE SCIENTISTS ARE LOOKING
FOR.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.430
KARTPLOTTER AND HIS COLLEAGUES
ARE EXPERIENCED RESEARCHERS,

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.330
BUT IN THESE FREEZING
TEMPERATURES, RAIN, AND SNOW,

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.000
THEY FACE NEW CHALLENGES.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.870
THE SCIENTISTS EXPERIENCE
PROBLEMS WITH THEIR

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.400
SAFETY HOOKS.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.200
THEY WON'T GRIP.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.870
THE ROCK SPLITS AND EVEN ICE
SCREWS WON'T HOLD.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.730
IT'S JUNE AND MOST OF THE ICE
HAS ALREADY MELTED.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:54.430
THE SCIENTISTS PROCEED WITHOUT
SAFETY HOOKS.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.430
IT'S PRECISELY WHAT THEY'RE
RESEARCHING THAT CREATES

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.970
THESE PROBLEMS.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.830
THE MOUNTAIN IS CRUMBLING.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.830
>> WE HADN'T EXPECTED THESE
PROBLEMS, BUT ACTUALLY, WE

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:07.930
SHOULD HAVE.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.300
BECAUSE HERE, WE HAVE
PERMAFROST THAT IS CONTRACTING

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.370
AND EXPANDING THROUGHOUT THE
SUMMER AND WINTER.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.100
THE CONTINUOUS FREEZING AND
MELTING TRIGGERS THIS FINE

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.230
RUBBLE COMING DOWN THE
MOUNTAIN.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.130
IT'S THE SAME PROBLEM WE'RE
HAVING TO COPE WITH NOW.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:27.070
WHERE IS A STABLE POINT AT
WHICH WE CAN FASTEN OURSELVES?

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:38.300
>> Narrator: NEVERTHELESS, THEY
SUCCEED.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.170
WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SUMMIT
STATION, THEY INSTALL THE

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:44.970
SENSORS THAT WILL TRANSMIT
DATA OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.430
WHICH WILL TELL MIKAEL
KARTPLOTTER HOW QUICKLY

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:50.170
THE MOUNTAIN ADAPTS TO
THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:54.930
AND HOW LONG IT CAN
STORE ITS OWN.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.930
BACK AT BONN UNIVERSITY, THEY
SEE IT WORKS.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:29.870
THE BOXES ON THE ZUGSPITZE ARE
TRANSMITTING THE TEMPERATURES

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.400
AT THE ROCK FACE.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.630
NOW, KARTPLOTTER SIMULATES THE
CONDITIONS ON THE ZUGSPITZE IN

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.500
HIS LABORATORY.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.630
HE SETS SCREWS INTO A PIECE OF
ROCK WHICH HE HAS BROUGHT BACK

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:44.600
FROM AN ELEVATION OF 2,900
METERS.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.900
THEY ARE ELECTRODES.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.270
WHICH WILL PASS CURRENT
THROUGH THE ROCK WHEN

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.900
KARTPLOTTER HAS FROZEN IT.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.270
HE'S ESTABLISHING REFERENCE
VALUES FOR HIS DATA FROM

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.730
THE ZUGSPITZE.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.930
WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE THE
MOUNTAIN WHEN THE ICE MELTS

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.800
IN SUMMER?

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.730
HOW DOES IT EXPAND AGAIN IN
WINTER?

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.430
AND WHAT CAN HALT THE THAWING
PROCESS?

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.430
AFTER YEARS OF RESEARCH INTO
EUROPEAN PERMAFROST,

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:22.170
KARTPLOTTER HAS SOME INITIAL
ANSWERS TO THOSE QUESTIONS.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.230
HE'S DRAWN GRAPHS OF THE
ACCUMULATED DATA.

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.500
THEY SHOW HOW THE FROZEN CORE
OF THE ZUGSPITZE HAS CHANGED

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.170
OVER THE YEARS.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:34.430
THE RESULTS WERE SURPRISING.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
>> UNTIL JULY, IT THAWS TO A
DEPTH OF ALMOST 10 METERS.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.070
THEN THE REST OF THE YEAR,
WHEN WE WOULD EXPECT FURTHER

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.370
THAWING, IT HARDLY OCCURS.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:47.130
THAT SURPRISED US.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:49.100
IT CONTRADICTED OUR PREVIOUS
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.700
THAWING PROCESS.

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.930
BUT IT DOES CORRESPOND WITH
THE FACT THAT WHERE THE

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:56.800
NOTORIOUS ROCK FALLS OCCURRED
IN SWITZERLAND IN 2003, WE SEE

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:02.070
HEAVIER ROCK FALLS IN JUNE AND
JULY.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.570
>> Narrator: HERE, IN THE
SIBERIAN ICE, THE DATA FROM THE

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.330
ZUGSPITZE SHOULD BE CONFIRMED.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.670
RUSSIANS JOKE THAT THE WEATHER
AT LAKE EL'GYGYTGYN

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.430
IS EITHER BAD OR VERY BAD.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.800
IT SEEMS THE RUSSIAN-GERMAN
TEAM RAN INTO VERY

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.630
BAD WEATHER.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:25.770
THEY HAD TO TEMPORARILY HALT
THEIR WORK.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.800
THEY SPENT THE NEXT FEW DAYS
WORKING IN THE LABORATORY.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.030
THE WATER SAMPLES WHICH THEY
HAD TAKEN FROM THE LAKE

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.100
IN BRILLIANT SUNSHINE JUST
A FEW DAYS BEFORE, HAD

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.530
TO BE FILTERED.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.800
THEY CONTAINED DIATOM ALGAE,
WHICH THE RESEARCHERS WANTED

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.370
TO COMPARE WITH THE SAME
ALGAE IN THEIR SAMPLES FROM

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.070
THE BOREHOLE.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.930
THAT COULD PROVIDE USEFUL
INFORMATION ABOUT PREVIOUS

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.470
CLIMATE CONDITIONS.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.930
>> WE TAKE THE FILTER WITH
WHAT WE ASSUME ARE DIATOM

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:15.070
ALGAE AND LET IT DRY OUT.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.230
THEN WE'LL TAKE IT HOME TO
ANALYZE IT.

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.870
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT, BUT
THERE ARE 80 LITRES IN THIS

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.330
PACK, SO WE HOPE WE'VE CAUGHT
ENOUGH OF THESE ALGAE FOR OUR

WE CAN'T BE SURE AT THIS
STAGE, BUT WE'RE OPTIMISTIC.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.670
WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING IS
THE WATER QUALITY WHICH WE

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:34.200
ALSO MEASURE.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.500
IT IS ALMOST THAT OF DISTILLED
WATER.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.370
IT'S INCREDIBLY PURE.

SATELLITE PHONE.

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:56.400
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES,
BUT ALL THESE YEARS IT'S

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.470
BEEN DIFFICULT.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.630
THIS LAKE IS AT THE BACK OF
THE BEYOND.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:05.630
THERE WERE AMERICANS WHO SAID
IT WAS LIKE FLYING TO MARS.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.170
IT'S TERRIBLY COMPLICATED TO
WORK HERE.

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.530
AND THE TONS OF EQUIPMENT WE
BROUGHT HERE TO GET HOLD OF

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:18.030
GEOLOGICAL SAMPLES IS
ENORMOUS.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:22.030
IT'S VIRTUALLY COMPARABLE TO A
GREAT SEA EXPEDITION.

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.430
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE NOT IN EUROPE OR IN THE

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:27.530
HIGH-TECH U.S. HERE.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:33.570

GROUND.

>> Narrator: THE SNOW STORM
RAGED FOR 5 DAYS.

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:46.730
DRILLING WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:48.570
IT WAS SOMETHING OF AN
EXPEDITION JUST TO GO TO

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:50.670
THE LAVATORY.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:54.800
OR TO EAT.

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.270
BUT THE WEATHER DIDN'T DAUNT
LUDMILLA.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.570
SHE WAS THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE
CAMP AND COOKED EVERYONE THREE

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:11.670
HOT MEALS A DAY.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.030
THE MEAT, BREAD, RICE, AND
NOODLES, WERE ALL BROUGHT HERE

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.170
BY SNOWCAT SEVERAL WEEKS
BEFORE AND STORED

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:23.000
DEEP FROZEN OUTSIDE.

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.230
THE RESEARCHERS RECEIVED A
DAILY WEATHER FORECAST BY

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.930
SATELLITE PHONE.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:40.670
THAT WAY, THEY KNEW THE STORM
WAS FINALLY SUPPOSED TO CLEAR.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.130
THE FOLLOWING MORNING, IT WAS
-30 DEGREES CELSIUS AND THE

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.930
SUN ONLY SHONE FOR AN HOUR.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:59.070
JUST ENOUGH TIME TO CLEAR THE
HALF METER OF NEW SNOW.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.070
>> IT WAS A REAL BLIZZARD.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.300
YOU COULD HARDLY SEE YOUR HAND
IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.530
BUT AT LEAST THE SUN'S COME
THROUGH NOW.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.870
IT'S STILL WINDY, BUT I THINK
THE WEATHER'S CLEARING UP SO

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:40.970
THAT WE CAN DO A BIT MORE AND GO
OUTSIDE.

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.870
>> Narrator: FINALLY, THE
DRILLING COULD BEGIN.

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:48.670
THE MEN HAD TO WORK IN 3
SHIFTS, 24 HOURS A DAY IN

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.130
ORDER TO REACH A DEPTH OF 100
METERS.

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.170
GEORG SCHONBORN AND HIS
COLLEAGUES HAD NO

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.900
TIME TO LOSE.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.570
THE DRILL WOULD BORE DEEP INTO
THE FROZEN GROUND TO THE

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:03.100
SEDIMENTS THAT INTEREST THE
RESEARCHERS.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:08.630
EVERY 2 METERS, THE DRILL WAS
REMOVED AND EMPTIED.

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:11.930
THE FIRST FEW METERS REQUIRED
THE GREATEST CARE.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:15.870
THE HOLE HAD TO BE EXACTLY
PERPENDICULAR.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.970
IF THE DRILL ENTERED AT AN
ACUTE ANGLE, IT WOULD FALSIFY

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:22.670
THE RESULTS.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.670
>> HE'S EXPLAINED TO ME WHAT
THEY HAVE TO DO.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.600
THEY'LL USE A LARGE DIAMETER
DRILL FOR THE FIRST 2 METERS

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.500
AND THEN INSERT A PIPE TO
PROTECT THAT SECTION.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.530
THEN CONTINUE WITH A SMALLER
DRILL, 11 CENTIMETERS, AND

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:34.930
THEN A BIT MORE.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:37.500
THEY'LL DRILL DEEPER AND THEN
START HAMMERING AND THE CORE

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:41.070
WILL COME OUT.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:48.870
>> Narrator: THE WORK AT THE RIG
WAS ARDUOUS.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:52.230
THE MOTORS WERE NOISY, THERE
WAS A STRONG SMELL OF OIL AND

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.570
HEATING WAS KEPT LOW SO
THAT THE MACHINES COULD

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.370
CONTINUE WORKING.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:00.470
THE CORE HAD TO BE RETRIEVED
FROZEN AND REMAIN FROZEN

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:04.970
OTHERWISE, THE RESULTS WOULD
BE USELESS.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:09.130
THE MACHINE BORED INTO THE
GROUND INEXORABLY.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.230
AT THE INITIAL STAGE, IT WAS
POSSIBLE TO MAKE CORRECTIONS.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:15.130
LATER, ONE PIPE AFTER ANOTHER
WOULD BE INSERTED INTO

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.700
THE GROUND.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.900
THE GERMAN SCIENTISTS WERE
KEENLY AWARE OF THEIR

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.600
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.270
THE EXPEDITION HAD COST ABOUT
A MILLION DOLLARS AND IT WAS A

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.430
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY.

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.530
WHILE THEIR COLLEAGUES IN
EUROPE WERE WORKING ON THE

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:31.370
SYMPTOMS OF GLOBAL WARMING,
THEY HAD THE POSSIBILITY HERE

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.870
OF FINDING DATA THAT COULD
PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR LONG

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.670
TERM FORECASTS.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.570

BEFORE, BUT HUMAN BEINGS WERE

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.670
EITHER NOT PRESENT ON THE
EARTH OR FAR LESS PREPARED

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:47.630
FOR THEM.

CONTAIN PERMAFROST.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.870
IT'S A RARE PHENOMENON AT THIS
LOW ELEVATION.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.800
NORMALLY, WE FIND PERMAFROST
ABOVE ABOUT 2,500 METERS

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.200
IN THE ALPS.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.500
>> Narrator: EVEN IN SUMMER WHEN
THE TEMPERATURE RISES TO 30

TO FIND FROZEN GROUND.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.300
FROST THAT HAS BEEN HERE SINCE
THE LAST ICE AGE.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.100
WITHOUT THE FROZEN CORE, THESE
ROCK HEAPS IN EASTERN GERMANY

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.170
WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.830
THE CORE IS STILL LARGE ENOUGH
TO CONSERVE THIS UNIQUE

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:15.570
LANDSCAPE WITH ITS RARE PLANT
AND ANIMAL LIFE.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:18.570
THESE ROCK HEAPS OCCUR DUE TO
THE WEATHERING OF LARGE BLOCKS

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:20.500
OF STONE.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.130
THEY ONLY SUPPORT MEAGER
VEGETATION...

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.730
EVEN ON THE VERY OLD ROCK
HEAPS.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.700
THAT'S BECAUSE LITTLE SOIL CAN
ACCUMULATE HERE.

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.670
YOU ONLY FIND MOSS AND LICHEN.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.000
>> AT THE MOMENT THE
TEMPERATURE IN BETWEEN THE

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.030
ROCKS IS 20-21 CELSIUS.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.100
THAT'S QUITE NORMAL FOR A
SHADY SPOT ON A DAY LIKE THIS

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.200
IT'S THE SAME TEMPERATURE I
WOULD USUALLY MEASURE AT

TWO METERS.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.670
THAT MEANS, WE HAVE THE SAME
TEMPERATURE HERE, 20

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.400
CENTIMETERS UNDERGROUND
AS WE'D FIND IN THE

TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THE UPPER

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.530

MARTIN GOUDA.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.500

5 DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.700
4.6 IS THE LOWEST I'VE
MEASURED.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.700
OF COURSE, THAT'S UNUSUALLY
LOW.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.530
IT'S CAUSED BY A FROZEN CORE
BEING FORMED WITHIN THE ROCK

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.070
HEAP IN WINTER.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:31.200
AND NOW, IN SUMMER, THE AIR
FLOWS INTO THE ROCK HEAP FROM

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.870
ABOVE AND COLD AIR COMES OUT
HERE AFTER IT HAS BEEN

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:39.130
DRASTICALLY COOLED BY THE
FROZEN CORE.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.630
SO THIS IS GENUINE PERMAFROST.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.370
WITHOUT THIS COOLING PROCESS
OVER THE ICE, THE LOW

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.500

EL'GYGYTGYN FOR SIX WEEKS.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.070
TOWARDS THE END OF THEIR STAY,
IT WAS -30 DEGREES CELSIUS AND

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:18.070
THE LAKE WAS FROZEN SOLID.

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:22.100

IT TOOK 3 DAYS.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.200
THE BOREHOLE WAS NOW 100
METERS DEEP.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.370
THE MECHANISM KEPT JAMMING.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.670
THE RUSSIAN DRILLING TEAM
CALLED THIS "FINE TUNING."

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:44.870
THEY USED THEIR HEAVIEST
HAMMER.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.470
IT TOOK SIX HOURS OF DRILLING
TO EXTRACT ONE OF THE CORES

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.200
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR.

00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.030
AND ANOTHER SIX HOURS FOR THE
NEXT ONE.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.370
THAT WAS THE RHYTHM.

FROZEN DUST, ROCK, AND DEBRIS,
EACH OF THESE FRAGMENTS

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:19.630
CONTAINS SEVERAL CENTURIES OF
THE EARTH'S HISTORY.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:24.930
AND THEY HAVE TO BE KEPT IN
THE RIGHT ORDER.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.530
AS SOON AS A CORE WAS BROUGHT
TO THE SURFACE, IT WAS

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.630
IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE LAB
WHICH WAS THE ONLY CONTAINER

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:37.700
IN THE CAMP WITHOUT INSULATION

THE DRILLING DEPTH, THE
COLOR, AND THE ICE CONTENT

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.400
WERE RECORDED.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.570
THE RESEARCHERS ALSO NOTED THE
SURFACE TEXTURE AND THE

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.630
BRITTLENESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
STONES.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:59.730

DRILLING PROCESS.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.730

THERE ARE LARGE POCKETS OF

ICE BETWEEN THE
GRAINS OF GRAVEL.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.470

IT FROZE.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.000

MOVED RAPIDLY, EITHER BY WATER
OR SIMPLY BY THE SLOPE.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.800
THEN, WHEN IT CAME TO REST,
IT MUST'VE ABSORBED WATER

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.970
AND FROZEN.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.430

IT WAS DECEMBER, AND THE
SUN NO LONGER RISES ABOVE

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:05.670
THE MOUNTAINS.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:12.270
THE NIGHT SHIFT ON THEIR WAY
TO WORK.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:14.570
THEY DROVE THE 3 KILOMETERS
BETWEEN THE CAMP AND THE

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.670
BOREHOLE IN A TRACK VEHICLE.

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.670
IT WAS QUICKER AND SAFER.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.900
THE SNOW WAS DEEP AND ANOTHER
SNOW STORM COULD'VE BROKEN AT

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.500
ANY TIME.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.530
ON FOOT, THEY COULD'VE EASILY
LOST THEIR SENSE OF DIRECTION.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:31.230
THE TEMPERATURE HAD DROPPED TO
-30 DEGREES CELSIUS.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.900
IN COLD LIKE THIS, THE HUMAN
BODY SHUTS DOWN.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:39.270
BLOOD VESSELS IN THE SKIN AND
IN THE EXTREMITIES CONTRACT.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.630
WARM BLOOD ONLY CIRCULATES IN
THE THORAX AND ABDOMEN TO

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:44.930
MAINTAIN THE TEMPERATURE
OF THE VITAL ORGANS AND

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.830
THE BRAIN.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.530
THE SEDIMENTS THE DRILL WAS
NOW BRINGING TO THE SURFACE

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.370
WERE MANY HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OLD.

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:01.370
SECTIONS WITH A LOT OF ICE
ALTERNATING WITH OTHERS

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.670
CONTAINING LITTLE ICE SHOWS
THERE WERE PERIODS IN WHICH

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:09.470
THE PERMAFROST DISAPPEARED,
ONLY TO RETURN.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:11.770
THE PRECISE RHYTHM WILL
PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.900
SPEED OF THESE PROCESSES
AND WHAT WE CAN EXPECT IN

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.230
THE FUTURE.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.830
>> IT'S A TREASURE TROVE OF
INFORMATION.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.730
I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S UNIQUE WHO
KNOWS WHAT WILL BE DISCOVERED

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.770
IN FUTURE, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY
A HIGHLIGHT WHICH WILL PROVIDE

00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:33.900
SCIENTISTS WITH RESEARCH
MATERIAL FOR YEARS.

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.730
SIMPLY BRINGING THIS STUFF
TO THE SURFACE IS A

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:38.030
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:41.100
BEING PART OF THE EXPEDITION
WITH ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.700
IT'S SPECIAL.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:48.830
THE MATERIAL WILL BE EXAMINED
IN LABORATORIES WORLDWIDE.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:51.030
IF WE HAVE A LOT OF LAKE
SEDIMENTS, THEY'LL BE OF

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.030
INTEREST TO MORE SCIENTISTS
THAN IF WE JUST HAD

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:54.500
ROCK SAMPLES.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:56.330
AND THAT'S LIKELY THE CASE.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.970
IT COULD BE 50 SCIENTISTS
WORLDWIDE COMPETING FOR THESE

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:05.530
SAMPLES, BUT FIRST, WE HAVE TO
GET THEM BACK.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:09.530
>> Narrator: BACK MEANS TO COLD
STORAGE IN BREMERHAVEN.

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:13.570
SEVERAL THOUSAND KILOMETERS
WITHOUT MELTING.

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.670
THESE BOXES WITH ALMOST 3 TONS
OF SAMPLES WILL TAKE 3 MONTHS

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:22.400
TO ARRIVE IN GERMANY.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:30.630
AS THE LAST OF THE VALUABLE
CORES ARE STILL BEING PACKED,

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:34.970
THE HELICOPTER ARRIVED.

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:42.430
AT THE END OF THEIR SIX WEEK
EXPEDITION, THE SCIENTISTS

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:46.600
COULD FINALLY RETURN HOME TO
ANALYZE THEIR SAMPLES AND

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.870
PRECISELY RECONSTRUCT THE
HISTORY OF THE LAKE.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:52.830
THAT SHOULD SHOW THEM HOW
RISING TEMPERATURES EFFECT

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.670
THE EARTH.

00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:16.470
?

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.700
>> Narrator: BUT ONE LAST TASK
REMAINED.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.700
THEY LOWERED A CHAIN WITH
THERMOMETERS INTO THE

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.030
BOREHOLE.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:26.400
THAT WOULD REGISTER HOW MUCH
THE FROST THAWS IN SUMMER

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.930
AND HOW QUICKLY IT
RETURNS IN WINTER.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:35.170
THE WARNING SIGNALS ARE TO BE
SENT TO EUROPE.

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:39.630
>> IF WHAT WE PREDICT COMES
TRUE, IF THE WARMING OCCURS

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:42.670
MAINLY IN THE NORTH, THAT
MEANS THE PERMAFROST WILL

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:46.870
MELT MORE DEEPLY ON THE
SURFACE THAN IT USED TO.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:51.900
THAT WILL AFFECT ROADS,
BUILDINGS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:54.570
A WORLDWIDE NETWORK, BUT
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.870
HEMISPHERE, IS OBSERVING
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:59.170
VARIOUS REGIONS.

00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.930
AND WE NOW HAVE ANOTHER POINT
THAT WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.230
THAT WORLDWIDE NETWORK.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.130
IT WILL BE MONITORED
CONSTANTLY TO SEE WHAT'S

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:14.100
HAPPENING IN THE CHUKOTKA
REGION IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.930
>> Narrator: WITH MIXED
FEELINGS, THE GEOLOGISTS

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:24.600
FINALLY BODE FAREWELL TO
THIS INHOSPITABLE AREA OF

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.930
NORTH EASTERN RUSSIA.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.970
THE SCIENTISTS FROM THE ALFRED
WEGENER INSTITUTE SEARCHING

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.870
FOR THE SECRETS OF LAKE
EL'GYGYTGYN WILL CERTAINLY NOT

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.170
BE THE LAST TO COME HERE.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:41.830
THE LAKE IS A KEY TO
UNDERSTANDING CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.070
IN THE END, WE WERE ABLE TO
KEEP TO OUR SCHEDULE, BUT IT

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:45.530
WASN'T EASY.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.170
TRANSPORT HERE IS NOT LIKE IN
CENTRAL EUROPE.

00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:50.970
BUT WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO
EXTRACT WHAT WE WANTED AND WE

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:52.300
ACHIEVED OUR GOAL.

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:53.400
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.330
A GOOD BEGINNING AND FOR
ALL THOSE WHO FOLLOW US,

00:49:56.330 --> 00:50:00.730
AN ENCOURAGEMENT.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:23.100
?

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.900
>> Narrator: THE CONTAINER CAMP
REMAINS IN STANDING FOR THE

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.600
USE OF FUTURE EXPEDITIONS TO
THIS UNIQUE LAKE.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.870
THESE SCIENTISTS GLIMPSE INTO
THE EARTH'S MEMORY COULD HELP

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:39.700
SECURE ITS FUTURE.

00:50:41.630 --> 00:51:07.400
