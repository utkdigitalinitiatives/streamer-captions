00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.700
I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU SOONER.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.960
YOU CAN'T LOVE SOMEBODY
JUST LIKE THAT.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.060
I'VE KNOWN YOU
ALL MY LIFE.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.000
I'VE MISSED HER
ALL MY LIFE.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.200
IS HE ON DRUGS? HE'S
TALKING SCRIBBLE.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.130
I LOVE HER.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.230
ANYBODY CAN
SAY THAT.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.160
BUT YOU NEVER DID.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.960
THAT'S NOT TRUE. I WAS
ALWAYS TELLING YOU.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:18.030
I USED TO SAY "I LOVE YOU" AND
YOU USED TO SAY "ME TOO".

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.700
HERMIA, I JUST WANTED TO
DO SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL,

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.230
JUST FOR YOU AND
JAMES, THAT'S ALL.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.130
WHY DO YOU WANT TO RUIN
EVERYTHING LIKE THIS?

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.800
I JUST WANT YOU TO
BE HAPPY FOR ME.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER AND
YOU'RE ABOUT TO MAKE THE

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.300
BIGGEST MISTAKE OF YOUR
LIFE. HOW CAN I BE HAPPY?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.560
PLEASE, DAD, I WOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU SOONER,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.300
BUT I COULDN'T BEAR THE
THOUGHT OF HURTING YOU.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.000
DO YOU WANT TO
KILL ME INSTEAD?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.160
IF I DON'T MARRY
JAMES YOU'LL DIE?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.930
IF YOU BREAK MY HEART I
MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD!

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.930
JUST LET THEM GO,
THEO. LET THEM GO.

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.630
YOU CAN'T BULLY HER
INTO LOVING JAMES.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.930
NOBODY LEAVES, NOBODY
GOES ANYWHERE.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.830
THERE WILL BE AN
ENGAGEMENT PARTY TOMORROW

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.260
AND WE WILL BE TOASTING
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.360
THEO, YOU HEARD HER.
THEY'VE SPLIT UP.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.000
JAMES DEMETRIUS AND HERMIA
MOON WILL BE GETTING ENGAGED

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.860
TOMORROW AT NOON,
SO IN THE MEANTIME

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.360
PLEASE ENJOY THE HOLIDAY
EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.860
DON'T.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.200
ONE MINUTE YOU'RE...

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.730
OR YOU THINK YOU'RE...

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.600
AND THEN THE NEXT IT'S NOT
BEEN UNDERSTOOD THE...

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.160
SHE IS THE ONE
THING I WANT.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.400
SHE IS IT.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.260
BUT SHE'S JUST...

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:23.630
SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO
SAY, IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.200
SNUG, BETWEEN COURSES YOU GIVE
THEM CARD TRICKS AND CONJURING

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.960
APPROPRIATE TO THE
GENTEEL SURROUNDINGS.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.130
DAVEY BLAINE SAYS THE
WAY TO DO REAL MAGIC

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.560
IS TO MAKE YOUR MIND
GO COMPLETELY BLANK.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.730
IT'S AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY
SO I'LL OPEN PROCEEDINGS

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.560
WITH THE THEME FROM
<i> THE DEERHUNTER,</i>

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.630
CONGRATULATIONS
TO THE CELEBRANTS,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.360
AND THEN
THE HIGHLIGHT.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.860
I'LL STORM IT.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.060
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE JUGGLING.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.700
I'VE MASTERED THE DIABLOS
AND THE THREE-CLUB CHASE.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.830
WELL, UNICYCLES ARE STRICTLY
PERSONA NON GRATA, UNDERSTOOD?

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.730
NOW, BOTTOM, YOU COME ON AFTER
THEY'VE HAD A FEW DRINKS.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:59.630
JUST THE CLEVER GAGS, NO
SMUT. IT'S A FAMILY CROWD

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.030
THEN FLUTE HERE
ROUNDS IT ALL OFF

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.860
ACCOMPANIED BY YOURS TRULY
ON MY BRAND NEW LES PAUL.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.830
YOU'VE COME INTO
MONEY, HAVE YOU?

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.330
WELL, I THOUGHT I'D
MAKE THE EXTRA EFFORT.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.630
I'LL SEE YOU
AT REHEARSALS.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.830
GET THERE ON TIME.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.100
I'M ON THE GRAVEYARD
SHIFT TONIGHT.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.100
EXCUSE ME, DO YOU WANT
TO GET OFF THOSE RAILINGS.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.900
THIS RUNNING ORDER,
THERE WEREN'T ROOM

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.700
FOR MY IMPRESSIONS,
WERE THERE?

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.300
I'VE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO
PUT TOGETHER AN EVENING

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.000
OF CONTEMPORARY
ENTERTAINMENT.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.430
CONTEMPORARY? I DO A DAVID
BRENT THAT HAS PEOPLE ROARING.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.600
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, YOUR
IMPRESSIONS DO NOT ALWAYS

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.530
MEASURE UP TO DREAM
PARK'S EXACTING STANDARDS.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.800
I'LL SEE YOU
AT REHEARSALS.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.860
WHEN YOU SEE MY LITTLE BRITAIN
YOU'LL BE BEGGING FOR MORE.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.660
THE THING THAT QUINCE
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.960
WHEN I PLAYED THE ALHAMBRA
IN BRUMFORD I STORMED IT.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.530
I TELL YOU, THEY WENT TO
SEE BERNIE AND SCHNORBITZ

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.830
BUT THEY CAME AWAY
TALKING ABOUT ME.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.230
YOU WERE BERNIE
AND SCHNORBITZ?

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.700
NOT THERE!

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.000
MUST MAKE A MOVE,
I SUPPOSE.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.800
HERMIA, I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD HANG AROUND.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.860
DID YOU BRING
AN EXTRA TOWEL?

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:24.400
HEY, COME ON.
IT'S OVER NOW.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.930
IT'S BEHIND YOU. YOU GOT
THROUGH THE HARDEST BIT.

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.200
YOU'D BETTER BE
WORTH IT, BUSTER.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.630
GOD, YOU ARE SO, SO...

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:48.260
IF YOU KNEW HOW
MUCH I WANTED YOU...

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.060
(COUGH)

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.900
REMEMBER ME?

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.930
LOYAL FRIEND,
VOICE OF REASON?

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.460
HI HELEN.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.560
HELEN<i> A.</i>

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.800
HOW WELL DO YOU
EVEN KNOW HIM?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.900
HOW COME YOU NEVER
MENTIONED HIM TO ME BEFORE?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.100
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D
STICK UP FOR JAMES.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.900
I KNOW HOW FOND
YOU ARE OF HIM.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.530
UNLIKE YOU BY THE
LOOKS OF THINGS.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.300
I'M NOT DOING THIS TO
HURT JAMES, I'M DOING IT

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.030
BECAUSE I FOUND A PERSON
I REALLY, REALLY LOVE.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:28.760
HERMIA, COME ON.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.000
YOU THINK I'M MAKING A MISTAKE
WITH ZANDER, DON'T YOU?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.900
NO. I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.230
WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU
LOVE AS MUCH AS I LOVE HIM

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.800
THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.360
AT LEAST GO AND TALK TO
YOUR DAD BEFORE YOU GO.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.030
NO, YOU HEARD HIM.
I'VE BROKEN HIS HEART.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.560
IN OTHER WORDS
YOU CAN'T FACE HIM.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.100
HE THOUGHT JAMES
AND I WERE PERFECT.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.230
HE THINKS WE
<i> A</i>RE PERFECT.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:57.500
BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GONE
THROUGH WITH THE ENGAGEMENT,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.760
WOULD YOU?

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.860
WE HAVE TO GO.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.000
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
GO AT THIS TIME?

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.060
ZANDER'S FOUND
AN EMPTY VILLA.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.030
HE'S GOING
TO BREAK IN.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.630
OH, VERY MATURE.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.830
I LOVE HER.

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.500
SO YOU KEEP SAYING.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.230
JUST BE HAPPY
FOR US, HELENA.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.930
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.960
YOU'LL DO SOMETHING
YOU'LL REGRET.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.160
THE GIRL CLEARLY
NEEDS TIME.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.730
TIME TO RUN OFF WHO KNOWS
WHERE WITH A BIG ISSUE SELLER.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:32.930
HE'S NOT A TRAMP, HE'S
JUST UNEMPLOYED.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.700
YOU SAY THAT LIKE I
SHOULD BE REASSURED.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.530
SHE DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW HIM.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:38.430
SHE'S CHANGED HER MIND.
CHARGING AFTER HER

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.930
LIKE A RAGING BULL IS NOT
GOING TO CHANGE IT BACK.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.460
WHO IS THIS
ZANDER BLOKE?

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.530
IT'S AS IF HE'S
BRAINWASHED HER.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:49.330
MAYBE SHE JUST FEELS
CONFUSED. PRESSURED.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.360
MAYBE THE MAN SHE
THOUGHT SHE LOVED

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.800
DOESN'T MAKE HER
HEART SING ANYMORE.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.600
IT DOES HAPPEN.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.100
LAST TIME I LOOKED THE HEART
WAS AN INTERNAL ORGAN.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.400
THE CHANCES OF IT SINGING
SEEM REMOTE AT BEST.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.260
SO IF YOU'RE FINISHED MOUTHING
OFF THIS NEW-AGE DRIVEL

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.060
PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS
YOURSELF TO THE ISSUES IN HAND.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.800
SHE DIDN'T FEEL SHE COULD
COME TO US AND TALK ABOUT IT.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.930
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT WE
SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT?

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.530
I SUPPOSE.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:28.630
SHE'S A HEADSTRONG GIRL,
THAT'S FOR CERTAIN.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:36.230
AND WE BOTH KNOW WHERE
SHE GETS THAT FROM.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.860
HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.060
IT'S FALLING APART.
THEO AND POLLY NEED US!

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.030
AND I'M SURE THAT YOU AND
THAT RUFFIAN, PUCK, ARE COPING.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.060
HE SEEMS VERY EAGER
TO IMPRESS YOU.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.700
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.700
I'LL BE VERY ACTIVE JUST AS
SOON AS I HEAR YOUR APOLOGY.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.830
APOLOGY? I
AM THE KING.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.400
SO START ACTING
LIKE ONE.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.800
I AM, AND I COMMAND YOU
TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.930
AND HELP ME SAVE
POLLY AND THEO.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.230
YOU DON'T COMMAND ME.
NOBODY COMMANDS ME.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.360
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THAT THE KING CAN

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.260
AND THAT HAPPENS
TO BE ME.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.060
SO I COMMAND YOU TO
GET YOUR FINGER OUT.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.960
AND WHY
SHOULD I OBEY?

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.930
IT IS TRADITION.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.300
OH, YES, TRADITION.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.600
THE PLACE WE LIKE TO HIDE WHEN
WE HAVE LOST THE ARGUMENT.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.260
ILL MET BY
MOONLIGHT, TITANIA.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.160
I AM KING OF
THE FAIRIES.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.160
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.860
ANYBODY CAN SEE THAT.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.130
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:47.430
YOUR REGAL BEARING, YOUR
AUTHORITY, YOUR ELOQUENCE.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.960
WELL, IT'S IN THE
BLOOD, THAT'S TRUE.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.230
YOU DON'T NEED SERVANTS OR STAFF
TO TELL THE WORLD YOU'RE A KING.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:20:00.230
YOU JUST NEED TO
MAKE AN ENTRANCE

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.660
AND EVERYONE FEELS
INCLINED TO BOW.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.700
AGREED?

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.600
AGREED.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.330
YOU DON'T
NEED ANYONE.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.700
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.900
SO YOU DON'T
NEED ME.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.500
I WOULD STOP THIS IF
I WERE YOU, TITANIA.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.030
OR I WILL MAKE
YOU REGRET IT.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.930
I'M GETTING BORED.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.360
SO WHAT WE GONNA
DO NOW? CANCEL?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.260
NO. NO, IT'LL BE FINE.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.100
YOU'RE JOKING,
AREN'T YA?

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.700
EVERY TIME YOU TWO MEET
YOU FRIGHTEN THE PIXIES.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.730
HOW CAN YOU
HELP ANYONE?

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.900
YOU JUST KEEP AN EYE
ON THE MORTALS.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.430
I'M GONNA FIND A WAY TO
TEACH MY QUEEN A LESSON.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.430
MY ADVICE TO THESE TWO IS
MOVE AWAY FROM THE FOREST.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.000
MAKE A CLEAN START,
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.100
ABOUT THIS PLACE THAT
DOES YOUR HEAD IN.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:04.700
IT'S LIKE ALL THIS NATURE
IS... IT'S UNNATURAL, ISN'T IT?

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.100
DOUBLE WHISKEY.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.900
THERE YOU GO, SIR.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.760
POUR IT LIKE
YOU MEAN IT.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.860
DO I...? I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE, DON'T I?

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.230
STOCKPORT REGISTRY
OFFICE, 1979.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.230
I WAS AT YOUR WEDDING.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:41.930
REALLY?

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.960
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.160
ARE YOU A FRIEND
OF POLLY'S FAMILY?

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.630
NOT A GUEST IN THE
TRADITIONAL SENSE.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.830
BUT REMEMBER YOU
WERE HAVING ONE OR TWO

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.400
LAST MINUTE DOUBTS SO I
TALKED TO YOU ABOUT LOVE.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.530
RIGHT, YEAH. WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.960
YOU DON'T KNOW? HASN'T
PUCK BEEN TO SEE YOU?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.800
OH, THE WEIRD,
SCRUFFY-LOOKING GUY.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.100
PRACTICAL JOKER
FELLOW, YEAH.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.430
I THOUGHT I WAS
SEEING THINGS AGAIN.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.100
NO, HE'S AS
REAL AS I AM.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.360
THAT'S WHAT
I'M DRIVING AT.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.760
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE REAL.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.660
NO DISRESPECT BUT I WAS PRETTY
OFF MY HEAD AT THE WEDDING.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:27.830
YEAH, WELL, WE WERE REALLY
THERE, BLESSING YOUR NUPTIALS.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.730
AND WE BROUGHT
YOU HERE, TOO.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.300
YOU SEE, IT'S AN
OBLIGATION, THEO.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.560
A DUTY TO SPREAD PEACE
AND LOVE AND HAPPINESS.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.830
SO IT'S COME TO THIS,
THAT THE ONLY MAN

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.830
WHO'LL DRINK WITH ME
IS A HALLUCINATION?

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.560
I AM NOT AN
HALLUCINATION.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.960
OKAY, OKAY, YOU'RE MY
FAIRY GODMOTHER.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.100
YOU KNOW, I COULD REALLY
MESS WITH YOUR HEAD.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.800
SO LESS OF THE
GODMOTHER, ALRIGHT?

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.760
BUT YOU'RE A
FAIRY, RIGHT?

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.830
OOH, I'M KING OF
THE FAIRIES, THEO.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.700
OKAY, SO WHERE ARE
ALL THE OTHER FAIRIES?

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.530
YOU SHOULD ASK MY LOVELY
QUEEN ABOUT THAT.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:11.900
DON'T TELL ME THE
KING OF THE FAIRIES

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.260
HAS MARITAL
DIFFICULTIES.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.160
WHY DO YOU THINK THE WEATHER'S
SO WEIRD NOWADAYS?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.130
YOU THINK IT'S
GLOBAL WARMING?

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.460
NO CHANCE. IT'S
ME AND TITANIA.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.900
YEAH?

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.060
YEAH, NATURE'S GOT A
WAY OF BITING BACK,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:28.300
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.630
NO, I DON'T REALLY.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:36.530
NATURE HAS A WAY OF... SHE HAS
A WAY OF TEACHING US LESSONS.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.830
'COURSE SHE HAS.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.830
I'VE GOT IT.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.600
I KNOW HOW TO
SORT OUT TITANIA.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:55.400
SOMETHING TELLS ME
IT'S NOT COUNSELING.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.100
I NEED YOU TO GET
ME SOME LOVE JUICE.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.500
OH, TOP PLAN. HOW
MUCH ARE WE TALKING?

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.930
THAT WAY WHATEVER TITANIA
LOOKS AT WHEN SHE WAKES UP

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.960
SHE'LL BE IN LOVE WITH.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.830
AND THAT'S YOU, RIGHT?

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.300
REMEMBER THAT STUFF I USED THE
NIGHT I HEARD THE MERMAIDS SING?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.060
THOSE MERMAIDS! OH MAN, WE
HAD THE WOBBLE ON THAT NIGHT.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.700
OH, WEE MAID IN
MEDITATION, FANCY-FREE,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.860
YET MARKED WHERE THE
BOLT OF CUPID FELL.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.800
I ASSURE YOU FROM LOVE
JUICE, NO DANGER.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.060
IT FELL UPON A LITTLE
WESTERN FLOWER -

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.330
BEFORE MILK-WHITE, NOW
PURPLE WITH LOVE'S WOUNDS.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.600
AND MAIDENS CALLED IT
"LOVE IN IDLENESS".

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.360
DO YOU WANT THE BLEEDIN'
LOVE JUICE OR WHAT?

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.960
JAMES, PLEASE.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.060
WHY DON'T YOU STAY AND TRY
TO MAKE A WEEKEND OF IT?

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.760
MY FIANCEE JUST WALKED
OUT ON ME. DO YOU THINK

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.700
I CAN GET OVER IT WITH A SWIM
AND A GAME OF PING PONG?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.760
I'M NOT SUGGESTING
YOU'D GET OVER IT,

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.060
JUST THAT I'D
LIKE YOU TO STAY.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.160
WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT
TO SPEND THE WEEKEND

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.030
WITH DULL,
DUMPED JAMES?

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.860
YOU'RE NOT DULL.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.360
WHO'S SHE GONNA
CHOOSE - PLAIN JAMES

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.100
OR THE GLAMOROUS SMOOTHIE
WHO CAN DO THE LOVE TALK?

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.630
HEY, WORDS AREN'T
EVERYTHING.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.460
YES, THEY ARE.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.730
AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID THEM
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.630
WHAT SORT
OF THINGS?

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.830
THAT I NEED HER AND I
CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT HER.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.130
THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN NICE.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.560
WHAT'S THE POINT? I CAN'T
TURN THE CLOCK BACK.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.660
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.160
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT.
IT'S VERY MUCH OVER.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.800
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT I
MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND HER

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.260
AND THAT YOU COULD
SAY THOSE THINGS?

00:25:51.260 --> 00:26:06.030
♪

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:10.500
IT'S NOT MUCH FURTHER.
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.730
YEAH.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:22.760
♪

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:37.600
♪

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.700
COULDN'T FIND
THEM ANYWHERE.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.030
COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED.

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.260
NICE TO SEE YOU TOOK MY
WORDS OF WISDOM TO HEART.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.430
HAVE YOU JUST BEEN SITTING
HERE ALL THIS TIME?

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.230
SHE COULD BE MILES
AWAY BY NOW.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.430
IF SHE'S GOT ANY
SENSE SHE WILL BE.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.530
SHE CAN PAY THE FULL
BALANCE ON HER VILLA.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.560
THAT WAY SHE MIGHT LEARN
THAT BEING A GROWNUP

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.200
DOESN'T COME CHEAP.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.760
THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THINGS THAN MONEY.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.600
WELL, LET'S SEE HOW EASY
IT IS FOR YOU TO SET UP

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.600
YOUR FLOATATION STUDIO
WITHOUT JAMES' HELP.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.230
I CAN'T MAKE HERMIA GET MARRIED
TO A MAN SHE DOESN'T LOVE

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.160
JUST SO I CAN HAVE A
SYMPATHETIC INVESTOR.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.430
I'LL JUST HAVE TO
FIND ANOTHER WAY.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.430
JUST HAVE TO FIND
ANOTHER WAY.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.300
BUILD IT AND
THEY WILL COME.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.860
IT'S A GOOD JOB
ONE OF US CAN

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.560
DEAL WITH LIFE'S
HARSH REALITIES.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.360
AND THAT'S
YOU, IS IT?

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.200
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.230
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO
LET THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.760
AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO
SHOUT AND GET NOWHERE.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.030
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO GO AFTER HER.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:47.530
HOW DOES SHE KNOW WE CARE
IF WE DON'T GO AFTER HER?

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.300
THEY'RE PROBABLY
HIDING IN A VILLA

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.030
AND LAUGHING
AT ME RIGHT NOW.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.430
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
NOBODY'S LAUGHING AT YOU.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:54.760
OH, AREN'T THEY?

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.560
YOU MIGHT NOT SAY MUCH BUT I'LL
BET YOU'RE A VERY DEEP THINKER.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.260
THAT'S RIGHT. I'VE OFTEN WORKED
OUT THE END OF<i> TOUCH OF FROST</i>

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.630
LONG BEFORE DEL-BOY.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.060
AND YOU CAN
BE FUNNY.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.130
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEMS
TO SHARE MY SENSE OF HUMOR.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:15.300
WELL, SOMETIMES I THINK PEOPLE
FIND YOU A BIT HARD TO APPROACH.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.530
YOU JUST NEED
TO RELAX A BIT.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.630
I CAN'T.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.060
YOU'RE RELAXED
WITH ME.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.130
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT.
YOU MAKE IT EASY.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.560
YOU'RE A LOT OF FUN
TO BE AROUND, JAMES.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.400
DON'T LET ANYBODY
TELL YOU DIFFERENT.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.530
WHY CAN'T HERMIA
SEE ANY OF THIS?

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.560
PERHAPS SHE JUST DOESN'T
KNOW WHERE TO LOOK.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.930
IF DAD COULD SEE
ME NOW, HE'D...

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.960
HE'D WHAT?

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.760
HIS BARK'S WORSE
THAN HIS BITE, RIGHT?

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.100
I DON'T KNOW.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:56.200
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
THIS ANGRY BEFORE.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.300
HE WOULDN'T REALLY COME
AFTER US, WOULD HE?

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.330
I WOULDN'T PUT
IT PAST HIM.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.960
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.300
WHAT?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.130
THERE WAS A SOUND OUTSIDE
LIKE A TWIG BREAKING.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.960
MAYBE IT WAS A
TWIG BREAKING.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.030
CAN WE ALWAYS
REMEMBER THIS?

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:25.430
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE OUR
SKY, OUR NIGHT, OUR STARS.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.830
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.060
OF COURSE.

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.300
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HERMIA
AND ZANDER BEFORE TONIGHT?

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.730
NO, I PROMISE I DIDN'T.
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:52.800
I'D HAVE TOLD YOU
STRAIGHT AWAY.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.460
WOULD YOU?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.830
OF COURSE. I'D NEVER
WANT TO SEE YOU HURT.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:01.300
I CARE ABOUT YOU.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:05.200
OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.
AND I CARE ABOUT YOU.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.530
(LOUD CRACK)

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.330
OH NO! ARE
YOU OKAY?

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.600
YEAH, I THINK SO.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.130
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:15.330
I'M FINE.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.500
THERE'S NOTHING
BROKEN, I DON'T THINK.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.530
I'M JUST CLUMSY.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.900
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.560
I DON'T KNOW.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.100
MAYBE WE JUST
GOT CARRIED AWAY.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.860
YEAH, THAT
MUST BE IT.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.260
CROSSED WIRES, MIXED
SIGNALS. I'M SORRY,

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.530
I'M SORRY.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:52.860
YOU DIDN'T TRIP ON
PURPOSE, DID YOU?

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.030
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.500
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GET
BACK WITH HER, DO YOU?

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.600
I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.830
I'LL BET YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.860
YOU TRICKED ME SO THAT YOU
COULD THROW YOURSELF AT ME.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.700
NO, THAT ISN'T TRUE.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.860
I'M HERE BECAUSE I COULDN'T
STAND TO SEE YOU SO HURT.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:14.960
LET'S FORGET WHAT HAPPENED
AND TRY TO FIND HERMIA.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.860
I'M NOT FALLING FOR
THAT TRICK AGAIN.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.430
DON'T YOU COME
ANYWHERE NEAR ME.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.130
I FEEL SICK JUST
TO LOOK AT YOU.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.500
HAS THIS MAN GOT
THE LOVE JUICE

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.800
OR HAS THIS MAN
GOT THE LOVE JUICE?

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.700
TAKE SOME OF THIS.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.100
THIS YOUNG WOMAN HERE IS
IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG WET

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.300
WHO DOESN'T
WANT TO KNOW.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.460
ODDS AND EVENS -
BEEN THERE MYSELF.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.130
FAIRIES ALL OVER ME.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:53.830
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"GIRLS, ONE AT A TIME".

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.530
DRIP SOME OF THIS IN
THE YOUNG MAN'S EYES.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:59.900
LET'S MAKE LOVE
OUR MISSION, EH?

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:03.900
PUCK, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.200
YOUNG WET,
LOVE JUICE, EYES.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.960
THREE STEPS
TO HEAVEN.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.800
WET BLOKE ALERT.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.660
CLOTHES DRYING, HIM STILL A BIT
DAMP AROUND THE EDGES, RESULTS.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.560
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE HE AIN'T, SIR.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.530
BUT THEN HE
IS A BLOKE.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.160
SHE IS NEEDY. AND A
JUMP'S A JUMP, I SUPPOSE.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:56.260
WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU WAKE,
YOU WILL FEEL TRUE LOVE TAKE.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.160
SPLISH, SPLASH, SPLUSH.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.430
OOPS. GET OUTTA THAT.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:40.530
JAMES, I FOUND THEM.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.630
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T
TRICKING YOU, JAMES.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.360
HEY, COME ON,
BABE. DON'T CRY.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.130
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.430
CRY ABOUT JAMES?

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:54.300
I LOVE HIM.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.660
NO, YOU JUST THINK
YOU LOVE HIM.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.900
WHAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE?

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.800
THIS.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.260
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JUST GET OFF!

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE I
DIDN'T SEE IT BEFORE.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.600
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T
BE TRUSTED.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.330
HOW CAN I LOOK AT
HERMIA WHEN I COULD BE

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.300
LOOKING AT YOU,
LOVING YOU?

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.500
WHY SHOULD I SETTLE
FOR SECOND BEST?

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.830
YOU HAVE GOT SOME SERIOUS
COMMITMENT ISSUES.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.860
GET SOME HELP.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.060
BUT THIS IS OUR SKY.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:22.460
THIS IS OUR NIGHT.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.060
THESE ARE OUR STARS!

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.160
YOU NEED A
LESSON, MY QUEEN.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.160
YOU THINK YOU'VE
GOT POWER OVER ME.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:50.000
BUT I'M GONNA
SHOW YOU POWER.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.560
YOU THINK I'M
TOO PROUD?

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.130
I WILL SHOW
YOU PRIDE.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.330
WHEN YOU WAKE UP YOU
WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.860
THE FIRST
THING YOU SEE.

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:18.230
I WILL MAKE YOU
FEEL SO SMALL

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:23.460
THAT YOU WON'T EVER
DARE TO CROSS ME AGAIN.

BEAUTIFUL TO MY EYES ♪

MAKE SURE YOU TIGHTEN
UP ON THE "NIGHT".

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.730
A MAN WALKS INTO A
PUB WITH A ROLL OF

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.760
GREEN TARMAC ON HIS HEAD
AND THE BARMAN SAYS

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.960
"DON'T TALK TO HIM.
HE'S A CYCLE PATH".

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.600
I DON'T GET IT.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.230
WHAT ABOUT THE
CLEVER STUFF?

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.130
THIS IS THE
CLEVER STUFF!

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:20.800
IN WYTHANSHAWE
MAYBE.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.560
WAS THIS YOUR CARD?

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.730
NO.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.530
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SAY "YES".

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.030
IT WASN'T MY CARD.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.060
YOU COULD BE A BIT
MORE ENCOURAGING.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.030
AW, BUT YOU GOT THE
PATTER JUST RIGHT.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.060
EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT
COULD I POSSIBLY

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.930
RELIEVE YOU
OF YOUR WATCH?

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.160
THAT'S THREE.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.530
COUNT THEM, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN!

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.430
THAT IS MORE LIKE IT.
NOW WE'RE TALKING A

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.800
TOP-NOTCH ENTERTAINMENT
PACKAGE AS BEFITTING

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.430
THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION
OF THE DISCERNING FAMILY.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.560
NOW WE'RE TALKING
MANAGEMENT CALLING

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.360
AND SAYING "WHY DON'T THE
RUDE MECHANICALS PERFORM

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.360
THE ENTERTAINMENT
ON A REGULAR BASIS"?

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.160
IT'LL BE A
MAD COMEBACK!

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.030
MY AGENT WILL BE
KICKING HIMSELF!

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:06.400
HA HA HA!

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.030
I SAID NO
IMPRESSIONS.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.760
YOU'LL LOVE THIS.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.700
I'M THE ONLY GAY
IN THE VILL-AGE!

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.000
WHAT?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.930
WAIT, WAIT!

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.460
(SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS)

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.460
TA-DAA!

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:23.660
THAT WAS A BRAND
NEW WATCH!

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.400
DIDN'T LOOK
CHEAP EITHER.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.230
EH EHH EH EH EHH.
EH EHH EH EH EHH.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.130
COME ON!

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.330
OH, I KNOW
THIS ONE.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ARE YOU
GETTING THE MESSAGE HERE?

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.700
WHAT YOU SEEM TO FORGET IS I'M
DOING ALL THIS FOR THE LIVING.

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.260
I KNOW WHAT PLAYS
TO A LIVE AUDIENCE.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:50.760
IF YOU KNOW WHAT PLAYS, WHY
ARE YOU A SECURITY GUARD?

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.600
WAIT, WATCH THIS ONE!

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.560
THAT WAS A BIT HARSH.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.760
CRUEL TO BE KIND?

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:07.100
MY NAME IS
MICHAEL CAINE.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:15.460
WATCH THIS. IT'LL BE TOP.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.700
MY NAME IS
MICHAEL CAINE.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:34.460
MY NAME IS
MICHAEL CAINE.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.000
THAT WAS REALLY
GOOD, MAN.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.200
THAT WAS REALLY
GOOD, MAN.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.360
YOU'VE NOT COME TO
AUDITION, HAVE YOU?

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.260
WE'VE GOT ALL THE
IMPRESSIONISTS WE NEED.

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:57.760
I SAID YOU WERE ONLY SUPPOSED
TO BLOW THE BLOODY DOORS OFF!

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.260
HELL ON EARTH, WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE TO YOURSELF?

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.230
TOLD YOU IT WAS
GOOD, DIDN'T I?

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:04.160
CAN YOU SEE
A DIFFERENCE?

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.130
YES, BUT IT'S NOT
FUNNY. IT'S JUST SICK.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:09.430
CHANGE BACK, IT'S
FREAKING ME OUT.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.730
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.600
NOT THE END
OF A FESTIVAL.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:21.760
THAT MAN SHOULDN'T BE
ALLOWED OUT AT NIGHT.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:27.630
IT'S ONLY A GUESS BUT,
IS IT RUUD VAN NISTELROOY?

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.960
WHAT IS THE MATTER

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.230

I'M NOT GOING

AT THE POCO-POCO CLUB

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.430
WITHOUT ATTRACTING
YOUR FAIR SHARE OF FANNY.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:13.530
WHEN YOU SPEAK
IT'S LIKE POETRY.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.500
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO SAY TO QUINCE!

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.060
GIFT OF THE GAB.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.360
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:26.000
BOTTOM. BUT YOU
CAN CALL ME "BOOTY".

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.260
YOU LIKE THAT ONE?

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.400
GOT HUNDREDS
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.060
WHAT DO THEY
CALL YOU?

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.900
TITANIA.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:40.260
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:44.030
I LOVE A ROUGH MAN.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:48.230
THEY DON'T COME
MUCH ROUGHER.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.700
YOU'RE MY
IDEAL AUDIENCE.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HANGING AROUND HERE?

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:57.200
I LIVE HERE. I'M
QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.900
ARE YA?

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.730
AND I'LL BET YOU'VE GOT GORGEOUS
SUN MAIDENS, HAVEN'T YOU?

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.900
IF THAT'S WHAT
WOULD PLEASE YOU.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.230
IT'S BANG HONEST.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:24.930
WAIT ON HIM. LEAD HIM
TO MY LOVE PALACE.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:28.760
IT'S NOT NYLON SHEETS,
IS IT? CUZ I GET THIS RASH.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.830
YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS FOR
SOME KIND OF BET, ARE YOU?

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.200
BECAUSE I FELL FOR THIS ONCE
BEFORE ON MY STAG NIGHT.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.260
OF COURSE, I'M NOT
MARRIED ANYMORE.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.160
SHE RAN OFF
WITH A BOOKIE.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.930
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE...

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:47.660
THE BOOKIE,
NOT MY WIFE.

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:54.000
I LIKE THINGS TO GET OUT
OF HAND, YOU KNOW.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.230
I WOULDN'T LEAD
YOU UP AND DOWN,

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:02.430
BUT THIS IS ALL TURNING INTO
A BIT OF A HEAD SQUEEZE.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.600
I'VE GOT A FEELING WHEN I
TELL OBERON WHAT'S HAPPENED

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:11.330
IT'S ME GETTING MY
HEAD SQUEEZED.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:13.100
HAS TITANIA
WOKEN UP?

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.300
OH, YES.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.630
AND?

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.760
BIT OF AN ANIMAL
VIBE GOING ON.

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.230
WHAT HAS SHE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH?

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:25.530
THIS DONKEY-MAN
COMEDIAN TYPE THING.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.860
GOOD.

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:30.730
SLUT.

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.300
THE MORE HUMILIATED
THE BETTER.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.060
THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.430
WHEN HE FINALLY
HAD THE CHANCE OF

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:41.960
HAVING YOU TO HIMSELF,
HE RAN AWAY.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:43.660
HE WOULD NEVER
LEAVE ME.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.600
IT'S ME THAT'LL
NEVER LEAVE YOU.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.700
IF YOU HAVE ANY
FEELINGS FOR ME AT ALL

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.630
THEN YOU'LL TELL ME
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HIM.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.430
I WISH I HAD, HERMIA.
I REALLY DO.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:56.400
BUT I HAVEN'T.
I DIDN'T.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:00.100
WILL YOU HELP
TO FIND HIM THEN?

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.360
JUST LET HIM GO! WE'RE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM!

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.900
THERE IS NO "WE"!

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.960
AUUUGH!

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.930
WELCOME TO THE
GLOBE DINER, SIR.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.030
DID YOU DRUG
THIS MAN?

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:25.500
NO. I DRUGGED THE YOUNG
WET BLOKE LIKE YOU SAID.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.200
THIS IS THE WET BLOKE
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.160
IS IT? HE'S AS
DRY AS A BONE.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.500
THAT'S NOT THE
KIND OF WET I MEANT.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.700
IS "PUCK" SHORT
FOR PUCK UP?

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.930
THIS MAN IS STILL IN LOVE
WITH THE WRONG WOMAN.

KNOW. NO NEED TO...

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.800
WHY DID YOU LEAVE
ME ALONE LIKE THAT?

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.460
I HAD BETTER
THINGS TO DO.

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.430

ALWAYS NEEDS AN AUDIENCE?

WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO TREAT ME LIKE THIS?

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.300
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:31.400

YOU KNOW I DON'T.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:42.630
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:49.560

ALWAYS HAS. HAVEN'T YOU?

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:51.260
OOPS.

FOLLOWING THIS?

CUZ I FEEL LIKE I'M WRESTLING
A SACKFUL OF MONKEYS HERE.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:07.460
AND WHEN DID THIS REMARKABLE
CHANGE OF HEART COME ABOUT?

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.400
I THINK I FIRST REALIZED
IT AT THE YOUTH CLUB

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.300
THAT TIME WE KISSED.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:13.960
THAT WAS 12 YEARS AGO. WHY
ARE YOU DRAGGING THAT UP?

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.530
IT WAS BEFORE HERMIA BUT
PART OF ME KNEW EVEN THEN.

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.500
BUT IT'S TAKEN TIL
NOW FOR ME TO SEE

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.400
WHAT MY HEART'S
ALWAYS KNOWN.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.160

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.430
HE'S A RIGHT OLD POET WHEN
HE GETS GOING, ISN'T HE?

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.730
I SHOULD WRITE SOME OF
THIS ON A CARD AND SELL IT.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:32.130

HE SEES IN YOU.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.760
OH, DON'T GO PUTTING
YOURSELF OUT ON MY ACCOUNT.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.160
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:45.330
I'M SICK OF THIS.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:46.960
JOIN THE CLUB.

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:50.330
NO, I MEAN I'M SICK
OF YOUR SARCASM.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:53.560
AND I'M SICK OF THE FACT
THAT YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.000
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.130
I DO LISTEN TO YOU, I
DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE.

00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:59.960
YOU DON'T LISTEN.
YOU JUST STAND THERE

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:02.300
AND WAIT FOR ME TO STOP
TALKING AND I AM SICK OF IT!

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.560
AND I AM SICK OF YOU HAVING
TO CONTROL EVERY SECOND

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.460
OF EVERY WAKING DAY!

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:07.930
WHAT'S GOT INTO YOU?

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:09.830
I'M THE ANGRY ONE,
YOU'RE THE CALM ONE.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:14.330
WELL, MAYBE AFTER 26 YEARS IT'S
MY TURN TO BE THE ANGRY ONE

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:16.060
BECAUSE GUESS WHAT?

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:19.260
INSIDE I'M ANGRY TOO EXCEPT I'VE
GOT TO BOTTLE IT UP BECAUSE

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.600
YOU'RE SO IRRITABLE ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE TO TIPTOE AROUND YOU!

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.960
WHY DO YOU THINK YOUR DAUGHTER
NEARLY GOT MARRIED TO A MAN

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.960
SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOVE?

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.460
BECAUSE OF YOUR
TEMPER, THAT'S WHY!

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.200
AND THAT'S WHY
SHE'S OUT THERE NOW

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.100
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
WITH A STRANGER!

00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.330
IT'S YOUR FAULT
AND NOBODY ELSE'S!

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:37.230
CUZ HERE IS THE NEWS:

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.130
WE ALL FEEL ANGRY!

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:42.030
WE ALL FEEL
DISAPPOINTED!

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:45.260
BUT MOST OF US JUST
GET ON WITH IT!

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.760
HELENA?

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.360
ZANDER?

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.030
LET'S TALK!

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.900
PLEASE?

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:18.300
DADDY, IT'S ALL
GONE WRONG.

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:37.630
SHH. IT'S OKAY.
IT'LL ALL BE OKAY.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:18.660
WHY IS IT...

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.600
I MEAN, HOW
CAN THEY...

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:28.660
WHEN YOU DO WHAT YOU THINK
IS RIGHT OVER THE YEARS

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:31.530
AND IT'S BEEN
WRONG ALL ALONG,

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:34.100
WHY WOULD SHE
WANT TO LIVE WITH IT

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.930
ALL THIS TIME IF THAT'S
WHAT SHE REALLY THINKS?

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.960
MAYBE SHE LOVES YOU.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.730
SHE DOESN'T
EVEN LIKE ME.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:42.800
THAT'S THE STRANGE
THING ABOUT WOMEN.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.200
THEY CAN LOVE US EVEN WHEN WE'RE
IRRITATING THE HELL OUT OF THEM.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.200
WHEN THEY LOVE YOU, THEY
LOVE YOU. NO CONDITIONS.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.130
IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.960
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO. WITH
THEM, IT'S A FORCE OF NATURE.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.860
IT'S A FOREIGN
LANGUAGE.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:00.660
YOU THINK YOU'VE
GOT TROUBLES?

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:04.560
MY WIFE, SHE'S FLIRTING WITH
A LOW-BUDGET CIRCUS FREAK.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.560
IS IT POSSIBLE
TO ASK, WHY?

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:10.130
WE FOUGHT.

00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:11.830
SHE SULKED.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:13.730
SHE REFUSED
TO HELP.

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:16.100
SO I THOUGHT I'D MAKE HER
SEE SENSE BY, YOU KNOW,

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.760
MAKING A FOOL
OUT OF HER.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:21.430
SO NOW SHE'S IN LOVE WITH A
BLOKE WHO LOOKS LIKE A DONKEY.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.860
I'M NO EXPERT, BUT
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.260
THE BEST IDEA
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.230
I THOUGHT WE'D ESTABLISHED
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT WOMEN.

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:30.400
AND YOU DO, I SUPPOSE.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.230
AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE
YOUR DAUGHTER IS.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.800
WHAT ARE
WE WAITING FOR?

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.760
NO. SHE'S GOT SOME
THINGS TO SORT OUT.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.400
SHE WON'T COME
TO ANY HARM.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.100
THAT'S EASY FOR
YOU TO SAY.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:42.630
SHE WON'T COME
TO ANY HARM.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.230
SO JUST SIT
HERE AND WAIT?

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.700
YOU COULD USE THE TIME
MAKING UP WITH YOUR WIFE.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:50.260
OH, HERE SPEAKS THE
EXPERT ON MARITAL BLISS.

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:52.000
JUST BECAUSE I GOT IT
WRONG DOESN'T MEAN

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.630
YOU NEED TO GET
IT WRONG TOO.

00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:58.030
YOU JUST GO IN THERE AND YOU
SAY THE THREE MAGIC PHRASES

00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:00.830
THAT ALL WOMEN
LOVE TO HEAR.

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:03.500
"I'M SORRY".
"I LOVE YOU"

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.960
AND "YOU
WERE RIGHT".

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.230
I'M NOT SURE
SHE DESERVES IT.

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:12.060
THERE WAS THIS MAN AND
HE LIVED HIS LIFE ALWAYS

00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.460
WORRYING THAT SOMETHING
BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:57:15.460 --> 00:57:19.230
HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIFE,
A WONDERFUL FAMILY.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.200
HE WAS RICH AND
HE WAS SUCCESSFUL

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.960
BUT HE COULDN'T ENJOY
IT BECAUSE HE KNEW

00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.230
THAT SOMETHING BAD
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.460
SO AFTER A FULL
AND CHARMED LIFE,

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:33.300
AT THE AGE OF 120 HE
REALIZED HE WAS DYING.

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.160
AND AS HE LAY ON HIS DEATHBED
HE LOOKED HIS WIFE IN THE EYE

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:40.130
AND HE SAID "SEE?

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:43.760
I TOLD YOU SOMETHING
BAD WAS GONNA HAPPEN".

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.760
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE ME, IS IT?

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:49.100
I'M NOT THAT RICH,
FOR A START.

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:51.730
JUST ENJOY WHAT
YOU'VE GOT, THEO.

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:55.800
JUST ENJOY
WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.760
AND THAT'S GOOD
COMING FROM YOU.

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:17.630
LOOK HOW TENDERLY
SHE HOLDS HIM.

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:19.430
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:24.000
AND TENDERLY STROKES
HIS BIG FURRY EARS.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.300
THIS IS UGLY.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.430
THIS IS SICK.

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:31.430
I KNOW. IT'S THE CAT'S
MATCHES THOUGH, ISN'T IT?

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:34.530
MY ANGER DID
THIS. NOT HER.

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:38.000
I DID IT AND I
WANT IT UNDONE.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.230
OH, YOU'RE KING OF THE FAIRIES;
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:43.160
TURN THE CLOWN
BACK TO NORMAL.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.330
MAKE HIM THINK
HE HAD A DREAM.

00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.700
THE SORT OF DREAM YOU NEVER
WANT TO WAKE UP FROM.

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.060
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.860
I'LL UNDO IT.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.630
(THUD)

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:03.300
NOW GO AND PUT THINGS RIGHT
WITH THE YOUNG LOVERS.

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.860
AW, BUT THEY'RE
FUNNY WHEN THEY'RE ALL

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.660
MESSED UP ON
LOVE JUICE.

ZANDER AND DO IT PROPERLY, PUCK.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.030

BLOWING UP ALL THE TIME.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:13.260
I DIDN'T REALIZE, I JUST

BETTER AT DEALING

YOU FOR THAT.
