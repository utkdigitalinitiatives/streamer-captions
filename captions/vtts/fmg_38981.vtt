COMPUTER:
 The directions for a human
 being are written in code

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
three billion letters long.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
These instructions tell
 our bodies how to live,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
how to grow, how to die.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Researchers call this code
 "The Sequence."

I'm Lucky Severson and this is
 Secrets of the Sequence.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There was an obscure song
on the radio back in the '60s

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that starts out, "Are you
a boy or are you a girl?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
With your long, brown hair,
you look like a girl."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The singer is obviously confused
by outward appearances,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
but to geneticists there
is almost no confusion.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The genetics of sex are
virtually certain at conception,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
though whether you're
a boy or a girl

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
seems to be
a toss of the genetic coin.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
COMPUTER:
On Sexual Determination:

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In the human genome, there
are 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
For 22 of those pairs,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a chromosome
from the father teams up

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
with the same chromosome
from the mother.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The 23rd pair is different.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It can come in an X version
and a Y version.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The egg always has
a single X chromosome.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Sperm can carry
either an X or a Y.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If it's an X, the embryo
develops with an XX pair,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and it is female.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If the fertilizing sperm
carries a Y, it is a boy.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Since you have to add something
to make a male,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
clearly, the default human being
is female.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Um, in any case, somewhere
there-- 83, 84, 85...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
SEVERSON:
Dr. David Page
teaches and researches

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the subject of sex chromosomes,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and the Y chromosome
in particular.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Once it was established that
you were healthy enough to cry,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
what was the next question
on your parents' mind,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
on everybody else's mind?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
AUDIENCE MEMBERS:
"Boy or a girl?"

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
"Boy or a girl,"
you got it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So how did your parents
or doctors

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
or whoever else
was in the delivery room,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
how did they figure out whether
you were a boy or a girl?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
( laughter )

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, there's a lot
of laughing here, uh...

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So they took a look

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and they saw whether
your external genitalia

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
were those of a male
or a female.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And so having determined

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that you were a girl or a boy,
on this basis,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
your parents could finally
decide what name to give you,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and they could announce
your existence to the world.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
SEVERSON:
David Page wears several hats
in the research community.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
He teaches biology
and genetics at MIT,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
conducts research
on the sex chromosomes

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
at the Whitehead Institute,
and gives public lectures.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
His current focus is to find out
why the Y, or male chromosome,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is unlike all the others
in the genome.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
PAGE:
A typical chromosome
has a few thousand genes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The Y chromosome has only about
40 or 50 different genes on it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So it's a relatively sparsely
populated, rural chromosome.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But what are those genes?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
There's a gene on the Y
chromosome called SRY--

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that stands for sex-determining
region of the Y chromosome.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The SRY gene on the Y chromosome
has a very important role

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
in all of our lives.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
SEVERSON:
Before fertilization,
the egg has the potential

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to become either
a male or female embryo.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The decision to develop ovaries
and be female

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
or develop testes and be male,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
is made by a single gene
on the Y chromosome

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
called the SRY gene.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
PAGE:
So seven weeks after the egg
that gave rise to us

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
was fertilized by the sperm
that gave rise to us,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
seven weeks after that happened,
the SRY gene, if it's present,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
raises its hand
and says "I'm here"--

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
instructs a number
of other genes

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to start the process
of making a testis.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But then it disappears
and is never heard from again.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
SEVERSON:
That makes SRY a pretty
important male gene

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and the Y chromosome
emphatically the male
chromosome.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But what about
the other 50 genes on the Y?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
PAGE:
Then there is the BLZ-2 locus,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
which is self-confidence
unlinked to ability, um.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Then, identifying aircraft,
MOM-4-U,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
which is a fascination with
spiders and reptiles and such.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
No other chromosome

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
gets cartoons like this
made about it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The Y has suffered through years
and years of misunderstanding.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
SEVERSON:
So there are three types
of genes on the Y chromosome.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
SRY triggers the formation
of the testes.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
There's a type
of housekeeping genes

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that regulate
basic cell functioning,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and another type,
like the DAZ gene,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
is responsible
for sperm production.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
PAGE:
So you have to keep them...

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So, what's the story?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You have to keep them
pretty dense

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to keep them from...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Um, you have to keep them
at intermediate density.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Yeah, they look pretty juicy
to me, pretty good.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
SEVERSON:
About one in every 4,000 boys

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
is born with a hole
in his Y chromosome

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that causes male infertility.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Page's lab is putting
human sperm-making genes

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
into infertile mice

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to see which ones are the most
important to male fertility.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
PAGE:
In this case,
a defect has been produced

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in a mouse spermatogenesis gene.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
We're going to see if we can do

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
a little gene therapy
on this mouse

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and rescue that defect,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
using the human Y
spermatogenesis gene,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and that will, in turn, tell us

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
a lot about how the human
Y spermatogenesis gene works.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
SEVERSON:
Figure that out, and it could
lead to a fertility therapy.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
One in six American couples
is infertile,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and about one-third of the time
it's caused by the male.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's just one
of the genetic puzzles

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that makes the Y chromosome
so important

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to both males and females.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The one question
that I'm asked most frequently

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is what do these X and Y
chromosomes have to do

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
with... with sexual orientation?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Do these,
do the X and the Y chromosomes

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
make you straight or gay?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We don't yet understand much,
if anything,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
about the connection
between the sex chromosomes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and how sexual identity, uh,
and sexual preference

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is actually established
in the mind.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Once the embryo decides
to make testes or ovaries

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
under the influence
or absence of SRY,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
then those-- the testis
or the ovary--

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
then produces sex hormones,
the famous things

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
like testosterone and estrogen
and so on.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And these sex hormones
are actually responsible

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
for masculinizing or feminizing

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
many of the other
parts of the body,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
including,
it's thought, the brain.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
SEVERSON:
So now we know

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
what the difference
between girls and boys is--

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
a gene called SRY.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The U.S. Senate
recently failed to act

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
on anti-cloning
legislation,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which means there probably
won't be any this year,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but the issue is not going away.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
As one newspaper
headline put it,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
"Cloning has put the 'political'
back in 'science'."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
That's literally true
in the case of Francis Fukuyama,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
one of America's foremost
political scientists,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
who also sits on the president's
Bioethics Council.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In a new book, Our Posthuman
 Future, Fukuyama argues

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that some of the most profound
and unprecedented changes

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
in history may be on the way.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Of course, we've been changing
things about ourselves

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
since the beginning
of the species--

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
knowledge and abilities,
habits, appearance.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
FUKUYAMA:
The one thing

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
that they have not been able
to alter thus far is

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
the basic genetic makeup
of the human species,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which is something

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that was basically given to us
by evolution.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And the "posthuman future"

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
refers to the prospect
down the road

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that we will at some point

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
be able to consciously
take control of that process

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
of genetic design
and essentially reshape,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
you know, what human beings
are by nature.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
SEVERSON:
Fukuyama warns of the social
and political consequences

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of even
the most benign changes

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
like the fact
that we live longer.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
FUKUYAMA:
Europe in 50 years is going to
have a median age of about 60--

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
50% of the population
will be 60 years or older--

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and that part of the world
will be surrounded

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
by a Third World, where the
median age is around 22 or 23.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
SEVERSON:
And issues with
even more profound implications

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
are on the horizon.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
FUKUYAMA:
Human germ-line engineering,
if it becomes possible,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
will be probably
the most consequential

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
simply because when you start
making these changes,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
they are irreversible--

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
they're handed down
to descendants.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
They really offer the chance

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
of changing
the fundamental structure

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
of what a human being is.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
SEVERSON:
Though the actual retooling
of the human genome

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is a good ways off,
Fukuyama is convinced

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
that this science
is too important

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
to be left
entirely to the scientists.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
He wants a new regulatory agency

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
staffed both by scientists
and non-scientists.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And it's not that scientists
have bad motives at all.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I mean, they have
very good motives.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But, you know, their interests
don't necessarily correspond

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
to the public interest,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and so therefore,
I think there is a need

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to somewhat democratize
that decision-making process.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
SEVERSON:
Can it be done--

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
fencing off areas prohibited
to scientific advance?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Francis Fukuyama believes
it can, and he is not alone.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
MAN:
I think it would be

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
morally reprehensible
to despair at the possibility

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of trying to exercise
some control

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
over where this engine is going.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
The atomic scientists
had a genie out of the bottle

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
at the end of World War II.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
The biologists
are in the same place.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Dr. Leon Kass is also on
the president's bioethics panel.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
In fact, he chairs it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
The group was set up last year

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
to advise the president
on the relevant issues.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
But the president didn't
even wait for its advice,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
instead immediately calling

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
for a total ban
on therapeutic cloning.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
For some background
on the issue,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
let's see what
our computer has on file.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
COMPUTER:
Therapeutic cloning--

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
or "somatic cell
nuclear transfer"--

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
involves removing the nucleus
from a human egg

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and replacing it with the
nucleus of a cell from a donor.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The nucleus contains the donor's
entire genetic code.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
As the egg divides,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
it develops an inner core
of embryonic stem cells,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
which could be harvested
and returned to the donor

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to replace
or repair damaged tissue

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
without the problem
of tissue rejection.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Some fear that permitting
therapeutic cloning

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
could lead
to reproductive cloning--

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the cloning of human beings--
or even to manufacturing embryos

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
to harvest their healthy organs
for the sick and disabled.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Our children... are gifts
to be loved and protected,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
not products to be designed
and manufactured.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Allowing cloning would be taking
a significant step

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
toward a society
in which human beings

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
are grown for spare body parts

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and children are engineered
to custom specifications,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and that's not acceptable.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
SEVERSON:
But those who believe in the
promise of therapeutic cloning

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
reject that argument.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
MAN:
This...

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
clump of cells that will never
leave the laboratory

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is not the union
of male and female.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It's an egg

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that gets its DNA
and its nucleus taken out.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
SEVERSON:
Hollywood Superman
Christopher Reeve was paralyzed

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in a riding accident in 1995.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Since then, he's learned
about-- and campaigned for--

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
research on
spinal cord injuries.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
He's convinced that stem cells
cloned from his own DNA

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
might heal his injured
spinal cord,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
enabling him to walk again.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
REEVE:
You're not even working
with an embryo;

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
you're working with an egg
that has not been fertilized.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You must see the distinction.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
There are 400,000 people
with spinal cord injuries,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and there are many, many more
who have other disabilities

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that could have been helped
by saved stem cells.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
SEVERSON:
Not surprisingly, the Religious
Right sees it differently.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
JERRY FALWELL:
If it's embryonic
stem cell research,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it all involves
the destruction of an embryo,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and so it begins
with an abortion.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I would say it's never right
to do wrong to accomplish right.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
SEVERSON:
So is this one of those
black-and-white issues,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
or a more shaded,
nuanced dilemma?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
KASS:
What we're dealing with here
is not simply

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
a case of good versus evil,
but a case of competing goods,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
or a case where the evils,
such as they are,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
are so closely embedded
in the goods

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that you can't simply
tease them out

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
without forgoing the one
or embracing the other.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
As a biologist,
I've come to somehow regard

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the earliest stages of human
life as not humanly nothing.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
SEVERSON:
To other bioethicists, that
position seems simply wrong.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The notion that potential
ingredients of people

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
are the same as people is one
that doesn't seem to me

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to be factually correct.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
My personal view is that there
is a kind of rising moral status

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
that begins at conception

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and continues, in fact,
until you become an adult.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And so it would be permissible
to do certain things

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
with embryos that it would not
be permissible to do

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
with a later-stage fetus or
certainly with an actual infant.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
SEVERSON:
Both Fukuyama and Kass
would draw a red line

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
between repairing and
enhancement, or modification.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Are these questions
that may affect the future

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
of the human species?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And who should decide--

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the scientists themselves
or government?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
CAPLAN:
If you believe in choice,
and you don't want to wind up

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
with a government-imposed vision

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
of genetic normalcy
or genetic desirability,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
you've got to let people
make their choices,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and I would allow some limits

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
if it turned out
that the choices

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that individuals were making
about genetics

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
were skewing the safety
or stability of a society.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Science is, by its
own self-definition,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
morally neutral,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
whereas if you've got moral
dimensions to a question,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
those are really for the
community as a whole to decide.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The debate will go on, whatever
congress and the president do

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
because of the profound
importance of these issues

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
to the human--
or posthuman-- future.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
There are two kinds of
cloning:

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
reproductive and therapeutic.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Reproductive cloning seeks
to reproduce

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
entire living organisms,
and we've done this

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
with goats, cats, sheep,
cows, mice and pigs.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Therapeutic cloning,
on the other hand, seeks

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to create not a whole organism,
but just a few special cells

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that might be used
to grow new tissue

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
or reverse genetic diseases.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
COMPUTER:
Lucky, there's a problem
with the term "therapeutic"

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
in connection with cloning.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Many scientists insist

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that creating duplicate cells
for medical experimentation

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
be called
"nuclear transplantation"

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
or "stem cell research."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
They think
that calling it "cloning"

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
raises too many red flags.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
To a layman I'm not sure

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
"nuclear transplantation" sounds
that much more benign,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
but let's begin
at the beginning.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
COMPUTER:
About cloning:

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The word "clone" comes
from the Greek word klon,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
which means "twig"
or "offshoot."

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
A clone is an identical copy
of something.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
In genetics
it means genetically identical.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Cloning is
nonsexual reproduction.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
It does not require the union

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
of male and female gametes,
or sex cells.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Genetic material from a donor
is inserted in an egg,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
which has had
its own nucleus removed.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
When the egg divides,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
it will reproduce
the inserted genetic material.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
SEVERSON:
There is widespread agreement

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
that the reproductive cloning
of human beings

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
is and should remain taboo.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
We just don't know enough

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to guarantee that a cloned baby
would be born healthy,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
but many favor
therapeutic cloning,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and that research is under way
in a number of laboratories.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
This is how it works.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
First the cloners need eggs.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
They remove the genetic material
from the egg and discard it.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
These are skin cells

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
from a mammal
that's going to be cloned.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Each dark spot

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
is a nucleus containing the
genetic material of the cell.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
The nucleus is extracted
from the rest of the cell

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
for use in the empty egg.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
One skin cell nucleus
is injected into each empty egg

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
so the genetic instructions
that came with the egg

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
have been replaced

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
with the genetic instructions
from the skin cell.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
After electrical
and chemical manipulation,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
a few of these cells may begin
to grow into embryos.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Once scientists have mastered
the creation and nurturing

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
of these embryos long enough
for stem cells to develop,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
they can explore
the possibilities

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
for organ and tissue repair.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
MAN:
With therapeutic cloning, you're
starting out with one cell,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and that one cell becomes two,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
then those two become four,
the four become eight,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and then you're
actually watching this

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
under the microscope,
and you can see

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
once you get to a certain level
and a certain volume of cells,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
there's an approximate volume
of cells

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
where you can actually take
the cells and start using them

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
for different purposes.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
You can convert these cells
into different tissue structures

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
whether it be heart muscle,
skeletal muscle,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
cartilage, bone, et cetera,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
and you can then expand these
cells into large quantities

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and have them available
for the patient.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
SEVERSON:
Dr. Atala is talking
about human embryonic stem cells

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
from which he hopes
to grow completely new organs.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
It's called tissue engineering.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
He could use the stem cells
already approved

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
by the U.S. government

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
but they don't solve
one important basic problem:

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
They don't come
from the patient who needs them.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
ATALA:
The fact is that
even if you are able

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
to obtain stem cells
from embryonic sources

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and even if you are able
to differentiate those cells

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and even if you are able
to take those cells

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and create tissue for therapy,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
once you go through
that whole process,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
there is no guarantee
that once it gets to the patient

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
that patient is not going
to reject it,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
because it's not recognizing
that tissue as their own.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And that is where therapeutic
cloning can provide an answer,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
because you're not using
somebody else's cells.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
You're using
the patient's own cells,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
and that makes a big difference.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
SEVERSON:
Dr. Atala collaborates

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
with Robert Lanza
of Advanced Cell Technology,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
a biotech company
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Despite all the controversy,
ACT has staked its future

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
on therapeutic
cloning technology

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
for both organ replacement
and cell therapy.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
LANZA:
Our objective is actually
to not to clone a whole copy

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
of a person or a whole animal

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
but to basically
just clone cells.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
We want to clone cells

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
that can be used
for replacement purposes.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
You know, there are literally
hundreds and hundreds

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
of diseases that this technology
could be used to treat--

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
for instance,
Parkinson's disease.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
If you wanted
to put in new neurons

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
or if you had kidney failure
or heart failure,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
we could grow you up
either new heart cells

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
or even eventually
an entire heart.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
SEVERSON:
The controversy arises because
a potential life is destroyed

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
to obtain those stem cells.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
LANZA:
We're talking about
a microscopic ball of cells

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
that doesn't have
a single body cell yet.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
It hasn't even decided
what it wants to do.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
So the question here is
is whether or not you're going

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
to take this microscopic ball
of cells

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and alleviate a lifetime
of suffering in a patient

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
or whether or not
you're just going to discard it.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
I think the whole question is

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
is whether or not a completely
undifferentiated ball of cells

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
that's microscopic--
smaller than the head of a pin--

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
warrants the same rights
and reverence

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
as an adult or a child
who may die

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
because we failed
to use this technology.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
If someone took that cloned ball
of undifferentiated cells

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
and implanted it
in a human uterus,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
could it be used to reproduce
a living, breathing human being?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
The troubling answer is "Yes."

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Should we ban therapeutic
cloning of human beings

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
which might help millions

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
to prevent reproductive cloning
of humans?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
That's a harder question
to answer.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
...substantially
to the placenta.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
SEVERSON:
Rudolf Jaenisch
of the Whitehead Institute

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
thinks the scientific reasons

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
not to clone a living
human being are very strong.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Based on studies
of cloned animals

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
and his own cloning research,
he believes that the process

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
of reproductive cloning
is too unpredictable

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and imperfect to try
on a human being,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and he is scornful of those
who are attempting to do it.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
JAENISCH:
They need to be stopped,
because what will come out,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
and I think we are pretty...

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I think it's with
quite some, um, confidence

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
we can predict this.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
What they will produce
are abnormal people,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
and, um, you don't want
to use people as guinea pigs.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
SEVERSON:
But Jaenisch feels differently
about therapeutic cloning,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
which he believes could
create embryonic stem cells

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
and lead to cures for diseases.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
JAENISCH:
Now, these embryonic stem cells

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
are really amazing cells.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
They have the potential
to... in culture

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
to develop into any tissue type
of your body.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
So they are shown that they...

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
We know they can develop
into neurons and nerve cells,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
into, um, muscle cells,
into heart muscle cells,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
into blood cells,
um, into cartilage,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
into bone, into anything.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
They are now a source

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
of any tissue type
you might want to use

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
to transplant back
into the donor

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and of course since genetically
they are identical,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
the immune system
wouldn't mind that.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
It wouldn't reject those cells.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
There is the potential of what
we call regenerative medicine

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
or transplantation medicine,
and this is all

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
under the umbrella term
"therapeutic cloning."

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
You know, Great Britain
has banned reproductive cloning

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
but is allowing research
into human cloning for
therapeutic purposes to proceed.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Meanwhile, a bill to ban
human cloning of any kind

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
for therapeutic
or reproductive purposes

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
is moving very slowly
through the U.S. Congress.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
In future episodes,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
we'll explore the ethical
dimensions of the cloning debate

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
and hear from two men who have
very different perspectives:

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
the Reverend Jerry Falwell
and actor Christopher Reeve.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
When we think about patents

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
we usually think
about inventors:

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Gutenberg
and the printing press,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Morse and the telegraph,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Marconi and the radio.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
We can understand patents
for inventions like these,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
but what about genes?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
That's right, genes.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
There's a new
gold rush going on

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
with scientists staking claims
for treasure,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
except this time,
the treasure is part of you.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
( computer beeps )

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
COMPUTER:
About patents.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
The word comes from the Latin
 litterae patentes,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
meaning an open letter.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Such letters were used
by medieval monarchs

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
to confer rights and privileges.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
With a royal seal, the letters
served as proof of those rights

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
for all to see.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
The first recorded patent
of invention was granted

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
to John of Utynam.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
In 1449, he was awarded
a 20-year monopoly

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
for a glass-making process
previously unknown in England.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
The first patent this year
in the United States

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
was assigned number 6,334,220

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
for an adjustable disposable
garment protector--

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
a bib for motorists
eating fast foods.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Well, that's all
very interesting

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
but not really
to the point of our story.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
The question is,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
do scientists have the right
to patent our genes,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
to claim rights
to a piece of DNA

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
that is our shared inheritance,
and make money on it?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Let's meet a family

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
who decided to take the matter
into their own hands.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Living in a well-tended suburb
of Boston, Massachusetts

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
used to be everything
the Terry family wanted.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Now their American dream is
pinned on something else:

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
a gene patent.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Pat Terry used to be
a contractor

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
hired to solve the problems of
building biotech laboratories.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Now he runs PXE International,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
a nonprofit foundation that
may someday find a solution

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
to a very specific
genetic problem.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
MAN:
Five years ago I didn't know
a gene from a hubcap.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
I did not have any experience
whatsoever in this realm.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
But after my children
were diagnosed,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I had to become an expert
and learn as much as I can.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
SEVERSON:
Pat's children,
Elizabeth and Ian,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
were diagnosed with a disease

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
called pseudoxanthoma elasticum,
or PXE.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
PXE attacks the connective
tissues of the skin, eyes

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
and cardiovascular system,

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
causing problems like severe
skin lesions, vision loss

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
and even sudden cardiac arrest.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And there is no known cure.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
In December 1994, the Terry
family got the diagnosis

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
that changed their lives.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
WOMAN:
I was with the kids alone.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I called Pat and told him
what the diagnosis was.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I don't think
it really hit us completely.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
We tried to get
some information.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
The information was scattered.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
We got scared.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
We did things
like bought the kids

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
everything they wanted
for Christmas that year.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
And we booked
a trip to Europe,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
thinking that they would die
by the time they were 13 or 14

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
was the news we got.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
SEVERSON:
Only one in 25,000 people
have PXE,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
so profits from any drug therapy
would be small.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Giving scientists motivation
to find a cure

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
for such a rare disorder
was a tall order,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
but the Terrys were determined.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Using the Internet--
and using up their savings--

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
they collected data
and tissue samples

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
from 1,500 PXE patients.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
They offered this unique
collection to researchers

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
and worked with scientists
to identify the gene.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Two years ago,
PXE International,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
along with the gene's
co-founder,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
the University of Hawaii,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
applied for a patent
on the PXE gene.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
SHARON TERRY:
I think the biggest difference

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
between corporate-structure
America patenting
and us patenting

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
is motivation.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And we have no problem

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
with corporate America
needing to make money,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
because that's what
they need to do.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
In fact we want them
to do that,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
because they will make
better drugs

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
and they will make
disease treatments.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But for us it's
pure motivation

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
in terms of the patient
or the person affected.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
SEVERSON:
Since filing the patent,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
researchers found out that
the PXE gene is also involved

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
in cardiovascular disease
and macular degeneration--

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
diseases affecting millions.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
That means their patent may have
wide application,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
and that should entice
pharmaceutical companies

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
to research the gene
and what it does.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
For the Terrys
it's the means to the end--

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
finding a cure
for their children.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Hi, Donna, is Nancy Taylor
available, please?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
PAT TERRY:
It's a slightly different
business model

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
because we will be subsidizing
this patent

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
because it may not have
an economic engine

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
to survive on its own.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
So we might be
subsidizing access

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
or leveraging access

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
through the patent
and licensing system

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
that is a little
out of the ordinary.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
SEVERSON:
Many researchers believe

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
that what the Terrys are doing
is a model

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
for how gene patenting
should work for patients.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
But initially, gene patents
were filed for profits,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
not for cures and therapies.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
MAN:
It's a very simple matter:
no patent, no drug.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
A drug company manufactures
a human component.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
All the research
that went into that

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
costs hundreds of millions
of dollars.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
If that research had not been
protected with patents,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
nobody would do that research.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Nobody owns a gene
in anybody's human body.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
But if we have taken that gene
from a body,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
we've learned how to use it
to make a substance.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
That substance is useful
for medicine like insulin.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Then it's deemed
the subject for patents,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
and they're very important
for the future of medicine.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
SEVERSON:
But determining
legal ownership of a gene

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
that's held commonly by everyone
is pretty complicated.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Allowing the patenting
of human genes

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
would be like allowing Columbus
to patent America

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
or Newton to patent gravity

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
and make all of us pay for the
privilege of living in America

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
or being subject to gravity.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
That's what happens

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
when you allow the patenting
of a product of nature.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
This should not be a part
of our patent law.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
And it takes something
that we all own

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
and should own as a community,
and lets a corporation own it

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
and make us pay for
the privilege of using it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
SEVERSON:
The National Institutes
of Health

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
were among the first
institutions to patent genes.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Since the Human Genome Project
was paid for

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
by the American public,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
it seemed to follow that
the ownership of human genes

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
would be held in the public
domain, for everyone to use.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
It didn't happen
that way, though.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
MAN:
Whenever anybody says, "Well,
should that be patented?"

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
my rejoinder is, "Well, would it
help the public if it were?"

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
And if the answer is yes,
then let's look at that.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
If the answer is no,
why are we doing that?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
On the other hand,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
if you're talking about snippets
of DNA of no known function

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
that somebody just wants to say,
"Now I own that piece.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
"There's a fence around it.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Nobody can work on this
without asking my permission,"

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
that doesn't help
the public at all.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
That does just the reverse.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
It basically puts
a "No Fishing" sign

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
across a whole lot of the genome

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
and ends up slowing down
the progress of research.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
He was too young to say,
"Don't take my picture now."

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
SEVERSON:
The last thing
the Terrys want to do

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
is slow the progress of research
on the PXE gene,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
and they plan to give wide
access to their discoveries.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
SHARON TERRY:
Our intention
in patenting the gene

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
was to have a place
at the table,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
to be a part of the discussion,

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
to be a part of the plans
that would go forward from here,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
and probably
most importantly,
to safeguard

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
what would happen
for patients

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
that, because we're
motivated first

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
by making sure
patients benefit,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
we would be the voice
at the table

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
who would
constantly say,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
"Is this the best path
for patients?"

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
PAT TERRY:
The reality for us to see
how rare-disease diagnostics

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
once the gene is found
or whatever,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
the excitement is over,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
the discovery process
is perceived to be over

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
by the scientific community and
they move on to another disease.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And we felt
that we had

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
the long-term interests
close to our hearts.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
This is a nice
picture, too.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
There are some doctors and
researchers

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
who want to replace the dog
as man's best friend

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
with the pig.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Specifically, a variety
called "miniature swine,"

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
which top out
at a mere 300 pounds,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
well below the 1,000 or so
of adult swine.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
These smaller pigs
won't be pets though;

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
they'll be organ donors.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
After some
genetic modifications,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
their organs may be used
to save human lives.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
It's called a "xenograft."

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
COMPUTER:
Xenograft comes from
the Greek word, "xenos,"

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
which means "stranger"
or "guest."

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Xenophobia is fear and hatred
of anything foreign or strange.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Xenografts are
tissue transplants

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
from one species to another--

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
from a pig to a human,
for example.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Normally the recipient's
immune system

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
would reject
such a transplant.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Human-to-human transplants
are called "allografts."

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
In this case, the immune system
needs to be suppressed

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
to avoid rejection.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Autografts are transplants
from one place to another

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
on the same human.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
The immune system has no problem
here; it likes its own kind.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
( heart rate machine bleeping )

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
SEVERSON:
For some 20 years now,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
human-to-human transplants
seem to have worked pretty well.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
So why even bother
with xenografts from pigs,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
with all the immune-response
problems?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
MAN:
The reason why we are all so
interested in the xenotransplant

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
is because, paradoxically,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
the success of ordinary,
allogenic transplants

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
has been so great that
we have run out of organs.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
There just aren't
enough cadaver organs

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
to satisfy the need
for all the people

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
whose lives could be saved
by a transplant.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
That's why we're really working
so hard on this;

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
it's because people
are dying every day.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
SEVERSON:
Right now, there are
about 80,000 patients

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
on waiting lists
in the United States alone

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
for various donor organs.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
By all accounts,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
16 people die each day
for want of a human donor organ.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
David Sachs believes that
pig organs can fill the gap.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
SACHS:
We would match

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
the donor to be the same size
as the recipient.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
So for an adult
who weighed 70 kilograms,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
we'd use a 70-kilogram pig.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
WOMAN:
It's incredibly surprising
how similar the pig is to man.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
It wouldn't be your choice
of your most-related relative.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
But when you look at things
like heart rate, blood pressure,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
serum chemistries,
the pig has...

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
shares an incredible amount, in
terms of physiology, with man.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
SEVERSON:
So physically,
pigs are a lot like people.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Genetically, there are some
significant differences

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
between pigs and humans.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Powerful drugs are already used

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
to suppress the immune response
to a human organ transplant.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
The amount of drugs needed

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
to suppress
the human immune response

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
to an unmodified pig organ
could be lethal.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
The major barrier
to xenotransplantation

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
is rejection--

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
the immune response
against that transplant--

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
and there are two ways we
are trying to overcome that:

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
One is by modifying the donor
through genetic engineering,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
changing some
of the antigens on the pig--

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
the ones that are most difficult
to overcome--

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
and changing those
such that there will be

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
much less of an immune
response to them.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
And the other is by changing the
immune response of the recipient

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
in a specific way, which we call
"inducing tolerance."

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
SEVERSON:
Basically, it means making pigs
a little less piglike

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
and humans
a little more pig-tolerant.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
It's working toward
a genetic middle ground.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
For example, pigs normally
carry a gene missing in humans,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
one that generates a sugar
our bodies recognize as foreign.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
At the beginning of the year,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
two biotechnology companies
announced

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
that they had cloned piglets
with that gene knocked out.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
SACHS:
It turns out

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
that on all species except
humans and old-world primates,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
the terminal sugar--

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
the last sugar
on the surface of all cells,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
on the sugars on all cells--
is alpha 1-3 gau.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
But sometime during evolution,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
old-world primates and humans
lost the enzyme for that sugar.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
So we don't have alpha 1-3 gau,

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
and therefore we make
a lot of antibody against it.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
That antibody appears to be

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
one of the major barriers
to xenotransplantation.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
SEVERSON:
Modifying pig organ donors
is half the equation.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Making human recipients more
tolerant is coming along, too.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
The human thymus is where white
blood cells are programmed

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
to recognize invaders.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
By injecting pig cells
in or near the thymus,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
some white cells are trained
to accept pig tissues.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
This has worked in baboons,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
which serve as
the humanlike animal model.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
But there is another concern:
pigs have something

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
called "porcine
endogenous retroviruses,"

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
retroviruses that are part
of the animal's own DNA.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
GREENSTEIN:
Every species
has endogenous retroviruses,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
and so in human transplantation

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
by transplanting an organ
from one human to another,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
you're not exposing the human
to a new endogenous retrovirus.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
We all have these pieces or
fragments of DNA in our genome.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
The issue in xenotransplantation

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
is that we
are potentially introducing

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
a new endogenous retrovirus
into the patient.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
SEVERSON:
Viruses that jump
from one species to another

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
can behave badly.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
A virus, jumping from
monkey to human, for instance,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
may have led to the disease
known to us as AIDS.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Tackling the virus problem
has taken time.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
So has everything else
about xenograft research.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
This project at Massachusetts
General Hospital

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
is now in its 12th year.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
But now the pace
of tissue engineering research

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
is picking up.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
So the question is,
will these pigs ever fly?

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
GREENSTEIN:
We've moved the survival of pig
organs in preclinical models

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
from minutes to hours to 30 days

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
to, in the extreme, almost
100 days of survival time.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Now, we think we'll be able
to put together our protocols

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
in the next year and a half
to two,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
and once we have survival times

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
on the order of six months
to a year,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
we'll be able to start

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
very small, carefully controlled
clinical trials.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
The idea of knowing our roots,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
where we came from is
almost irresistible.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
And nowhere is it practiced
more faithfully and expertly

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
than within the Mormon Church,
headquartered in Salt Lake City.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Mormons trace their lineage

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
in order to collect names
of dead ancestors

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
so members can perform what are
called "baptisms for the dead."

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
But genealogy has long been
overlooked by technology.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
The advent of the Internet
sped up the process enormously,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
but it's genetics
that has revolutionized

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
the study of the family tree.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
( camera shutter clicking )

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
SEVERSON:
People have been tracing
their family trees

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
since biblical times.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
And after the Second World War,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
genealogy--
the study of human ancestry--

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
became an even
more popular hobby.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
I don't think that
I've ever met a person

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
who isn't interested
in who they are

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
and how they're connected
to other people

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
and essentially
everybody else in the world.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
With this ring,
I thee wed.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
SEVERSON:
Tracing your heritage
isn't easy.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Family trees never
stop branching out,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
which means they create

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
increasingly complex
relationships between relatives.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Grandparents die,
children move away,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
there's divorce and remarriage.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
So genealogies can
often hit a dead end.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Family secrets slowly
become hidden in history.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
But DNA--
our definitive family record--

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
has the capacity to expose
genealogical connections

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
like never before.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Diahan Southard
of Relative Genetics in Utah

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
is helping to amass
a DNA database.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
There's tons of things you
can learn about your ancestry

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
on paper.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
But there's even more, I think,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
you can learn about
your ancestry through DNA,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
as paper only goes so far and
it can only tell you so much.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
But your DNA
really does reveal...

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
It carries everything
there is to know about you.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
SEVERSON:
So mysteries that have
long stumped archivists--

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
tracking where families
have moved,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
finding long-lost relatives--

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
these and other mysteries
now might be solved

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
through DNA analysis.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Relative Genetics
is just one

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
of several companies
in the United States

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
offering DNA analysis to amateur
and professional genealogists.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
DNA samples are
typically collected

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
by scraping cells
from inside the mouth.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Technicians and
million-dollar gene machines

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
then extract strands
of the subject's DNA

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
and replicate or amplify it

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
using a technique called
polymerase chain reaction.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
COMPUTER: 
About PCR:
polymerase chain reaction.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
PCR has transformed
molecular biology

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
through vastly extending
the capacity

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
to identify, manipulate
and reproduce DNA,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
allowing scientists
to analyze genetic samples

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
that previously
could not be tested

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
because of poor quality
or small amounts.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
The starting material for PCR
is the "target sequence,"

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
a gene or segment of DNA.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
The complementary strands

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
of a double-stranded molecule
of DNA are separated by heating.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Within a short time,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
millions of exact replicas
of the target sequence

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
will have been produced

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
through repeated heating
and cooling cycles.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
This process is known
as PCR amplification

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
and creates enough DNA
for identification and research.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
SEVERSON:
Old techniques allowed
genealogists to track

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
maternal and paternal lines
separately,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
but couldn't cross-reference
the data.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
DNA analysis
will be able to do both.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
SOUTHARD:
It's easy for genealogists

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
because genealogy
is based on surnames

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
and it's based on tracking
the name of someone

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
to the name of someone else.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
And so when you're tracking
the name of someone,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
you're also tracking their DNA,
and that's what we're using.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
SEVERSON:
Still, family tree research
using mitochondrial DNA

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
and y chromosome analysis
has some flaws.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
If a mother bore only sons
for one generation,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
her link to the future
was broken.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
The same can be said for a
father who sired only daughters.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Southard, along with researchers

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
at Brigham Young University
in Utah, are collecting

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
genealogical
and genetic information

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
from 100,000 individuals
around the globe,

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
representing the world's
different populations.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
They are conducting DNA analysis

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
on samples from every individual
in a massive database,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
testing for patterns

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
not just in the y chromosome
and mitochondrial DNA,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
but 250 varied points
on the complete human genome.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
SOUTHARD:
Then you see what's common
about their genealogy

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
and what's common
about their genetics,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
and when those two things
overlap, then we've found

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
a genetic marker
that identifies that population.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
You compare them one person
to another, and you can see

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
how each individual
is unique on their own,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
and yet how they share

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
with different people who
descend from the same area.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
SEVERSON:
The scientist responsible
for this ambitious project

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
is Scott Woodward.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
WOODWARD:
We can reconstruct
gene pools in the past.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
We can now type an individual
who doesn't know anything

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
about their genealogy
or who they are

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
and tell them, with a high
degree of probability,

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
where their genes were

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
a generation ago, two, three,
four, five generations ago.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
It's useful mostly
because it doesn't lie.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
While your paper trail
could lead you

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
in completely
the wrong direction,

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
while you will run into two men

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
who have the same name--
John Wilson--

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
you will never run into two men
who have the same DNA.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
SEVERSON:
But DNA reveals the truth:
we are all related,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
and more closely
than we might think.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
WOODWARD:
Everyone has two parents.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
They have four grandparents
and eight great-grandparents,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
and if you keep going back
for 30 generations,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
there are one billion potential
ancestors for each one of us.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
We share ancestors.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
There weren't enough people
living on the earth

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
to take care
of each one of us to have

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
one billion unique ancestors,
unique ancestors 750 years ago.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
So that means we all essentially
have married our cousins.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
And genealogy is a way
of discovering that.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Evolution has been at work

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
since the first single-cell
organism appeared

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
some three and a half billion
years ago.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
It has taken that long
for natural selection

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
to produce an animal
that could study evolution.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
As we study our own development,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
we have made some
interesting discoveries.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
By analyzing our
mitochondrial DNA,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
we can trace our lineage back
some 150,000 years

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
to the ancestral
mother of all humans,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
the so-called African,
or mitochondrial, "Eve"

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
that all humans seem to share
as their original mother.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
A British researcher,
Bryan Sykes,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
thinks that most who claim
European ancestry

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
are descended from seven
so-called "Daughters of Eve"

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
who existed from 10,000
to 45,000 years ago.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
He's got a company now,
Oxford Ancestors it's called--

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Sykes is a professor at Oxford--

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
and they recently mailed me
this DNA kit

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
to see which of the
seven Daughters of Eve

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
I might have descended from.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
You've probably
seen this before--

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
a swab to scrape cells
from inside a cheek,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
the sort of thing you do

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
to prove that you really are
heir to all those millions

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
and that you're not
a monkey's uncle.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Let me read the directions.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
It says, "Rinse your mouth
with water

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
"to remove food
and other debris.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
"Remove the brush
from its pocket,

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
"taking care not to touch
the bristles with you fingers.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:05.000
"Rub the bristles on your inner
cheek five times on each side.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
"Try to avoid touching
your teeth,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
"as bacteria collect there.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Replace the brush
inside the pocket."

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Seal it, and send it off,
back to England,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
and in a few weeks
they promise to let me know

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
who my greatest of
all grandmothers was--

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
perhaps Ursula or Helena
or Xenia.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Wasn't she a warrior princess?

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Tara?

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Who picked these names,
a Hollywood agent?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
One thing you see when you look
at this location map

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
of the Seven Daughters

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
is that their tribes had all
migrated thousands of miles

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
from their original
African home.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
MAN:
You can see how much of
our environment has changed.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
In the last 100,000 years,
we move out of Africa,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
we go to very cold climate,
very warm climate,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
very wet, very dry climate,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
and the north, south--
everywhere.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
So we change our habitat
and we develop agriculture,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
so we change our diet.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
We now can live in
very dense habitation,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
because the food supply
is now very abundant.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
And once you live
in such close proximity,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
all the pathogens--
bacteria, cholera, malaria,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
everything-- just multiply.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
SEVERSON:
But this new animal also
has created air-conditioning,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
central heat,
and modern medicine,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
and that may be changing

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
the mutation-plus-environment
equation in another way.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
WU:
A mutation can be
good-becoming-bad

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
or bad-becoming-good,
because environment changes.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
When you have mutations
going from bad-to-good

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
that is evolution,
and in that respect,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
human probably has been
evolving the most

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
compared to other species.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
SEVERSON:
Even without such intervention,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
bad mutations that aren't
immediately disabling

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
occur much faster than natural
selection can weed them out.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
WU:
The very common diseases

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000
like cardiovascular disease,
the diabetes, asthma,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
and most of the common disease,
are actually caused by these--

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
we call them
small-effect mutations.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Each one by itself
doesn't cause much harm,

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
but the problem is that
we have so many of them,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
and that can, in aggregate,
can be a public health concern.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Natural selection is
still able to remove

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
all the mutations
that come in,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
but it's not doing it
fast enough,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
so before a mutation

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
gets completely purged
from the population,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
it probably would have
a sojourn time,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
a retention time,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
of a couple hundred generation
in a population.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
So far, we haven't mentioned
one key element

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
implied in Darwin's theory
of natural selection: luck.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
WU:
The central concept is that
of course each mutation has

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
a very, very small chance
of becoming fixed,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
but there are so many of them.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
So the analogy would be

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
that if you buy a million
lottery tickets,

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
the chance of hitting
the jackpot is pretty good,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
and that is the issue
we are addressing;

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
that is it true
that in a molecular world

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
"survival of the fittest"
does not apply;

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
it's "survival of the luckiest"?

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Recently the Smithsonian
Institutution in Washington D.C.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
added some new genes
to its collection.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
They include photographs
of DNA sequences

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000
believed to belong
to O.J. Simpson,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
taken during what was called

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
"the trial of the century"
in 1995.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
This genetic evidence
was very controversial

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
and helped get Simpson acquitted
of murder.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
It also drew
the nation's attention

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
to what was then a pretty new
forensic method-- DNA profiling.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
But let's back up a bit.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Forensics is the application
of science to legal problems

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
and there's nothing new
about that.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Let's turn to our
hitchhiker's guide to the genome

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
for a history lesson.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
( computer beeps )

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
COMPUTER:
In the early 1900s,
an Austrian professor discovers

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
that blood cells fall
into different groups.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
These groups are eventually
labeled as types A, B, AB and O.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
In 1917
William M. Marston invents

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
the first lie detector test,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
claiming he can detect
verbal deception

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
by measuring an increase
in systolic blood pressure.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Well, thank you
so very, very much.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
While we've been investigating
crimes for centuries,

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000
it's been less than 20 years

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
since genetics revolutionized
the criminal justice system.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
In 1984 British geneticist Alec
Jeffreys developed DNA profiling

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
and it's been shaking up

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
the process
of solving crimes ever since.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
SEVERSON:
Today Kirk Bloodsworth
is a free man,

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
making his living on his fishing
boat on the Chesapeake Bay.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
But only a few years ago,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Kirk was on the State
of Maryland's death row,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
waiting to be executed
for a crime he didn't commit.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
In the summer of 1984, a young
girl was raped and murdered

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
in Kirk's neighborhood.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Authorities were sure
Kirk had done it.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
He lived near the crime scene

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
and he looked like a police
sketch of the suspected killer.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
BLOODSWORTH:
Well, I didn't know
what to think.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
To tell you the truth,

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I was in utter shock and
disbelief by the whole thing.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
I really can't explain it
other than, you know,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
I knew that it was wrong and
they shouldn't be doing this.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000
But the problem with that was is
that nobody would listen to me.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
It was almost like
I was a nonparty to it,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000
although I was the one
that was the center of it all.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
SEVERSON:
Kirk was a former U.S. marine

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
who had never been
in serious trouble with the law,

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
but he was convicted of rape
and murder

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
and was sentenced to die
in the gas chamber.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
He was 23 years old.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000
BLOODSWORTH:
You're in your cell by yourself

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
and, uh, every day you wake up,
it's another day closer

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.000
that they're going to walk you
to the gas chamber

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.000
and, uh, to your last breath,
and you're waiting to die.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
I can't even begin
to articulate the anguish

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
that you endure during
that, uh, process.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
It's brutal on the... the soul.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
SEVERSON:
Kirk spent two years
on death row

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
before his sentence
was reduced to life in prison.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000
He kept hoping someone
would believe he was innocent.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
For nine years,
almost no one did,

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
until DNA profiling came along.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
( computer beeps )

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
COMPUTER:
About DNA profiling:

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:46.000
DNA-- deoxyribonucleic acid--
is the molecule responsible

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
for every person's
genetic makeup.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
It is composed
of four nucleotide bases,

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
arranged in a double helix
or spiral.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
DNA is in virtually every cell
in the human body.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
With the exception of identical
or monozygotic twins,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
no two people have the same DNA.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Since each person's DNA sequence
is unique,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
DNA evidence collected
from a crime scene

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
can link a suspect to a crime
or eliminate one from suspicion

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
in the same way
that fingerprints are used.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
This is called a DNA profile.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
SEVERSON:
In prison, Kirk read a book

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
about how DNA testing in England
had helped police find a killer.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000
He was sure it could help him,
too, in a different way.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I felt that if it
could prove somebody did it,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
it could also prove
that they didn't do it.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
SEVERSON:
When Kirk was sentenced
back in 1985,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
biological samples
weren't tested for DNA,

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
but by the early '90s, forensic
scientists could test for it--

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
even very small amounts.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
When a semen stain

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
on the murdered girl's clothing
was tested,

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
it came back negative
for Kirk's DNA.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
He was pardoned and became

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:02.000
the first death row inmate ever
to be freed by DNA evidence.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000
The re killer
is still out there,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
and all of this
won't be complete

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
until the real one
is behind bars.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
With the advent
of the DNA technology, uh,

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
it's revolutionized
forensic science

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
at least to the extent

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
that fingerprints did
a hundred years ago.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
It's... it's easily

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
one of the single most important
revolutions in forensic science

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.000
in the last two decades.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
SEVERSON:
Paul Ferrara

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
is director of Virginia's
Division of Forensic Sciences.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
He says DNA technology
has changed

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
almost every aspect
of law enforcement

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
from the crime scene
to the courtroom.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000
FERRARA:
They are changing the way
they look at potential evidence.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Anything that might contain

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
some biological, uh, remnant
of an individual

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
is being collected

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000
and it can be dental floss,
toothbrushes, um,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
hairbrushes, uh, you name it.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
If it's been in contact
with a perpetrator,

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
it's entirely possible
for us to develop a DNA profile.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Ten years ago
they wouldn't even conceive

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000
of collecting something
like that.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
SEVERSON:
Authorities now have stacks
of evidence to test.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
They look for hair,
saliva, blood or semen--

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
anything that might yield DNA.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Even microscopic quantities
are sufficient for testing.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
FERRARA:
In the early days
of DNA technology,

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
uh, you'd require a blood stain
the size of a quarter

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
to get a DNA profile.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:45.000
With the advent
of the new technologies today,

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
we're able to develop
a DNA profile

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
from material that can't
even be seen with the naked eye.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
SEVERSON:
The most common type
of DNA analysis today uses PCR,

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
which stands
for "polymerase chain reaction."

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
PCR allows investigators
to analyze evidence

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
that couldn't be tested before
because there wasn't enough DNA

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
or it was of poor quality.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
PCR copies the DNA
over and over again--

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
a kind of chemical Xeroxing.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
This amplification process
creates enough DNA

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
to generate a profile.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
But with small amounts of DNA,
a sample is easily contaminated.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000
That's when DNA from
an outside source gets mixed up

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
with the DNA being tested.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
It can happen
when someone sneezes on a sample

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
or handles it with bare hands.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Contamination of evidence
was one of the many charges made

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
by the O.J. Simpson
defense team.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000
But even if a sample
is contaminated,

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000
scientists say the original DNA
is still around.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:59.000
FERRARA:
There's nothing in DNA testing
that would allow an examiner

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.000
to mistakenly identify
one DNA profile

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
as belonging to someone else.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
If you contaminate a sample,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
you have just introduced
a second DNA profile

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000
on top of the original.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000
It doesn't change
the DNA profile.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
SEVERSON:
All lab workers in Virginia

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
have their own DNA profiles
on record.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
So if their DNA has contaminated
a sample, they can identify it.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
But how do you decide
whose DNA it is?

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Well, it turns out that while
we're nearly 100% the same,

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000
there are a few sections
of our genetic code

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
where we differ quite a bit.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:45.000
13 of those spots are typically
used to generate a DNA profile.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000
FERRARA:
In recent years,

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.000
all of the forensic science
community in the U.S.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
and most of the forensic
community around the world

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
use these same genetic markers.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.000
These portions of DNA are called
STRs, or short tandem repeats.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.000
They're portions of the DNA sort
of between the actual genes.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
SEVERSON:
The real investigative power
of DNA

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
is in cases
where there is no suspect.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000
This CODIS database
contains DNA profiles

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
from convicted criminals.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Authorities link unknown DNA
left at a crime scene

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
with the DNA in the database.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Sometimes they find
a perfect match--

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
what's called "a cold hit."

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
MAN:
We develop a DNA profile

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000
from the evidence in this case

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000
and then search the database
against convicted offenders,

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:40.000
and the computer search finds

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
that an individual
in the database

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
actually is completely matching
the profile from the evidence.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
And then we are able
to give the police a name

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
of an individual to go talk to,

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
to investigate further,
helping them solve the case

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
when they have no idea
where to look

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
or who committed a crime.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
SEVERSON:
And DNA, like justice, is blind.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
If you're guilty,
it's your worst enemy.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
If you're innocent,
it's your best friend.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
BLOODSWORTH:
I would say the DNA
was a magic wand for me.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
It's a magic wand
for any innocent man,

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
but it'll be your
damning thing if you did it

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
and, uh, that's what we need.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.000
And it's...
it's almost like, um,

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
some sort of superhero
type of element

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
that we have in society

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
and without it,
I would still be there.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
To be a free man,
a free, innocent person

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
and, uh, just to be
a regular guy

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.000
is, uh, more joy than
I could possibly put into words.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:54.000
*

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
