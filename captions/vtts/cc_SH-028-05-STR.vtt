00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.300


2
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.670
Now, sweet lord,

3
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.270
you know the goodness I intend upon you.

4
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.800
Tell me but truly but then speak the truth,

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.930
do you not love my sister?

6
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.400
In honored love.

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.470
But have you never found my brother's way

8
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.800
to the forfended place?

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.930
No, by mine honor, madam.

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.330
I never shall endure her.

11
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.470
Dear my lord, be not familiar with her.

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.600
Fear me not.

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.630
She and the duke, her husband

14
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.570
I had rather lose the battle

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
than that sister should loosen him and me.

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.670
Our very loving sister, well be-met.

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.670
Sir, this I heard: the king is come to his daughter,

18
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.470
with others whom the rigor of our state forced to cry out.

19
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.830
Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant, for

20
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.300
Why is this reasoned?

21
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.270
Combine together 'gainst the enemy,

22
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.670
for these domestic particulars are not the question here.

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.830
Let's then determine

24
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.100
with the ancient of war on our proceeding.

25
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.030
Sister, you'll go with us?

26
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.270
No.

27
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.900
'Tis most convenient; I pray you, go with us.

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.200
O, ho, I know the riddle.

29
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.670
I will go.

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.870
If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,

31
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.530
hear me one word.

32
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.600
I'll overtake you! Speak.

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.570
Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.

34
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.830
If you have victory,

35
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.230
let the trumpet sound for him that brought it.

36
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.800
Wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion

37
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.370
that will prove what is avouched there.

38
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.330
If you miscarry, your business of the world hath so an end,

39
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.500
and machination ceases.

40
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.730
Fortune love you.

41
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.100
Stay till I have read the letter.

42
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.530
I was forbid it.

43
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.400
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,

44
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.770
and I'll appear again.

45
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.900
Why, fare thee well.

46
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.170
I will o'erlook your paper.

47
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.400
The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.

48
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.600
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces

49
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.100
by diligent discovery.

50
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.900
But your haste is now urged on you.

51
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.030
We will greet the time.

52
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.270
To both these sisters have I sworn my love,

53
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.570
each jealous of the other as the stung are of the adder.

54
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.170
Which of them shall I take?

55
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.800
Both? One?

56
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.870
Or neither?

57
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.630
Neither can be enjoyed if both remain alive.

58
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.600
To take the widow exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril.

59
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.500
And hardly shall I carry out my side,

60
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.900
her husband being alive.

61
00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.400
Now, then, we'll use his countenance for the battle,

62
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.200
which, being done, let her who would be rid of him

63
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.200
devise his speedy taking off.

64
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.530
As for the mercy which he intends

65
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.670
to Lear and to Cordelia,

66
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.770
the battle done and they within our power

67
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.200
shall never see his pardon,

68
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.330
for my state stands on me to defend, not to debate.

69
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.370
Away, old man. Give me thy hand, away.

70
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.100
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.

71
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.900
Give me thy hand; come on.

72
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.500
No further, sir.

73
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.030
A man may rot even here.

74
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.700
What, in ill thoughts again?

75
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.870
Men must endure their going hence

76
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.870
even as their coming hither.

77
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.300
Ripeness is all.

78
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.830
Come on.

79
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.830
And that's true too.

80
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.400
Some officers, take them away.

81
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.570
Good guard until their greater pleasures

82
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.930
first be known that are to censure them.

83
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.230
We are not the first who, with best meaning,

84
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.070
have incurred the worst.

85
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.100
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down.

86
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.670
Myself could else outfrown false fortune's frown.

87
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.200
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

88
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.800
No, no, no, no!

89
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.830
Come, let's away to prison.

90
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.230
We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage.

91
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.400
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,

92
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.070
and ask of thee forgiveness.

93
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.270
So we'll live and pray and sing and tell old tales,

94
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.400
and laugh at gilded butterflies

95
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.200
and hear poor rogues talk of court news.

96
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.500
And we'll talk with them too, who loses and who wins,

97
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.270
who's in, who's out,

98
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.600
and take upon's the mystery of things,

99
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.330
as if we were God's spies.

100
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.530
And we'll wear out, in a walled prison,

101
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.530
packs and sects of the great ones that ebb and flow by the moon.

102
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.030
Take them away.

103
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.900
Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,

104
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.570
the gods themselves throw incense.

105
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.570
Have I caught thee?

106
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.730
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven

107
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.100
and fire us hence like foxes.

108
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.430
Wipe thine eyes.

109
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.830
The good-years shall devour them,

110
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.570
flesh and fell, ere they shall make us weep.

111
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.270
We'll see 'em starve first.

112
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.770
Come.

113
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.770
Come hither, Captain. Hark.

114
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.130
Take thou this note.

115
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.130
Go follow them to prison.

116
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.100
One step, I have advanced thee.

117
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.670
If thou dost as this instructs thee,

118
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.230
thou dost make thy way to noble fortunes.

119
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.800
Know thou this: that men are as the time is.

120
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.100
To be tender-minded does not become a sword.

121
00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.500
Thy great employment will not bear question.

122
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.570
Either say thou'lt do 't, or thrive by other means.

123
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.800
I'll do it, my lord.

124
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.600
About it, and write happy when thou hast done.

125
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.830
Mark, I say, instantly,

126
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.800
and carry it so as I have set it down.

127
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.170
I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats.

128
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.070
If it be man's work, I'll do it.

129
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.400
Sir, you have shown today your valiant strain,

130
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.970
and fortune led you well.

131
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.630
You have the captives

132
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.400
who were the opposites of this day's strife.

133
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.970
I do require them of you, so to use them

134
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.630
as we shall find their merits and our safety

135
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.070
may equally determine.

136
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.630
Sir, I thought it fit to send the old and miserable king

137
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.230
to some retention and appointed guard,

138
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.870
whose age had charms in it, whose title more,

139
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.800
to pluck the common bosom on his side

140
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.100
an turn our impressed lances in our eyes

141
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.430
which do command them.

142
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.030
With him I sent the queen, my reason all the same.

143
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.330
And they are ready tomorrow, or at further space,

144
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.670
to appear where you shall hold your session.

145
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.570
Sir, by your patience, I hold you

146
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.470
but a subject of this war, not as a brother.

147
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.300
That's as we list to grace him.

148
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.770
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,

149
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.430
'ere you spoke so far.

150
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.830
He hath led our powers,

151
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.100
bore the commission of my place and person,

152
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.600
the which immediacy may well stand up

153
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.270
and call itself your brother.

154
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.400
Not so hot.

155
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.400
In his own grace, he doth exalt himself

156
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.070
more than in your addition.

157
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.100
In my rights, by me invested, he compeers the best.

158
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.830
That were the most if he should husband you.

159
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.200
Jesters do oft prove prophets.

160
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.530
Holla, holla!

161
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.330
That eye that told you so looked but a-squint.

162
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.600
Lady, I am not well,

163
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.370
else't I should answer from a full-flowing stomach.

164
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.770
General, take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.

165
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.700
Dispose of them, of me.

166
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.230
The walls is thine.

167
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.430
Witness the world

168
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.270
that I create thee here my lord and master.

169
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.430
Mean you to enjoy him?

170
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.300
The let-alone lies not in your good will.

171
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.870
Nor in thine, lord.

172
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.970
Half-blooded fellow, yes.

173
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.930
Let the drum strike and prove my title thine.

174
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.500
Stay yet; hear reason.

175
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.470
Edmund, I arrest thee on capital treason

176
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.770
and, in thy attaint, this gilded serpent.

177
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.270
For your claim, fair sister,

178
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.130
I bar it in the interest of my wife.

179
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.070
'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,

180
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.270
and I, her husband, contradict your bans.

181
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.830
If you would marry, make your love to me;

182
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.900
my lady is bespoke.

183
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.270
An interlude!

184
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.400
Thou art armed, Gloucester.

185
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.470
Let the trumpet sound.

186
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.670
If none appear to prove upon thy person

187
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.170
thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,

188
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.100
there is my pledge:

189
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.170
I'll make it on thy heart 'ere I taste bread,

190
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.300
thou art in nothing less than I have here proclaimed thee.

191
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.200
Sick, O, sick!

192
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.430
If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

193
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.100
There's my exchange.

194
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.770
What in the world he is that names me traitor,

195
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.600
villain-like, he lies.

196
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.170
Call by thy trumpet.

197
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.370
He that dares approach on him, on you, who not

198
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.030
I will maintain my truth and honor firmly.

199
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.830
A herald, ho!

200
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.170
Trust to thy single virtue,

201
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.930
for thy soldiers, all levied in my name,

202
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:06.370
have, in my name, took their discharge.

203
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.070
My sickness grows upon me.

204
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:14.200
She is not well; convey her to my tent.

205
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.630
Come hither, herald.

206
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.330
Let the trumpet sound, and read out this.

207
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:39.970
"If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army

208
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.400
"will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester,

209
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.500
"that he is a manifold traitor,

210
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.970
"let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet.

211
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.830
He is bold in his defense."

212
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.030
Sound!

213
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.870
Again!

214
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.270
Again!

215
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.670
Ask him his purposes

216
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.400
and why he appears upon this call o' the trumpet.

217
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.470
What are you:

218
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.070
your name, your quality,

219
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:35.330
and why you answer this present summons?

220
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.730
Know, my name is lost,

221
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.530
by treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.

222
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:47.170
Yet am I noble as the adversary I come to cope.

223
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.600
Which is that adversary?

224
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.500
What's he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of Gloucester?

225
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.400
Himself. What say'st thou to him?

226
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.370
Draw thy sword that, if my speech offend a noble heart,

227
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.070
thy arm may do thee justice.

228
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.070
Here is mine.

229
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.870
Behold, it is the privilege

230
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.100
of mine honors, my oath, and my profession.

231
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:22.600
I protest, maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence

232
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.030
despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,

233
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.970
thy valor and thy heart, thou art a traitor,

234
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.700
false to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;

235
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.170
conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;

236
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.500
and, from the extremist upward of thy head

237
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.670
to the descent and dust below thy foot,

238
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.400
a most toad-spotted traitor.

239
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.870
Say thou "no,"

240
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.130
this sword, this arm, and my best spirits

241
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.930
are bent to prove upon thy heart,

242
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.730
whereto I speak, thou liest.

243
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.670
In wisdom, I should ask thy name.

244
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.230
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike

245
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.830
and that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,

246
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.500
what safe and nicely I might well delay

247
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.700
by rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.

248
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.630
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head

249
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.470
with the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;

250
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.330
which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,

251
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.130
this sword of mine shall give them instant way,

252
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.630
where they shall rest forever.

253
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.470
Trumpets, speak.

254
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.300
Save him. Save him!

255
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.100
This is practice, Gloucester.

256
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.800
By the laws of war, thou wast not bound

257
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.370
to answer an unknown opposite.

258
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.930
Thou art not vanquished but cozened and beguiled.

259
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.230
Shut your mouth, dame.

260
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.030
Or with this paper shall I stop it.

261
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.370
Hold, sir.

262
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.730
Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.

263
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.470
No tearing, lady.

264
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.770
I perceive you know it.

265
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.170
Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine.

266
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:44.370
Who can arraign me for it?

267
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.430
Most monstrous.

268
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.330
Oh, know'st thou this paper?

269
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.600
Ask me not what I know.

270
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.100
Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.

271
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.030
What you have charged me with, that have I done,

272
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.700
and more, much more.

273
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.500
The time will bring it out.

274
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.700
'Tis past, and so am I.

275
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.400
But what art thou that hast this fortune on me?

276
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.300
If thou art noble, I do forgive thee.

277
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:20.830
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund.

278
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.530
If more, the more thou hast wronged me.

279
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:30.900
My name is Edgar and thy father's son.

280
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.330
The gods are just

281
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.630
and, of our pleasant vices, make instruments to plague us.

282
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.330
The dark and vicious place where thee he got

283
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.970
cost him his eyes.

284
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.700
Thou hast spoken right; 'tis true.

285
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.370
The wheel is come full circle.

286
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.900
I am here.

287
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.500
Methought thy very gait did prophesy a royal nobleness.

288
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.730
I must embrace thee.

289
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.470
Let sorrow split my heart

290
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.100
if ever I did hate thee or thy father.

291
00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.330
Worthy prince, I know it.

292
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:56.730
Where have you hid yourself?

293
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.530
How have you known the miseries of your father?

294
00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.370
By nursing them, my lord.

295
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.900
List a brief tale, and when 'tis told,

296
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.170
O, that my heart would burst.

297
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:10.430
The bloody proclamation to escape

298
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.370
that followed me so near

299
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.770
O, our lives' sweetness.

300
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.370
That we the pain of death hourly would die

301
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.270
rather than die at once

302
00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:23.370
led me to move into a madman's rags,

303
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.230
to assume a semblance that very dogs disdained.

304
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.600
And in this habit met I my father

305
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.600
with his bleeding rings their precious stones new lost.

306
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.570
Became his guide, led him, begged for him,

307
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:38.370
saved him from despair.

308
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.600
Never fault! revealed myself unto him

309
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.230
until some half-hour past, when I was armed.

310
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.870
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,

311
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:55.730
I asked his blessing and told him all my pilgrimage.

312
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.200
But his flawed heart, alack,

313
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.170
too weak the conflict to support,

314
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:13.030
'twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, burst smilingly.

315
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.530
Help, help, oh, help!

316
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.270
What kind of help? Speak, man.

317
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.470
What means this bloody knife?

318
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.470
'Tis hot; it smokes.

319
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.270
It came even from the heart of

320
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.800
she's dead!

321
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.730
Who dead? Speak, man.

322
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.630
Your lady, sir, your lady.

323
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.030
And her sister by her is poisoned.

324
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.370
She confesses it.

325
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.870
I was contracted to them both.

326
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.370
All three now marry in an instant.

327
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.730
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.

328
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.430
This judgment of the heavens, which makes us tremble,

329
00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.970
touches us not with pity.

330
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.300
Here comes Kent.

331
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.300
Oh, is this he?

332
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.170
The time will not allow the compliment

333
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.700
which very manners urges.

334
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.770
I am come to bid my king and master aye good night.

335
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.200
Is he not here?

336
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.000
Great thing of us forgot.

337
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.570
Speak, Edmund. Where's the king?

338
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.730
And where's Cordelia?

339
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.730
Yet Edmund was beloved.

340
00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.630
The one, the other poisoned for my sake

341
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.830
and after slew herself.

342
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.570
I pant for life.

343
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.930
Some good I mean to do, despite of mine own nature.

344
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.730
Quickly send be brief in it to the castle,

345
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.670
for my writ is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.

346
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.100
Nay, send in time.

347
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.500
To who, my lord? Who has the office?

348
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.770
Send thy token of reprieve.

349
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.830
Well thought on.

350
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.370
Take my sword; give it the captain.

351
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.830
Haste thee, for thy life.

352
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.130
He hath commission from thy wife and me

353
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.100
to hang Cordelia in the prison

354
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.870
and to lay the blame upon her own despair,

355
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.270
that she fordid herself.

356
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.400
The gods defend her.

357
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.870
Bear him hence awhile.

358
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.030
Howl!

359
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.200
Howl, howl!

360
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.830
Howl!

361
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.430
O, you are men of stones!

362
00:17:55.430 --> 00:18:02.470
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so

363
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.230
that heaven's vault should crack!

364
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.970
She's gone forever.

365
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:17.430
I know when one is dead and when one lives.

366
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.530
She's dead as earth.

367
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.900
Lend me a looking-glass.

368
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.100
If that her breath should mist or stain the stone,

369
00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.330
why, then she lives.

370
00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:29.330
Is this the promised end?

371
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.970
Or image of that horror?

372
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.030
Fall, and cease.

373
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.630
This feather stirs; she lives!

374
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.870
If it be so, it is a chance

375
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.000
which does redeem all sorrows that ever I have felt.

376
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.270
O my good master!

377
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.900
Prithee, away.

378
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.270
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

379
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.970
A plague upon you murderers, traitors all!

380
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.470
I might have saved her.

381
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.770
Now she's gone forever.

382
00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:00.070
Cordelia, Cordelia.

383
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.770
Stay a little.

384
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.230
Ha!

385
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.070
What is't thou say'st?

386
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.100
Her voice was ever soft, gentle, and low,

387
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.700
an excellent thing in woman.

388
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.370
I killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.

389
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.770
'Tis true, my lords, he did.

390
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.100
Did I not, fellow?

391
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.530
I have known the day,

392
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.730
with my good biting falchion, I'd have made them skip.

393
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.130
I am old now,

394
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:33.430
and these same crosses spoil me.

395
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:35.270
Who are you?

396
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.830
Mine eyes are not o' the best; I'll tell you straight.

397
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.170
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,

398
00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.230
one of them, we behold.

399
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.570
This is a dull sight.

400
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:44.630
Are you not Kent?

401
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.730
The same, your servant Kent.

402
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.230
Where is your servant Caius?

403
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.470
He's a good fellow.

404
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.470
He'll strike, and quickly too.

405
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.330
He's dead and rotten.

406
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:58.100
No, my good lord; I am the very man.

407
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.400
I'll see that straight.

408
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.530
That, from your first of difference and decay,

409
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:02.900
have followed your sad steps.

410
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.930
You are welcome hither.

411
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.530
Nor no man else.

412
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.270
All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.

413
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.630
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves

414
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.630
and desperately are dead.

415
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.600
Aye, so I think.

416
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.470
He knows not what he says.

417
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.000
And vain is it that we present us to him.

418
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.900
Very bootless.

419
00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.800
Edmund is dead, my lord.

420
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.730
That's but a trifle here.

421
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.730
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.

422
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:33.130
What comfort to this great decay may come shall be applied.

423
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.730
For us we will resign,

424
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.570
during the life of this old majesty,

425
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.500
to him our absolute power you, to your rights

426
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.030
with boot and such addition

427
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.170
as your honors have more than merited.

428
00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.500
All friends shall taste the wages of their virtue

429
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.930
and all foes the cup of their deservings.

430
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.570
O, see, see.

431
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.200
My poor fool is hanged.

432
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.070
No.

433
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.670
No, no life.

434
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:12.630
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life

435
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.370
and thou no breath at all?

436
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.300
Thou'lt come no more

437
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.770
never,

438
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:30.370
never, never,

439
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.170
never!

440
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:36.000
Pray you, undo this button.

441
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.570
Thank you, sir.

442
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.270
Do you see this?

443
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.770
Look on her, look, her lips.

444
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.030
Look there! Look there!

445
00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.070
He faints!

446
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.230
My lord, my lord!

447
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.600
Break, heart; I prithee, break!

448
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.900
Look up, my lord.

449
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.470
Vex not his ghost.

450
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.800
O, let him pass.

451
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.430
He hates him that would upon the rack

452
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.570
of this tough world stretch him out longer.

453
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.470
He is gone, indeed.

454
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:09.400
The wonder is he hath endured so long.

455
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.170
He but usurped his life.

456
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.500
Bear them from hence.

457
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.100
Our present business is general woe.

458
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.570
Friends of my soul, you twain rule in this realm

459
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.330
and the gored state sustain.

460
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.630
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.

461
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:35.170
My master calls me; I must not say no.

462
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:41.900
The weight of this sad time, we must obey.

463
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:46.930
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.

464
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.970
The oldest hath borne most.

465
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.300
We that are young

466
00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:02.530
shall never see so much, nor live so long.

467
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.200
