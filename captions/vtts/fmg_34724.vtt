00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:47.000
*

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
*

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
THE OCEAN IS
 DYNAMIC, IT'S MOVING...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
OVER 70% OF THE
 SURFACE OF THE PLANET

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
IS COVERED WITH
 THESE OCEANS...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
YOU HAVE THE
 ATLANTIC OCEAN,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
YOU HAVE THE
 PACIFIC OCEAN...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
WE HAVE SURFACE CURRENTS
 AND THEN THERE ARE

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
VERY DEEP CURRENTS...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
THE OCEAN HAS PLAYED
 A REALLY BIG ROLE

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
IN THE CLIMATE
 OF THE EARTH...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
THE OCEAN IS
 TRULY AMAZING.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
LAKES, RIVERS,
OCEANS AND SEAS;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
THE EARTH IS COVERED
WITH 70% WATER

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
AND IS OFTEN CALLED
"THE WATER PLANET",

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
A VITAL ELEMENT
TO LIFE ON EARTH.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
EARTH IS THE ONLY TERRESTRIAL
PLANET THAT WE KNOW OF

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
THAT HAS LIQUID WATER
IN GREAT ABUNDANCE.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
AND IT'S A RESULT
OF THESE VAST OCEANS

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
THAT WE BELIEVE
MADE LIFE POSSIBLE.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
WITHOUT WATER, AT LEAST,
MODERN BIOLOGISTS

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE
WOULD EVEN BE HERE.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
SO, OCEANS AND WATER ON
THIS PLANET EQUAL LIFE.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
WHERE DID THE VAST AMOUNTS
OF WATER ON EARTH COME FROM?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
SOME SCIENTISTS THINK IT
MAY BE FROM ICY COMETS

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
THAT DELIVERED
WATER TO EARTH.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
BUT THE MOST ACCEPTED
THEORY IS THAT THE WATER

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
CAME FROM VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS
AS THE EARTH WAS COOLING.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
OVER GEOLOGIC TIME, MOST
OF THE OCEANS THAT WE SEE

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
ARE THE RESULT OF
VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
SO, VOLCANOES PRODUCE
A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
WATER VAPOR, THEY'RE
DE-GASSING FROM THE CENTER

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
OF THE EARTH OR THE
INTERIOR OF THE EARTH.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
THE OCEANS HAVE CHANGED
THROUGHOUT GEOLOGIC TIME

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
AS THE CONTINENTS HAVE
MOVED ABOUT THE PLANET.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
BUT TODAY WE RECOGNIZE
FOUR MAJOR REGIONS:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
THE INDIAN OCEAN

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
THE ARCTIC OCEAN

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AND THEN THERE IS THE
LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
FEATURE ON THE
PLANET, COVERING OVER

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
HALF THE OCEAN
SURFACE AREA -

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
HOWEVER, SOME SCIENTISTS
CONSIDER THE WATERS AROUND

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
ANTARCTICA TO BE A
SEPARATE FIFTH REGION,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
CALLED THE
"SOUTHERN OCEAN".

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
AND WHILE THESE OCEANS
ARE DISTINCT IN SOME WAYS,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
THEY ARE REALLY ONE GLOBAL
OCEAN AND CONNECTED TO

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
EACH OTHER AND WITH
OTHER BODIES OF WATER

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
THROUGH THE WATER CYCLE.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
THE WATER ON EARTH IS
ESSENTIALLY CONSTANTLY

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
BEING RECYCLED.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
YOU'VE GOT WATER
EVAPORATING FROM THE OCEANS

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
AND CURRENTLY A LOT FROM
THE DIFFERENT ICE CAPS.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THE
WATER TURNING FROM ICE

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
TO WATER THAT GETS UP INTO
THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT'S

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
MOVED AROUND, IT FORMS
CLOUDS AND WE GET RAIN.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
WHILE LAKES AND OTHER
FRESHWATER BASINS

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
CATCH SOME OF THE RAIN,
MOST OF THE WATER

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
FLOWS BACK TO THE
OCEANS AND SEAS,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
ACCOUNTING FOR 97% OF THE
EARTH'S WATER - SALTWATER,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
AND THESE VAST
BODIES OF WATER

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
CONTAIN RICH AND
VARIED RESOURCES.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
THE OCEAN IS SO IMPORTANT
IN THAT IT PROVIDES FOOD,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
IT CONTROLS CLIMATE,
ITS DEEPER THAN

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
OUR HIGHEST MOUNTAIN
IS HIGH AND

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
IT'S GOT SOME OF THE
TALLEST MOUNTAINS.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
IT'S GOT INCREDIBLE
TOPOGRAPHY AND DIVERSITY,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
AND WE REALLY
DON'T KNOW

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
A WHOLE LOT OF
WHAT'S DOWN THERE.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
THERE'S SO MANY
THINGS TO DISCOVER.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
OCEANOGRAPHY AND
THE MARINE SCIENCES

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
STRIVE TO KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE DEEP OCEANS.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THEY
STUDY THE MANY RESOURCES

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
INCLUDING MARINE LIFE.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
THEY LOOK AT WAVES,
CURRENTS AND TIDES;

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
THEY STUDY THE EFFECT
OCEANS HAVE ON CLIMATE;

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
AND THEY INVESTIGATE THE
GEOLOGY OF THE OCEAN FLOOR.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
THE OCEAN FLOOR CAN
BE HIDDEN FROM VIEW,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
BUT MODERN EXPLORATION
HAS REVEALED

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
A VERY INTERESTING
LANDSCAPE DEEP BELOW.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
THE OCEAN FLOOR IS
LIKE THE SURFACE,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
EXCEPT THAT IT'S
UNDER WATER.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
MANY SCIENTISTS FOR A
LONG TIME THOUGHT THE

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
OCEAN BASINS WERE FLAT
FEATURELESS THINGS THAT

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
HAD MILLIONS OF YEARS
OF ACCUMULATED SEDIMENT

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
THAT WOULD RECORD,
VERY CONVENIENTLY,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
EARTH'S EARLY BEGINNINGS
TO THE PRESENT DAY.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
BUT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT
THE OCEAN BOTTOMS ARE

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
EXTREMELY VARIED IN THEIR
TOPOGRAPHY AND FEATURES

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
AND REVEAL ACTUALLY
THE SECRETS BEHIND

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
PLATE TECTONICS.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
THE EARTH IS MADE UP OF
CONTINENTAL AND OCEANIC

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
CRUSTS AND THE OCEANIC
CRUST OCCURS IN THE OCEANS.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
CONTINENTAL MARGINS ARE
WHERE CONTINENTAL CRUST

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
MEETS THE OCEAN FLOOR,
OR OCEANIC CRUST,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
AND THEY ARE DIVIDED
INTO SUBSECTIONS:

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
THE CONTINENTAL SHELF

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
THE CONTINENTAL SLOPE

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AND THE CONTINENTAL RISE.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
WHEN WE LOOK AT
CONTINENTS WE OFTEN

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
SEE THE MAP EDGE
OF A CONTINENT.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
THAT IS, THE EDGE OF THE
LAND WHERE THE WATER BEGINS.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE
THE CONTINENT STOPS.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
IF WE LOOK AT THE EDGE OF
THE CONTINENT IT ACTUALLY

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
EXTENDS WELL BEYOND THE
SHORELINE INTO RELATIVELY

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
DEEP OCEAN - MAYBE A
COUPLE HUNDRED METERS -

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
SOMETHING CALLED THE
"CONTINENTAL SHELF".

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THAT'S STILL
CONTINENTAL MATERIAL.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
IT WILL THEN DROP OFF INTO
CONTINENTAL SLOPE -

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
A VERY STEEP
SECTION WHICH IS

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
REALLY SOMETHING THAT
MARKS THE TRANSITION

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
FROM CONTINENTAL CRUST
TO OCEANIC CRUST.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
AND THEN WE HAVE
SOMETHING CALLED THE

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
"CONTINENTAL RISE"
WHICH IS TYPICALLY

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
A FAN OF SEDIMENT
THAT'S PRODUCED

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
AT THE BASE OF
THE CONTINENTAL SLOPE

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
AND THIS CONTINENTAL MARGIN
IS GREATLY INFLUENCED

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
BY THE PLATE TECTONIC
ACTIVITY THAT'S GOING ON.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF
CONTINENTAL MARGINS

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
BASED ON PLATE TECTONICS
INVOLVING THE INTERACTION

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
BETWEEN THE PLATES
OF OUR EARTH:

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
INACTIVE, OR PASSIVE,
AND ACTIVE MARGINS.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
INACTIVE CONTINENTAL
MARGINS ARE ASSOCIATED

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
WITH DIVERGENT PLATE
BOUNDARIES WHERE

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
TWO PLATES ARE MOVING
AWAY FROM EACH OTHER,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
ALLOWING MAGMA TO RISE
FROM DEEP IN THE EARTH

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
CREATING NEW CRUST,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AND THIS AFFECTS THE
SHAPE OF THE MARGIN.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
FOR EXAMPLE, THE EAST
COAST OF NORTH AMERICA

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
ALONG FLORIDA
HAS A VERY BROAD,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
GENTLY SLOPING
CONTINENTAL SHELF

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
AND A VERY DISTINCT
SLOPE AND RISE.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
ACTIVE CONTINENTAL MARGINS
ARE WHERE PLATES COLLIDE

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
AND CRUST IS SUCKED
BACK INTO THE EARTH.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE'RE ON
WHAT'S CALLED AN ACTIVE

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
CONTINENTAL MARGIN,
THAT'S ONE THAT HAS

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
ACTIVE CONVERGENCE
AND SUBDUCTION,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
WE'LL HAVE A VERY
SHORT AND ABBREVIATED

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
CONTINENTAL MARGIN WITH A
VERY DEEP OCEANIC TRENCH.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
TRENCHES MARK AREAS
OF SUBDUCTION.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
BEYOND THE CONTINENTAL
MARGINS YOU GET INTO THE

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
DEEP OCEANS AND A PLACE WE
CALL THE "ABYSSAL PLAIN".

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
THE ABYSSAL PLAIN IS A
VERY FLAT, IN SOME CASES

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
FEATURELESS ABYSS, IF YOU
WILL, OF THE OCEAN BOTTOM.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
AS WE MOVE ACROSS
THE ABYSSAL PLAIN

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
WE EVENTUALLY RUN
INTO ONE OF THE MOST

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
MAGNIFICENT FEATURES
ON THE PLANET,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
AND THAT IS THE
MID-OCEAN RIDGE SYSTEMS.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
AND THIS MARKS REALLY THE
CENTER OF THE OCEAN BASIN.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
MID-OCEAN RIDGES WHERE
TWO OCEANIC PLATES

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
ARE COMING APART HAVE
INCREDIBLE TOPOGRAPHY.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THEY'RE GENERALLY ABOUT
TWO KILOMETERS WIDE

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
AND THEY'RE ALSO ABOUT
TWO KILOMETERS HIGH.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
THEY'RE LIKE
MOUNTAIN RANGES.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
THESE PATTERNS OF THE
OCEAN FLOOR REPEAT

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
UNTIL WE MEET
THE NEXT COAST.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
AND THERE ARE MANY
KINDS OF COASTS

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
AND THEY CHANGE
OVER TIME.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS
WHY COASTS LOOK THE WAY

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THEY DO AS A FUNCTION
OF WHAT KINDS OF RIVERS

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
ARE DEPOSITING WHAT KINDS
OF MATERIAL ALONG THE COAST;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THE ORIENTATION
OF THE COASTLINE

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
RELATIVE TO
WAVE SYSTEMS;

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
WHETHER OR NOT THE COAST
IS TECTONICALLY ACTIVE

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
AND MOVING UP.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
ALL OF THESE THINGS, OF
COURSE, ARE IMPORTANT

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
TO FACTOR IN WHEN YOU'RE
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
A PARTICULAR COAST.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I WOULD SAY THE MAIN
CONTROLLING FACTOR

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
OF WHAT A COASTLINE
WILL END UP LOOKING LIKE

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
IS THE ROCKS AROUND
IT, YOU KNOW?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THE INPUT OF SEDIMENT

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
IS COMING FROM.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
SO, A LOT OF SANDY
BEACHES, YOU KNOW,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
YOU HAVE A LOT
OF ROCK NEARBY

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO
BREAK DOWN AND TO ERODE

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
AND JUST DUMP
IN THE OCEAN.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE
REALLY ROCKY BEACHES

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
ARE WHERE THE ROCK IS A
LITTLE HARDER TO BREAK DOWN.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
AND, OF COURSE, WHERE
THERE'S CLIFFS, YOU KNOW,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
THAT ROCK'S JUST NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, RIGHT?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE
A LOT OF SAND IN THOSE AREAS.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
THE COASTS, THE BASINS,
PLATE TECTONICS,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
ALL AFFECT THE
IMPORTANT WAVES, TIDES,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
AND CURRENTS OF
OUR DYNAMIC OCEANS.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
ONE OF THE WAYS WE SEE
THE POWER OF THE OCEAN

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
IS IN WAVES.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
WE SEE WAVES CRASHING ON THE
BEACH AND THE QUESTION IS...

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
AND THESE WAVES
DON'T GO AWAY,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY
HAPPENING.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
WELL, AS WIND BLOWS ACROSS
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
THE SPEED OF THE WIND,
THE DURATION THAT

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
THE WIND BLOWS,
AND THE DISTANCE

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
OVER WHICH THE WIND
BLOWS OVER THE WATER

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
HAS A GREAT INFLUENCE
ON HOW THAT WATER MOVES.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
IT'LL CREATE SWELLS WITHIN
THE WATER AND THOSE SWELLS

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
REPRESENT ENERGY
THAT'S BEING IMPARTED

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
TO THE WATER
FROM THE WIND.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
THE WAVE DOES NOT
MOVE WATER FORWARD;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
RATHER, IT MOVES THE
ENERGY AS IT PROGRESSES.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
THE EASIEST WAY TO
THINK OF THAT IS

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A
FIELD OF GRAIN OR WHEAT

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
THAT'S BLOWING
IN THE WIND.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
YOU SEE WHAT APPEAR TO
BE WAVES MOVING THROUGH

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
THAT WHEAT FIELD.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
THE PLANTS DON'T MOVE, BUT
THE WIND'S IMPARTING ENERGY

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
TO THOSE PLANTS AND THEN
MOVING BACK AND FORTH.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
WELL, WIND BLOWING ON THE
SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
OR THE SURFACE OF A WATER
BODY DOES THE SAME THING -

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
IT IMPARTS ENERGY TO THAT
WATER BUT DOESN'T REALLY

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
MOVE THE WATER
FORWARD ANY.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
THE ENERGY MOVES
THOUGH THE WATER.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
THE SURFACE, IN
FACT, DOESN'T MOVE.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
RATHER, IT RISES UP AND
GRAVITY PULLS THE WAVE

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
BACK DOWN INTO
THE OCEAN.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
WAVES ARE GENERATED AS A
RESULT IN THE AREA WHERE

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
WIND AND WATER INTERACT
AND, BECAUSE THE SURFACE

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
DOESN'T MOVE, IT RISES UNTIL
IT COLLAPSES ON A SHORE.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
WELL, AS THAT ENERGY
APPROACHES SHALLOWER

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
AND SHALLOWER WATER,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
THAT WATER BEGINS TO
PILE UP ON ITSELF.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED
"FEELING BOTTOM"

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
AND THAT IS
WHEN THE MOTION,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
THE ENERGY THAT'S
MAKING THE WATER MOVE

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
ACTUALLY BEGINS TO FEEL THE
BOTTOM OF THE SHORELINE.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
AND WHAT HAPPENS THEN
IS THAT THE BOTTOM WATER

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN, BUT
THE TOP WATER STILL HAS

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
A LOT OF ENERGY MOVING
AT THE SAME SPEED.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
THAT WATER WILL PILE UP,
FORMING A WAVE WHICH WILL

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
EVENTUALLY BECOME UNSTABLE
AND COLLAPSE OR BREAK.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
THERE ARE OTHER
CAUSES OF WAVES,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
BUT ONE OF THE MOST
DEVASTATING CAN BE

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
UNDERWATER EARTHQUAKES
WHICH CAN CAUSE TSUNAMIS.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
A TSUNAMI IS GENERATED
WHEN YOU HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
ALONG A PLATE BOUNDARY
THAT IS UNDERWATER.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
SO, IN THE CASE OF THE
BIG TSUNAMI GENERATED BY

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
THE SUMATRAN EARTHQUAKE,
WHAT HAPPENED WAS

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A
CONVERGENT PLATE BOUNDARY

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
WHERE ONE PLATE
IS GRINDING DOWN

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
UNDERNEATH
ANOTHER ONE.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
AND WHEN THAT
EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
THE UPPERMOST PLATE
MOVED VERY QUICKLY UP.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
AND, SO, ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE PUSHING ROCK

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
UP INTO AN AREA THAT
WAS OCCUPIED BY WATER

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
AND YOU CREATE
A GIANT WAVE.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
AND, SO, AS YOU MOVE ALL
THAT VOLUME OF WATER,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IT'S JUST LIKE SLAPPING
YOUR HAND AGAINST

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THE SIDE OF A BATHTUB.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
THE WATER HAS TO GO
SOMEWHERE AND IT

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
GENERATES WAVES THAT
SLOSH BACK AND FORTH

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
ACROSS THE OCEAN BASIN.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
THE HIGHEST PART OF THE
WAVE IS CALLED THE CREST.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
THE LOWEST PART OF THE
WAVE IS CALLED THE TROUGH.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
WAVES CAN BE DESCRIBED
BY THEIR HEIGHT, LENGTH,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
AND WAVE PERIOD.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
THE WAVE HEIGHT IS
THE VERTICAL DISTANCE

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
FROM THE CREST
TO THE TROUGH.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
THE WAVE LENGTH IS THE
HORIZONTAL DISTANCE

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
BETWEEN THE
CREST OF ONE WAVE

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
AND THE CREST OF THE
SUCCESSIVE WAVE.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
THE WAVE PERIOD IS
THE TIME IT TAKES

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
FOR TWO SUCCESSIVE WAVES
TO PASS A FIXED POINT.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
AND THE WAVE VELOCITY IS THE
SPEED THE WAVES ARE MOVING.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
TIDES ARE A RESULT OF
THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
OF THE MOON
AND THE SUN.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
BUT BECAUSE THE SUN IS ABOUT
400 TIMES FURTHER AWAY,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
THE MOON IS THE
DOMINANT INFLUENCE.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
SO, THE TIDES ARE CAUSED
BASICALLY BY THE INFLUENCE

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
OF THE MOON AND ITS
GRAVITATIONAL PULL.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
AT TIMES WHEN THE MOON
IS A LITTLE BIT CLOSER

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
TO THE EARTH, THE GRAVITY'S
A LITTLE STRONGER,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
THE MOON LITERALLY
SUCKS THE WATER

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
TO ONE DIRECTION
OF THE EARTH.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
WHEN THE SUN AND THE
MOON ARE ALIGNED,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
THEIR COMBINED FORCES
PRODUCE LARGER TIDAL BULGES

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
CALLED "SPRING TIDES".

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
HOWEVER, THEY ARE NOT
RELATED TO THE SEASONS.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
THEY ACTUALLY OCCUR
TWICE A MONTH,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
DURING THE FULL
AND NEW MOONS.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
"NEAP TIDES" ALSO
OCCUR TWICE A MONTH

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
DURING QUARTER MOONS
WHEN THE MOON AND SUN

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
ARE PERPENDICULAR
TO EACH OTHER

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
IN RESPECT TO
THE EARTH.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
NEAP TIDES ARE
ESPECIALLY WEAK TIDES.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
TIDAL PATTERNS HAPPEN
ON A DAILY BASIS

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AND THERE ARE
THREE MAIN TYPES:

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
DIURNAL TIDES ARE
WHEN THERE IS

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
ONE "HIGH" TIDE AND ONE
"LOW" TIDE EVERY DAY.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
SEMI-DIURNAL TIDES
ARE WHEN THERE ARE

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
TWO HIGH AND TWO
LOW TIDES PER DAY.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
MIXED TIDES INVOLVE
TWO HIGH WATER

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
AND TWO LOW WATER
TIDES PER DAY;

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
HOWEVER, THE TWO HIGH
TIDES AS WELL AS

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
THE TWO LOW TIDES ARE
OF UNEQUAL HEIGHT.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
WHILE WAVES AND
TIDES MIX THE WATER,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
CURRENTS ARE THE WAY
OCEAN WATERS MOVE.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
THE OCEAN IS DYNAMIC;
IT'S MOVING AT ALL LEVELS.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
WE HAVE SURFACE CURRENTS
AND THEN THERE ARE

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
VERY DEEP CURRENTS.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
CURRENTS ARE DRIVEN BY
SUCH FACTORS AS HEATING

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
AND COOLING OF THE WATERS,
THE AMOUNT OF SALT,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
AND WIND, WHICH ARE EFFECTS
OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
THE CURRENTS OF THE OCEANS
ARE DIRECTLY DRIVEN

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
BY THE MOTIONS OF THE
EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
AND THE MOTIONS IN THE
EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE ARE

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
DIRECTLY TIED TO THE
SUN AND HOW THE SUN

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
DIFFERENTIALLY HEATS
THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
THE SUN WILL HEAT THE
SURFACE MORE AND THEN

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
IT STARTS PENETRATING
THE DEEP OCEANS WHICH ARE

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
VERY COLD COMPARED TO
THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
THE OCEAN IS LAYERED,
WARMER ON TOP;

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
COLDER AND MORE
DENSE WATER IS BELOW.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
ON THE SURFACE, CURRENTS ARE
DRIVEN MAINLY BY THE WIND

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
BUT OTHER FORCES SUCH AS
THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
AND LAND MASSES ALSO
AFFECT THE PATTERNS.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
YOUR SURFACE CURRENT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
WILL BE MORE OR LESS FROM
WEST TOWARDS THE EAST,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
EXCEPT THAT YOU WILL
ENCOUNTER EUROPE

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
SO THERE WILL HAVE TO
BE A RETURN CURRENT.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
YOU HAVE CIRCULATING GYRES
IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
AND THE SOUTH ATLANTIC
AND THE NORTH PACIFIC

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
BECAUSE OF THE
EARTH'S ROTATION,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
HUGE CIRCULAR
SURFACE GYRES

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
ROTATE CLOCKWISE IN
THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
AND COUNTER-CLOCKWISE IN
THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
BELOW THE SURFACE THERE
ARE OTHER KINDS OF CURRENTS

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
- DEEP OCEAN CURRENTS
WHICH AFFECT ABOUT

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
80% TO 90%
OF THE OCEAN.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
MOST OF THE CURRENTS ARE
THESE DEEP OCEAN CURRENTS

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
AND THEY FORM BY
DIFFERENCES IN SALINITY

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
AND TEMPERATURE.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
THESE DIFFERENCES IN
SALINITY AND TEMPERATURE

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
AS WELL AS WATER PRESSURE
DETERMINE THE DENSITY

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
OF OCEAN WATER.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
THESE DENSER COLDER WATERS
- THE DEEP OCEAN CURRENTS -

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
GENERALLY TRAVEL AT
A MUCH SLOWER SPEED

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
WHEN COMPARED
TO SURFACE FLOWS.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
AND ALL THESE CURRENTS
INFLUENCE WEATHER PATTERNS

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
AND CYCLES, BOTH LOCALLY
AND AROUND THE WORLD.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
ONE EXAMPLE IS EL NINO.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
EL NINO REFERS TO A PERIOD OF
TIME WHEN OCEAN TEMPERATURES

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
ALONG THE EQUATOR IN
THE EASTERN PACIFIC

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
BECOME WARMER THAN
THEY NORMALLY ARE.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
THAT HAPPENS RIGHT ALONG THE
COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA AND

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
FISHERMEN HAVE KNOWN ABOUT
THIS THERE FOR MANY YEARS.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
EL NINO IS ACTUALLY REALLY
GOOD FOR FISHERMEN

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
IN SOUTH AMERICA BECAUSE
WHERE THERE'S WARM WATER

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
THERE'S A LOT OF
NUTRIENTS AND THAT MEANS

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
THAT THERE'S A
LOT MORE FISH.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
SO EL NINO'S GOOD FOR
FISHERMEN IN SOUTH AMERICA

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THEM
WITH A LARGER CATCH OF FISH.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
IT'S NOT SO GOOD FOR
PLACES LIKE CALIFORNIA

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
AND OTHER PLACES ON THE
WEST COAST OF AMERICA

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
BECAUSE IT TENDS TO
CAUSE A LOT OF STORMS.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
BUT WE NOW RECOGNIZE
THAT THAT COASTAL WARMING

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AFFECTS WHERE STORMS TRAVEL
ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
THE WARM TEMPERATURES
OF EL NINO ARE PART OF A

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
LARGER CYCLE, PAIRED WITH
A COOLING OF THE WATERS

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
CALLED "LA NINA".

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
IT'S THE COLD PHASE THAT
WE NOW CALL "LA NINA"

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
WHICH IS A RECENT
CONSTRUCTION.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
IT JUST MEANS THE
OPPOSITE OF EL NINO.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AND IT, INDEED, HAS MANY
OF THE OPPOSITE CLIMATIC

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
EFFECTS IN FAR-FLUNG
PLACES THAT EL NINO HAS.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
LIKE EL NINO, LA NINA ONLY
HAPPENS EVERY FEW YEARS

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
AND ONLY LASTS A FEW
MONTHS, BUT IT CAN HAVE

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
LONG-REACHING EFFECTS ON
THE CLIMATES OF THE EARTH,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
EFFECTS WHICH
ULTIMATELY SHED LIGHT

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
ON THE IMPORTANT
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
OCEAN TEMPERATURES
AND CLIMATE.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
THE OCEANS ARE VAST AND
DEEP, AND FILLED WITH

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
RICHES AND MYSTERY.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
BUT DESPITE THEIR HUGE
SIZE, THE OCEANS HAVE BEEN

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
GREATLY AFFECTED
BY HUMAN ACTIVITY.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
POLLUTION, OVER FISHING,
AND RISING TEMPERATURES

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
LINKED TO INCREASED CO2
EMISSIONS ARE SOME OF

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
THE MAJOR CONCERNS.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
AS THE EARTH GETS WARMER,
MUCH OF THE POLAR ICE

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
IS MELTING, CHANGING
THE TEMPERATURE

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
AND LEVEL OF THE OCEAN,
DISRUPTING CIRCULATION

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AND, ULTIMATELY, ALTERING
THE GLOBAL CLIMATE.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
IF YOU WANT TO STUDY
CLIMATE, YOU NEED TO KNOW

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
A LOT ABOUT
THE OCEANS.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
IF YOU WANT TO STUDY MANY
ISSUES IN BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
AND CHEMISTRY, YOU NEED TO
KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE OCEANS.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
EVEN IF YOU WANT TO DO
PROBLEMS WITH URBAN PLANNING

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
- LOTS OF URBAN CITIES
ARE PLACED AROUND

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OCEANS AND COASTS.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
IT'S A DISCIPLINE
THAT IS EXPANDING.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
OCEANOGRAPHY
INVOLVES MANY FIELDS

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
AND HAS MADE
MANY DISCOVERIES.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
HOWEVER, THERE IS
MUCH MORE TO LEARN.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
IRONICALLY, I BELIEVE WE
PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
THE MOON AND ABOUT OUR OWN
SOLAR SYSTEM THAN WE DO

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
ABOUT OUR OWN OCEANS AND
WHAT RESIDES AT THE BOTTOM

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
OF THE OCEANS.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
OCEANOGRAPHY IS
LEARNING MORE EVERY DAY

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
BUT THERE'S STILL VAST
REGIONS OF OUR PLANET,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
NAMELY OUR DEEP OCEANS,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
THAT WE KNOW VIRTUALLY
NOTHING ABOUT.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
BY EXPLORING THESE
REGIONS OF THE DEEP

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
WE MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OCEANS

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANT
INTERDEPENDENCIES

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
BETWEEN LIFE,
THE OCEANS,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
AND THE ATMOSPHERE
OF OUR PLANET EARTH.
