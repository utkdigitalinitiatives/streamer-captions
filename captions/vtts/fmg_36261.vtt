WEBVTT

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD HE MIGHT

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
DO TO YOU?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
THAT HE'D TAKE ME OUT IN THE

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
DESERT AND KILL ME.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Announcer: THURSDAY NIGHT,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
MARCH 2, 2006.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
IT'S TIME FOR "PRIMETIME."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
YOU'RE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
SIR.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED THE

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
FIRST TIMEÑi WE VISITED COLORADO

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
CITY.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
WE WERE STOPPED BY THE

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
POLYGAMIST-RUN POLICE.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
DO YOU MIND PUTTING THE

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
CAMERA DOWN?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.000
PLEASE.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
WE'LL LEAVE.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT THE

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
CAMERA --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
THEN LAST SUMMER WE RETURNED

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
WITH THIS WOMAN.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
IT'S LIKE COMING INTO A

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
NIGHTMARE, ANOTHER LIFE.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
IT'S LAURENE JESSOP'S FIRST

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
TRIP HOME SINCE ESCAPING THIS

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
ISOLATED AND FOR BIDDEN WORLD 18

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
MONTHS EARLIER.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
IT JUST LOOKS DESOLATE.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.000
EXPECT.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
YOU NERVOUS, LAURENE?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'M NERVOUS.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.000
WHY?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
WALK THROUGH TOWN AND NOT BE

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
HANDCUFFED, AND IF THE POLICE

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
OFFICERS DECIDE TO HANDCUFF ME,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
WHAT'S TO SAY THEY CAN'T NOW ANY

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
MORE THAN THEY DID BEFORE?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
SHE NEEDS TO PROVE TO HERSELF

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
THAT THE POLYGAMIST SECT THAT

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
RUNS THIS TOWN NO LONGER HAS

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
POWER OVER HER.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
PLEASE GO AWAY.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
EVERYONE HERE IS TAUGHT FROM

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
A VERY YOUNG AGE THAT OUTSIDERS

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.000
ARE EVIL.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
THEY RUN FROM OUR CAMERAS.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
THEY WEAR OLD-FASHIONED CLOTHES.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
AND THEY FERVENTLY SUBMIT TO THE

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
RULES OF A MAN THEY CALL THE

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
PROPHET, WARREN JEFFS.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
CAN YOU TELL US WHERE TO FIND

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
WARREN JEFFS?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.000
JUST GO TO HELL.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
JEFFS, A LEADER OF THE

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
FUNDAMENTALIST CHURCH OF LATTER

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
DAY SAINTS, IS IN HIDING, WANTED

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
GIRLS TO MARRY OLDER MEN.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
THE FIRST STOP IN LAURENE'S

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
NERVOUS HOMECOMING IS THE HOUSE

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
WHERE SHE WAS RAISED, BUT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
SOMEONE ELSE LIVES HERE NOW.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
HI.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A MOTHER QUICKLY USHERED HER

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
BROOD INTO THE HOUSE AND DRAWS

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
THE BLINDS.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
GIVES ME THE CHILLS.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
HOW BIG WAS YOUR FAMILY?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
MY DAD HAD 56 CHILDREN.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
HOW MANY WIVES?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
FOUR WIVES.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
IT WAS AN OPPRESSIVE

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
CHILDHOOD WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
COMPLETELY SHUT OUT.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
THIS LITTLE PEEK RIGHT HERE

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
OF THE HOUSE WAS MY BEDROOM AS A

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.000
TEENAGER.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
THAT WINDOW RIGHT THERE?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
UH-HUH.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I REMEMBER ONE TIME LOOKING OUT

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
THE WINDOW JUST FEELING LIKE I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
WAS TRAPPED AND WISHING THAT I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
WAS FREE.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
A YEAR LATER, AT 19, SHE'S

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
MARRIED TO VAL JESSOP, AN OLDER

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
MAN CHOSEN BY THE SECT.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
MY SISTER WAS MARRIED TO HIM,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
AND SO I KNEW HIM A LITTLE BIT.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
HOW COULD YOU MARRY A MAN YOU

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
REALLY DON'T KNOW AND HE HAPPENS

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
TO BE MARRIED TO YOUR SISTER?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
WELL, I ALWAYS FELT LIKE I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.000
WAS AN INTRUDER.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
THE PICTURE OF A POLYGAMIST

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
MARRIAGE, THE PROUD HUSBAND, VAL

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
JESSOP, WITH HIS WIVES, TWO

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.000
SISTERS.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
THE FORMER MARIE AND LAURENE

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
COOK.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
THEY HA

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
LAURENE SAYS MARIE IS BITTERLY

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
JEALOUS FROM DAY ONE, BEGINNING

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
WHEN VAL AND LAURENE CONSUMMATE

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
THEIR MARRIAGE.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
WHEN HE HAD SEX WITH YOU, SHE

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.000
WAS THERE?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
YES.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
HE INVITED HER TO OUR BED.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
SHE JUST HUGGED HIS BACK, HUGGED

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
HIM ALL NIGHT THROUGH.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
IT WAS VERY STRANGE.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AND PAINFUL.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
PAINFUL.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
AND I WAS VERY SHY.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I WAS SCARED.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I DIDN'T DARE SAY, LIKE I SHOULD

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
HAVE, THIS IS OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
WE SHOULD GO TO A MOTEL OR WE

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
SHOULD HAVE OUR OWN PRIVACY.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
WHEN LAURENE FINALLY SPEAKS

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
UP ABOUT HER SISTER WIFE, VAL

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
JESSOP CALLS THE SECT POLICE WHO

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
FORCIBLY REMOVE HER FROM HER

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
HOME, ALL BECAUSE, SHE SAYS, SHE

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
DID NOT FOLLOW THE LAW THAT SAYS

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
PLURAL WIVES MUST OBEY THEIR

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.000
HUSBANDS.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
IN COLORADO CITY, THE RULES OF

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
THE SECT ARE ALSO THE LAW OF THE

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.000
LAND.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
THESE ARE STATE CERTIFIED

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
POLICEMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ORDERED

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
BY THE PROPHET OR AN ELDER OR

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
SOMEBODY TO COME IN THERE AND

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.000
ARREST ME.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
WERE YOU HANDCUFFED?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
YES, I WAS HANDCUFFED, PUT IN

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
THE POLICE VEHICLE, TAKEN TO THE

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
INSTITUTION.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
FOUR TIMES, THE POLICE TAKE

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
HER TO A MENTAL INSTITUTION IN

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
FLAGSTAFF, MORE THAN 200 MILES

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
AWAY FROM HER CHILDREN.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
MY HUSBAND HAD GONE TO THEM

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
AND I WAS IN REBELLION TO MY

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.000
HUSBAND.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I WAS TAUGHT THAT THE ONLY

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
RIGHTS A WOMAN HAS IS TO BE

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
OBEDIENT TO HER HUSBAND.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
IT'S THE PREVALENT ATTITUDE

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
CAPTURED IN THE SLOW BEGAN YOU

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
HEAR THROUGHOUT THIS COMMUNITY.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
KEEP SWEET.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
THAT MEANS DON'T SHOW ANY

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
EMOTION, DON'T ROCK THE BOAT,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
DON'T MAKE ANY TROUBLE.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
LAURENE IS DESPERATE TO

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
ESCAPE, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE NO

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
WAY TO TAKE HER CHILDREN WITH

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
HER UNTIL SHE MEETS

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
ANTI-POLYGAMIST ACTIVIST FLORA

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
JESSOP.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
LET'S GO PICK THE KIDS UP.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.000
THEY'RE WAITING FOR US.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
HAVING ESCAPED HERSELF AS A

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
TEENAGER, FLORA NOW RESCUES

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.000
OTHERS.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
WHEN WE FIRST MEET HER, SHE'S ON

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
A SECRET MISSION TO HELP TWO

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
TEENAGE GIRLS ESCAPE UNDER THE

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
COVER OF NIGHT.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
IT'S WITH FLORA'S HELP THAT

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
LAURENE FINALLY RUNS, FAR AWAY

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
TO PHOENIX, WHERE SHE FINDS A

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
SAFE HOME AND WINS CUSTODY OF

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
HER THREE DAUGHTERS, LUANNE,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
JENNIFER AND VALENE, AND SONS

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
ANTHONY AND THOMAS.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
IT'S NOT ONLY THE FEAR OF

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.000
LEAVING.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
IT'S THE FEAR OF HOW DO I TAKE

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
CARE OF MY CHILDREN ONCE I'M OUT

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.000
THERE.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
SO HER LEAVING MAKES HER --

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
A HERO.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
IT MAKES HER A MOTHER.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
LAURENE'S RETURN TO COLORADO

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
CITY ALSO MAKES HER A SURVIVOR.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
WHERE ONCE SHE WOULD COWER

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
BEFORE THE POLICE, DAY SHE

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
STANDS HER GROUND WHEN WE'RE

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
CHALLENGED BY A COP.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
DO YOU KNOW LAURENE?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
DO YOU REMEMBER HER?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
YES, I KNOW LAURENE.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
HANDCUFFED AND TAKEN AWAY FROM

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
HERE?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
INSTITUTIONALIZED, HANDCUFFED

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
BY POLICE OFFICERS.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I DON'T REMEMBER.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
YOU HAVE A SHORT MEMORY.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
WAS I THERE?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.000
YOU WERE INVOLVED, AND YOUR

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
FATHER.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
INSIDE?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I FEEL EMPOWERED.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I FEEL LIKE I COULD STAND THERE

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
AND LOOK AT THAT MAN IN THE

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.000
EYES.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
BUT HER JOURNEY HAS ONLY JUST

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.000
BEGUN.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
LAURENE CANNOT LEAVE THIS PLACE

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
FOR GOOD UNTIL SHE FACES THE

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
DEEPEST SECRETS OF HER LIFE.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
AND AS YOU'LL SEE, THERE ARE

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
OTHER PEOPLE SHE HAS TO LOOK

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
STRAIGHT IN THE EYES BEFORE SHE

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
CAN MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
THAT'S WHY IN AN ALL NEW CHAPTER

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
JUST AHEAD, NO ONE WILL BE

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
PREPARED FOR THE LATEST TWIST IN

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.000
HER STORY.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
NEITHER WILL YOU, AS WE RE-ENTER

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
THE WORLD WE'VE BEEN CHRONICLING

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
FOR OVER TWO YE

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Announcer: "PRIMETIME"

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:40.000
CONTINUES WITH JOHN QUIÑONES.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
THEY'RE COMPLETELY CUT OFF

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
THEY WEAR THE CLOTHES OF ANOTHER

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
CENTURY.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
YOUNG GIRLS IN COLORADO CITY

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
GROW UP KNOWING THEIR FATE,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
DESTINED TO BE MARRIED OFF IN

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
THEIR TEEN YEARS TO OLDER MEN,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
EXPECTED TO BEAR MANY CHILDREN

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
AND OBEY THE STRICT RULES OF

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
THEIR POLYGAMIST SECT.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
THE MEN IN THIS COMMUNITY TRULY

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
WIELD ALL THE POWER.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
OVER THEIR WIVES.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
OVER THEIR DAUGHTERS.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
OVER ALL THEIR CHILDREN.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
FOR LAURENE JESSOP, AN EVEN

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
DARKER, MUCH SCARIER FORM OF

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
INDOCTRINATION BEGINS BEFORE SHE

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
GETS MARRIED, WHEN SHE'S A YOUNG

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.000
GIRL.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
THE SEXUAL ABUSE STARTED

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
HAPPENING WHEN I WAS DEVELOPING.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.000
BY WHOM?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
MY DAD.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
THERE WOULD BE SEVERAL OF US

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
GIRLS IN THE ROOM, AND HE WOULD

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
KISS EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS, PUT

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
HIS HAND DOWN YOUR BLOUSE, SAY,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
OH, LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GETTING

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
BIGGER, YOU'RE DEVELOPING,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
YOU'RE COMING ALONG VERY WELL

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.000
HERE.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
HE WOULD GRAB YOUR BREASTS?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
YES.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
LAURENE AND 12 OF HER SISTERS

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
REPORTED BEING MOLESTED, THOUGH

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
THE ABUSE STOPPED SHORT OF

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.000
ACTUAL INTERCOURSE.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
AND IN 1983, JACK COOKE PLEADED

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
GUILTY TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
WENT TO PRISON FOR FIVE YEARS.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
HE TOOK MY VIRTUE, AND I

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
THINK HE SHOULD HAVE GOT MORE

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
THAN FIVE YEARS IN PRISON.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
WITH HER FATHER IN PRISON,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
THE SECT REASSIGNS LAURENE'S

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
FAMILY TO HER UNCLE.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
THAT'S MY MOM.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
WHEN MY DAD WENT TO PRISON, MY

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
FOUR MOMS MARRIED THIS MAN, DICK

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
COOKE.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:21.000
AS SHE WALKS TOWARD HER

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
HOUSE, HER UNCLE AND HER MOM

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
APPROACH SLOWLY, WARILY.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
HI.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
WANT TO SAY HI TO ME?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
HOW ARE YOU?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
HI, I'M GOOD.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
GOODNESS, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.000
BACK OFF?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
YOU GUYS, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
JUST GO.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
IT'S A CHILLY REUNION, BUT

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
LAURENE PUSHES ON.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
YOU DIDN'T STAND UP FOR ME

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
WHEN THEY PUT ME IN THE

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.000
INSTITUTION.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
YOU KNEW THE TRUTH.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I HAVE NO ARGUMENT WITH YOU.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
SHE SAYS HER HUSBAND HAD HER

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
COMMITTED AND ARRESTED.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
DO YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR A

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
HUSBAND TO DO THAT TO A WIFE?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I THINK I AM THROUGH WITH

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
THIS CONVERSATION.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
THANK YOU.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
SHE SAYS SHE WAS ABUSED AS A

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
LITTLE GIRL.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
EVA COOKE HAS HAD ENOUGH OF OUR

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.000
QUESTIONS.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
SHE RETREATS TO THE HOUSE

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
UNFAZED, LAURENE CONTINUES TO

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
CONFRONT HER UNCLE.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I WANT SOME STRAIGHT ANSWERS.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
YOU HAVE AS MANY AS I HAVE.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
WHY THIS WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
IN THIS COMMUNITY AND WHY --

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
WHICH?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
THE WAY WOMEN ARE TREATED.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
HE STONEWALLS HER QUESTIONS

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
AND MINE.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
MR. COOKE, HOW MANY WIVES DO

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.000
YOU HAVE?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
DO YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.000
WIFE?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
SOON AFTER WE ARRIVE, DICK

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
COOKE CALLS IN A COMPLAINT.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
WE'RE NOT PESTERERS.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THE POLYGAMIST RUN POLICE

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
FAIL TO SHOW UP, A SIGN THAT THE

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
GRIP ON COLORADO CITY MAY BE

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
BEGINNING TO LOOSEN.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
ONE REASON THE LOCAL POLICE MAY

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
BE LOSING THEIR GRIP IS THIS

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
MAN, AN OUTSIDER SENT IN BY THE

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
COUNTY ATTORNEY TO DO A JOB THE

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
LOCAL POLICE WILL NOT DO.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
CLEAN UP COLORADO CITY.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'M SIMPLY HERE TO

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
INVESTIGATE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
AND WHEN YOU'RE LEGALLY MARRIED

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
AND YOU'RE SPIRITUALLY MARRIED

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
TO A SECOND WIFE --

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
OR THIRD OR FOURTH.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
OR THIRD OR FOURTH WHO IS

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
UNDER THE AGE OF 18, IT'S

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
AGAINST THE LAW.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
ENGELS GOT EIGHT MEN TO

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
SURRENDER AND FACE SEX ABUSE

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
ALLEGATIONS THAT THEY MARRIED

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
UNDERAGE GIRLS, CHARGES TO WHICH

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
THEY PLEADED NOT GUILTY.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
WHERE IS WARREN JEFFS?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
WELL, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
RIGHT NOW.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
HE TRAVELS WITH BODYGUARDS, AND

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I'M SURE THEY'RE PROBABLY ARMED,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
AND WHAT THEIR DIRECTIVE IS AND

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
HOW THEY'LL PROTECT HIM, WE

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.000
DON'T KNOW.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
JEFFS IS BELIEVED TO HAVE

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
FLED HIS WALLED COMPOUND IN THE

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
CENTER OF TOWN.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
AT THE GATE, WE DON'T EVEN GET A

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
CHANCE TO ASK.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
YOU BACK OFF.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
BACK OFF!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE HIS

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
FOLLOWERS WILL DO ANYTHING,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
INCLUDING KILL OR DIE, FOR THEIR

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.000
PROPHET.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I LOVE HIM WITH ALL MY MIND,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
WITH ALL MY HEART, WITH ALL MY

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.000
SOUL.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
IF HE'S LOCKED UP AND JAILED

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.000
AND ARRESTED.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I TELL YOU THIS, HE'S NOT AND

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
HE NEVER WILL BE.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO CATCH

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
HIM.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
THEY WON'T FIND HIM.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.000
YOU HAVEN'T.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
THEY WON'T.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I WOULDN'T TELL YOU IF I KNEW.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
COLORADO CITY, A TOWN, ITS

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
LEADER, A CULTURE UNDER AN

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.000
UNWELCOMED SPOTLIGHT.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
MANY WOMEN, IF THEY KNEW A

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
DIFFERENCE, THEY WOULD WANT TO

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
BE OUT OF THERE.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I'VE SEEN THEM STRUGGLE WITH

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.000
POLYGAMY.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I'VE SEEN THEM STRUGGLE WITH

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
THEIR HUSBAND COMING HOME WITH A

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
NEW WIFE.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I'VE SEEN THE NEW WIFE STRUGGLE

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
TO TRY TO FIT INTO THE FAMILY,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
FIND A PLACE, NO PLACE FOR HER

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
BECAUSE IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
TURF.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
LAURENE JESSOP AND HER

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
CHILDREN BEGIN A NEW LIFE IN

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
PHOENIX, 400 MILES AWAY FROM HER

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
HISTORY OF ABUSE AND POLYGAMY,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
INSIDE THE EXTREMIST SECT OF

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
COLORADO CITY, ARIZONA.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
AFTER A LONG COURT BATTLE,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
SHE WON FULL CUSTODY OF HER FIVE

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
CHILDREN.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
SO THIS IS YOUR HOME.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
YES, SIR.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
MEANWHILE, LAURENE'S

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
ESTRANGED HUSBAND, VAL, LIVES

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
ALONE IN AN EMPTYOUSE ON THE

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
EDGE OF COLORADO CITY.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
FOR REASONS HE WON'T DISCUSS,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THE SECT EXCOMMUNICATED HIM AND

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
TOOK AWAY HIS OTHER WIFE.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
BUT MOST OF ALL, HE MISSES HIS

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
CHILDREN.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
YOU WANT THEM BACK.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
AND I WANT THEM BACK.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.000
PAINFUL?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
PAINFUL.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.000
EXTREMELY PAINFUL.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
IN AWARDING CUSTODY OF THE

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
CHILDREN TO LAURENE, AN ARIZONA

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
JUDGE CONCLUDED THEIR COLORADO

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
CITY ENVIRONMENT WAS DOMINATED

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
BY ABUSE.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
ARE YOU A POLYGAMIST?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
NO, I'M A SINGLE MAN, ALL BY

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
MYSELF IN A BIG HOUSE WAITING

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
FOR MY CHILDREN TO COME HOME.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
HOW MANY WIVES?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
TWO.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
THEY'RE SISTERS.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.000
THAT'S POLYGAMY.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
NO, IT'S PLURAL MARRIAGE.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
YOU STILL BELIEVE IN PLURAL

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.000
MARRIAGE?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I WAS BORN MORMON, OKAY?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
IT'S IN MY BLOOD.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GOING TO GO BE

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I'M WHO I AM.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
VAL JESSOP ADMITS HE WASN'T A

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
PERFECT HUSBAND AND THAT THINGS

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
GOT OFF TO A ROCKY START WHEN

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
LAURENE BECAME HIS JUNIOR WIFE.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
SHE TALKED ABOUT THE NIGHT YOU

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
CONSUMMATED YOUR MARRIAGE.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
WAS ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
THERE'S A LOT OF STORIES,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I'LL TELL YOU.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I WOULD SAY ABOUT 2:00 OR

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
3:00 IN THE MORNING, MARIE CAME

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
AND SAID CAN I BE WITH YOU?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IT WASN'T RIGHT.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
I WAS TOO SOFT-HEARTED TO SAY GO

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
BACK TO YOUR BEDROOM.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
DON'T BOTHER US.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
HOW DO YOU GET AN EDUCATION

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
WITHOUT EXPERIENCE?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
HE SAYS HE RAISED HIS

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
CHILDREN ACCORDING TO HIS

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:02.000
BELIEFS.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
HE DENIES ASKING THE POLICE TO

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
ARREST LAURENE FOR DISOBEYING

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
HIM.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
HE CLAIMS SHE WAS MENTALLY ILL

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
AND VIOLENT AND THAT HE IS THE

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
TRUE VICTIM FOR LOSING HIS

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
CHILDREN.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
HE QUESTIONS THE AUTHORITY OF

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
MAN-MADE LAWS AND THE COURT IN

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.000
PHOENIX.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
BUT A JUDGE IN PHOENIX HAS RULED

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.000
THAT --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
A JUDGE IN PHOENIX HAS NO

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
JURISDICTION.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I'M SORRY?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL BULL CRAP.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
SUDDENLY, WE'RE INTERRUPTED

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
BY THAT WOMAN WE MET EARLIER WHO

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
SEEMS ALMOST DELIRIOUS IN HER

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
PASSION TO DEFEND HER BELIEFS

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
AND HER PROPHET.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I'VE DEFENDED WARREN JEFFS ALL

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
THE WAY.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
BECAUSE IF HE LOSES THIS WAR,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
YOU LOSE, TOO.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
IF YOU CAN COME INTO A MAN'S

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
HOME AND TAKE AWAY HIS LAND

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
BECAUSE THE WAY HE WORSHIPS AND

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.000
TEACHES IN HIS CHURCH --

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
THE ISSUE IS NOT RELIGION.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
IT'S THE PLURAL MARRIAGES.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000
NO, IT AIN'T.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
THAT'S BULL [ BEEP ].

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
THAT'S [ BEEP ].

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
WE DISCOVER THIS ANGRY WOMAN

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
IS RUTH COOKE, ONE OF LAURENE'S

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
55 SIBLINGS.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I HAVE A RIGHT TO WORSHIP ANY

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
DAMN THING I WANT AND WEAR ANY

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
CLOTHES I WANT
 AND I'M TIRED OF

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000
HEARING HOW STUPID WE ARE.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
MY FATHER WAS A FILTHY CHILD

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.000
MOLESTER.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
HOW MANY OF YOUR DAUGHTERS DO

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
YOU ADMIT THAT YOU TOUCHED

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
INAPPROPRIATELY?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
JACK COOKE IS NOW 76.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
IT'S BEEN 22 YEARS SINCE HE LAST

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
SAW LAURENE.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
BUT AS HE TALKS, HE KNOWS SHE'S

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
IN A NEARBY ROOM LISTENING TO

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.000
HIS EVERY WORD.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I'VE COMMITTED FONDLING AND

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
TOUCHING MY DAUGHTERS IMPROPERLY

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
IMPROPERLY, BUT I CLAIM THAT

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
THEY'RE ON THE SAME PREMISE,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
THEY DEPEND ON OUR RELIGION.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
HOW COULD ANYONE'S GOD

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
SANCTION SEXUAL ABUSE OF YOUR

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
OWN DAUGHTER?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ABUSE.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I DIDN'T VIEW IT AS ABUSE.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.000
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
NO.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
IT WAS NOT A SEXUAL, SEXUAL

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
DEAL.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.000
BULL CRAP.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I BELIEVED THAT THOSE CHILDREN

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
WERE MINE.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
I OWNED THEM.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
YOU KNEW WE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I DID NOT THINK IF I SAW MY

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
DAUGHTERS' BODY OR WHATEVER THAT

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
I THOUGHT OF IT MORE AS NO BIG

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.000
DEAL.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
YOU LOOK AT ANIMALS --

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
NO, IT'S NO BIG DEAL TO YOU,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
YOU [ BEEP ].

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
IT WASN'T ANY BIG DEAL WITH

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.000
ME.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
LIKE FARM ANIMALS.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
FARM ANIMALS.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO FARM

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
ANIMALS.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
LAURENE SITS THERE STUNNED BY

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
HIS ARROGANCE.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
EVERY INTIMACY I HAD WITH

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
THEM, THEY UNDERSTOOD PERFECTLY

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
THAT IF I DID ANYTHING THEY

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
DIDN'T LIKE, TO TELL ME AND I

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
WOULD NOT DO IT.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
YOU TOLD US WE WEREN'T NORMAL

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
IF WE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
AND THAT ALL THE MEN DO THAT TO

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
THEIR DAUGHTERS.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I SAID IT WAS CONSENSUAL,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
WHATEVER WE WERE DOING.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I WAS NOT IMPOSING ON THEM.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
AFTER HEARING HER FATHER'S

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
STORY, HIS VAGUE MEMORY AND HIS

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
EXCUSES, LAURENE DECIDES IT'S

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
TIME TO CONFRONT HIM.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
HI.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
LET ME FEAST MY EYES ON YOU,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
YOU BEAUTIFUL LADY.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
HIS GREETING SEEMS HIGHLY

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.000
INAPPROPRIATE.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
SHE IGNORES IT AND KEEPS HER

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
DISTANCE.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.000
YOU.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.000
YOU DO?

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
OKAY.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
YEAH.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
SITTING DOWN, SHE NERVOUSLY

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
REFERS TO SOME NOTES THAT SHE

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
WROTE IN PREPARATION FOR THIS

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.000
MOMENT.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
CAN YOU TELL ME IN YOUR OWN

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
WORDS WHAT YOU DID TO ME

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
SEXUALLY?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE ONE OF

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
THOSE FEW THAT I DON'T REMEMBER

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
HARDLY TOUCHING AT ALL.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
YOU DID TO ME.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.000
OKAY.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
YOU MASTURBATED ME MANY

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
TIMES.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I DID?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
AGAINST MY WILL.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.000
NO.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
YES.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU WERE

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
DOING THE FIRST TIME.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I WON'T CALL YOU A LIAR.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I WAS VERY TENDER AGE.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I REMEMBER EVERY SMELL.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING, EVERY

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
DETAIL OF IT.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I'M IN SHOCK, BECAUSE --

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
I'M TELLING YOU --

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
IF I DID THINGS WITH YOU AND

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
CAN'T REMEMBER, THEN I MUST HAVE

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
DONE THINGS WITH OTHER GIRLS

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER EITHER.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
WE WEREN'T SAFE AT HOME.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
WE WEREN'T SAFE AT SCHOOL.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
IF I WAS WALKING DOWN THE HALL,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
YOU'D -- COME HERE, TAKE US INTO

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
THE LITTLE MAINTENANCE ROOM.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
WE WEREN'T SAFE ANYWHERE.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
AND WHAT, KISS YOU?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
AND --

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
SEE, THAT'S --

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
FEEL ME OUT.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
TOUCH ME ON MY BREASTS AND MY

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
PRIVATE PARTS.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
ALL I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW, WITH

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
THESE THINGS HAPPENING TO YOU,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M SORRY.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
LAURENE SAYS SHE WILL FORGIVE

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
HIM, BUT SHE CAN NEVER FORGET

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
HER LOST CHILDHOOD AND ALL THE

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
OTHER DAMAGE CAUSED BY POLYGAMY.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
A YEAR AGO I COULDN'T LOOK AT

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
THE PICTURES.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
I PUT THEM ALL IN A BOX UP IN

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.000
THE CLOSET.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I LOOKED AT THEM THE OTHER DAY,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
AND, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT'S A

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
DIFFERENT LIFE.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
IT'S A DIFFERENT PART OF ME.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
IT'S STRANGE TO THINK THAT I

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
ACTUALLY LIVED LIKE THAT NOW.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
IT'S ONLY A YEAR LATER.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
LAURENE'S JOURNEY INTO THE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
DARKNESS OF HER PAST IS AS LONG

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
AND LONELY AS THE HIGHWAY OUT OF

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
COLORADO CITY, AND IT'S ABOUT TO

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:52.000
TA.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWO YEARS

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
SINCE LAURENE JESSOP ESCAPED THE

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
HARSH LIFE OF MORMON POLYGAMY IN

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
COLORADO CITY, ARIZONA, AND SIX

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
MONTHS AFTER THIS SCENE,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
CONFRONTING HER FATHER ABOUT A

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
CHILDHOOD OF SEXUAL ABUSE.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
YOU DID TO ME.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
OKAY.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
AND NOW LAURENE SURPRISINGLY

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
IS READY TO FORGIVE.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
WITH HIM, TALKED SEVERAL

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
DIFFERENT TIMES TO HIM.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
I FEEL COMPLETE FORGIVENESS

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
TOWARD HIM.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
SHE NOW BELIEVES THAT IN

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
COLORADO CITY, SEXUAL ABUSE OF

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
CHILDREN WAS ACCEPTED AND

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
RAMPANT AND THAT HER FATHER WAS

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
MADE A SCAPEGOAT BY THE

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
POLYGAMIST SECT.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I WAS OBEYING THE RELIGION BY

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
WHAT I THOUGHT WERE MY RIGHTS.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
REALLY HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.000
HE DID.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
AND OTHER MEN WERE DOING THE

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
SAME THING, BUT WHAT IT DID WAS

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
SHUT THE WOMEN UP, THE GIRLS UP

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
FROM TELLING, AND I THINK -- I

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
THINK HE'S PAID THE PRICE FOR

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
WHAT HE DID.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
LAURENE JESSOP HAS COME A

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
LONG WAY, BUT WHEN WE MET LAST

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
SUMMER, SHE ALSO ADMITTED TO A

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
FRIGHTENING INNER CONFLICT AND A

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
STRANGE FORCE PULLING HER BACK

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
TO COLORADO CITY AND VAL JESSOP,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
THE HUSBAND SHE SHARED WITH

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
ANOTHER WIFE.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
YOU THINK YOU'LL SURVIVE OUT

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
HERE IN THE REAL WORLD?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I THINK I WILL.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I THINK I WILL.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
BUT IS THERE A LITTLE PART OF

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
YOU THAT WANTS TO GO BACK TO

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
YOUR HUSBAND AND THAT LIFE, THAT

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.000
RELIGION?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
YEAH, THERE IS.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I THINK THERE ALWAYS WILL BE.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
IT'S A LITTLE PART OF ME.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
IT'S A LITTLE PART OF MY LIFE.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
IN PHOENIX, WITH HER FIVE

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
CHILDREN, LAURENE FEELS SAFE,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
BUT ONE OF HER TWO SONS IS IN

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
OUTRIGHT REBELLION, DEPRESSED

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
AND BROODING, ANTHONY STILL

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
WEARS THE GARB OF THE SECT, EVEN

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
IN THE STIFLING HEAT.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
HE WANTS TO GO HOME, AND HE'S

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
HAVING ALARMING THOUGHTS.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I'M ALMOST READY TO DO

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
ANYTHING TO GET BACK TO MY

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.000
FATHER.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I'M SICK OF IT HERE.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
DID YOU THREATEN TO BLOW UP

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
THE SCHOOL?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.000
YEAH.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD DO IT,

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:05.000
THOUGH.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I DON'T HAVE ANY BOMBS.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
IN THE MONTHS SINCE THAT

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
NERVOUS TRIP INTO HER PAST,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
COLORADO CITY HAS ONLY GROWN

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
MORE TENSE.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, WE WERE

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
ACCOSTED BY THE POLYGAMIST-RUN

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.000
POLICE.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
TURN THE CAMERA OFF, SIR.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
WE'RE NOT TURNING IT OFF.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
AND WE HAVE THIS EERIE

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
ENCOUNTER WITH WARREN JEFFS,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
OUTSIDE HIS FOR TRESS-LIKE

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.000
COMPOUND.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHERE WARREN

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
JEFFS IS.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
HE ANSWERS WITH SILENCE AND A

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
MENACING STARE.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
PLEASE TURN THE CAMERA OFF.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
WE'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
HE'S HERE.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I HAVE NO COMMENT.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
THAT MAN GAVE YOU A LOOK, AND

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
IT SAID VOLUMES OF WHAT HE WAS

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
CAPABLE OF.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
JOHN LLEWELAN, WHO HAS

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
WRITTEN BOOKS FROM HIS

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
EXPERIENCE, SAYS WARREN JEFFS'

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
MOST LOYAL FOLLOWERS BELIEVE HIS

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
PROPHECY OF A FINAL BLOODY

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
CONFRONTATION WITH THE OUTSIDE

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.000
WORLD.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
AND THEY WILL USE WHATEVER

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
VIOLENCE IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
HIM.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000
THESE MEN ARE AS DEDICATED AS

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
SOME OF THESE YOUNG MUSLIM GUYS

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
THAT TURN THEMSELVES INTO HUMAN

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
BOMBS.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
AND FROM A WOMAN PUSHING A

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
STROLLER, OMINOUS ADVICE FOR

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
ANYONE ON THE HUNT FOR HER

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
PROPHET.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
I JUST SAY YOU BETTER BE

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
CAREFUL.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
WOULD SOMEONE HURT PEOPLE WHO

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
WOULD HURT FOR MR. JEFFS?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
OH, NO.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
THEY JUST BETTER BE AWARE OF

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
LAURENE JESSOP TOLD US SHE

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
WAS TERRIFIED OF THIS PLACE,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
DETERMINED NEVER TO COME BACK

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
HERE AND CERTAINLY NOT BY

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
HERSELF, AND YET JUST THREE

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
MONTHS AFTER WE MEET HER, SHE

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
GETS IN HER CAR ALL ALONE IN

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
PHOENIX, THEN DRIVES SIX HOURS,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
RETURNING TO COLORADO CITY.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
AND NOW SHE'S LIVING HERE, IN

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
THIS HOUSE WITH THE MAN SHE SO

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
DESPERATELY TRIED TO ESCAPE.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
VAL JESSOP.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
I WAS REALLY SCARED, BECAUSE

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I DIDN'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, HOW VAL

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
WOULD -- REALLY HOW HE'D BE.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
WHAT HAD YOU BEEN TOLD HE

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
MIGHT DO TO YOU?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
THAT HE'D TAKE ME OUT IN THE

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
DESERT AND KILL ME.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
AND WHEN YOU FIRST LAID EYES

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
ON YOUR FORMER HUSBAND --

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I SAW THAT HE WAS MELLOWED,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
AND HE WAS NICE TO ME.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
AND THE CHILDREN WANTED HIM.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
IT WAS SO GOOD TO SEE HER.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
SHE WAS SCARED, THOUGH.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
LAURENE AGREES TO BRING THE

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
CHILDREN HOME AS LONG AS VAL

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
JESSOP PROMISES NOT TO TAKE ANY

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
ADDITIONAL WIVES.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
HE HAS SAID HE WOULDN'T.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
IF HE DOES, I'LL LEAVE, IF HE

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
DECIDES TO MAKE THAT CHOICE, I

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
WILL LEAVE AGAIN.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I WON'T LIVE IN POLYGAMY AGAIN.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
EVEN WHEN THEY COME OUT, THEY

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
FIND IT DIFFICULT NOT TO BE

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
DRAWN BACK IN.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
YES.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
TWO YEARS AFTER HELPING

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
LAURENE ESCAPE, ANTI-POLYGAMY

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
ACTIVIST FLORA JESSOP IS NOT

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
SURPRISED THAT WOMEN WHO ESCAPE

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
POLYGAMY SOMETIMES GO BACK.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
THEY'RE TRYING TO OVERCOME AN

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
ENTIRE LIFETIME OF INTENSE

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
CONTROL AND INDOCTRINATION.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
TRYING TO SEPARATE THEM FROM

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
THEIR IDEOLOGIES IS ALMOST

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.000
YES.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
BRAINWASHED?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
GRACIOUS FATHER IN HEAVEN,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.000
THANK YOU FOR THE DAY YOU'VE

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
GIVEN US.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
THE REUNITED JESSOP FAMILY

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
NOW LIVES IN A RENTED HOUSE JUST

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
OUTSIDE COLORADO CITY, AND THEY

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
ALL SEEM VERY HAPPY TO BE BACK

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
TOGETHER.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000
ANTHONY, WHO HAD TALKED ABOUT

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
BLOWING UP HIS SCHOOL IN

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
PHOENIX, IS TRANSFORMED.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
WHEN YOU SEE YOUR DAD HOLDING

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:52.000
YOUR MOTHER'S HAND, WHAT DO YOU

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
THINK?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
IT'S A MIRACLE.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
ABSOLUTE MIRACLE THEY'RE HOLDING

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.000
HANDS.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
MAKES YOU HAPPY?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
YEAH, IT'S A MIRACLE.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
BUT THIS IS A MAN WHO IS AN

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
AVOWED POLYGAMIST, A MAN WHO

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
MARRIED YOUR SISTER, A MAN WHO

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
HAD YOU ARRESTED, AND YOU WIND

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
UP BEING COMMITTED FOUR TIMES IN

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
A MENTAL INSTITUTION.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
YES, BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:18.000
GOING TO GO LOOK FOR ANOTHER

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
WIFE.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
YET, WHEN PRESSED, VAL ADMITS

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
HE STILL BELIEVES THAT THE

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
FUGITIVE SECT LEADER, WARREN

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
JEFFS, IS THE ONE TRUE PROPHET

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
OF GOD.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000
AND WHEN IT COMES TO PLURAL

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.000
MARRIAGES --

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
I DON'T HAVE THE OPTION.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
IT WON'T HAPPEN.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
IT'S NOT REVEALED TO ME.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
HOW WOULD IT BE REVEALED TO

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
YOU?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
THROUGH THE LEGITIMATE

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
AUTHORITY AS SPOKEN IN SECTION

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
132 OF THE DOCTRINE.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
THE PROPHET.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
YES.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
IF VAL JESSOP'S INTENTIONS

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
SEEM UNCERTAIN, LAURENE SAYS

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
SHE'LL TAKE HER CHANCES AND STAY

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
AS LONG AS SHE'S THE ONE AND

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
ONLY WOMAN OF THIS HOUSE.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
AND YOU'VE FORGIVEN HIM.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I'VE FORGIVEN HIM.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I KNOW THE LORD LOVES US.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
AND THE CHILDREN.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
AND HE WANTS US TO BE A FAMILY.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I MISS HER.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO FIND HER

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
WAY, AND I HOPE THAT SHE CAN

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
WITHOUT -- WITHOUT IT COSTING

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
HER HER CHILDREN OR HERSELF.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
BUT YOU WILL NOT LIVE LIFE

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.000
THE OLD WAYS.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
NO.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000
YES.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000
IT'S TOO MUCH PAIN THAT WAY.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Announcer: "PRIMETIME"

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
CONTINUES.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
NOW WE MAKE 180-DEGREE TURN

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
TO WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MORE

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
MODERN POLYGAMIST COMMUNITY.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
IT'S THE IDEA BEHIND A NEW HBO

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
SERIES "BIG LOVE," ABOUT A MAN

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
WITH THREE WIVES BEING

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
ENCOURAGED TO TAKE A FOURTH.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
JUST HANDLING THESE THREE,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
THAT'S A FULL-TIME JOB.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
VAL, COME TO BED.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:01.000
VAL!

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
THAT, OF COURSE, IS FICTION,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
BUT HERE'S THE REALITY.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
A MANSION WE WERE INVITED TO

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
WHERE WE MET OVER A DOZEN WIVES,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
COUNTLESS CHILDREN, AND JUST ONE

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
MAN IN THE SHADOWS, LITERALLY.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
* O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.000
SKIES *

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
IT SEEMS SO PATRIOTIC,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
STRAINS OF A STIRRING ANTHEM SET

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
AGAINST A BACKDROP OF CLASSIC

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
AMERICAN SCENERY.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
* ABOVE THE FRUITED PLAIN *

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
BUT THE WOMEN IN THIS CHOIR

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
IN CENTENNIAL PARK, ARIZONA, ARE

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
NOT ONLY SINGING PRAISES TO

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
THEY'RE ALSO PLEDGING THEIR

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
DIE-HARD ALLEGIANCE TO POLYGAMY.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
HOW MANY OF YOU BELIEVE THAT A

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
PLURAL MARRIAGE IS YOUR

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
THIS IS NOT EXACTLY YOUR

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
MOTHER'S TUPPERWARE PARTY.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
EVERY ONE OF THESE WOMEN LIVES

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
IN A HOUSEHOLD WITH ONE HUSBAND

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
AND ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO A DOZEN

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
OR MORE WOMEN THEY CALL SISTER

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.000
WIVES.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
FOR US, IT WORKS BECAUSE WE

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
LOVE IT.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
WE WANT IT TO WORK.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
FOR THE MOST PART, THESE SEEM

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
LIKE TYPICAL LAW-ABIDING,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
GOD-FEARING AMERICANS, TEACHERS,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
NURSES, BUSINESS WOMEN.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
THEY'RE MODERN, SAVVY, AND IF

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
YOU ASK THEM LIBERATED.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
TAKE LINDA EARLE, FOR INSTANCE.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I'M INDEPENDENT.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DOTE ON

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
A GUY EVERY NIGHT.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO MAKE

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
SURE HE HAS A MEAL EVERY NIGHT.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.000
LET SOMEBODY ELSE DO IT WHO

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
LIKES IT.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
IN LINDA'S HOUSE, THERE'S

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
ROOM FOR MANY WIVES.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
SHE LIVES IN THIS

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
MULTI-MILLION-DOLLAR

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
MEGAMANSION.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
THERE ARE THREE MASSIVE WINGS IN

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
THE HOME TOTALING 30,000 SQUARE

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
FEET.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
THE HOUSE IS IMMACULATE.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
CHECK OUT THE DINING ROOM.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
WITH ALL THE KIDS, HOW DO YOU

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
KEEP IT LIKE THIS?

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
A LOT OF HELP.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.000
THE KITCHEN.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
THE FORMAL KITCHEN.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.000
MASSIVE.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000
YOU SAY YOU LIKE IT BECAUSE YOU

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
DON'T HAVE TO COOK.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I DON'T HAVE TO COOK.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
TWO SEPARATE BARS.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:05.000
TWO MICROWAVES.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
THEN THERE'S THE EVERYDAY

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.000
KITCHEN.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
FOUR REFRIGERATORS.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
FOUR REFRIGERATORS.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
THE SIZE OF THE CAFETERIA.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
AFTER ALL, THERE ARE DOZENS OF

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
OF MOUTHS TO FEED HERE FROM

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
NEWBORNS TO TEENAGERS.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO SCHOOL.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
THEY CLAIM THEY DON'T KNOW

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.000
HOW MANY CHILDREN LIVE HERE

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THE

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.000
AUTHORITIES MIGHT INVESTIGATE

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
AND PERHAPS BREAK UP THE FAMILY.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
THAT'S WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
OFFICIAL WIFE HERE IN THE EYES

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
OF THE LAW.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
THE OTHERS ARE SANCTIONED ONLY

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
BY THE SECT.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
YOU WOULD WANT TO BE IN A

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
MARRIAGE WHERE THERE WOULD BE

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
OTHER WIVES, SISTER WIVES?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
YEAH, THEY'RE YOU'RE SISTERS.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
YOU WORK TOGETHER.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
YOU GENUINELY CARE ABOUT EACH

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.000
OTHER.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
BUT WITH SO MANY WOMEN AND

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
ONLY ONE MAN, WE HAD TO ASK.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
DOESN'T ONE SISTER WIFE EVER GET

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
JEALOUS OF ANOTHER?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
JEALOUSY DOESN'T MATTER.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
WHEN IT COMES TO A SITUATION

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
WHERE HE HAS COMMITTED TO THAT

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.000
WOMAN ALSO.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
THE WOMAN WHO HAS HER

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
HUSBAND'S SEXUAL PARTNERS AT

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
BREAKFAST WITH HER THE NEXT

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
MORNING, SHE KNOWS WHERE HER

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
HUSBAND HAS BEEN.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
SHE KNOWS THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
COME FROM THIS UNION, SHE LOVES

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
THOSE CHILDREN, SHE LOVES THAT

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.000
WOMAN.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
WHAT IF A SISTER WIFE IS

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
YOUNGER, PRETTIER?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
GOOD FOR HIM.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
ABOUT INTIMACY, SEX.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
IT MUST TAKE SOME AMOUNT OF

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
VIAGRA FOR THIS MAN TO BE ABLE

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.000
TO --

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
THESE MEN TAKE.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
THIS IS SERIOUS.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
THIS IS NOT CASUAL --

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.000
SEX.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
-- SEX IN ANY WAY.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
SO WHO IS THE MAN OF THIS

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
HOUSE?

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
WELL, HE'S AN EXTREMELY WEALTHY

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
BUSINESSMAN WHO'S CONCERNED THAT

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
IF HE SPEAKS PUBLICLY, IT COULD

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
CAUSE HIM BOTH LEGAL AND

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
FINANCIAL HARM.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
SO HE DEMANDS ANONYMITY TO

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
PRESERVE, HE SAYS, HIS RIGHT TO

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
PRIVACY.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
HOW MANY WIVES DO YOU HAVE?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
LET'S JUST SAY I BELIEVE THAT

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS IS

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
SUPERIOR TO A SINGLE

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
RELATIONSHIP.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
IT IS MORE COMPATIBLE TO THE

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.000
NEEDS OF THE MAN.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
IT'S MORE COMPATIBLE TO THE

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
NEEDS OF THE LADIES.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE YOU

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.000
FATHERED?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
HOW MANY CHILDREN HAVE YOU

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
FATHERED?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
HE WON'T DISCUSS NUMBERS, BUT

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
A RELATIVE TELLS "PRIMETIME"

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
THAT THIS MAN HAS AS MANY AS 15

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
WIVES AND PERHAPS 75 CHILDREN.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
IS THE SEX EVER OVERWHELMING?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
DON'T INSULT ME.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
WE ARE SERIOUS AND COMMITTED TO

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
THE LIFESTYLE CHOICES WE'VE

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
MADE, AND WE'RE HONORABLE IN

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
THEM.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
THIS IS NOT ONE BIG RAUCOUS

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
SEX PARTY.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
NO, I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
ME WITH MR. HEFNER DOWN IN LOS

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
ANGELES.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
THERE ARE MUCH CHEAPER WAYS TO

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
HAVE SEX THAN TO MAINTAIN A

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000
PLURAL HOUSEHOLD.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
ISN'T THIS JUST THE ULTIMATE

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
IN ONE MAN HAVING HIS WAY WITH

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
SO MANY WOMEN FOR PERSONAL

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
GRATITUDE?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
THAT WOULD SHOW A GREAT DEAL

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
OF IGNORANCE.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
IT REQUIRES AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
OF EFFORT TO MAINTAIN ANY

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
RELATIONSHIP.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
TRY MAINTAINING TWO

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.000
RELATIONSHIPS OR THREE

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
IT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL EFFORT.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
WHY DO YOU THINK THE OUTSIDE

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
WORLD VIEWS THIS WITH SUCH

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
DISMAY, DISGUST?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
IT'S POSSIBLY JUST THE

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.000
DIFFERENCE.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
I HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
DISGUST FOR MONOGAMY AND TOTAL

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
DISGUST FOR BACHELORHOOD.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
WHEN THERE'S NEED FOR A

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.000
ROMANTIC ENCOUNTER WITH YOUR

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
HUSBAND, HOW DO YOU SCHEDULE

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
THAT?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
IT'S NEVER AN ISSUE OF

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
SCHEDULING.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
YOU FIND OUT THERE ARE LADIES

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
THAT HAVE NEEDS THAT MIGHT BE A

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
NEED, ESPECIALLY IF A YOUNG LADY

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
IS TRYING TO HAVE A CHILD.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I'M UNWILLING TO RESTRICT WHO

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
I LOVE, AND IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
BETWEEN LOVING SARAH VERSUS

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
LOVING DOROTHY, I RESENT IT, SO

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
I WILL MAKE THEM THE SAME OFFER.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
AND IF THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.000
THEY CAN.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
IF THEY DON'T, THEY DON'T NEED

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
TO.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
BUT NO WOMAN IS GOING TO TELL ME

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
I CAN'T LOVE ANOTHER WOMAN.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
THERE'S A WAY OUT IF A WIFE

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
DOESN'T WANT TO BE THERE?

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
AS CLOSE AS YOUR CAR KEYS.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
IS THIS POLYGAMY?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
POLYGAMY HAS AN UGLY TONE TO

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:09.000
IT.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
THIS IS A LIFESTYLE THAT WORKS

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
FOR SOME OF US VERY NICELY.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
AS HARD AS IT MIGHT BE FOR

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
UNDERSTAND, THE ONE THING YOU

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
CANNOT DENY ABOUT THE WOMEN OF

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
CENTENNIAL PARK IS THEIR

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
PASSION.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I REALLY

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
DO LOVE THE WAY I LIVE.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
AND I FEEL VERY PROUD, VERY

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
HONORED TO KNOW EACH AND EVERY

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
MEMBER WITHIN MY HOUSEHOLD.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
I WANT TO LIVE THIS WAY FOR THE

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
REST OF MY LIFE AND FOR THE REST

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000
OF ETERNITY.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
INTERVIEWS DAVID STRATHAIRN.
