00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.960
PETER COYOTE: In July of 1929,
a 90-year-old woman returned

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.330
to the Yosemite Valley
in California.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.160
She was called Maria Lebrado,
but 78 years earlier as

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.460
a young girl, she had been known
by her real name To-tu-ya,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.830
the granddaughter
of Chief Tenaya, leader

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.060
of the Ahwahneechees,
an Indian tribe who

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.000
for centuries had called
the valley their home until

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
in 1851 a battalion of white
men had driven them out

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.800
at bayonet point.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.400
To-tu-ya was the sole
remaining survivor

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.500
of that sad moment.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.830
This was her first time back.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.260
Half a generation after the
Ahwahneechees' expulsion,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.330
the federal government had
preserved the beautiful valley

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.500
permanently as
a national park.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.900
Still, everywhere she looked,
To-tu-ya was reminded of how

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.130
much things had changed.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.860
In a broken mixture of
English, Spanish, and her own

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.460
ancient language, she told her
escorts the valley floor was

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.030
now more wooded and
brushy than in her day.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.360
Her people had regularly
set grass fires to keep

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.700
the meadows open and the
trees and shrubs at bay.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.660
Then she looked up at the
rock walls of the valley.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.660
The great monoliths
and majestic waterfalls

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.330
stood unchanged.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.900
Turning toward Half Dome,
the cleft rock she knew as

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.730
Tis-sa-ack, she stretched out
her arms and raised her voice

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.930
in a strong, clear,
high-pitched call that echoed

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.400
off the granite walls.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.030
It was, she explained,
the call her

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.500
grandfather Tenaya had
once used to summon his

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.830
people together.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.360
Until that moment, she had
been the last one to hear it.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.360
[Woman calling]

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.800
WOMAN: They're
islands of hope.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.300
The parks are always where
I can go home again.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.930
I go back to my hometown,
there is a Safeway where I

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.960
used to play with
Sylvia Gonzalez, they have taken

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.800
and turned my old school
into a junk shop,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.560
but the parks don't do that.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.930
So these are places we
can always go home

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.700
and paradoxically that we can
always see into the future

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.930
and hope for the
better things.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.530
MAN: When we look at parks and
we look at the United States

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.300
and we examine the whole idea
of democracy, I think that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.430
the park experience
is an exploration

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.630
of the idea of freedom.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.330
Where do I come from,
where am I going,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.130
how did I get here, how did
we as a people get here?

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.530
I think that when people go
to a national park, they

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.460
get a sense,
a compass to history.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.000
COYOTE: As the 1920s ended,
the United States was about to

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.960
enter two of the darkest
and most frightening decades

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.960
of the 20th Century, ones
that included an economic

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.100
catastrophe that threatened
the foundation of American

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.030
society, followed by a war
that threatened the existence

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.430
of freedom throughout
the world.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.160
For a time during those dark
years, the national parks

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.030
would thrive as never before.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.460
In the 1930s and 1940s,
hundreds of thousands

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.060
of American boys would go
to the parks in pursuit

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.830
of a paycheck and discover
a new sense of dignity.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.930
Then hundreds of thousands
more under different

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.060
circumstances would enjoy in
the parks a moment of peace.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.060
And what happens in the United
States is that the American

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.930
land comes to embody
the American nation,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.800
and the national parks become
the icons of our nationalism,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.760
the place where we come to
celebrate what it means

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.130
to be an American.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.900
COYOTE: The national park
idea was changing, too.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.830
Though the park service had
lost its charismatic first

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.900
director Stephen Mather,
a new president and his

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.460
progressive administration
would vastly expand the number

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.360
of parks and then even more
dramatically expand the very

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.830
notion of what a
national park could be.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.000
A young biologist would insist
that the survival of wildlife

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.230
is as important as the
preservation of scenery

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.630
and that places without
mountains or waterfalls should

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.600
be seen as natural wonders,
as well, and in a time when

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.230
the future of the country was
most in doubt, the symbols

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.000
of her complicated past would
be set aside and cherished

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.230
while Americans from every
walk of life and every

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.360
possible background would
find in the parks a deeper

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.000
connection to their land,
their nation, and themselves.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
MAN: My sense is that our
special connection with

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.500
the national parks comes from
the fact that we're a nation

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.200
of immigrants, we're a nation
of people for whom this is not

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.200
home, and the national parks
are what anchor and root us

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.500
on this continent.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.430
They are the meaning of
home for many of us.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.100
They're what it means to be
an American and to inhabit

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.700
this continent.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.860
It's the end of the immigrant
experience, and they're what

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.530
takes you and says,
"Now I am in America."

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.560
COYOTE: In April of 1933,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.400
newly sworn in as president,
asked Horace Albright,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.660
the second director of the
National Park Service to come

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.930
along with him during a day
trip from Washington to

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.830
Virginia's
Blue Ridge Mountains.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.430
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
The president got in the front

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.900
seat, where there was more
room, and they took

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.160
the braces off his legs.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.700
He put a cigarette in
his long cigarette holder,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.260
sat back, and relaxed.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.360
I sat behind him on the
jump seat just a few inches

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.760
from his ear.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.000
I had a dream I wanted
to make real.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.930
For years, I had wanted to
get the many national military

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.860
parks, battlefields,
and monuments transferred out

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.130
of the War Department and
Department of Agriculture into

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.360
the National Park Service.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.500
As we approached the
Rappahannock River, I began

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.030
thinking, "If I'm going
to talk to the president

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.500
"about getting
the military parks,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.260
"I had better get to it."

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.860
Now was the time.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.460
COYOTE: Albright began
pointing out sites important

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.530
to the Second Battle of
Bull Run in the Civil War,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.160
then broadened the discussion
to myriad other battlefields

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.630
and historic sites
in the area.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.130
WOMAN: So my father had
a golden opportunity.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.330
He told him exactly
what he wanted.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.930
He wanted the monuments,
and he wanted

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.700
the battlefields.
"All right."

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.200
When they got back
to the White House,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.360
"Hey, Albright," he said.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.060
"Tomorrow morning, I want
a plan in my office.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:40.460
"I want to know what
you want to do."

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.100
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT: And to
the formal duties of the

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:47.100
Park Service by transferring
from other departments many

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.100
other parks,
battlefields, memorials,

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.600
and national monuments.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.830
COYOTE: Within days, Roosevelt
would sign two executive

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.730
orders initiating a sweeping
reorganization that overnight

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.000
transformed the Park Service.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.530
From the War Department,
the agency was given

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.300
responsibility for more than
20 military parks and historic

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.360
battlefields and monuments:
from Castillo de san Marcos,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.400
an ancient Spanish fort
in St. Augustine, Florida,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.630
to Yorktown, Virginia,
where the decisive victory

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.330
of the American Revolution
had been won; From Antietam,

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.600
where the bloodiest battle
of the Civil War was fought,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.300
to Appomattox Courthouse,
where it ended.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.900
Under the new plan, the Park
Service was now expected to

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.500
protect and interpret more
than a dozen nonmilitary

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.460
historic sites, as well:
The Statue of Liberty in

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.730
New York's Harbor;
Mount Rushmore in South Dakota;

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.900
and many
of the District of Columbia's

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.860
most hallowed places,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.760
including the Lincoln Memorial,
the shrine to

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.960
the president who in 1864 had
given the national park

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:06.200
idea its first
tentative expression.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.500
National parks now embraced
the idea of America itself.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.330
MAN: Our national heritage
is richer than just

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.200
scenic features.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.760
The realization is coming that
perhaps our greatest national

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.930
heritage is nature itself with
all its complexity and its

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.860
abundance of life.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.930
George Melendez Wright.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.500
COYOTE: During To-tu-ya's
emotional return to Yosemite,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.760
one of her escorts, chosen
because he was fluent

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.860
in Spanish, was a young Park
Service employee named

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.460
George Melendez Wright.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.860
He had been born into a
wealthy San Francisco family.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.330
His mother came from one of
El Salvador's most

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.430
prominent dynasties.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.160
His father was a ship captain.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.130
When they both died
prematurely, he was raised by

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:12.300
an aunt, who encouraged his
fascination with the natural

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.060
world, which led to
a degree in zoology.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.530
Working in Yosemite as an
assistant park naturalist,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.830
Wright became convinced that
the parks were fulfilling only

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.360
part of their purpose.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.700
By focusing so much on
attracting visitors,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.300
park managers had overlooked
another responsibility,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.730
which Wright called "the very
heart of the National Park

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:43.260
"System," preserving wildlife
in its natural state.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.600
MAN AS GEORGE MELENDEZ WRIGHT:
When a tourist enters the

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.730
park, he is looking for the
same concentration of animals

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.700
he saw in the paddocks of
the zoological garden.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.100
A galaxy of bears at our
garbage platform approximates

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.900
this concept, and
he is satisfied.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.900
Then comes a day when
his heart skips a beat.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.260
Walking along a deep forest
trail, he comes upon a single

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.060
bear eagerly peeling the bark
from a log in search

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.460
of fat white grubs.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.360
This is a fresh thrill, and
it brings the realization that

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.400
the unique charm of the
animals in a national park

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.500
lies in their wildness,
not their tameness, in their

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.000
primitive struggle to survive,
rather than their fat

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.360
certainty of an easy living.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.930
COYOTE: Though only in his
mid-20s and near the bottom

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.630
of the Park Service career
ladder, Wright proposed to his

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.630
superiors that he undertake
something that had never been

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.230
done before, a scientific
survey of wildlife conditions

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.300
in the parks.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.100
It took a year of persuasion,
but he finally won approval

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.530
for his plan, partly
because of his persistence

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.700
and friendly personality and
also because the financially

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.660
independent Wright offered
to pay for the whole

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:05.300
thing himself.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.800
In the summer of 1930 in
a Buick Roadster he had

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.130
purchased and customized to
carry camping gear, cameras,

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.300
and scientific instruments,
Wright set off with two

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.760
colleagues on an 11,000-mile
tour of the western parks.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:28.730
They would keep at it for
4 consecutive years.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.960
At each park, Wright kept
a daily log

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.260
of the animals he saw.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.400
He also gathered information
from his conversations

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.300
with people in the field,
park rangers

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.800
and superintendents,
local rangers and hunters,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.800
old-timers who remembered
what it was like back

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.560
in the 19th Century,
anyone with information

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.260
about the state of wildlife in
the parks, to augment what he

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.930
and his fellow
researchers were observing

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.430
with their own eyes.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.530
Everywhere he went, Wright
discovered disturbing evidence

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.600
that the equilibrium of
nature was out of kilter.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.230
Coyotes, wolves, and mountain
lions, even badgers and hawks

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.460
and owls were routinely
shot as unwelcome predators.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.860
Buffalo were kept in
corrals like domestic cows.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.430
Elk, deer, and antelope
were being fed hay

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.760
in the wintertime.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.760
At Yellowstone, he learned
that rangers had been ordered

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.530
to go to the nesting grounds
of white pelicans and stomp

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:46.130
their eggs because it was
feared that grown pelicans

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.400
deprived anglers of
too many fish.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.300
The bears meanwhile were
treated like pets, fed scraps

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.900
of food at staged events
each evening near the parks'

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.360
garbage dumps or along the
roadsides, where they were

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.300
encouraged to beg for
handouts from tourists.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.700
MAN AS GEORGE MELENDEZ WRIGHT:
The average citizen expects

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.930
more intelligence from a
bear than he has any

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.660
right to expect.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.830
He goes on the assumption that
if he feeds a bear two sticks

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:17.330
of candy and does not want
to give it a third he is

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.760
the one to say,
"No, no," and he believes that

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.130
the bear is to be accused
of an unforgivable breach

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.930
of etiquette if it takes all
the candy out of his hand

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.330
and perhaps takes
the hand with it.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.000
COYOTE: Wright eventually
published two reports

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.930
proposing a
radically new policy.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.060
Unless threatened with
extinction within in a park,

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.560
each native species, including
the hated predators, he wrote,

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.060
"should be left to carry
on its struggle

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.660
"for existence unaided."

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.600
MAN: When he said that "the
rare predators shall be

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.630
"protected in the national parks

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:05.030
"in proportion that they are
persecuted everywhere else,"

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.360
that was--that
was revolutionary.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.360
COYOTE: Wright also called for
the end of winter feedings,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.100
closing the bear dumps,
no more stocking streams

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.900
with nonnative fish, expansion
of some park boundaries to

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.830
accommodate grazing habits
and changes in a multitude

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.760
of practices that
had become ingrained.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.700
Most park managers
were unconvinced,

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.200
but Horace Albright, intrigued
by the surveys, established

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.760
a new Wildlife Division in 1933

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.400
and named
George Melendez Wright,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.830
only 29 years old,
as its chief.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.600
MAN AS GEORGE MELENDEZ WRIGHT:
If we destroy nature blindly,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.000
it is a boomerang which
will be our undoing.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.430
Consecration to the task of
adjusting ourselves to the

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.900
natural environment so that
we secure the best values from

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:07.600
nature without destroying
it is not useless idealism.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.400
It is good hygiene
for civilization.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.400
MAN: Part of the changing
relationship with national

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.000
parks as we evolved as
a nation went

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.230
from scenery to science.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.100
The scenery was obvious.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.300
It was overwhelming,
it was stunning.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.030
The science is not so obvious.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.330
Science embraces mystery,
and it begins to look into

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.760
the future in ways that most
people can't preserve.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.000
It asks questions that most
people don't ask, and it says,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.830
"We need to hold on to these
places, and I can't give you

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:47.160
"precise reason why, but the
reason will come along later,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.100
"and if we don't have them,
we'll never be able to explore

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.500
"the answers to the
questions we'll be asking."

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.460
So they hold the answers to
questions we have not even

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.430
yet learned to ask.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.160
[Frogs croaking]

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.400
WOMAN: I think it's the people
that pressure the government

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:37.330
to do the things
that benefit them.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.630
I don't think most politicians
sit there and say, "Now what's

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.960
"the best thing I can do
for the people today?"

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.760
But they hear from their
constituents, and that's what

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.000
makes up their minds,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.530
and the people really
love their parks.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.500
They mean a lot.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.530
There's an emotional
bond there, and they'll

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:03.030
fight for them.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.900
WOMAN: There are no other
Everglades in the world.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.800
Nothing anywhere else
is like them.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.700
Their vast, glittering
openness wider than

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.630
the enormous visible round of
the horizon, the sweetness

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.330
of their massive winds
under the dazzling blue

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.930
heights of space.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.530
The miracle of the light
pours over the green and brown

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.460
expanse of saw grass and
water, shining and slow-moving

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:38.730
below, the grass and water
that is the meaning central

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.830
face of the
Everglades of Florida.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.430
It is a river of grass.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.000
Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.660
COYOTE: For centuries,
the fresh waters of Lake

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.100
Okeechobee had flowed slowly
and yet unimpeded across

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.660
a vast swath of southern
Florida toward the Gulf

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.130
of Mexico, a seemingly endless
saw grass marsh punctuated by

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.700
cypress swamps and mangrove
forests, creating

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:13.900
an environment unlike
anything else on earth.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.530
Its highest elevation is never
more than a few feet above sea

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.400
level, yet its rich landscape
supports more than a thousand

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.200
different species of plants
from royal palms

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.900
and smooth-barked
gumbo limbo trees

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.400
to delicate orchids
and bromeliads.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.400
It is the only place where
alligators and crocodiles can

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.700
be found living side by side,
and it is a critical breeding

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:44.760
ground for wading birds beyond
counting: egrets and ibises

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.060
and herons of all sizes,
roseate spoonbills,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:56.330
and the wood stork, the only
stork native to America.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.330
GREENE: It's magnificent when
you stand there and look out

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.760
on the vastness of it all.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.260
Well, they call it a swamp,
but it's really not a swamp

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:13.860
because the water moves ever
so slowly, but it moves.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.330
COYOTE: Because of its
trackless impenetrability,

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:23.160
the Everglades became
something of a sanctuary

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.930
for people, too.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:29.400
In the 1800s when the Seminole
Indians were driven out

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:34.330
of Florida, small groups
escaped and found refuge deep

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.560
in the cypress trees
and saw grass along

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:43.360
with the Miccosukee Tribe and
hundreds of runaway slaves.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.400
Later when the fashion in
women's hats made the white

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.430
feathers of egrets more
valuable per ounce than gold,

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:54.100
plume hunters and poachers
hid out in the Everglades

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.860
and slaughtered the birds
there with impunity.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.560
A few game wardens who dared
try to stop them were killed,

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.830
too, but a greater threat soon
imperiled not just the birds

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.130
but the Everglades itself.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.200
Napoleon Bonaparte Broward,
elected governor on a slogan

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.330
of "Drain the Everglades" was
merely one in a long series

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.700
of Florida politicians and
promoters who built their

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.400
careers on the idea of turning
the vast wetland into

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.560
a developer's promised land.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.900
They had divided up the
Everglades into lots that they

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.160
were selling to the
suckers from up north.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.760
They were selling land
by the gallon.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:48.530
COYOTE: As mechanized dredges
began digging drainage canals,

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.630
real estate speculators
began offering land

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:57.100
at $1.00 an acre,
then $20, then $50,

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.000
even though some of it
was still underwater.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.630
A succession of real estate
booms swept south Florida.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.900
Much of the northern
Everglades was turned into

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.260
sugar cane plantations,
vegetable fields,

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.930
and cattle ranches.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.460
The towns sprouting up along
the coastline began taking

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.230
more and more land in
the interior as their

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.100
populations swelled.

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:32.400
Then in the late 1920s in the
Miami area, a small movement

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.630
began, hoping to save as
much of the remaining

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.100
Everglades as possible.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.560
The Florida Federation of
Women's Clubs had already

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.560
preserved a 120-acre parcel
called Royal Palms and given

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.000
it to the state.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.360
That wasn't enough for
Ernest Coe, a landscape

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.930
architect who had recently moved
from Connecticut to Miami

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.330
and was shocked to learn that
rare orchids, exotic birds,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.130
and so much else in the
Everglades were being

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.130
systematically destroyed.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.960
He decided to make it his
life's work to create a much

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.060
larger national park.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.660
Coe threw himself into the
cause, convening meetings,

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.100
firing off petitions,
relentlessly pestering

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:28.900
politicians, and persuading
others to join his crusade.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.300
WOMAN AS DOUGLAS: I can't say
I've spent many years and months

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.400
communing with the Everglades.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.360
To be a friend of the
Everglades is not necessarily

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.400
to spend time wandering
around out there.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:47.800
It's too buggy, too wet,
too generally inhospitable.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.500
I suppose you could say the
Everglades and I have the kind

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.960
of friendship what
doesn't depend on constant

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.500
physical contact.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.730
I know it's out there,
and I know its importance.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.260
Marjory Stoneman Douglas.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.130
COYOTE: Marjory Stoneman
Douglas soon became

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:10.760
the movement's most powerful
public voice, even though,

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.600
as she was the first to admit,
she seemed an unlikely

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.460
champion of the cause.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.560
She wouldn't voluntarily say,
"Well, let's go have a picnic

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:27.030
in the Everglades," or, "Let's
go boating in the Everglades."

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.800
She just wasn't that much
of an outdoor person really,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.560
but she taught people
about the Everglades.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.060
She would go anywhere
anytime to make a speech

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.600
about the Everglades.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.460
COYOTE: A graduate of
Wellesley College, Douglas had

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.860
come to Florida in 1915 to
get a divorce after a brief

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.660
and unhappy marriage,
then enlisted in the Navy

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.500
in World War I and served
with the Red Cross in Europe.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.160
"I wanted my own life in
my own way," she said.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.200
She became the "Miami Herald"
society reporter but found

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.430
herself more interested in the
struggles for women's rights

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.760
and racial justice, earning a
reputation for her feistiness

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.300
and colorful writing.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.730
When Ernest Coe turned her
attention to the Everglades,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.660
Douglas quickly agreed
with him that its unique

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:25.830
combination of water,
wildlife, and plants needed

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:31.030
federal protection, but at
the national level, many park

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:35.160
supporters were unsure whether
the Everglades, lacking

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.730
dramatic mountains,
waterfalls, or geysers,

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:42.700
was worthy of being
a national park.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.260
"A swamp is a swamp,"
one leading

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.100
conservationist said.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.200
The National Park Service has
spent the first 15, 20 years

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.600
of its own existence promoting
the West, and suddenly,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.800
the Everglades comes along,
and the National Park Service

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.960
says, "But wait a minute.
Where's the scenery?

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.500
"Where's the Canyons?
Where's the mountains?

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.960
Why are people going
to come here?"

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.460
COYOTE: Frederick Law Olmsted
Jr., who like his father had

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.200
helped define the national
park idea, was dispatched to

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.300
Florida to study the request.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.530
"The quality of the scenery,"
he conceded, "is to

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.560
"the casual observer somewhat
confused and monotonous,

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.100
"perhaps rather subtle for
the average person in search

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:32.600
"of the spectacular."

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.660
Then at the end of a long day,
Olmsted found himself near the

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.830
nighttime roost of thousands
of ibises and herons.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.730
MAN AS OLMSTED:
After dusk, flock after

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:06.300
flock came in from their
feeding grounds and settled

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.060
in the thickets close at hand.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.460
It was an unforgettable sight
that ranks high among the

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.400
natural spectacles of America.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.030
MAN: Somebody can tell you
about a place, and you can nod

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.700
your head and say, "Yeah, boy,
that's interesting."

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.460
Someone can show you a
photograph or a painting of it

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.960
and say, "Man, that's
something," but until you're

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.800
actually there, until you're
in the midst of the place,

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:36.630
where all your senses
are involved, that's

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.060
the transformative moment,
that's when you say,

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:45.300
"This is a place,
and I am part of it."

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.400
COYOTE: Skeptical Park Service
leaders, including

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.460
Horace Albright, made a series
of official trips to decide

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.030
whether to support the idea.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.730
So did George Melendez Wright,
director of the new

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.530
Wildlife Division.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.530
Both found it easier to
conduct at least part of their

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:09.330
investigations from the air,
floating above the Everglades

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.930
in the Good Year Blimp.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:17.060
Both were astonished
by what they saw.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.830
"Unless this area is quickly
established as a national park,"

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.860
Wright warned,
"the wildlife there will

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:28.060
"become extinct."

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.360
RUNTE: And then
Horace Albright got in a blimp,

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.300
went over the Everglades,
looked down, saw the wildlife,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.460
saw the alligators and all the
ibises and all the wonderful

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.060
bird life, and said,
"You know, this is a beautiful

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.560
"place, and I think this could
be a park," and began to

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.930
change his mind.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.460
And in the process
of changing his mind,

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.330
it changed
the Park Service's mind.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.060
COYOTE: Finally, Ernest Coe
and Marjory Stoneman Douglas'

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.160
efforts paid off.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.700
A bill to create Everglades
National Park passed Congress

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.560
by the narrowest of margins.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.730
For the first time in history,
a park had been created solely

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.530
for the preservation
of animals and plants

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.530
and the environment
that sustains them.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:38.500
GREENE: It was an enchanted
spot, and to me, that was the

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:43.130
closest thing to heaven on
earth, and I spent almost

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.230
every weekend down in the a
little bitty boat cruising

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:51.460
Florida Bay and looking
at the birds.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:03.530
We didn't fish, we didn't
speed around in a boat.

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:07.900
We just floated around
and felt like we were

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.360
all part of it.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.130
Us and the birds.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.760
And the fish that we could
see on the bottom the water

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.900
was so clear.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.400
We were just being
there part of it all.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.630
I think that's what a
national park is all about.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:50.900
It gives people breathing
room, it gives people

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.260
a tranquil atmosphere.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:01.800
It gives them an opportunity
to be a part of nature.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:08.700
You're just part of it all,
just part of the rest of it.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.460
[Frogs croaking]

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:55.130
ROOSEVELT: Today for the first
time, I have seen Glacier Park.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.530
Perhaps I can best express to
you my thrill and delight by

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.300
saying that I wish that every
American, old and young,

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.360
could have been with me.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.900
The great mountains,
the glaciers, the lakes,

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.130
and the trees make me long
to stay here for all

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.430
the rest of the summer.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:17.230
To say from standpoint
of scenery alone that--

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:23.000
MEN, SINGING: Where seldom
is heard a discouraging word

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.830
And the skies are
not cloudy all day

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.660
COYOTE: In Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, the national parks

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.330
had found their greatest
friend in the White House

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.100
since the presidency of his
cousin Theodore Roosevelt

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.500
a generation earlier.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.460
F.D.R. had developed his own
deep love of the outdoors

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.200
during his boyhood on
his wealthy family's

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.160
country estate.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.230
Adding historic sites and
battlefields to the national

00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:00.100
parks had been simply a
first step in the larger

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:05.700
reorganization F.D.R. and his
administration contemplated,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.900
but a much bigger issue
demanded his attention.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.400
The Great Depression had
thrown 1 out of every 4

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.300
American wage
earners out of work.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:34.200
Factories shut down, farms
were foreclosed, unemployed

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.800
young men, concerned that they
had become a burden to their

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.000
families, roamed
the countryside

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.700
by the hundreds of thousands.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.930
Many Americans wondered
where their next meal

00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:49.800
would come from.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.160
In some cities, animals in
the zoo were shot and the meat

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.500
distributed to the poor.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:06.160
Everyone in the United States
was affected.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:11.360
MAN: The welfare at that
time was called relief.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.230
It was sad when I found out
the source of that money.

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:21.000
It was from the paupers' fund,
so that was hard to take,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.360
but, hey, it kept us going.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.260
COYOTE: Juan Lujan had grown
up in west Texas near the tiny

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:31.530
town of Redford on
the Rio Grande.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.560
LUJAN: By the time I graduated
from high school, that was

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.300
the depth of the Depression,
so that prompted me and my

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.860
mother to seek something,
and one of the social workers

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:49.230
advised her about the CCCs.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:55.700
COYOTE: The TVA, the PWA,
the WPA, the CWA.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.660
Among the alphabet soup of
programs Roosevelt's New Deal

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.830
created to stimulate
the economy and combat

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.930
unemployment was one
especially dear to

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.830
the president's heart because
it incorporated his concern

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:12.260
for conservation.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.860
He had pushed it through
Congress in less than a week

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.930
after being inaugurated.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.700
The Civilian Conservation
Corps put young men to work

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.560
in national forests, state
parks, and national parks,

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.900
clearing brush and replanting
forests, fighting fires,

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.800
building visitor shelters
and ranger cabins, improving

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.800
campsites and trails.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.830
Horace Albright was part
of the early planning,

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.730
and because the Park Service
already had a long list

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.860
of projects ready to go,
it was given a lead

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.960
role in the new program.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:21.260
Within 3 months, 1,000 CCC
camps were up and running

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.760
with nearly 300,000 young men
at work in them, sending money

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:29.500
back home, helping
millions of Americans.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.530
LUJAN: Prior to the CCC,
I didn't know anything

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.360
about national parks except
what I read in my history

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.560
books, that they
existed somewhere.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.660
I had never been to a
national park before.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.200
COYOTE: Juan Lujan was
dispatched to help develop

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.600
what would become Big Bend
National Park in Texas.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.300
LUJAN: We were housed
in barracks,

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.730
we ate in a mess hall just
like the military,

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:21.260
and we had a certain
discipline.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.060
We'd get up early in the
morning, do calisthenics.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.500
That was before breakfast,
and you'd better be

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.530
at the calisthenics.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:35.600
Otherwise, KP, kitchen patrol.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.230
COYOTE: For many, it was their
first time away from home

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:45.230
and their first real encounter
with the natural world.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.130
Burton Appleton from Brooklyn
was sent to Glacier National

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.530
Park in northwest Montana.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.730
I once visited my brother
in Hackettstown, New Jersey,

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.960
which was maybe 50 miles
west of the Hudson River.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.060
I had an aunt who lived
out on Long Island,

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.500
Eastport, Long Island.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:08.200
Maybe that was 50 miles.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.960
I can't remember
visiting anyplace else.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.300
Those are the only two times
that I think I had left

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.160
Brooklyn, New York.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.900
We'd been on the train for
about 4 days, and we were

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:27.530
awakened at a stop, and I
looked out the window of my

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:32.930
upper berth, and there was
this mountain with snow

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:37.900
in April, and of course,
in Brooklyn, we had a bluff

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.800
maybe in Prospect Park we
could walk up, but nothing

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.160
like that in my past.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.000
Another thing I remember is
that I was out there by myself

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.560
one day with my Kodak box
camera, and I--to this day,

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.730
I don't believe it.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:40:00.460
A deer walked up to me
within 10 feet maybe.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.100
I stood stock still.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.060
I couldn't believe that,
and I took a picture, and as

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.900
soon as I clicked the camera,
the deer turned tail an ran,

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.360
and I have that photo.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:23.430
COYOTE: Claude Tyler, at age
16 the eldest of 6 boys and

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.200
2 girls in a desperately poor
farm family from Blossom,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.600
Texas, was dispatched to the
barren wastes of Death Valley

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.130
National Monument.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:37.160
TYLER: We loaded on a truck
somewheres in that area

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.660
and went to Death Valley,
and it was pretty warm then,

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.100
but in June, it
really did get hot.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:49.200
Fifth day of June,
it was 120 in the shade.

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:52.860
270 foot below sea level.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:56.930
Well, it was hot, and us
boys kind of got toughened

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.560
to it, I think.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:03.530
We all got a good suntan.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:07.300
COYOTE: Tyler was then sent to
Lassen Volcanic National Park

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.130
in northern California,
a peak more than

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.560
10,000 feet above sea level.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.930
TYLER: I'd never been to
the mountains before.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.730
It was all new to me.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.260
Kind of short-winded the
first time I went up there.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.930
Ha ha ha!

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:29.960
Get up above the tree line,
why, you get short of breath,

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:33.130
and I would make pictures and
send them home and tell them I

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.200
was doing all right and this
is where I'm at, and Mother

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.560
would write and say,
"Well, you be careful

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.000
on those mountains."

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.830
We got paid $30 a month of
which a whole $5.00 was ours.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:51.530
The rest of it went home,
and $25 a month seems like

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:55.700
nothing, but it made
a big difference.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.860
Money and dignity was
important because whenever you

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.730
need a shirt and you buy it,
if you bought it with your own

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:06.600
money, that's a good feeling.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.500
ROOSEVELT: It's very good
to be here at these

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.630
Virginia CCC camps.

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:23.100
I wish I could see them
all over the country.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.530
I hope that all over the
country they're in as fine

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.800
condition as the camps that
I have seen today.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.300
I wish that I could take a
couple of months off from the

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.760
White House and come down here
and live with them because I

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.400
know I'd get full of
health the way I have.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.460
LUJAN: We almost
thought he was God.

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.600
We really liked him.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.830
Because at the same time,
there were many other programs

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.730
having nothing to do with the
CCC, but there was progress,

00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:52.430
there was work,
there was money in

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.800
the community circulating.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.500
COYOTE: Besides the
conservation work they did,

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.760
the men also participated in
organized sports, hobby clubs,

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:06.460
discussion groups, and
classes meant to prepare them

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.900
for getting jobs once
they left the camps.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.900
At Big Bend, Juan Lujan helped
lay the foundations for new

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.860
park buildings and then,
because he spoke both Spanish

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:23.230
and English fluently,
became a museum guide.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.760
He was also put to
work teaching his

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:29.000
less-educated comrades.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.700
LUJAN: Most of the enrollees
in that particular camp had

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.260
not graduated
from high school.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.600
Many of them had little or
no education, and those of us

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:43.100
that had some, we volunteered
to teach classes, and some

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:46.730
of them wanted to learn how
to read and write Spanish.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:51.330
I taught some
of those, too.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.800
COYOTE: Juan Lujan would go
on to college, something his

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:59.230
mother always wanted him to do,
eventually earn a master's

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:03.000
and then a doctoral degree
and continue teaching others

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.260
for the rest of his life.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.030
After his time at Lassen,
Claude Tyler returned

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.730
to Blossom, Texas.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.360
TYLER: I went back
to school for a year.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.500
I went over to the school house,
and the teacher wanted

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:26.230
me to go from a--I had only
finished about the fifth

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:31.130
grade, and he looked over
some of the things that I took

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:34.760
in CC camps and correspondence
courses, and he put me

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.100
in the first year in high
school, and so I went one year

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.060
in high school,
and that's the last

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.260
of the education that I had.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.960
It's because my parents
hadn't really got up

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.300
on their feet real good.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:56.030
I went back to CC camps and
stayed two terms in there.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.000
APPLETON: I was not a very
good high-school student.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.900
My grades were not all that
good, and I am convinced to

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:04.960
this day that the only reason
I was able to matriculate

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.630
at the New York State College
of Forestry was that I

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.000
convinced the registrar or
the dean of admissions of my

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.900
experience in the CCC.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.160
That's what the
CCC did for me.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:25.300
COYOTE: Over the course of
the Depression, more than

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.960
3 million men would find work at
one time or another with the

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.360
Civilian Conservation Corps.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.300
They would build more than
97,000 miles of fire roads

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.660
in national forests, combat
soil erosion on 84 million

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:46.230
acres of farmland, and plant
3 billion trees, more than one

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.530
half the total reforestation
accomplished

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.200
in the nation's history.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.160
During that time, some
$218 million would be pumped

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:02.400
into projects solely within
the national parks,

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:09.430
including trails and buildings
that remain to this day.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:10.960
RUNTE: The Depression
is a golden age

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.300
because the National Park
Service is a federal agency,

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.960
and it's going to get all of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.960
"let's rebuild the
nation" dollars.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.160
And the budgets of the
National Park Service soar,

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.800
and as the National Park
Service looks at projects that

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.800
could put people to work,
Congress agrees,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.800
and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt agrees,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.260
and the National Park Service

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:37.960
suddenly finds itself swimming
in money relative to what it

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:42.060
had in the 1920s.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.360
ROOSEVELT: We are definitely in
an era of building today,

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.130
the best kind of building,

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:52.460
the building
of great public projects

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.760
for the benefit of the
public and with the definite

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:00.660
objective of building human
happiness at the same time.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.260
TYLER: Looking back on it now,
I believe that it helped a lot

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.400
of families have
a better life.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.500
I realize now that it was for
the benefit of the economy,

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:44.830
too, but I believe that a lot
of families might not have

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:47.800
been able to survive
if it hadn't have been

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.060
for that program.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.330
And I got to see a lot of the
world that I wouldn't have

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:57.860
seen before that if I hadn't
have done to the CC camps.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.560
Mount Lassen was
outstanding all right.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.660
Death Valley was just hot.

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.360
I don't know whether I'd
call that a favorite memory,

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:10.300
but I can remember it.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.160
[Clattering]

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.530
SCHULLERY: The national parks
have always been managed

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.330
pretty much by the
values of their time.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:28.260
It was still spectacle.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.500
Wild beauty was defined on
superficial levels that had

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.930
very little to do with
wildness and how wildness

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.530
actually works.

00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:44.160
Oddly enough, it's the
scientists who had the most to

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:49.530
do with redefining beauty.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.630
MAN AS GEORGE MELENDEZ WRIGHT:
In the end, the National Park

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.630
Service either will be praised
for intelligently conserving

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:59.530
the last fragments of
primitive America or condemned

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:03.500
for failure to hold
to the real purpose.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.400
George Melendez Wright.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.000
WOMAN: I think his passion
really shows through

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.160
in his writing.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.130
He was very persuasive.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:16.600
He could convince people who
really were against his ideas,

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.600
he could bring them along.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.530
He was a joyous person.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:28.400
He was very comfortable in
his own skin, not egotistical

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.000
but very confident in himself.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.860
He was a small person even
by Hispanic standards

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:39.260
but with a big heart, mind,
and presence.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.160
COYOTE: By 1936, George
Melendez Wright was married

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.960
with a growing family,
but he was busier

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.930
with is work than ever.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:52.130
The Wildlife Division he had
started within in the Park

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:57.430
Service now had 27 biologists
promoting Wright's vision that

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.060
park policies had to take
the animals and plants into

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:05.630
account, not just
the tourists.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.560
His personal interest in
Yellowstone's trumpeter swans,

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.000
the largest and most rare of
American water fowl, which had

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.330
been reduced by hunting to
a mere handful of breeding

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:20.560
pairs, had turned into a
personal crusade to save them

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.000
from extinction.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.560
Wright solicited the help
of local rod and gun clubs,

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:29.900
lobbied state fish and game
commissions and other federal

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:34.800
agencies, even donated some of
his own money again to create

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.000
a special wildlife refuge that
ultimately brought the swans

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.260
back from the brink.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.400
MAN AS GEORGE MELENDEZ WRIGHT:
Sometimes while I'm watching

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.860
these birds, the illusion of
the untouchability of this

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:52.030
wilderness becomes so strong
that it is stronger than

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:57.200
the reality, and the polished
roadway becomes the illusion,

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.860
the mirage that
has no substance.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.400
COYOTE: In February,
the traveled to the newly

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.030
authorized Big Bend National
Park in southwest Texas,

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.800
where the Chisos Mountains
rise out of the Chihuhuan

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.060
Desert and the Rio Grande cuts
through a series of dramatic

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:22.600
canyons separating the
United States from Mexico.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.730
With Roger Toll, another
rising star within the Park

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.730
Service, Wright was part of a
two-nation commission studying

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.260
the possibility of an
international park straddling

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.700
both sides of the border.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.600
His fluency in Spanish and his
outgoing disposition helped

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.530
him make friends with
his Mexican counterparts.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.130
After the meeting, he and
Toll headed for home.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:53.660
Near Deming, New Mexico,
an oncoming car blew a tire

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:57.560
and crashed head-on
into their vehicle.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.400
Both men were killed.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:03.460
George Melendez Wright was 31.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.930
Without him,
the Park Service's interest

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:11.730
in wildlife waned.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:15.400
By the end of the decade,
of the 27 biologists who had

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:21.000
once been under his
supervision, only 9 were left.

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:31.660
MAN: Scenery without
wildlife is scenery.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:38.260
Wildlife is a component
of the grander scene.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.700
Without that wildlife,
you don't have

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.630
a national park.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:51.230
George Melendez Wright was
a savior of wildlife

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:55.460
in America's national parks,
but more importantly,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.900
George Melendez Wright
is a savior

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:01.430
of the national park ideal.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:28.000
ROOSEVELT: I'm very keen about
travel, not only personally--

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.530
you know that--but also travel
for as many Americans as can

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:41.100
possibly afford it because those
Americans will be fulfilling

00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:45.730
a very desirable objective of
our citizenship, getting to

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:53.360
know their own country better,
and the more they see of it,

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:58.300
the more they will realize
the privileges which God

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.560
and nature have given
to the American people.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.660
COYOTE: Throughout
the Depression,

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.460
President Roosevelt made a
number of well-publicized visits

00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:17.130
to the national parks, glorying
in the chance to be outdoors

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:21.500
in the midst of such stunning
landscapes, even if the polio

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:25.300
that had destroyed his legs
confined him to the backseat

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:30.360
of his touring car, and he
cheerfully encouraged his

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:36.430
fellow citizens to
follow his example.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:40.300
ROOSEVELT: I decided today
that every year ought

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.230
to be National Parks Year.

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:48.160
There is nothing so American
as our national parks.

00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.560
The scenery and wildlife are
native, and the fundamental

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:55.530
idea behind the
parks is native.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:55:02.760
It is in brief that the
country belongs to the people.

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:07.930
They are not for
the rich alone.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.360
COYOTE: Despite hard times,
the number of park visitors

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:15.660
continued to rise during the
1930s from roughly 3 million

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:20.500
a year at the start of the
decade to 15.5 million

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:27.660
in 1939, and Roosevelt was
intent on setting aside more

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.060
places for them to visit.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:33.000
He turned his attention to
the northwestern corner of

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.230
Lake Superior off the coast
of Minnesota and Michigan

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:40.730
and the largest freshwater
island in the world, creating

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:44.300
Isle Royale National Park.

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:47.130
The president also used
his authority under

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:51.760
the Antiquities Act to bypass
Congress altogether and create

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.800
a string of national
monuments.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.600
Some of them would eventually
be elevated to park status,

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:02.360
including Joshua Tree in
southern California, named

00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.400
for the distinctive plants
Mormon pioneers believed

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.000
looked in silhouette liked the
Prophet Joshua raising his

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.500
arms to beckon them forward.

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:18.230
The Dry Tortugas, a remote
cluster of 7 tiny islands

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:21.900
70 miles off the
southernmost tip of Florida.

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:25.360
On one island sits the
largest brick fortification

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.960
in the world, Fort Jefferson,

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.500
used during the Civil War
as a prison.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.330
Capitol Reef in Utah, where
a hundred-mile fold

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:41.100
in the earth's crust exposes a
panoply of differently colored

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.200
rock formations
the Navajo Indians called

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.460
The Land of
the Sleeping Rainbow.

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.760
And off the coast of
Santa Barbara,

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.230
the Channel Islands,

00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:55.130
a crucial breeding ground for
hundreds of animal species,

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:59.430
including the California brown
pelican, whose nesting place

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.530
had virtually disappeared
everywhere else in the western

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:07.230
United States, an oasis of
undeveloped land just a few

00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:13.400
miles from the explosive urban
growth of greater Los Angeles.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.030
All clear!

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.230
ROOSEVELT: We should remember
that the development of our

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:33.200
national park system over a
period of many years has not

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:38.260
been a simple bed of roses.

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:43.200
It has been a long and fierce
fight against many private

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:47.560
interests, which were
entrenched in political

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.960
and economic power.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.630
MAN: This is an allocation
out of the total sum...

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:55.200
COYOTE: No one was more
willing to take on entrenched

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.160
interests than the president's

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:01.360
irascible Secretary of the
Interior Harold Ickes,

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:05.330
a self-described old curmudgeon.

00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:09.060
A Chicago lawyer and former
Republican stalwart known

00:58:09.060 --> 00:58:13.200
equally for his explosive
temper and his fierce devotion

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.930
to New Deal policies, he had
become one of Roosevelt's

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:20.700
closest and most
controversial advisors.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:23.700
"The meanest man who ever
sat in a cabinet office

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.700
"in Washington,"
Horace Albright said,

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:32.530
"and the best Secretary
of the Interior we ever had."

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.900
Ickes fought battles
on every front.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:39.300
One of his first acts was
to abolish the department's

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.560
segregated lunchrooms.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.930
Then he told the national
parks in the South to simply

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:47.760
ignore local Jim Crow laws

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.530
requiring separate
facilities for blacks.

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:55.100
At Virginia's Shenandoah
National Park, signs

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.230
segregating campgrounds
or picnic areas were

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.300
quietly taken down.

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.660
Ickes make more enemies by
repeatedly proposing the

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.430
creation of a Department of
Conservation that would put

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:12.330
national parks, national
forests, and all other natural

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:18.360
resources under the same
administrative control--his.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:23.130
Congress repeatedly refused,
but he continued to have

00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:27.760
Roosevelt's ear and trust
and was tirelessly effective

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:33.760
in advocating new parks
regardless of the opposition.

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.360
In 1937, Roosevelt
and Ickes entered

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:43.030
into a park controversy that
had been raging for 30 years.

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:47.130
On the Olympic Peninsula west
of Seattle, majestic mountains

00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:50.730
trapped the moist Pacific
winds, which dropped

00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:56.000
160 inches of rain a year,
nurturing verdant rain forests

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.060
that contained the largest
specimens in the world

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:03.100
of Douglas fir, red cedar,
western hemlock,

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.630
and Sitka spruce.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:09.460
For centuries, it was the
homeland of native tribes like

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:15.130
the Makah and Quinault,
the Hoh and Skokomish.

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:18.200
Over the years, more than
10 different bills had been

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.460
introduced in Congress to
make Mount Olympus National

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:25.300
Monument into a National Park.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:29.960
Each one was defeated, caught
in a seemingly endless battle

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.160
between the Forest Service
and the Park Service.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:38.930
Meanwhile, loggers were
approaching the last virgin

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:41.560
stands of rain forest.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.460
"Left to the care of the
Forest Service," Harold Ickes

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:48.100
contended, "such places
suffered the same fate as

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.730
"a pig in the stockyards.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:55.400
All that is left," he said,
"is the squeal."

01:00:55.400 --> 01:01:00.160
POPE: Harold Ickes was one of
the few Interior Secretaries

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.130
of the 20th Century who was as
big as the parks because Ickes

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:09.460
was the first Secretary of the
Interior who really engaged

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:12.830
the fact that you could save
a place once somebody had

01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.960
aspirations on it.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.530
The early parks were
created before anybody big

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:21.260
and powerful had aspirations,
and when San Francisco,

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.230
which was big and powerful,
drew its bead on Hetch Hetchy,

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:28.500
San Francisco won,
Hetch Hetchy lost.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.000
Ickes said, "Wait a minute.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.060
"Big, powerful people may
have their aspirations

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:38.660
"on the Olympics,
but they don't have to win."

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.700
COYOTE: The president decided
to have a look for himself,

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.230
but his visit was arranged
by the Forest Service and its

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:50.330
allies in the lumber and pulp
mill industries, all of them

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:53.800
intent on convincing Roosevelt
that a national park would

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.500
ruin an already
suffering local economy.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.430
No detail was overlooked.

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:04.260
They excluded all
Park Service officials from

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:08.400
the invitation list, scheduled
a massive logging train to

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.260
rumble past the president's
lodge during his breakfast,

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:16.300
a not-so-subtle reminder of
the jobs at stake, and they

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.530
moved the sign marking the
National Forest boundary to

01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:23.960
give the impression that
a heavily logged area,

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.230
now several square miles
of burned stumps, was not

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:30.700
on federal land.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.500
"I hope the son of a bitch
who's responsible for this is

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.960
"roasting in hell," Roosevelt
said, not realizing that he

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:42.630
was actually looking at a
national forest and his guide

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:45.830
was the forest supervisor.

01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:48.930
When Roosevelt learned
about the deception, it only

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:54.630
increased his commitment
to protect the forest.

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:59.030
On June 29, 1938, with
the president's passionate

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:03.430
support, Congress converted
the National Monument to

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:08.400
Olympic National Park and gave
Roosevelt the authority to

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:13.260
expand its boundaries,
which he soon did, saving two

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.000
of the most threatened valleys
by stripping an additional

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.800
187,000 acres away from
the Forest Service.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.960
MAN: When the weekend comes
around, I get restless.

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:37.200
At night, I bring maps of
Mount Rainier into bed with me

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.460
and fall asleep
looking at them.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.660
When it's time to depart for
a trip, I cannot stay in bed

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:48.700
any longer and get up
before anyone else.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.600
I can't wait to
go hiking again.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:58.930
Iwao Matsushita.

01:03:58.930 --> 01:04:00.660
COYOTE: Among the millions
of people who

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:04.600
took President Roosevelt's
advice to visit national parks

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.860
were Iwao Matsushita and his
wife Hanaye, Japanese citizens

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.830
who had moved to
Seattle in 1919.

01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:18.300
Each Sunday, the Seattle
Camera Club, which he had

01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:21.430
helped start, organized
outings to nearby

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:25.430
Mount Rainier National Park,
where Matsushita not only took

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:30.000
still photographs but also
created home movies and kept

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.630
a small journal to
record their adventures.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:35.560
[Projector running]

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.930
MAN AS IWAO MATSUSHITA: Beyond
these high valleys, you can

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.560
see the craggily white
mountains, whose peaks are

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.760
showing through a thick fog.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.800
It is a view worthy of
a sumi-e painting.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.300
Looking to the north, you can
see Mount Rainier appearing

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:09.000
majestically like our king
of mountains Mount Fuji.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.400
I sit on a patch of heather.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.960
I marvel at the speed
with which clouds are

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.260
changing their shape.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:20.700
I crouch by a stream fed by
the remaining snow to enjoy

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:25.200
a cold drink of water
and open up my sushi.

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:33.330
COYOTE: By the mid-1930s,
Iwao and Hanaye had visited

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:38.960
the park more than 100 times,
drawn to the place they called

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:41.660
Holy Mountain.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:43.000
MAN AS IWAO MATSUSHITA:
Everyone here is having a good

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.030
old time, and no one had
a reason to frown.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:52.500
Like a paradise of our
own world and time.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.530
Looking up, I feel as though
the great snowy mountain were

01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:59.800
an affectionate mother to
all the people playing

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.460
on her slopes.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:10.130
COYOTE: Farther to the south,
another Japanese immigrant was

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:13.500
finding similar joy
and inspiration

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.760
in another national park.

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:22.260
MAN: Success or failure
is not my aim in life.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:27.830
Whether I be a flake of
snow or only a drop of dew,

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:30.130
I do not care.

01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:34.130
I wish only to paint with
gratitude to nature in my

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:38.860
heart and with
sincerity in my brush.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:44.000
This is my future,
this is my biography.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.030
Chiura Obata.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:51.760
COYOTE: Chiura Obata had
arrived in the United States

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.230
in 1903 at age 17, a promising
young painter whose original

01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:01.130
intention was to stay only
briefly in America before

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:06.100
going on to Paris to continue
his career, but he soon set

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:10.300
down roots in San Francisco,
creating some of the only

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.630
on-site sketches of the
destruction wrought by the

01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:18.730
Great 1906 Earthquake, making
a name for himself in the bay

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:23.100
area's international art
community, even co-founding

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:29.730
the first Japanese-American
baseball team on the mainland.

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:34.300
Then in 1927, he visited
the high Sierra

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.700
and John Muir's Yosemite.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.830
MAN AS CHIURA OBATA: In the
evening, it gets very cold.

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:43.960
The coyotes howl
in the distance.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.160
In the mid-sky,
the moon is arcing.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.230
All the trees are
standing here and there...

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.700
[Coyote howls]

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.000
and it is very quiet.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.730
[Water running]

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:00.930
You can learn from
the teachings within

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:03.860
this quietness.

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:09.900
Some people teach by speeches,
some by talking, but I think

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:16.230
it is important that you
are taught by silence.

01:08:16.230 --> 01:08:20.660
WOMAN: I think for my
grandfather it was not only

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.930
that he was able to paint
this landscape, but for him,

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:30.060
it became a spiritual
inspiration, as well, and he

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.960
would describe it that this
was "the greatest harvest

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:37.300
"for my whole life and future
in painting," and not only did

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.700
he paint for art that he would
bring home but also even just

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.630
little postcards.

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:47.600
He sent several postcards back
to his children back home.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.700
One of them reads, "Gyo-chan,
the lovely moon is gone.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.600
"It went to bed early to sleep.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.330
"Grow big and shine more."

01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:06.100
COYOTE: For two months, he
and two other artist friends

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.800
tramped the high country,
taking in all the park had to

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:16.000
offer, exposing Obata to what
he called "not just shizen,"

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.330
or nature, "but dai-shizen,
great nature."

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:40.300
Obata's Yosemite images drew
huge crowds when they were put

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.860
on exhibit and rave
reviews from the critics.

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:47.730
"To see our native beauty
spots through the eyes

01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:51.700
"of a foreign artist of high
rank," one of them wrote,

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:56.530
"is to find new charm
in our own land."

01:09:56.530 --> 01:10:00.900
By the 1930s, Obata had been
asked to join the art faculty

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.530
at the University of
California, and every summer,

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:08.500
he and his family would return
to Yosemite, where he gave

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.760
lectures, taught outdoor
sketching classes to the

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:16.830
tourists, and made his annual
pilgrimage to a special mountain

01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:21.160
spring, whose clear water he
collected for use in making

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.930
his paints throughout
the rest of the year.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.130
MAN AS CHIURA OBATA:
I dedicate my paintings first to

01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:33.460
the great nature of
California, which has always

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:40.960
given me great lessons,
comfort, and nourishment,

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.960
second to the people who share
the same thoughts as though

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.800
drawing water from one
river under one tree.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:59.960
My paintings, created by the
humble brush of a mediocre man,

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.060
are nothing but
expressions of my

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:05.460
whole-hearted praise
and gratitude.

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.600
COYOTE: By 1940, thanks in
great part to the national

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.460
parks they had come
to cherish as their own,

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:20.900
both Chiura Obata
and Iwao Matsushita

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:24.830
had decided
the United States was home,

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:28.460
even if its laws at
the time prohibited them from

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:34.760
becoming citizens because
they had been born in Japan.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:38.660
When the company he worked
for ordered him back to Tokyo,

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:42.230
Matsushita resigned.

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:46.260
The Depression would make
finding a new job difficult,

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.300
but he and Hanaye wanted
to stay close to their

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:51.960
Holy Mountain.

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:58.800
MAN AS IWAO MATSUSHITA:
I enjoy my life in Seattle.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.800
I have so many happy memories
with nice people, both

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.000
Japanese and Americans.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:14.900
I have visited Mount Rainier,
my lover, more than 190 times.

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:19.260
I cannot leave Seattle when I
think of the beautiful views

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:22.000
of Mount Rainier.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.460
Iwao Matsushita.

01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:40.800
MAN: Fortunate he is who may
see Mount McKinley against

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:48.700
the summer midnight sky, the
lush fern forests of Kilauea,

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:53.460
the white jubilance
of Yosemite's waters,

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:59.000
and the somber rock and surf
of Acadia National Park.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.860
To record and interpret
these qualities for others,

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:07.000
to brighten the drab moods
of cities, and build high

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.730
horizons of the spirit on the
edge of plain and desert,

01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:19.160
these are some of the
many obligations of art.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:24.100
Ansel Adams.

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.530
COYOTE: In 1938, a book
arrived at Harold Ickes'

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:33.100
office, entitled "Sierra
Nevada: the John Muir Trail."

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.130
It was filled with stunning
images of the mountainous

01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:40.400
Kings River Canyon region of
the southern Sierra, captured

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.130
by an aspiring photographer
named Ansel Adams.

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:48.730
This was his first book of
landscapes, and since he knew

01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:51.660
that Ickes was interested in
making the area a national

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:58.030
park, Adams had sent it along
with his personal compliments.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:14:00.800
Ickes took it to the
White House to show

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.430
President Roosevelt, who
liked it so much he quickly

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:08.200
appropriated it for his own.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:12.060
Ansel Adams was on his way to
becoming the most influential

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:15.430
photographer for the cause of
national parks since

01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:19.460
William Henry Jackson's images
of Yellowstone had helped

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:21.800
persuade Congress to
create the world's

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.860
first park in 1872.

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:30.300
There is this unending
argument about whether art can

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:35.060
affect human affairs, and
I think Ansel is one great

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.500
example of how it did.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.160
Muir is another example.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.460
Muir's writings absolutely
had effect, and it wasn't just

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.630
propaganda writings.

01:14:43.630 --> 01:14:45.900
It was his evocative
descriptive writings

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.630
of the Sierras.

01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:49.260
Same with Ansel.

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.430
Ansel used his photographs in
this movement and used them

01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:57.800
very effectively.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.860
COYOTE: The sensitive only
child of a patrician

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:04.830
San Francisco family, Adams
had first encountered nature

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:08.530
during a family
trip to Yosemite.

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:12.700
There, seeing the
waterfalls and the rock faces,

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.960
El Capitan,
The Three Brothers, Half Dome,

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:20.160
he was transfixed.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:23.630
"We should not casually pass
them," Adams wrote later,

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:29.300
"for they are the very heart
of the earth speaking to us."

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.260
"I knew my destiny," he added,

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:36.560
"when I first
experienced Yosemite."

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:40.660
In the 1920s when he made
two pack trips into the

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.760
Kings Canyon Country, it ignited
in him the conviction that

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:48.460
the place was just as
inspirationally spectacular as

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:55.200
Yosemite and equally deserving
of federal protection.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.800
It was an old dream.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:02.860
John Muir had fought for
it and failed in the 1890s.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.500
Then Stephen Mather had
taken up the cause

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.660
with the same result.

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:11.730
Now Adams and the Sierra Club
believed they had an ally who

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:16.900
shared the dream and had the
power to make it come true--

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:20.930
Secretary of the
Interior Harold Ickes.

01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:24.560
"If I had my way about
national parks," Ickes said,

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:29.030
"I would create one without a
road in it, a place where man

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:34.700
"would not try to
improve upon God."

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:38.200
Ickes saw in Kings Canyon
his chance to create a new

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.830
kind of park,
a wilderness park in which

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:47.060
roads, hotels, and other large
developments would be banned.

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:50.460
He thought it should be called
the John Muir Kings Canyon

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:54.230
Wilderness Park, and he threw
himself into the fight against

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:58.660
the forces that instead wanted
dams, irrigation projects,

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:04.330
grazing, timber harvesting,
and elaborate tourist resorts.

01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:07.630
Through a series of shrewd
maneuvers, he turned one

01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:11.730
private interest group against
the other, waged ceaseless

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:14.900
battle against the Forest
Service's efforts to retain

01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:18.400
control over the land,
and persuaded most

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.730
of the major conservation
groups not to abandon their

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:24.830
support because of
the compromises he felt

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:27.030
he had to make.

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:30.060
"Ickes was," one opponent
of the park said,

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:35.500
"overambitious, egocentric,
ruthless, unethical,

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:40.500
"and highly effective."

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.960
In the final moments before
the vote in Congress, the name

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.630
was simplified,
dropping any reference

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:49.860
to John Muir and wilderness.

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:54.260
On March 4, 1940, President
Roosevelt signed the law

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:58.800
creating Kings Canyon
National park.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:03.330
Because it was a roadless park
and because of his disability,

01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:08.800
Roosevelt would never be able
to see Kings Canyon in person.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.930
Instead, he contented himself
with following John Muir's

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:20.660
trail through the photographs
and words of Ansel Adams.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.360
MAN AS ANSEL ADAMS: The dawn
wind in the high Sierra is not

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.530
just a passage of cool air
through forest conifers,

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:32.560
but within the labyrinth of
human consciousness becomes

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:39.960
a stirring of some world magic
of most delicate persuasion.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.260
Here are forces familiar
with the eons of creation,

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:47.730
contemplating the flow of life
and of change through living

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:53.260
things, each of them tied to
cloud, stone, and sunlight.

01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.260
We may make new discoveries
about ourselves.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:06.060
COYOTE: In the fall of 1941,
Ickes decided Adams could be

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:09.130
of even greater assistance.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:14.030
He put him on the Interior
Department's payroll at $22.22

01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:18.060
a day and told him to bring
back photographs of all the

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:22.600
parks for prominent display
in the capital city.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.800
Adams said it was one of the
best ideas ever to come out

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:29.830
of Washington and happily
packed up his station wagon to

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.900
set out on his assignment.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:36.230
Off and on for the next
8 years, he would compile

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:40.360
thousands of images of the
national parks and visit every

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:45.330
one of them except, to his
great regret, the Everglades.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.600
[Radio static]

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.860
ANNOUNCER: This bulletin
from the NBC Newsroom

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:10.030
here in New York.

01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:12.060
SECOND ANNOUNCER:
We've just had a flash...

01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.660
ANNOUNCER: Action
against Pearl Harbor defenses.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.030
SECOND ANNOUNCER: saying that
a state of war exists

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:16.230
with the United States.

01:20:16.230 --> 01:20:17.400
THIRD ANNOUNCER: That the
Japanese have attacked

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.460
the United States Naval Base.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.100
SECOND ANNOUNCER: Now we
begin to see through things,

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:25.230
it's obvious that the--the,
uh, Imperial General's staff

01:20:25.230 --> 01:20:29.100
has precipitated an attack
and now announces

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.460
that that attack is war.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:34.960
COYOTE: But just a few months
after Adams began his travels,

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:38.930
the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor, and the United States

01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:42.760
was thrust into
another World War.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:47.260
Now Adams pursued his project
with even greater passion.

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.830
To those who questioned
whether his artistry could be

01:20:49.830 --> 01:20:52.630
put to a better purpose
in wartime, he had

01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:54.660
a simple reply.

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:58.500
"I believe my work," he wrote,
"relates most efficiently to

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:03.660
"what we are fighting for."

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.730
Like everything else in
American life, the national

01:21:06.730 --> 01:21:10.430
parks now found themselves
subordinated to the all-out

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:17.000
effort to defeat Japan
and its ally Germany.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.830
The CCC camps closed down as
the men who had been working

01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:24.800
on trails and park buildings
became soldiers and shipped

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.760
out overseas.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.500
Park budgets were cut to
a quarter of their

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.400
pre-war levels.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.860
Just as in the First World War,
pressures mounted to open

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:40.200
them up to timber cutting,
mining, and grazing.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:45.600
Harold Ickes did his best
do minimize the damage.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.330
MAN AS ANSEL ADAMS: When
World War II began, there were

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:50.100
strong pressures in many
circles to close the national

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:53.600
parks for the duration with
the thought that no one needs

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.200
a vacation in wartime.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:59.000
Ickes disagreed with this,
stating that in times

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.560
of national stress and sorrow
the people needed precisely

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.830
what the national
parks could offer.

01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:09.260
Ansel Adams.

01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:12.330
COYOTE: When Ickes informed
Roosevelt that a proposed

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:15.460
bombing range would
endanger the breeding grounds

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:18.930
of the rare trumpeter swan
that George Melendez Wright

01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:22.760
had worked so hard to
preserve, the president dashed

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.200
off a quick note to
his Secretary of War

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.730
countermanding the decision.

01:22:28.730 --> 01:22:31.660
"The verdict is for the
trumpeter swan and against

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.900
"the Army," Roosevelt wrote.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:39.900
"The Army must find a
different nesting place."

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.800
In 1941, the year leading up to

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.400
America's entry into the war,
a record 21 million people had

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:50.900
visited the national parks.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:55.030
The next year, the figure
dropped to 9 million, then to

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:59.900
6.8 million in 1943.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:03.100
All across the system,
many park rangers changed

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.530
uniforms and went off to war.

01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:10.200
"Poor, old National Park
Service is in a bad way,"

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:12.860
a now retired
Horace Albright wrote to his

01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:17.460
successor after being informed
of all the cutbacks,

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:22.030
but the parks still
had a role to play.

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:25.200
At Mount Rainier, units
of what would become

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.760
the 10th Mountain Division were
taught how to survive in high

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.900
altitudes and cold weather.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.700
War planners also realized
that national parks could

01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.800
provide much needed rest
and recuperation

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.460
for battle-weary soldiers.

01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:45.160
The Navy took over the swank
Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:48.060
for a convalescence center.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.360
Rest camps went up in Sequoia,
Carlsbad Caverns,

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.030
the Grand Canyon,

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.200
and Mount McKinley
National Park in Alaska was

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:02.130
transformed into an
army recreation camp.

01:24:02.130 --> 01:24:05.660
Soldiers stationed in the
Aleutian Islands could fish,

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:11.730
hike, ski, skate, and relax.

01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:16.130
In 1943, 1.6 million
soldiers found

01:24:16.130 --> 01:24:20.830
momentary solace and enjoyment
in a national park,

01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:23.760
1/4 of the total visitation.

01:24:30.930 --> 01:24:34.800
That same year, Ansel Adams
interrupted his photographic

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.630
survey and went to the
Owens Valley of California

01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:41.930
in the eastern shadow of
Mount Whitney to document

01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:45.060
something entirely different.

01:24:45.060 --> 01:24:48.300
After the surprise attack
on Pearl Harbor, President

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:52.760
Roosevelt signed an executive
order requiring all people

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.030
of Japanese descent living on
the West Coast, even those who

01:24:57.030 --> 01:25:00.260
were United States citizens,
to be uprooted from their

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:03.630
homes and sent to
internment camps

01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:06.330
for the duration of the war.

01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:10.130
"We must prosecute this war
with all ruthless efficiency,"

01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:13.200
Adams wrote after he had
photographed the Manzanar

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:18.060
Internment Camp, "but we must
be certain that, as the rights

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.760
"of the individual are the
most sacred elements of our

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:26.030
"society, we will not allow
passion, vengeance, hatred,

01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:30.130
"and racial antagonism to cloud
the principles of universal

01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:32.500
"justice and mercy."

01:25:40.330 --> 01:25:46.500
WOMAN: Dear Husband, I'm
a little too much tired,

01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.860
but I'm sure I can live
here all right.

01:25:52.330 --> 01:25:54.230
Just imagine a mountain camp.

01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:02.000
When the sky's clear,
we will see our holy

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.900
Mount Rainier, I suppose.

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:12.700
I will write you
again very soon.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:18.860
Lovingly yours, Hanaye.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.930
COYOTE: Because he had worked
for a Japanese company,

01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:26.260
Iwao Matsushita was arrested
and taken away from his wife

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.830
in the first hours
after Pearl Harbor.

01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:34.960
Hanaye was put in a temporary
detention center near Seattle,

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:37.530
where she tried her best
to boost the spirits of her

01:26:37.530 --> 01:26:41.400
husband far away in
an internment camp

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.900
in western Montana.

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:50.130
WOMAN AS HANAYE MATSUSHITA:
Dear Husband, after severe

01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:56.660
rain, the sky became clear,
and we saw Mount Rainier over

01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:03.900
the hill yesterday
for the first time.

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:09.030
There will actually be a
day when you'll be released

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:13.030
and we'll be able
to rest peacefully.

01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:16.930
Once in a while, I dream
about running around the base

01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:19.560
of Mount Rainier.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:25.560
Remember the times we hiked
through the mountain together?

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.030
It all seems like a dream.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.630
MAN AS CHIURA OBATA: The sudden
burst of Pearl Harbor

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:43.760
was as if the Mother Earth on
which we stood was swept by

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:47.700
the terrific force of a
big wave of resentment

01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:50.130
of the American people.

01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:54.100
Our dignity and our
hopes were crushed.

01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:02.600
COYOTE: Friends of Chiura Obata
had pleaded with the

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.300
federal government that the
artist posed no security

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:10.430
threat and even suggested that
he be taken instead to his

01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:13.130
beloved Yosemite.

01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:15.960
The request was denied.

01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:19.300
Obata and his family were
forced to go to a camp

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:22.460
in Topaz, Utah.

01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:25.700
To help keep his and his
fellow prisoners' minds off

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.700
what he called
"the intolerable sin" of their

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:33.200
incarceration, Obata opened
an art school at the camp

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.500
and continued his own
sketching and painting.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:15.030
HILL: So here he was
basically with a community

01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:17.930
of fellow Japanese.

01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:20.830
"Yes, we are in this desert,
but don't just look

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:23.360
"at the dust and the ground,
don't just be depressed

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.660
"about what's happening.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:28.300
"You can somehow lift
your spirits by looking

01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.660
"at the mountains that
are surrounding us."

01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:34.430
They were not the same
mountains that he had

01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:38.760
experienced in the Sierras
of course, and yet,

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.900
he felt comforted.

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:42.560
He would use that word.

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:48.530
"I still feel comforted and
nurtured by great nature."

01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:51.660
And he wanted other people
to understand this, as well.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:02.430
COYOTE: One of his paintings,
"Moonlight Over Topaz,"

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:06.160
was given to the president's
wife, Eleanor Roosevelt,

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:09.260
in thanks for her speaking
out for fair treatment

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.800
of Japanese Americans.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:17.300
Years later in remembrance
of his personal ordeal, Obata

01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:21.100
would paint "Glorious Struggle,"
the image of a tree

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:25.460
in Yosemite's high Sierra,
whose own struggle to survive

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:31.130
seemed to give him strength
and hope in his darkest hour.

01:30:31.130 --> 01:30:34.500
One subject he loved to
paint again and again

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.800
was the sequoia.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:40.230
For him, they were
this great vertical

01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:45.500
line that connected heaven and
earth, and for him, he saw

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:51.500
the life of a person in these
trees and that no matter the

01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:57.030
storms and trials of life that
these trees survive with great

01:30:57.030 --> 01:31:02.130
dignity and great strength.

01:31:02.130 --> 01:31:04.600
MAN AS CHIURA OBATA: In such
times, I heard the gentle

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:09.360
but strong whisper of
the Sequoia gigantean.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.200
"Hear me, you poor man.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:18.030
"I've stood here more than
3,700 years in rain, snow,

01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:24.800
"storm, and even mountain fire,
still keeping my thankful

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.560
"attitude strongly with nature.

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:35.330
"Do not cry, do not spend your
time and energy worrying.

01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:39.730
"You have children following.

01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:44.930
"Keep up your unity.
Come with me."

01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:46.460
Chiura Obata.

01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:02.800
COYOTE: In the midst of
the war, a letter arrived

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.730
at the White House for
President Roosevelt.

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:10.060
MAN: My dear Mr. President,
many years ago,

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.900
I purchased some
30,000 acres of land

01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:18.660
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
confidently expecting

01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:21.460
that the federal government
would gladly accept

01:32:21.460 --> 01:32:27.930
the land as a gift to be added
to its national park system.

01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:30.600
15 years have passed.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.500
The government has not
accepted the property.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.830
I have now determined to
dispose of the property,

01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:41.960
selling it if necessary in
the market to any

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:45.030
satisfactory buyer.

01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:50.700
Very sincerely,
John D. Rockefeller Jr.

01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.000
COYOTE: The longest
festering fight in the history

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:56.100
of the parks was
about to erupt into

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.900
a full-scale battle.

01:33:06.230 --> 01:33:09.630
Back in the 1920s,
Horace Albright had shown

01:33:09.630 --> 01:33:13.030
Mr. and Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller Jr.

01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:17.230
the flat, sage-brush- covered
plain called Jackson Hole

01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:20.700
and explained to them his
dream that all of it,

01:33:20.700 --> 01:33:22.500
the valley floor as well as

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:26.560
the mountains, would one
day be preserved, but when

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:31.530
Congress had created Grand
Teton National Park in 1929,

01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:38.100
it left the valley alone and
set aside only the mountains.

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:41.930
Meanwhile, Rockefeller
continued anonymously buying

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:46.300
up ranches and homesteads in
the valley with the intention

01:33:46.300 --> 01:33:53.000
of donating it all for the
park's expansion, but Wyoming

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.830
politicians, who had learned
of Rockefeller's scheme,

01:33:56.830 --> 01:34:01.300
did everything they could to
thwart his plan, not wanting

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.200
Washington to tell them what
they could and could not do

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.860
with their land.

01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:10.360
The state's sole congressman
even introduced a bill calling

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:15.060
for the complete abolition
of Grand Teton National Park

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:18.030
despite the fact that the
mountains were not part

01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:21.630
of the dispute.

01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:23.100
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
I must confess I get pretty

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:26.030
discouraged at times in
trying to understand some

01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:28.000
of the people out there.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.030
It almost makes one weep,
not for one's self

01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:34.330
because after all what
difference does it make to

01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:38.360
an individual what happens
to Wyoming, but one weeps

01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.300
for Wyoming itself.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:43.500
Horace Albright.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:47.030
COYOTE: Albright was a private
citizen but more determined

01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:50.660
than ever to see
his dream fulfilled.

01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:56.000
In 1943 with Congress still
unwilling to enlarge the park,

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.900
he and Rockefeller and
Harold Ickes decided that their

01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:03.330
only hope lay in the president's
unique authority under

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:08.430
the Antiquities Act to create
a national monument.

01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:11.400
Rockefeller's letter to
Roosevelt was meant to prod

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.200
the president into action.

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.400
It worked.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:22.360
On March 15, 1943, Roosevelt
signed an executive order

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.260
establishing Jackson Hole
National Monument, placing

01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:33.860
221,610 acres of federal land
on the eastern border of

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:38.660
Grand Teton National Park
under Park Service control.

01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:44.930
In Wyoming, the response was a
declaration of political war.

01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:48.200
The president, one senator
said, had committed

01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.500
"a foul, sneaking,
Pearl Harbor blow."

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:55.030
A journalist wrote that
Roosevelt's action followed

01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:56.860
the general lines of
Adolf Hitler's

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:59.760
seizure of Austria.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:03.700
MAN: When this happened,
it was a big uproar,

01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.400
lots of talk,
lots of talk, and the ranchers

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:12.330
were totally opposed, and
they thought their grazing

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:16.660
rights were being destroyed.

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:19.700
COYOTE: Wyoming's governor
threatened to use state police

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:23.560
against any National Park
official attempting to assume

01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:26.100
authority in the new monument.

01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:30.430
Some Forest Service employees
gutted their ranger stations

01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:34.000
before turning them over to
the Park Service, and hoping

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.100
to provoke a confrontation and
draw attention to their cause,

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:42.560
a group of armed local
ranchers, led by the aging

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.500
movie star Wallace Beery,
defiantly herded 500 head

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:52.160
of cattle across the
monument without a permit.

01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.360
MAN: I was born here in
Jackson Hole in 1912.

01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:00.700
There was pretty strong
resentment about the manner

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:06.030
in which the monument had been
created, and we had rifles,

01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:09.860
and we drove cattle across the
Gros Ventre River and across

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:12.700
the monument land, and
Wallace Beery was right

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.860
at the--right at the head.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:19.630
ostensibly to shoot anybody
who might try to stop us.

01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:22.060
No one tried to stop us,
but we did get

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:24.760
a lot of attention.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.660
COYOTE: In Washington,
Wyoming's delegation pushed

01:37:27.660 --> 01:37:31.600
through a bill abolishing the
national monument and turning

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.060
the land back to
the Forest Service.

01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:37.860
Roosevelt vetoed it.

01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:41.230
The state of Wyoming then
went to court, claiming that

01:37:41.230 --> 01:37:44.660
Jackson Hole lacked the
objects of scientific or

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:50.360
historic interest necessary
for national monument status.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.600
Postcards showing a ramshackle
outhouse were circulated

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.930
with a message saying,
"These are some

01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:59.460
"of the historic
structures here.

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:03.730
"This is one known to have
been occupied several times

01:38:03.730 --> 01:38:06.930
"by Horace M. Albright."

01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:11.030
A federal court dismissed the
case, saying it was a dispute

01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:14.700
between the executive and
legislative branches which

01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:20.630
the judiciary would do well
to steer clear of.

01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:26.830
In 1945, Roosevelt died
and World War II ended,

01:38:26.830 --> 01:38:32.030
but the battle of
Jackson Hole roared on.

01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:33.860
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
Dealing with Wyoming is like

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:36.060
dealing with the Russians.

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.860
You never get anywhere
by trying to cooperate.

01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:41.900
Horace Albright.

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.160
COYOTE: "This was a battle,"
the retired Albright said,

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.930
"I had to get into."

01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:51.030
He lobbied his Republican
friends like former president

01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:55.030
Herbert Hoover and marshaled a
campaign by major conservation

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:58.530
groups to rally their members
to tell Congress that

01:38:58.530 --> 01:39:01.900
the American people also
had a stake in what

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:04.460
happened in Wyoming.

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:08.360
A study was published showing
that retail sales taxes

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.230
in Jackson Hole had doubled
and the region's overall

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:17.030
economy had been strengthened
by the boost in tourism,

01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:20.730
but the local political
climate remained decidedly,

01:39:20.730 --> 01:39:25.600
stubbornly antipark.

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.760
Finally in 1950 after it
became clear that the bitter

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:33.430
battle would never end in
unconditional surrender by

01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:38.730
either side, a compromise
was worked out.

01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:41.700
Teton County would be
reimbursed for lost property

01:39:41.700 --> 01:39:46.660
taxes, existing grazing
rights were grandfathered in,

01:39:46.660 --> 01:39:50.030
and the migratory elk herd
would be managed by both the

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:53.500
Park Service and the state,
which would be permitted to

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:57.830
oversee supervised hunts.

01:39:57.830 --> 01:40:02.660
In return, the bulk of Jackson
Hole National Monument became

01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:07.100
part of an enlarged
Grand Teton National Park,

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:11.230
now 3 times its original size.

01:40:11.230 --> 01:40:15.530
Included in it was the 30,000
acres of private land

01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:20.330
John D. Rockefeller Jr. had been
trying so hard to give away.

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:28.200
MURIE: So it's not
just the spectacular.

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.960
It's the foreground.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.760
You have to have foregrounds
to wilderness, you have to

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.500
have the highlands and middle
lands and the lowlands,

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:43.400
and a huge piece of northern
Jackson Hole is saved from

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:48.330
strip malls, saved from
what happened to--to--down

01:40:48.330 --> 01:40:51.230
in the town of Jackson.

01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:54.030
COYOTE: Tucked away in the
compromise that finally ended

01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.900
the battle of Jackson Hole was
another concession:

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:02.200
"According to this provision,
future United States presidents

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:06.230
"are barred from ever again
using executive action to

01:41:06.230 --> 01:41:08.760
"establish new
national monuments

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.360
"in the state of Wyoming except

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.130
"by the express permission
of Congress."

01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:19.730
Wyoming, the state with the
distinction of having the

01:41:19.730 --> 01:41:23.760
world's first national park,
Yellowstone, and the first

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.160
national monument,
Devil's Tower, now had another

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.000
distinction--the only state
where the Antiquities Act

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.030
is null and void.

01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:39.060
HANSEN: I was one who was very
critical of the Rockefellers

01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:46.030
and did all I was able to do
to try to thwart their plans,

01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:50.060
and I'm grateful now that I
wasn't successful because I

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:54.900
have to appreciate as everyone
else does the uniqueness

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:56.860
and the beauty of this area.

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.460
Thank God for
the Rockefellers.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.800
I've told them on more than
one occasion that I'm glad

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.760
I lost that fight.

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.330
WOMAN: For all the
bureaucracy, for all the red

01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:12.100
tape, for all the arguments
about public policy,

01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:18.430
our national parks are first
and foremost places of love,

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:21.400
and I think each American can
look into their own hearts

01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:25.530
and tell you, "This is my
national park," and it might

01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:28.130
be the Great Smokys,
it might be Yosemite.

01:42:28.130 --> 01:42:31.100
For our family,
it's Grand Teton.

01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:34.560
This is the range
of our memory.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.700
My great-grandfather brought
my grandfather, who brought

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:43.100
my father, who brought
us as children.

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:46.600
It's the last place my
mother came before she died.

01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:53.200
It's also the last place my
brother took his family before

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.100
he succumbed to lymphoma.

01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:58.130
I'll never forget.
We were at the Murie Ranch,

01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:02.000
and Steve and Ann
and the girls were walking

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.460
toward the Snake River.

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:09.030
It was pink light, alpenglow,
and Steve stopped,

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:10.960
and you could see the
reflections of the Tetons

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:16.800
in one of the pools, and he
turned to Ann and the girls,

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:21.100
and he said,
"Mark this moment."

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:26.760
And then 5 elks went across
the Snake River, and I watched

01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:30.660
this family of 5 return.

01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:34.830
These are the stories that
allow us to go home and face

01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:38.930
not only our lives
but even our deaths.

01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:42.860
That's the power of these
remembered landscapes.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.400
DUNCAN: The Declaration of
Independence began with this

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:08.460
incredible statement that
all men, all human beings

01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:12.160
are created equal.

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:16.600
We've been chasing that ideal,
those words for the rest

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:21.100
of our history, often too
slowly, never quite reaching

01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:28.700
it even yet, but that's the
statement that we're chasing.

01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:32.400
The national park idea,
which is the best idea we had

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:36.930
after we became a nation,
didn't start that way

01:44:36.930 --> 01:44:40.200
with a bold statement,
grand ideals that we're

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:42.130
trying to chase.

01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:45.230
It began sort of
experimentally,

01:44:45.230 --> 01:44:49.560
improvisationally, and it's
only as we've moved through

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:57.130
time that we have added this
notion of what a park is

01:44:57.130 --> 01:45:01.260
and what's allowed in it and
what's not allowed in it,

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:06.360
what we should be drawing
from it, but like the notion

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:11.160
of freedom, we've always been
arguing over it, we've always

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:15.460
been trying to grapple with
its meaning, and always trying

01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:20.930
to on the one hand remain true
to the ideal but leaving it up

01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:25.060
to each succeeding generation
to either push it a little bit

01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:32.530
farther or broaden
it a little bit more.

01:45:32.530 --> 01:45:34.230
COYOTE: In the midst
of Franklin Roosevelt's

01:45:34.230 --> 01:45:39.160
presidency, the world renowned
contralto Marian Anderson had

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:42.500
been denied the
opportunity to perform in

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:46.300
Constitution Hall,
the 4,000-seat auditorium

01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:49.760
controlled by the Daughters
of the American Revolution,

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.460
because of the
color of her skin.

01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:57.000
At the urging of
Eleanor Roosevelt, Harold Ickes,

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.560
who had once been the head of
the NAACP in Chicago, quickly

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:06.200
issued Anderson permission to
sing at a different venue,

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.730
the Lincoln Memorial,
a recent addition

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:13.260
to the national park system.

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:18.900
The concert was free
and drew a crowd of 75,000

01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:21.230
of all races and creeds.

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:31.360
HAROLD ICKES: Genius, genius
draws no color line, and so it

01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:34.960
is fitting that
Marian Anderson should raise her

01:46:34.960 --> 01:46:38.360
voice in tribute
to the noble Lincoln,

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.660
whom mankind will ever honor.

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.260
Miss Marian Anderson.

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:47.000
COYOTE: After being introduced
by Ickes, Anderson stepped to

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.860
the microphone and
began her program.

01:46:57.930 --> 01:47:04.030
My country, 'tis of thee

01:47:04.030 --> 01:47:10.100
Sweet land of liberty

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:15.930
Of thee we sing

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:21.660
Land where my fathers died

01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:27.430
Land of our pilgrims' pride

01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:33.800
From every mountainside

01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:41.200
Let freedom ring

01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:50.930
Ave Maria

01:47:50.930 --> 01:47:55.030
ICKES: In this great
auditorium under the sky,

01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:58.760
all of us are free.

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:02.960
When God gave us this
wonderful outdoors and the sun

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:10.200
and the moon and the stars,
he made no distinction of race

01:48:10.200 --> 01:48:12.930
or creed or color.

01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:16.030
[Anderson continues
singing "Ave Maria"]

01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:17.760
POPE: You start out with
places that were created

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:20.930
in the late 19th Century
because nobody wanted them,

01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:24.460
like Yellowstone.

01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:27.030
You go through places like
Hetch Hetchy, which were

01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:31.560
sacrificed because
somebody did want them.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:35.100
You go to the Olympic
Peninsula, and the guys who

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:38.460
wanted to cut the logs lose.

01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:42.460
You go to Jackson Hole,
and the state of Wyoming

01:48:42.460 --> 01:48:45.060
desperately fights the
creation of Grand Tetons

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:50.130
and then puts it on its
license plates, and finally,

01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:53.260
you end up with history.

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:57.030
So what--what, a European
would ask, does all this have

01:48:57.030 --> 01:49:01.900
in common, and I think what it
all has in common is these are

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.730
the places where Americans
encounter who they

01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:07.300
are and are home.

01:49:10.430 --> 01:49:16.730
These are the places that
make this continent our home.

01:49:16.730 --> 01:49:21.330
This is what enables Americans
to inhabit this whole place,

01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:25.630
where after all very few of
us originally came from.

01:49:25.630 --> 01:49:36.230

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.930
