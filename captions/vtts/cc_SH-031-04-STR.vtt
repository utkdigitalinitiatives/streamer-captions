00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.770


2
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.330
Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.

3
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.000
If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.

4
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.900
Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:

5
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.400
If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.

6
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.730
Sir, we are undone; these are the villains

7
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.600
That all the travellers do fear so much.

8
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600
My friends,--

9
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.830
That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.

10
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.030
Peace! we'll hear him.

11
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.730
Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.

12
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.470
Then know that I have little wealth to lose:

13
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.170
A man I am cross'd with adversity;

14
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.330
My riches are these poor habiliments,

15
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.770
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,

16
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.830
You take the sum and substance that I have.

17
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.830
Whither travel you?

18
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.600
To Verona.

19
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.630
Whence came you?

20
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.370
From Milan.

21
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.500
Have you long sojourned there?

22
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.870
Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,

23
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.270
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.

24
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.900
What, were you banish'd thence?

25
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.430
I was.

26
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.370
For what offence?

27
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.930
For that which now torments me to rehearse:

28
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.870
I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;

29
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.370
Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,

30
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.330
Without false vantage or base treachery.

31
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.300
Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.

32
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.300
But were you banish'd for so small a fault?

33
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.100
I was, and held me glad of such a doom.

34
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.870
Have you the tongues?

35
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.270
My youthful travel therein made me happy,

36
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.000
Or else I often had been miserable.

37
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.830
By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,

38
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.970
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!

39
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030
We'll have him. Sirs, a word.

40
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.530
Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.

41
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.800
Peace, villain!

42
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.430
Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?

43
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.370
Nothing but my fortune.

44
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.130
Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,

45
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.630
Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth

46
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.530
Thrust from the company of awful men:

47
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.470
Myself was from Verona banished

48
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.600
For practising to steal away a lady,

49
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.730
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.

50
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.500
And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,

51
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.000
Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.

52
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.570
And I for such like petty crimes as these,

53
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.800
But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,

54
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.500
That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;

55
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.570
And partly, seeing you are beautified

56
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.630
With goodly shape and by your own report

57
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.000
A linguist and a man of such perfection

58
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.030
As we do in our quality much want--

59
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.570
Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,

60
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.670
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:

61
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.770
Are you content to be our general?

62
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.500
To make a virtue of necessity

63
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.300
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?

64
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.130
What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?

65
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.630
Say ay, and be the captain of us all:

66
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.900
We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,

67
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.800
Love thee as our commander and our king.

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.630
But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.

69
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.070
Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.

70
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.070
I take your offer and will live with you,

71
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.370
Provided that you do no outrages

72
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.070
On silly women or poor passengers.

73
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.200
No, we detest such vile base practises.

74
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.670
Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,

75
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.700
And show thee all the treasure we have got,

76
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.300
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

77
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.270
Already have I been false to Valentine

78
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.970
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.

79
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.700
Under the colour of commending him,

80
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.700
I have access my own love to prefer:

81
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.330
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,

82
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.730
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.

83
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.170
When I protest true loyalty to her,

84
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.170
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;

85
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.300
When to her beauty I commend my vows,

86
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.330
She bids me think how I have been forsworn

87
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.870
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:

88
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.770
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,

89
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.870
The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,

90
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.900
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,

91
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.400
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.

92
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.500
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,

93
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.970
And give some evening music to her ear.

94
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.100
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?

95
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.870
Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love

96
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.170
Will creep in service where it cannot go.

97
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.900
Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.

98
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.800
Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.

99
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.070
Who? Silvia?

100
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.230
Ay, Silvia; for your sake.

101
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.070
I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:20.070

I pray you, why is it?

105
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.270
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.

106
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.900
Come, we'll have you merry:

107
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.230
I'll bring you where you shall hear music

108
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.270
and see the gentleman that you asked for.

109
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.630
But shall I hear him speak?

110
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.730
Ay, that you shall.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.670

One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.470
I am so far from granting thy request

181
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.230
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,

182
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.200
And by and by intend to chide myself

183
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.500
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

184
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.630
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;

185
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.030
But she is dead.

186
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.200
'Twere false, if I should speak it;

187
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.530
For I am sure she is not buried.

188
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:04.570
Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend Survives;

189
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.000
to whom, thyself art witness,

190
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.930
I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed

191
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.600
To wrong him with thy importunacy?

192
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.870
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.

193
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.130
And so suppose am I; for in his grave

194
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.070
Assure thyself my love is buried.

195
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:36.870
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.

196
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:42.770
Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,

197
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.830
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.

198
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.130
He heard not that.

199
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.830
Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,

200
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.830
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,

201
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.730
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;

202
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.130
To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:

203
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.270
For since the substance of your perfect self

204
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.570
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;

205
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.530
And to your shadow will I make true love.

206
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.670
If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it,

207
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:18.830
And make it but a shadow, as I am.

208
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.670
I am very loath to be your idol, sir;

209
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.570
But since your falsehood shall become you well

210
00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:31.200
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,

211
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.930
Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:

212
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.370
And so, good rest.

213
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:40.600
As wretches have o'ernight

214
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.030
That wait for execution in the morn.

215
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.430
Host, will you go?

216
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.930
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.

217
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.670
Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?

218
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.930
Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.

219
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.270
Not so; but it hath been the longest night

220
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:23.570
That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.

221
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.330
This is the hour that Madam Silvia

222
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.130
Entreated me to call and know her mind:

223
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:57.470
There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.

224
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.330
Madam, madam!

225
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.770
Who calls?

226
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.300
Your servant and your friend;

227
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.900
One that attends your ladyship's command.

228
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.970
Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

229
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.500
As many, worthy lady, to yourself:

230
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.570
According to your ladyship's impose,

231
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.700
I am thus early come to know what service

232
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.000
It is your pleasure to command me in.

233
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.030
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--

234
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.800
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--

235
00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.200
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:

236
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.470
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will

237
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.430
I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,

238
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:06.930
Nor how my father would enforce me marry

239
00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.770
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.

240
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.230
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say

241
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.730
No grief did ever come so near thy heart

242
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.000
As when thy lady and thy true love died,

243
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.730
Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.

244
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.570
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,

245
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.430
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;

246
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.970
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,

247
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.470
I do desire thy worthy company,

248
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.530
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.

249
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.470
Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,

250
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.370
But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,

251
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.100
And on the justice of my flying hence,

252
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.300
To keep me from a most unholy match,

253
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.870
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.

254
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.870
I do desire thee, even from a heart

255
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.300
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,

256
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.770
To bear me company and go with me:

257
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.030
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,

258
00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:00.870
That I may venture to depart alone.

259
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.900
Madam, I pity much your grievances;

260
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:08.800
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,

261
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.500
I give consent to go along with you,

262
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.470
Recking as little what betideth me

263
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.330
As much I wish all good befortune you.

264
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:20.530
When will you go?

265
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.500
This evening coming.

266
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.400
Where shall I meet you?

267
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.970
At Friar Patrick's cell,

268
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.000
Where I intend holy confession.

269
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.170
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.

270
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:43.530
Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.

271
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.470
When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,

272
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:08.600
look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy;

273
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.800
one that I saved from drowning,

274
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.870
when three or four

275
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.970
of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.

276
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.570
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,

277
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.570
'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver

278
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.700
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;

279
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.030
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber

280
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:27.800
but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:

281
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.700
O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself

282
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.170
in all companies! I would have, as one should say,

283
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.230
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,

284
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:41.670
as it were, a dog at all things.

285
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.870
If I had not had more wit than he,

286
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.330
to take a fault upon me that he did,

287
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.900
I think verily he had been hanged for't;

288
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.200
sure as I live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge.

289
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.800
He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four

290
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.670
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table:

291
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.530
he had not been there--bless the mark!--

292
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:05.530
a pissing while, but all the chamber smelt him.

293
00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:06.870
'Out with the dog!' says one:

294
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.300
'What cur is that?' says another:

295
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.700
'Whip him out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.

296
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.130
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,

297
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.130
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that

298
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.800
whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip the dog?'

299
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.030
'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he.

300
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.370
'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I;

301
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.300
''twas I did the thing you wot of.'

302
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.300
He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber.

303
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.500
How many masters would do this for his servant?

304
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.970
Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings

305
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.700
he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed;

306
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.800
I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed,

307
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.670
otherwise he had suffered for't.

308
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.070
Thou thinkest not of this now.

309
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.530
Nay, I remember the trick you served me

310
00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.030
when I took my leave of Madam Silvia:

311
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:58.970
did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do?

312
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.970
when didst thou see me heave up my leg

313
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.270
and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?

314
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.730
didst thou ever see me do such a trick?

315
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:38.600
Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well

316
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.330
And will employ thee in some service presently.

317
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.230
In what you please: I'll do what I can.

318
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.400
I hope thou wilt.

319
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.830
How now, you whoreson peasant!

320
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.370
Where have you been these two days loitering?

321
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.230
Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.

322
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.300
And what says she to my little jewel?

323
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.170
Marry, she says your dog was a cur,

324
00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:59.730
and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present.

325
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.070
But she received my dog?

326
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.330
No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him back again.

327
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.100
What, didst thou offer her this from me?

328
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:08.930
Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me

329
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.130
by the hangman boys in the market-place:

330
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.600
and then I offered her mine own,

331
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.070
who is a dog as big as ten of yours,

332
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.100
and therefore the gift the greater.

333
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.470
Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,

334
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.930
Or ne'er return again into my sight.

335
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:27.070
Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?

336
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.700
A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!

337
00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:43.630
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,

338
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.170
Partly that I have need of such a youth

339
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.700
That can with some discretion do my business,

340
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.200
For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,

341
00:21:52.200 --> 00:22:06.900
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,

342
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.330
Which, if my augury deceive me not,

343
00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:16.400
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:

344
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.500
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.

345
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.830
Go presently and take this ring with thee,

346
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.970
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:

347
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.200
She loved me well deliver'd it to me.

348
00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.170
It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.

349
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.570
She is dead, belike?

350
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.600
Not so; I think she lives.

351
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.870
Alas!

352
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.670
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?

353
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.270
I cannot choose

354
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.470
But pity her.

355
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.670
Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?

356
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.170
Because methinks that she loved you as well

357
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.930
As you do love your lady Silvia:

358
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.230
She dreams of him that has forgot her love;

359
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:02.430
You dote on her that cares not for your love.

360
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.230
'Tis pity love should be so contrary;

361
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.570
And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'

362
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.730
Well, give her that ring and therewithal

363
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:26.400
This letter. That's her chamber.

364
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:34.300
Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.

365
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:40.170
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,

366
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:46.100
Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.

367
00:23:54.830 --> 00:24:01.030
How many women would do such a message?

368
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.830
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd

369
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.970
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.

370
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:14.200
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him

371
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.530
That with his very heart despiseth me?

372
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:24.400
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;

373
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:31.770
Because I love him I must pity him.

374
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.100
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,

375
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.370
To bind him to remember my good will;

376
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.830
And now am I, unhappy messenger,

377
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.930
To plead for that which I would not obtain,

378
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.830
To carry that which I would have refused,

379
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:57.000
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.

380
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.870
I am my master's true-confirmed love;

381
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.730
But cannot be true servant to my master,

382
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:11.570
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.

383
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:16.770
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly

384
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:21.200
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

385
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.900
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean

386
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.530
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.

387
00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.070
What would you with her, if that I be she?

388
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.030
If you be she, I do entreat your patience

389
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.570
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.

390
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.870
From whom?

391
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:47.100
From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.

392
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.900
O, he sends you for a picture.

393
00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.800
Ay, madam.

394
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.470
Ursula, bring my picture here.

395
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.370
Go give your master this: tell him from me,

396
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.800
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,

397
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.730
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.

398
00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.430
Madam, please you peruse this letter.--

399
00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:24.930
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised

400
00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.330
Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:

401
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:30.130
This is the letter to your ladyship.

402
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:31.100
I pray thee, let me look on that again.

403
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.830
It may not be; good madam, pardon me.

404
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:40.630
There, hold!

405
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.430
I will not look upon your master's lines:

406
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.700
I know they are stuff'd with protestations

407
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.730
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break

408
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:55.170
As easily as I do tear his paper.

409
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.030
Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.

410
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.400
The more shame for him that he sends it me;

411
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.170
For I have heard him say a thousand times

412
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.030
His Julia gave it him at his departure.

413
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.300
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,

414
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.900
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.

415
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.430
She thanks you.

416
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.430
What say'st thou?

417
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.530
I thank you, madam, that you tender her.

418
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.330
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.

419
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.700
Dost thou know her?

420
00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.500
Almost as well as I do know myself:

421
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.030
To think upon her woes I do protest

422
00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.230
That I have wept a hundred several times.

423
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.500
Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.

424
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.600
I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.

425
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.000
Is she not passing fair?

426
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.800
She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:

427
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.130
When she did think my master loved her well,

428
00:27:55.130 --> 00:28:00.730
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:

429
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.300
But since she did neglect her looking-glass

430
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.130
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,

431
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.930
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks

432
00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.830
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,

433
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:14.070
That now she is become as black as I.

434
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.130
How tall was she?

435
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:18.730
About my stature; for at Pentecost,

436
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.430
When all our pageants of delight were play'd,

437
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.200
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,

438
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.870
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,

439
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.730
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,

440
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.500
As if the garment had been made for me:

441
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.670
Therefore I know she is about my height.

442
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:40.670
And at that time I made her weep agood,

443
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.870
For I did play a lamentable part:

444
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.130
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning

445
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:52.600
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;

446
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.570
Which I so lively acted with my tears

447
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:04.530
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,

448
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:11.370
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead

449
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.300
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!

450
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:23.130
She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.

451
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:30.370
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!

452
00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.530
I weep myself to think upon thy words.

453
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:42.270
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this

454
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:50.300
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.

455
00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.430
Farewell.

456
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:06.230
And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.

457
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:11.730
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful

458
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.100
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,

459
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.430
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.

460
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:27.900
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!

461
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.800
Here is her picture: let me see;

462
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.900
I think, If I had such a tire, this face of mine

463
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.770
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:

464
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.600
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,

465
00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:01.330
Unless I flatter with myself too much.

466
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:06.330
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:

467
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.770
If that be all the difference in his love,

468
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.500
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.

469
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:16.670
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.

470
00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:20.100
What should it be that he respects in her

471
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.800
But I can make respective in myself,

472
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:31.600
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?

473
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:43.070
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,

474
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:49.800
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,

475
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:56.400
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!

476
00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.470
And, were there sense in his idolatry,

477
00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:03.370
My substance should be statue in thy stead.

478
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:10.800
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,

479
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:18.170
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,

480
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.770
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes

481
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:26.530
To make my master out of love with thee!

482
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.600
