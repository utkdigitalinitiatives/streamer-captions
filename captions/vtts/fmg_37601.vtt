WEBVTT

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.360
THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM IS
MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.460
FUNDING FROM THE SOUTHERN
ALLIANCE FOR CLEAN ENERGY.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.200
AND CLEAR THE AIR.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000
OF THE MANY THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE TOURING

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.560
THE NORTH CAROLINA
OUTER BANKS EACH YEAR,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.230
FEW PEOPLE APPRECIATE
THE RAW BEAUTY HERE

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.330
AS MUCH AS NATURE
PHOTOGRAPHER,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.030
MICHAEL HALMINSKI.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.860
WELL, THE
OUTER BANKS,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.900
IT'S ON THE
ATLANTIC FLYWAY.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.530
IT'S A MAJOR STOPPING
POINT FOR MIGRATORY BIRDS

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.630
- ALL TYPES OF BIRDS, WE
SEE HAWKS AND SONGBIRDS,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.500
ALL THE TYPES OF
DUCKS AND GEESE.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
FROM HIS FINE ART GALLERY
ON HATTERAS ISLAND

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.800
MICHAEL'S IMAGES
COMMUNICATE TO VISITORS

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.860
THE VISUAL SPLENDOR OF THE
UNIQUE MARINE ENVIRONMENT

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.200
THAT IS THE OUTER BANKS.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.330
...AND IF YOU WERE A BIRD
UP IN THE AIR, FLYING,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.530
AND YOU'RE MIGRATING
NORTH OR SOUTH

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.260
AND YOU LOOK DOWN, YOU
HAVE ALL THIS WATER AROUND

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.560
AND THEN HERE'S THIS
LITTLE PATCH OF LAND,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
A LITTLE STRIP OF SAND
WITH SOME VEGETATION ON IT.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.130
IT'S LIKE A MAGNET
FOR THE WATER FOWL.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.730
AS SEEN FROM SPACE,
A SATELLITE VIEW

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.100
GLIMPSES THE OUTER
BANKS AS THEY ARE -

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
A DELICATE
NECKLACE OF LAND.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.060
A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR
TOURISM INDUSTRY HAS

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.260
GROWN UP ALONG NORTH
CAROLINA'S SANDY JEWEL.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.960
PEOPLE COME TO FISH, TO
SURF, TO SIMPLY BE HERE.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.460
AND MANY COME TO LIVE.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.100
THE HIGHLY PRIZED
OCEAN FRONT PROPERTIES

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.100
OCCUPY THE FRONT LINE
WHENEVER GREAT STORMS

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.330
ROLL IN FROM
THE ATLANTIC.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.500
THE AREA IS VULNERABLE TO
AN ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.560
STRESSORS, INCLUDING
OVER-DEVELOPMENT.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.130
BUT THE
OVER-ARCHING THREAT,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.860
WORSENING ALL OF THESE
PROBLEMS IS GLOBAL WARMING.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.130
ONE OF THE BEST RECORDS
OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.430
COMES FROM MIKE MANN'S
STUDIES OF TREE RINGS

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.130
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.460
AND HE SHOWS RELATIVELY
STABLE CLIMATE

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.530
SINCE THE LAST
GLACIAL PERIOD.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.430
THIS IS THE LAST
TWO THOUSAND YEARS

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.560
OF HIS RECORD THAT
SHOWS RELATIVELY

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860
STABLE CONDITIONS OF
EARTH'S TEMPERATURE

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.430
FOR A LONG
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.830
YOU COULD SEE SOME
ANNUAL VARIABILITY

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.800
BUT IT'S NOT
EVER VERY LARGE.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000
AND THEN A DRAMATIC
SPIKE IN THE RECENT YEARS

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION THAT

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.260
CAN BE LINKED TO THE HUMAN
BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.130
AND THE INCREASE IN CARBON
DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.300
THOSE INCREASING CO2
LEVELS FIND UNDISPUTED

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.660
EVIDENCE IN ICE
CORE SAMPLES.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.960
NO OTHER NATURAL
MECHANISM EXPLAINING THE

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.130
OMINOUS TEMPERATURE
SPIKE HAS ATTRACTED

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.900
SERIOUS ATTENTION IN THE
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.560
BUT THE IDEA OF
HUMAN-INDUCED CLIMATE

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.760
CHANGE, WHILE OVER A
CENTURY OLD, DID ENCOUNTER

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.030
YEARS OF RESISTANCE IN THE
COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.230
IT'S NOT SURPRISING TO ME
THAT IT TOOK THAT LONG.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.060
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT
SCIENCE TO TRY TO PREDICT

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.600
THE CLIMATE OF A PLANET,
BOTH THE PAST AND IN THE

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.730
FUTURE, AND I THINK WHAT
WE'VE SEEN IS A VERY

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.930
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF
THAT SCIENCE OVER THE

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.500
LAST 35 YEARS LEADING
TO OUR CONSENSUS NOW.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.900
CONSENSUS AMONG
SCIENTISTS...

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.360
A GROUNDSWELL OF
PUBLIC SUPPORT...

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.630
IT APPEARS GLOBAL WARMING
IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.430
AS THE MASS MEDIA -
INCLUDING COVER STORIES

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.530
FROM CONSERVATIVE
MAGAZINES AND INTERVIEWS

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.160
WITH CONSERVATIVE
POLITICIANS ON CNN

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.860
- HAVE BROUGHT THE
GLOBAL WARMING STORY

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.930
INTO THE MAINSTREAM.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.200
WHAT WILL AND WHAT DOES
GLOBAL WARMING MEAN

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.630
TO THE INHABITANTS
OF THE OUTER BANKS?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.300
TO ALL RESIDENTS
OF NORTH CAROLINA?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.630
I SEE SEVERAL AREAS IN WHICH
CITIZENS OF NORTH CAROLINA

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.730
ARE FEELING CLIMATE
CHANGE AND WILL FEEL IT

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.260
AS THE PLANET GETS WARMER
IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.100
ONE OF THESE, OF COURSE,
IS SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.130
AS POLAR ICE CURRENTLY
SITTING ON LAND MASSES

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.000
MELTS AWAY INTO THE SEA,
SCIENTISTS PREDICT THAT

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.460
BY THE YEAR 2100 OCEAN
LEVELS WILL HAVE RISEN

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.500
BY AS HIGH
AS 43 INCHES.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.260
WHEN ONLY AN INCH RISE CAN
SINK THE LOWEST LYING AREAS,

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.760
THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL
WARMING IN NORTH CAROLINA

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.760
MEANS A DRAMATICALLY
RE-DRAWN COASTLINE.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.560
BYE-BYE OUTER BANKS.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.730
TRUE OLD-TIMERS, LIKE
FISHERMAN I.D. MIDGETT,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.360
ARE ALSO CONCERNED.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.230
THEY KNOW
TIME IS SHORT

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.600
AND THE OUTER BANKS
ARE VULNERABLE.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.130
WELL, IT'S REALLY
NOTHING MORE THAN A REEF

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.430
WHICH SEPARATES THE
OCEAN FROM THE MAINLAND,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.230
AND PROTECTS THE MAINLAND,
REALLY, IN A SENSE.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.760
OF COURSE, IF WE GET
A RISE IN WATER LEVEL,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.160
WE'RE SUNK.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.260
STORMS PROBABLY WHERE
WE'RE STANDING NOW

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.660
WOULD BE OVER
FIVE FOOT DEEP

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.760
- PROBABLY ARMPIT
DEEP OR MORE.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.060
HURRICANES I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.800
WHILE STORMS ARE A FORCE
OF NATURE THAT HAVE LONG

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.560
ATTRACTED PHOTOGRAPHERS
LIKE MICHAEL HALMINSKI,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.660
NOBODY WOULD WISH THE
KIND OF DESTRUCTION

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.600
HE HAS WITNESSED
ON HATTERAS ISLAND

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.130
AS FROM
HURRICANE ISABEL.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.930
WHILE SCIENTISTS DON'T
AGREE ON JUST HOW GLOBAL

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.130
WARMING WILL IMPACT
HURRICANE SEASON ON THE

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.000
OUTER BANKS, IT'S THE
DE-STABILIZATION OF THE

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.800
WEATHER AND THE PROSPECT
OF FAR MORE INTENSE

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.330
HURRICANES THAT HAS
EVERYONE CONCERNED.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.630
A WARMER NORTH CAROLINA
WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.600
A DRIER NORTH CAROLINA.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.160
I EXPECT THAT GREATER
RATES OF EVAPORATION

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.060
WILL LEAVE DRIER SOILS.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.230
AND, OF COURSE, WATER IS
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.660
MOST CONCERNS A FARMER IN
THE SUCCESS OF THE CROP

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.560
IN ANY PARTICULAR YEAR.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.130
WHILE EVEN THE MOST
ROBUST COMPUTER MODELS

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.000
LEAVE SCIENTISTS UNCERTAIN
OVER THE EXACT DEGREE OF

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.100
FLOODING AND RISING SEAS,
THE NUMBER OF HURRICANES,

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.260
AND A LONG LIST OF DIRECT
AND INDIRECT IMPACTS ON

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.800
PEOPLE, ANIMALS, AND THE
ENVIRONMENT, WHAT IS CLEAR

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.260
IS THAT IF SOMETHING ISN'T
DONE TO LIMIT AND LOWER

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.160
GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION,
THAT THE BIGGEST LOSERS IN

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.900
THIS DANGEROUS EXPERIMENT
WITH EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.200
ARE HUMANS, AND OUR
TREASURED RESOURCES.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.400
SO THERE ARE CHALLENGES
WITH GLOBAL WARMING,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.300
BUT THERE ARE ALSO
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.600
AND IF BUSINESSES SEIZE
THESE OPPORTUNITIES

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.900
WE WILL SEE INNOVATION
FLOW FORWARD.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.960
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
SEEING BUSINESSES

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.700
LIKE GENERAL
ELECTRIC, DUPONT,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.960
AND BRITISH PETROLEUM
PROVIDE LEADERSHIP.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.830
BUT WE NEED OTHER
SECTORS TO ENGAGE,

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.400
LIKE THE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.760
WHERE THEY CAN
ACTUALLY GROW FUELS

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.730
WHERE WE USED TO
MINE FOSSIL FUELS

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.360
AND THAT WILL PROVIDE
CLEANER SOURCES OF ENERGY

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.860
THAT REDUCE GLOBAL
WARMING POLLUTION.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.460
THIS INNOVATION
WILL NOT HAPPEN

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.930
WITHOUT GOVERNMENT
INVOLVEMENT.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.000
VOLUNTARY MEASURES
DON'T WORK.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.530
TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE'VE
SEEN WHERE THE GOVERNMENT

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.160
SETS THE RULES OF THE
ROAD, INDUSTRY RESPONDS

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.260
WITH TECHNOLOGY
AND INNOVATION.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.660
THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE
ACID RAIN PROVISIONS

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.460
OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.930
WE HAD SUCCESS THERE; WE
CAN HAVE SUCCESS AGAIN

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.600
USING THE SAME MEASURES FOR
GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.700
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED
GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP,

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.930
INVOLVEMENT AND
INNOVATION FROM INDUSTRY,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.300
AND THE SUPPORT
OF EVERY CITIZEN.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.800
MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.000
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A WAY OF LIFE.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.300
BUT I DO APPRECIATE
THE EARLY MORNING

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.530
IN SILENCE
AND TRANQUILITY.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.300
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S
INGRAINED IN YOU, I GUESS.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.730
JUST A LOVE OF THE
LAND I SUPPOSE.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.230
IF NORTH CAROLINIANS
CHOOSE TO FIGHT AGAINST

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.000
A FUTURE LARGELY DEFINED
BY GLOBAL WARMING,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.160
A CHIEF MOTIVATION WILL
BE OUT OF SELF INTEREST.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.900
BUT WE SHOULD CONSIDER
A HIGHER CALLING,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.900
AND THAT IS PROVIDING
GOOD STEWARDSHIP

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.660
OF OUR TREASURED PLACES
FOR I.D. MIDGETT

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.160
AND ALL NORTH
CAROLINIANS ALIKE...

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.330
- PLACES LIKE THE
LOVELY OUTER BANKS.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.160
IT'S OLD-TIMEY DAY

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.700
AT MOUNT HORR AFRICAN
METHODIST CHURCH

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.030
HELD UNDER ITS GRAND LIVE
OAKS ON EDISTO ISLAND.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.160
<i>GOD HAS CALLED US TO BRING
ALL OF CREATION BACK</i>

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.630
<i>TO HIM AND TO LOVE AND
RESPECT ALL CREATION...</i>

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.560
THEY WORSHIP GOD AMID
THE VERY SPLENDOR

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.160
OF HIS CREATION.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.100
IT'S AN OLD
LOW-COUNTRY TRADITION

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.030
HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.560
WHEN OUR FOREFATHERS
WERE IN SLAVERY

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.100
AND EVEN AFTERWARDS,

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.300
THERE WAS A GREAT
CONNECTION WITH NATURE,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.800
AND THAT BASICALLY IS AN
OLD AFRICAN TRADITION.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.760
LIVING OFF THE LAND, BEING
ONE WITH THE LAND, BEING

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.160
IN HARMONY AS A
PART OF CREATION

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.960
BUT NOT A
MASTER CREATION.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.830
AND SO THAT TYPE OF
THINKING CONTINUED ON

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.530
IN OUR
RELIGIOUS THOUGHT.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.030
THESE ARE OUR
TREASURED PLACES.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.230
TO THE PEOPLE OF EDISTO
ISLAND AND THE ACE BASIN,

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.900
IT'S THEIR MAGICAL DEEP
WATER CREEKS AND MARSHES.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.330
TO RESIDENTS
OF HILTON HEAD,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.400
IT'S AN EARLY MORNING
ROUND OF GOLF.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.660
RESIDENTS AND VISITORS
ALIKE TREASURE ALL THAT IS

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.200
HISTORIC CHARLESTON.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.430
AND TUCKED AWAY IN A
REMOTE CORNER OF THE

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.800
UPSTATE, SOUTH CAROLINIANS
ENJOY HIKING AND CAMPING

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.330
ALONG MOUNTAIN TRAILS AND
SAVOR ANY OPPORTUNITY TO

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.430
FISH THE LOVELY STREAMS OF
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.330
EVEN WHEN THE TROUT
AREN'T BITING.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.300
WELL, THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL IT "FISHING"

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.900
AND NOT "CATCHING".

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.160
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE
MOST IMPORTANT THING.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.700
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS GETTING OUT HERE AND

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.460
ENJOYING NATURE, SEEING
THE BEAUTY OF THE PLACE,

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:11.460
AND EXPERIENCING SOLITUDE,
AND GETTING AWAY FROM

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.860
THE HECTIC STRESS
OF MODERN DAY LIFE.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.100
THE PLEASANT SUNNY WEATHER
BELIES A TROUBLING REALITY

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.900
LOOMING ON
THE HORIZON -

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.160
THE MUCH TALKED ABOUT
ISSUE OF GLOBAL WARMING.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.260
IT'S BEEN ALL OVER THE
MEDIA; A RASH OF MAGAZINE

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.200
COVER STORIES, AND
GLOBAL WARMING RECEIVES

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.630
EVER-INCREASING
TELEVISION NEWS COVERAGE.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.400
<i>BREAKING NEWS OVERNIGHT...</i>

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.200
<i>UNSTOPPABLE...</i>

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.630
<i>1500 OF THE WORLD'S TOP
EXPERTS ANNOUNCE THE</i>

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.230
<i>GLOBAL WARMING GENIE
IS OUT OF THE BOTTLE.</i>

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.260
VIDEO IMAGES OF FAR
AWAY MELTING ICE CAPS

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.630
PLAY ACROSS THE SCREEN.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.230
SO WHERE DOES THE
ISSUE OF GLOBAL WARMING

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.000
SIT WITH THE PEOPLE
OF SOUTH CAROLINA?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.260
SPORTSMEN IN SOUTH
CAROLINA ARE RESPONSIBLE

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.400
FOR BRINGING OVER
ONE BILLION DOLLARS

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.260
INTO OUR
STATE ANNUALLY.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.900
IN FACT, ONE OUT OF EVERY
FOUR SOUTH CAROLINIANS

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.360
EITHER HUNT OR FISH,
SO WHAT BETTER GROUP

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.130
TO GO TO, TO ASK
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING?

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.900
THIS SPRING WE CONDUCTED
A POLL IN SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.760
A RANDOM SAMPLING
OF LICENSE HOLDERS.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.260
WE ASKED THEM WHAT
THEY THOUGHT ABOUT

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.500
GLOBAL WARMING.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.500
68% BELIEVE THAT
GLOBAL WARMING EXISTS,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.530
THAT SAME GROUP BELIEVE
THAT IT'S BEING CAUSED

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.400
BY THE BURNING OF
FOSSIL FUELS AND,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.500
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY
WANT TO SEE ACTION.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.560
NOT ONLY ON THE NATIONAL
LEVEL, BUT 90% OF THEM

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.060
WOULD ENDORSE A
STATE ENERGY PLAN.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.200
SO WHO ARE THESE
SPORTSMEN?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.760
WELL, THEY'RE BASICALLY
CONSERVATIVES.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.100
CONSIDERING THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION'S

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.760
RESISTANCE TO THE IDEA
OF HUMAN INDUCED CLIMATE

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.460
CHANGE, THE POLL RESULTS
COME AS A MAJOR SURPRISE.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.160
ABOUT 70% OF THOSE POLLED
BY THE SOUTH CAROLINA

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.630
WILDLIFE FEDERATION
VOTED FOR GEORGE BUSH

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.300
IN BOTH ELECTIONS.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.060
AND BECAUSE OF THAT
THEY FEEL THEY HAVE

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.230
THE RIGHT TO ASK FOR
IMMEDIATE ACTION.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.000
THERE ARE 90% OF
THEM THAT WANT TO SEE

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.130
IMMEDIATE ACTION
ON A NATIONAL LEVEL.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.360
WHILE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
IN THE WEATHER OF A PLANET

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.600
USUALLY OCCUR IN
GEOLOGICAL TIME SPANS,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.530
A DISTURBING ASPECT
OF THE PRESENT WARMING

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.960
IS HOW RAPIDLY
IT IS OCCURRING.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.330
EVEN IN THE COURSE
OF A HUMAN LIFE SPAN;

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.860
SOUTH CAROLINA'S OLD
TIMERS NOTE THE CHANGES.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.100
BUT IT WAS COLDER THEN,
IT DEFINITELY WAS.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.200
I HAVE SEEN CHATTOOGA
RIVER FROZE OVER AND

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.860
THERE STILL ARE PLACES WHERE
YOU COULD WALK ACROSS.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.760
AND OLDER PEOPLE THAN ME
HAVE TOLD ABOUT DRIVING

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.630
A YOKE OF OXEN OR A
TEAM ACROSS THE FROZE...

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.530
I NEVER SAW THAT,
BUT I'VE SEEN IT

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:53.430
COLD ENOUGH FOR IT
TO BE FROZE OVER.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.130
WHILE GLOBAL WARMING SPELLS
TROUBLE THE WORLD OVER,

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:58.600
ITS CONSEQUENCES WILL
BE FELT RIGHT HERE

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.230
ON THE SHORES OF
THE PALMETTO STATE.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.730
BRINGING PROBLEMS THAT
WILL RIPPLE INLAND,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.460
AFFECTING EVERYONE
AND EVERYTHING

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.800
FROM OUR TREASURED
NATURAL PLACES

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.200
TO OUR VERY
LIVELIHOODS.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.100
WE WERE CONTACTED BY SOME
PEOPLE WHO ARE TUNED IN

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.230
TO WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE ENVIRONMENT

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.230
AND THE BIGGER
BUSINESS COMMUNITY,

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.400
SPECIFICALLY THE
INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.960
AND WHAT WE WERE HEARING
WAS THAT INSURANCE

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.560
COMPANIES WERE STARTING TO
MODEL FOR GLOBAL WARMING

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.400
AND WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO
MEAN FOR INSURANCE RATES.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.430
AND THAT WAS GOING
TO IMPACT ANYBODY

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.760
WHO HAS A BUSINESS
ALONG OUR COAST.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.330
WELL, MOST OF OUR
BUSINESS ALONG THE

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.560
SOUTH CAROLINA COAST
ARE SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.800
THESE SMALL BUSINESSES
SUPPORT THE STATE'S

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.900
NUMBER ONE INDUSTRY -
TOURISM - AND 60% OF THAT

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.760
BUSINESS COMES FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA'S COASTAL REGION

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.330
- THE GROUND ZERO WHEN IT
COMES TO GLOBAL WARMING.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.960
MELTING ICE IN GREENLAND
AND ANTARCTICA,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.360
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE, WILL
CAUSE SEA LEVELS TO RISE

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.660
BY UP TO TWO FEET
AND POSSIBLY MORE

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.500
IN THE NEXT
HUNDRED YEARS.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.460
BAD NEWS
FOR AN ECONOMY

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.400
LARGELY BUILT
ALONG THE COAST.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.230
SEA LEVEL RISE MEANS
ERODING COASTLINES

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.200
AND ENTIRELY REDRAWN
COASTLINES BUT A HIGHER

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.730
WATER TABLE ALSO MEANS
YET HIGHER STORM SURGES

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.530
FROM HURRICANES, AND
COUPLED WITH INCREASED

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.830
HURRICANE INTENSITY ALSO
LINKED TO GLOBAL WARMING,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.800
IT'S A DOUBLE
WHAMMY FOR WHICH

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.660
THE ENTIRE STATE
IS UNPREPARED.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.260
REMEMBER
HURRICANE RITA?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.630
WILMA?

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.100
AND WILL WE EVER
FORGET KATRINA?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.830
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY
WAS UNPREPARED,

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.460
AND WE REMAIN SO.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.330
<i>OKAY, HERE WE'VE GOT
A RESCUE IN PROGRESS...</i>

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.460
ENVIRONMENT HAS NEVER
PLAYED LARGE ON THE

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.030
NATIONAL AGENDA, BUT
HAVING DOLED OUT OVER

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.360
90 BILLION DOLLARS ON
INSURED LOSSES BETWEEN

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.600
2004 AND 2005, THE
FIRST INDUSTRY TO BE

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.830
HIT IN THE WALLET BY
POTENTIAL IMPACTS

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.760
OF GLOBAL WARMING IS
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.500
AND THEY'RE PAYING
CLOSE ATTENTION.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.030
WHERE THE RUBBER HITS THE
ROAD WITH REGARD TO THIS

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.600
ISSUE FOR THE INDUSTRY
IS IN THE QUESTION,

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.630
WILL THE FREQUENCY
AND/OR THE SEVERITY

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:21.560
OF HURRICANE ACTIVITY
IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.100
IN PARTICULAR FOR US HERE
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.460
WILL THAT BE
MEASURABLY INCREASED

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.130
IN A WORLD THAT IS WARMED
BY GREENHOUSE GASES?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.530
THAT IS THE
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION,

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.430
THE MOST VEXING QUESTION
FACING THE INDUSTRY

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.200
RIGHT NOW WITH
REGARD TO THE

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.430
PROSPECT OF
CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.030
THE IMPACTS OF GLOBAL
WARMING ARE MANY,

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.930
ARE COMPLEX.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.730
AND WHILE A DESTABILIZED
CLIMATE ISN'T FULLY

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.230
UNDERSTOOD, THE PROSPECT
OF ANOTHER KATRINA

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.500
STRIKING SOUTH CAROLINA,
STRIKING CHARLESTON,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.460
PROVIDES MORE THAN
ENOUGH REASON TO CARE.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.830
KILLER STORMS THREATEN
THE STATE'S LIFEBLOOD -

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:04.600
TOURISM, AND ITS NUMBER
TWO INDUSTRY - TIMBER

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.460
- IS EQUALLY VULNERABLE.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.230
WHEN HURRICANE HUGO
SLAMMED INTO BULL'S BAY

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.500
IN MCCLELLANVILLE IN 1989,
MOWING DOWN A 50-MILE

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.230
SWATH ALL THE WAY TO NORTH
CAROLINA AND WELL BEYOND,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.660
IT DOWNED THREE
TIMES THE TREES

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.100
LOST TO THE MT. ST.
HELEN'S ERUPTION,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.800
SEVEN TIMES THE
YELLOWSTONE FIRES

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.800
- AN EIGHT BILLION
DOLLAR LOSS.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.930
FUELED BY INCREASED HEAT
FROM WARMING OCEANS,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.930
MORE FREQUENT AND MORE
INTENSE HURRICANES

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.960
COULD MEAN THAT
HUGO-STRENGTH STORMS WON'T

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.330
JUST BE A DISTANT MEMORY
FOR SOUTH CAROLINIANS.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.230
THE CONSEQUENCES OF
GLOBAL WARMING EXTEND FROM

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.600
FAR AWAY MELTING ICE CAPS TO
SOUTH CAROLINA'S SHORELINE,

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.200
ACROSS THE PIEDMONT
AND INTO THE UPSTATE,

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.100
INCLUDING DAVE VAN LEAR'S
FAVORITE FISHING HOLE

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.900
HERE ON THE UPPER
CHATTOOGA RIVER.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:04.230
AS A RESULT OF HABITAT
CHANGES, LAND USES,

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:09.400
AND THE DEGRADATION
OF WATER QUALITY,

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.900
AND THE INTRODUCTION
OF NON-NATIVE SPECIES,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.500
THE BROOK TROUT HAVE
BEEN RELEGATED TO THE

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.400
HEADWATERS OF STREAMS IN
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.330
THEY ARE THE MOST
TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:26.600
OF THE TROUT SPECIES AND
REQUIRE COLD CLEAR WATER.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.500
EVEN IF IMPACTS OF GLOBAL
WARMING AREN'T ALL EXTREME,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.700
WHAT'S AT STAKE ISN'T
SOMETHING ACCEPTABLE

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.230
TO ANYONE WITH A CONNECTION
TO THE OUTDOORS.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.800
IF THE WATER'S MUCH ABOVE
70 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.260
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME,

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.830
THEN THAT WILL KILL
THE BROOK TROUT.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.130
AND IF IT STAYS ABOVE
70 DEGREES FOR WEEKS

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.760
IT WILL PROBABLY
DRIVE OUT

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.930
THE RAINBOW AND
BROWN TROUT AS WELL.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.300
WHILE EVERY INDIVIDUAL
FROM EVERY REGION IN EVERY

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.260
COUNTRY CONTRIBUTES TO THE
PROBLEM OF GLOBAL WARMING

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.060
POLLUTION, THE SEARCH FOR
SOLUTIONS RESTS EQUALLY

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.900
WITH ONE CARBON-LOADING
HUMAN IN CHINA

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.430
JUST AS IN
SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.630
THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER WE AS A STATE

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:19.800
WILL RISE TO
THIS CHALLENGE.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.030
AND THE REASON
WE SHOULD -

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:24.130
THE<i> REASONS</i> WE
SHOULD ARE TWO-FOLD.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.630
ONE, THE COST OF NOT
ACTING, THE COST OF

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.360
CONTINUING IN THIS CYCLE
OF DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.430
FUELS AND THE IMPACT OF
THAT ON THE LOW COUNTRY.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.060
IT'S SEVEN FEET
ABOVE MEAN SEA LEVEL.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.660
THE COSTS ARE ALMOST
INCALCULABLE.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:44.330
WE'VE GOT THE POTENTIAL
FLOODING OF THIS CITY,

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.200
OF SALT MARSH,
OF RICE FIELDS,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.130
OF THESE LANDSCAPES THAT
ARE ICONIC LANDSCAPES,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.130
THAT ARE A DRAW FOR TOURISTS
BUT ALSO A REFERENCE POINT

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.300
FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE
AND HAVE MOVED HERE

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.560
AND HAVE LIVED HERE
FOR GENERATIONS.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.800
AND SO, THE COSTS, IT WOULD
NOT BE EVEN POSSIBLE

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.960
TO PROPERLY ASSESS THEM.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.160
THE OPPORTUNITIES
ARE SUBSTANTIAL

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.600
AND IDENTIFIABLE.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.560
AT CLEMSON UNIVERSITY'S
ENERGY SYSTEMS LABORATORY

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.660
THE SEARCH FOR A BREAK
FROM FOSSIL FUEL ENERGY

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.400
IS AS MUCH ABOUT CAPITALIZING
ON ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.500
AS IT IS MITIGATING
GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.560
DR. NICHOLAS RIGAS,
DIRECTOR OF THE

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.230
SOUTH CAROLINA INSTITUTE
FOR ENERGY STUDIES

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.360
ENJOYS TEACHING
A NEW GENERATION

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.200
OF PROBLEM SOLVERS.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.500
SOUTH CAROLINA IS
BEING PROACTIVE

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.830
IN DEVELOPMENT OF
ALTERNATIVE CLEAN ENERGIES

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.260
AND IT'S BEING ACTIVE
ON SEVERAL FRONTS.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.960
IT'S BEEN ACTIVE ON
THE HYDROGEN FRONT -

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.930
WHICH HYDROGEN IS MORE
OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.100
FOR THE NATION AS AN
ALTERNATIVE FUEL.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.530
IT'S ALSO BEING ACTIVE
ON THE BIO-ENERGY PIECE.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.000
NOW, SOUTH CAROLINA
CANNOT COMPETE AGAINST

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.460
THE MIDWEST IN TERMS OF
CORN PRODUCTION TO...

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.300
FOR INSTANCE, ETHANOL.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.860
BUT SOUTH CAROLINA
POSSESSES A LOT OF BIOMASS

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.200
THAT CAN BE CONVERTED INTO
BIOETHANOL OR BIODIESEL

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.130
VIA NEW TECHNOLOGIES
THAT WILL BE HOPEFULLY

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.230
DEVELOPED IN
THE NEAR FUTURE.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.760
SOUTH CAROLINA ALSO
POSSESSES, AND IT'S BEEN

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.030
DOCUMENTED, OFFSHORE
WIND POTENTIAL.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.560
THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE
LAND-BASED WIND POTENTIAL

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.500
GIVEN ITS LOCATION
AND ITS CLIMATE,

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.060
BUT THE OFFSHORE WIND
POTENTIAL OF THE STATE

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.630
WHICH RESIDES BETWEEN
FIVE TO 15 NAUTICAL MILES

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.130
OFF THE STATE HAS BEEN
DOCUMENTED, SO THERE IS

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.800
CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR
ELECTRICITY GENERATION

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.730
OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH
CAROLINA AS WELL.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.160
THEY ARE NEW ECONOMIC
OPPORTUNITIES,

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.600
NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR
ENERGY PRODUCTION,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.330
RENEWABLE ENERGY
PRODUCTION,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.460
NEW TECHNOLOGIES
FOR CONSERVATION,

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.560
EXPORTING WHAT WE
KNOW ABOUT WONDERFUL,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.460
EFFICIENT URBAN DESIGN.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.300
CITIES THAT BECOME
WALKABLE, BIKEABLE,

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.260
MORE CIVIL AND
CIVIC ORIENTED,

00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.900
BECAUSE WE DRAW ON THESE
300 YEAR OLD MODELS.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.200
SO CHARLESTON HAS A LOT TO
TEACH AND SOUTH CAROLINA

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.330
HAS A MAJOR
ROLE TO PLAY

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.130
IN THIS NATIONAL DEBATE
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.600
THE REALIZATION
IS UPON US.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.900
IT'S HUMAN ACTIVITY,
LARGELY THE BURNING OF

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.630
FOSSIL FUELS IN OUR
AUTOMOBILES AND POWER

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.760
PLANTS THAT'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR GLOBAL WARMING.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.360
THE PUBLIC IS
READY FOR CHANGE.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.400
AND SEVERAL OF SOUTH
CAROLINA'S MAJOR

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.930
INSTITUTIONS ARE GEARING
UP TO HELP POSITION

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.200
THE STATE FOR SEIZING
NEW OPPORTUNITIES

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.300
IN THE EMERGING
CARBON MARKET.

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.300
BUT ANY SOLUTION ALSO
DEPENDS ON ACTION

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.530
AND INNOVATION
FROM INDUSTRY.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:39.760
TIME REALLY IS
OF THE ESSENCE,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.830
AND WE NEED TO SEIZE
THESE OPPORTUNITIES

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.060
IN THE EMERGING
CARBON MARKETPLACE.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.500
AND HISTORY HAS SHOWN
US THAT INDUSTRY

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.130
DOES NOT RESPOND TO
VOLUNTARY MEASURES ALONE,

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.630
SO WE WILL NEED SOME FORM
OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.200
AND THIS INTERVENTION
MAY COME IN THE FORM

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.800
OF INCENTIVES
AND LEGISLATION

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.830
AND IN ORDER TO
REALIZE SUCCESS,

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.330
WE WILL NEED THE
PARTICIPATION AND EFFORTS

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.060
OF GOVERNMENTS,
AND INDUSTRY,

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.100
AND EVERY PRIVATE
CITIZEN TO GET INVOLVED.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.160
THAT HUMANS ARE NEGATIVELY
IMPACTING LIFE OVER THE

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.600
ENTIRE PLANET RAISES AN
OBVIOUS MORAL QUESTION.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.060
A DEEPLY FELT
CONNECTION TO NATURE

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.060
AMONG REVEREND
PINCKNEY'S BRETHREN

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.200
UNDERLIES THEIR
SPIRITED SONG

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.600
AND MAKES CLEAR
THE TRUEST MEANING

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.460
OF GIVING PRAISE
TO GOD'S CREATION.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:43.260
NATURE IS A PART OF WHO
WE ARE, AND I DON'T THINK

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.730
THAT DESTROYING NATURE
IS GODLY AT ALL.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.260
I THINK IT'S HOW
WE MANAGE IT

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.000
AND HOW WE LOOK
AND RESPECT IT -

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.060
I THINK THAT'S GODLY ABOUT
HOW WE DEAL WITH NATURE.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.700
(SINGING)

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.330
AMEN!

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.460
SOUTH FLORIDA IS A
TREASURED REGION

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.430
OF OUR NATION.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:22.430
FROM THE EVERGLADES TO THE
KEYS, A VAST WILDERNESS.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.860
PEOPLE COME TO MARVEL
AT ITS WILDLIFE.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.360
ABOVE GROUND...

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.660
AND UNDERWATER...

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.760
BUT MAINLY, PEOPLE COME
TO RESTORE PERSPECTIVE.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.830
THE KEYS ARE SO UNIQUE.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.960
I CAN START FROM A VERY
FACTUAL POINT OF VIEW

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.560
AND SAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S
THE ONLY SUBTROPICAL

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.230
PART OF THE
UNITED STATES.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.300
THERE ARE PLANTS AND
THINGS THAT GROW HERE

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.600
THAT DON'T GROW ANYWHERE
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.300
BUT IT GOES
BEYOND THAT;

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.800
THE KEYS HAS A
MAGICAL SENSE TO IT.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.560
RESIDENTS LIKE FRAN DECKER
HAVE SETTLED IN THE KEYS,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.160
ENJOYING A LIFESTYLE
LARGELY DEPENDENT ON

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.000
THRIVING TOURISM.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.230
ONCE A TOURIST HERSELF,
JUANITA GREENE MADE

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.530
SOUTH FLORIDA HER HOME
NEARLY HALF A CENTURY AGO.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.160
TAKING IN HER AMAZING
SURROUNDINGS ON THE

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.900
ANHINGA TRAIL IN
EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.300
JUANITA WILL TELL YOU
THERE'S MORE TO THIS

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.700
TREASURED PLACE
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.830
WELL, ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT IT IS

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.560
IS THE SILENCE.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.960
YOU KNOW, NO
HORNS AND NO NOISE

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.630
EXCEPT THE
NATURAL NOISE.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.530
AND YOU CAN HEAR
THE WIND BLOWING.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.230
LOVERS OF THE OUTDOORS
NATURALLY VALUE

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.630
ALL SOUTH FLORIDA
HAS TO OFFER.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.000
BUT SWEEPING TRACTS
OF UNDEVELOPED LAND

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.100
MEAN SOMETHING
TO EVERYONE.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:46.130
THE GREAT, GREAT VALUE OF
THE EVERGLADES IS THAT IT'S

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.730
SNUGGED RIGHT UP AGAINST A
HUGE DENSELY POPULATED AREA.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.700
AND EVEN PEOPLE WHO NEVER
COME TO THE EVERGLADES

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.730
ARE COMFORTED
WITH THE THOUGHT

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.060
THAT THE EVERGLADES
ARE OUT THERE.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.060
THE VALUE OF THE
EVERGLADES -

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.500
AND, BY THE WAY, IT IS
A WORLD HERITAGE SITE,

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.560
IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL
BIOSPHERE RESERVE AND

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.360
IT'S ALSO AN INTERNATIONAL
WETLAND OF IMPORTANCE

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.700
- AND MY FEELING IS THAT
EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.460
PROVIDES A VERY
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.530
TO THE RESIDENTS
OF SOUTH FLORIDA.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.600
IT IS THE LARGEST
WILDERNESS AREA

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.230
EAST OF THE ROCKIES.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.230
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE
NATURAL AREA.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.800
INSIDERS REFER TO "THE
GREATER EVERGLADES ECOSYSTEM"

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.830
MILE UPON MILE
OF INTACT WETLANDS,

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.500
A LOW COUNTRY WHERE ONLY AN
INCH OF RISE IN ELEVATION

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.460
CAN SPELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN GRASSY PRAIRIE

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.230
AND WOODED HAMMOCK.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.160
THE SYSTEM, SPANNING
SOME ONE AND A HALF

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.830
MILLION ACRES,
HAS ENDURED MUCH,

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.230
LOSING 50% OF ITS WATER
FLOW TO NEIGHBORING

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.530
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY AND
BURGEONING DEVELOPMENT.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.230
BUT CONFRONTING SOUTH
FLORIDA TODAY THERE'S THE

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.400
OVER-ARCHING ENVIRONMENTAL
PROBLEM - GLOBAL WARMING.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.700
YES, GLOBAL WARMING
IS VERY REAL.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.000
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING
FOR THE FUTURE;

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.160
IT'S IN FACT
HAPPENING NOW.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.030
AND, YES, IT WILL HAVE
AN INCREASING INFLUENCE

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.500
ON THE EVERGLADES AND
ALL OF OUR COASTAL

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.130
AND LOW-LYING
ENVIRONMENTS.

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.400
THE POLAR ICE
CAPS ARE MELTING

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.360
AS OUR PLANET
HEATS UP.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.330
THAT SPELLS DANGER FOR LOW
LYING AREAS AROUND THE GLOBE.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.900
ESPECIALLY TROUBLING
TO SCIENTISTS

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.260
OBSERVING CHANGE
IN SOUTH FLORIDA

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:33.800
IS A DRAMATICALLY EVOLVING
LANDSCAPE ALONG THE COAST.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.030
WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE
DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:40.130
BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE
MANGROVE AND WHATEVER'S

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.500
BEHIND THEM - EITHER WATER
OR FRESHWATER SWAMP.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.160
AND ALL OF THIS IS BECAUSE,
FOR SOUTH FLORIDA,

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.660
FOR INSTANCE, WE
HAVE HAD A RELATIVE

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.900
SEA LEVEL RISE OF NINE
TO TEN INCHES SINCE 1930.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.130
THIS IS AN INCREASE IN THE
RATE OF SEA LEVEL RISE OF

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.200
EIGHT TO NINE TIMES WHAT
HAD BEEN GOING ON FOR THE

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.300
LAST 2000 YEARS AND
THAT'S DRAMATIC -

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.660
IT'S CLOSE
TO CATASTROPHIC.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:10.030
IN THE NEXT 100 YEARS, IF
SOMETHING ISN'T DONE TO

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.600
LIMIT AND LOWER GLOBAL
WARMING POLLUTION,

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.660
EARTH'S SEAS WILL
CONTINUE TO RISE,

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.630
ACCORDING TO DR. WANLESS,
BY ANOTHER TWO FEET.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.030
PARK OFFICIALS
ARE CONCERNED.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:25.630
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SEA
LEVEL RISE SINCE RELIEF

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.630
HERE IS SO LOW, WE'RE
SEEING AREAS THAT WOULD,

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:30.700
IN FACT, BE INUNDATED
AND CHANGE OF HABITAT

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.700
FROM SAW GRASS
PRAIRIE TO MORE

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.730
MANGROVE SALT-DOMINATED
ECOSYSTEMS.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:40.300
ACROSS FLORIDA BAY, MUCH
DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.900
NOW ADD ANOTHER
TWO FEET OF SEA.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.800
THE REDRAWN COASTLINE
SPELLS SIGNIFICANT LOSS

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.200
OF WETLAND HABITAT
FOR WADING BIRDS

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.600
AND FRESHWATER AQUATICS.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.600
GLOBAL WARMING
MEANS RISING SEAS,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.330
RISING TEMPERATURES,

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.360
AND RISING UNCERTAINTY
ABOUT THE WEATHER.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.330
SCIENTISTS ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE INCREASED HEAT

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:06.060
RISING OFF THE OCEANS AND
INTENSIFYING HURRICANES.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:09.000
THIS YEAR, WITH HURRICANES
KATRINA AND WILMA,

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.960
IN BOTH THOSE
CASES WE EXPERIENCED

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.630
A STORM SURGE HERE AT
EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.160
IN KATRINA WE HAD A STORM
SURGE DOWN IN FLAMINGO

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.760
THAT WAS FROM THREE
TO FOUR FEET

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.760
AND THEN SIX WEEKS
LATER, IN WILMA,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.800
WE HAD A STORM SURGE OF
FROM EIGHT TO NINE FEET.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.030
AND I AM CONCERNED THAT
INCREASES IN SEA LEVEL RISE

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.100
WOULD EXACERBATE
THOSE KINDS OF IMPACTS.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.900
EVEN IF THE HURRICANE
LEVEL STAYS THE SAME,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.500
WITH RISING SEA
LEVEL WE WILL HAVE

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.200
AN INCREASED IMPACT
BY HURRICANES

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.460
BECAUSE THEY WILL
REACH FURTHER IN,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.560
THEY WILL MOVE MORE
SAND ON BARRIER ISLANDS,

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.800
THEY WILL CUT MORE
INLETS, AND SO ON.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.830
AND SO, EVEN WITHOUT
WORRYING ABOUT THE INCREASE

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.300
- LIKELY, IN MY MIND -
INCREASE IN HURRICANES,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.600
WE'RE STILL GOING TO
HAVE A DRAMATICALLY

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.000
INCREASED INFLUENCE
FROM HURRICANES.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.400
SOUTH FLORIDA, ITSELF
AN ANCIENT CORAL REEF,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.760
CONNECTS TO THE
COUNTRY'S ONLY LIVING

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.930
BARRIER REEF
ENVIRONMENT.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.800
HAVING LOGGED OVER 18,000
DIVE HOURS IN THESE WATERS,

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.400
DR. BILLY CAUSEY TREASURES
THE FLORIDA KEYS.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.100
THE KEYS ARE AN
INCREDIBLY SPECIAL PLACE.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.160
AND, IN FACT, THIS
ENVIRONMENT IS UNLIKE

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.860
ANY OTHER ENVIRONMENT IN
THE COASTAL UNITED STATES.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.330
CORAL REEFS ARE THE MOST
BIOLOGICALLY DIVERSE

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:31.260
COMMUNITIES IN THE
MARINE ENVIRONMENT

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.230
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.630
THE NATURAL BEAUTY HERE,
AS ABUNDANT ABOVE WATER

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.830
AS BELOW, ATTRACTS
THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.760
AND SOME, FALLING IN LOVE
WITH WILD BEACHES LIKE

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.630
BAHIA HONDA STATE PARK,
MAKE THE KEYS THEIR HOME.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.060
THOSE ARE SOME OF MY
ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PLACES

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.200
IN THE KEYS.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.600
AND I LOVE BEACHES
AND I LOVE ANYWHERE

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.860
WHERE THE OCEAN AND THE
LAND COMES TOGETHER.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.460
AND THAT BEACH TENDS TO BE
KIND OF WILD AND WINDSWEPT.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.400
AS WITH THE REST OF SOUTH
FLORIDA, GLOBAL WARMING

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.960
IS TAKING ITS TOLL
ON THE FLORIDA KEYS.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.960
SIGNS ABOVE
GROUND AND BELOW

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.630
ALERT MARINE
BIOLOGISTS OF SERIOUS

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.530
HEALTH PROBLEMS RELATED
TO WARMING SEAS.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:19.330
SCIENTISTS ARE CERTAIN
THAT THERE ARE CHANGES

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.400
TAKING PLACE, CLIMATE
CHANGES THAT WE ARE

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.030
ABLE TO RECORD.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:26.230
WE'RE SEEING THIS IN THE
CORAL REEF ENVIRONMENT -

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.600
THE CORAL REEFS ARE REALLY
THE CANARY IN THE COALMINE

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.130
IN THAT WE ARE SEEING
CHANGES TAKE PLACE.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.060
FROZEN ICE CAPS OF THE
ARCTIC AND ANTARCTIC

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.130
AND CORAL REEFS TOGETHER
REPRESENT THE MOST

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:41.830
STABLE ENVIRONMENTS
IN GEOLOGIC TIME.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.600
CORAL REEFS EXIST IN A
NARROW TEMPERATURE RANGE

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.000
- BETWEEN 65 AND 85
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.860
CORAL BLEACHING, WHILE
A NATURAL PART OF A

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.800
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
SUPPORTING CORAL GROWTH

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.860
AND ALGAE, NOW APPEARS
AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.230
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.060
MASSIVE CORAL BLEACHING
EVENTS WERE FIRST OBSERVED

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.530
IN THE MID 70'S,

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.900
AND THEY HAVE PICKED UP
IN FREQUENCY SINCE THEN

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.630
EVOLVING FROM
ISOLATED LOCAL EVENTS

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.900
TO REGIONAL TO
GLOBAL IN SCALE.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.300
THE GLOBAL WARMING PART
OF GLOBAL WARMING IS

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.400
INCREASED TEMPERATURE, AND
VERY CLEARLY THAT IS GOING

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.730
TO BE A DISASTER FOR THE
TROPICS BECAUSE MANY OF

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.660
THE ORGANISMS THAT LIVE
IN OUR SHALLOW SEAS

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.260
LIKE WARM WATER, BUT THEY
WILL DIE IN HOT WATER.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.330
DYING FISH, MAJOR
LOSSES OF SEA URCHINS,

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.430
SPONGES, AND CORALS,

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.030
INTENSIFIED HURRICANES
AND RISING SEA LEVELS

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.900
INUNDATING AND PERMANENTLY
REDRAWING COASTLINES...

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.830
SUCH ARE THE GLOBAL
WARMING IMPACTS THAT

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.460
THREATEN OUR MOST
TREASURED PLACES.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.630
SO THERE ARE CHALLENGES
WITH GLOBAL WARMING,

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.230
BUT THERE ARE ALSO
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:54.700
AND IF BUSINESSES SEIZE
THESE OPPORTUNITIES,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.930
WE WILL SEE INNOVATION
FLOW FORWARD.

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:58.660
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
SEEING BUSINESSES

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.730
LIKE GENERAL
ELECTRIC, DUPONT

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.100
AND BRITISH PETROLEUM
PROVIDE LEADERSHIP.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.230
BUT WE NEED OTHER
SECTORS TO ENGAGE,

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.730
LIKE THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR,
WHERE THEY CAN ACTUALLY

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.900
GROW FUELS WHERE WE USED
TO MINE FOSSIL FUELS,

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.460
AND THAT WILL PROVIDE
CLEANER SOURCES OF ENERGY

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.000
THAT REDUCE GLOBAL
WARMING POLLUTION.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.700
THIS INNOVATION WILL
NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.060
GOVERNMENT
INVOLVEMENT.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:21.030
VOLUNTARY MEASURES
DON'T WORK.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.560
TIME AND TIME AGAIN
WE'VE SEEN THE GOVERNMENT

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.330
SETS THE RULES OF THE
ROAD, INDUSTRY RESPONDS

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:29.530
WITH TECHNOLOGY
AND INNOVATION.

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.800
THE BEST EXAMPLE IS THE
ACID RAIN PROVISIONS

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.600
OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.030
WE HAD SUCCESS THERE, WE
CAN HAVE SUCCESS AGAIN

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.900
USING THE
SAME MEASURES

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.360
FOR GLOBAL
WARMING POLLUTION.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.000
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED
GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP;

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.060
INVOLVEMENT AND
INNOVATION FROM INDUSTRY;

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.730
AND THE SUPPORT
OF EVERY CITIZEN.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.160
AS OUR CITIES BALLOON
WITH DEVELOPMENT,

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.460
THAT GROWTH CAUSES
INCREASED CONSUMPTION

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.360
OF ELECTRICITY,
DRIVING MORE CARS,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.000
AND SHRINKING WILD AREAS
- ALL CAUSING POLLUTION

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.160
THAT EXACERBATES
GLOBAL WARMING.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.860
TAKING TIME TO REFLECT,
JUANITA PEERS OUT

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.160
ON A SCENE THAT
FOR MANY DECADES

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.900
HAS NEVER FAILED TO
LIFT HER SPIRITS.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.700
AND IT'S REAL, IT'S NOT
CONTRIVED; IT'S PART OF

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.200
THE NATURAL SYSTEM AND WE
CONNECT TO THE NATURAL

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.260
SYSTEM BECAUSE WE'RE PART
OF THE NATURAL SYSTEM

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.560
AND WE NEED TO
ASSOCIATE WITH IT.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.960
THAT'S THE SORT OF
THE SPIRITUAL PART

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.560
OF THE EVERGLADES, THE
NEED FOR THE EVERGLADES.
