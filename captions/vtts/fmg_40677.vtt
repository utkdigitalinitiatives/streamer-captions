WEBVTT

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.930
WE LOVE STORIES
THAT TERRIFY US...

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.030
STORIES THAT
ENCHANT US...

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.960
STORIES THAT INSPIRE US...

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.630
AND WE ALWAYS HAVE.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.660
THE POWER OF VISUAL
STORY-TELLING

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.830
IS NOT A MODERN
PHENOMENON.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.660
FEATURE FILMS TODAY
ARE USING TECHNIQUES

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.260
DEVELOPED WAY BACK
IN THE DISTANT PAST.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.230
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS ARTISTS
GRAPPLED WITH WAYS TO BRING

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.660
THEIR STORIES ALIVE, TO
CAPTIVATE THEIR AUDIENCE.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.960
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW
OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.430
MADE THE DISCOVERIES
THAT HAVE GIVEN FILM

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.800
SUCH A HOLD OVER
OUR IMAGINATIONS.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:12.830
♪

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.160
♪

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.160
EVERY YEAR, SEVEN BILLION
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.430
PAY MONEY TO DO THIS:

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.360
SIT DOWN IN FRONT
OF A LARGE SCREEN

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.130
AND WATCH PICTURES
TELL A STORY.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.260
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.060
OH, MA. MA!

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.000
MAA-AAA. MAA-AAAA.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.360
WHEN WE WATCH A
REALLY GOOD FILM

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.130
SOMETHING
EXTRAORDINARY HAPPENS.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.030
WE BECOME SO INVOLVED
WITH WHAT'S GOING ON

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.400
WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE'RE
LIVING IN THE STORY OURSELVES.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.160
VISUAL STORY TELLING
HAS A UNIQUE POWER

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.300
OVER OUR IMAGINATIONS.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.900
IT CAPTIVATES US.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.160
HOME, PIG.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.500
THIS IS GEORGE MILLER,
THE MAN RESPONSIBLE

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.260
FOR A SERIES OF BOX OFFICE
HITS, INCLUDING BABE.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.960
IT'S THE JOB OF THE STORYTELLER
TO ENGAGE AN AUDIENCE

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.860
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.400
YOU BRING TO BEAR ALL
YOUR TECHNIQUES, WISDOM

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.260
AND KNOWLEDGE
OF FILMMAKING

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.530
IN ORDER TO
ENCHANT THE AUDIENCE,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.630
TO HAVE THEM
SUSPEND THEIR DISBELIEF

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.030
TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE WHAT'S
HAPPENING BEFORE THEM.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.730
BUT STORYTELLING IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT WAS INVENTED

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030
IN FILM WHICH IS
ONLY 100 YEARS OLD

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.530
AND TELEVISION WHICH
IS ONLY HALF A CENTURY.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.800
IT GOES RIGHT BACK
TO THE BEGINNING OF

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.700
HUMAN ENGAGEMENT,
REALLY.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.130
>>SO HOW DID FILM GET THE
ABILITY TO TRANSPORT US

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.530
TO IMAGINARY WORLDS?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.100
WHERE DID THE
INGREDIENTS COME FROM

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.100
THAT GIVE IT SUCH A
COMPELLING HOLD OVER US?

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.860
TO FIND THE ANSWER, WE NEED
TO TRACE VISUAL STORYTELLING

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.660
BACK TO ITS ANCIENT ORIGINS,
AND WHAT BETTER PLACE TO START

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.230
THAN AT THE VERY
DAWN OF CIVILIZATION?

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.660
WE HAVE COME
TO MESOPOTAMIA

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.860
IN THE DESERT SANDS
OF THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.860
SO MANY OF THE THINGS WE
TAKE FOR GRANTED TODAY

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.000
ORIGINATED HERE.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
FARMING, MATHEMATICS,
WRITING...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.360
THEY ALL STARTED
BETWEEN TWO RIVERS -

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.860
THE TIGRIS AND
THE EUPHRATES.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.260
BUT THE REASON WE'VE COME
TO MESOPOTAMIA IS BECAUSE

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.160
IT WAS HERE IN THE 19TH
CENTURY THAT A BRITISH

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.000
ARCHAEOLOGIST MADE A
REVELATORY DISCOVERY.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.230
HIS NAME WAS
AUSTEN HENRY LAYARD.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.130
LAYARD AND HIS TEAM WERE
EXCAVATING ANCIENT SITES

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.560
THROUGHOUT MESOPOTAMIA
AND FOUND MANY TREASURES.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.330
BUT FAR AND AWAY THE
MOST INTRIGUING OF THESE

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.260
WAS A CACHE OF 25,000
BROKEN CLAY TABLETS

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.500
COVERED WITH
UNREADABLE MARKINGS.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.300
THE TABLETS WERE
BROUGHT BACK TO LONDON

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.430
AND PAINSTAKINGLY
REASSEMBLED.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.830
THE MARKINGS WERE
FOUND TO BE THE WORLD'S

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.160
FIRST WRITTEN LANGUAGE
- CUNEIFORM.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.400
SCHOLARS ORIGINALLY
ASSUMED THAT THE TABLETS

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.700
WERE JUST COURT
RECORDS OR ACCOUNTS.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.800
BUT THEN AFTER YEARS OF STUDY
THEIR CODE WAS FINALLY CRACKED.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.660
SOME OF THESE TABLETS
ACTUALLY TOLD A STORY.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.200
IT WAS THE FIRST
STORY EVER WRITTEN.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.700
IT WAS A STORY THAT BEGAN AND
ENDED IN THE FIRST CITY EVER

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:18.460
BUILT - A CITY IN WHAT IS NOW
SOUTHERN IRAQ, CALLED URUK.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.760
BUILT 6,000 YEARS AGO, URUK WAS
FOR MANY CENTURIES THE WORLD'S

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.100
LARGEST CITY, WITH WALLS THAT
RAN FOR MORE THAN FIVE MILES

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.700
AND A POPULATION OF
ALMOST HALF A MILLION.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.360
TODAY, SADLY, WAR AND THE
ENCROACHING DESERT HAVE ALL

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.600
BUT DESTROYED THIS WONDER
OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:53.800
BUT WHAT HAS SURVIVED IS THE
STORY THAT THIS CITY INSPIRED.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:07:03.930
THE STORY OF GILGAMESH: THE
WORLD'S FIRST GREAT HERO.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.960
THE STORY OF GILGAMESH
TELLS OF ONE MAN'S SEARCH

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.560
FOR ETERNAL LIFE.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.960
IN A SERIES OF
DARING ADVENTURES,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.900
GILGAMESH DEFEATS MONSTERS
AND CHALLENGES THE GODS

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.630
BEFORE RETURNING HOME
TO HIS BELOVED URUK.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.760
SO COMPELLING WAS THIS
STORY OF AN ACTION HERO

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.030
THAT IT WAS PASSED
DOWN FOR GENERATIONS.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.800
AND 4,000 YEARS
AFTER IT WAS FIRST TOLD

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:43.160
IT'S STILL POPULAR TODAY
HERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.500
THE STORY OF GILGAMESH
HAD EXPLOITED THE UNIVERSAL

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.860
HUMAN DESIRE
FOR A HERO.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.500
MOST GREAT
STORIES HAVE A HERO.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.730
THE STAR WARS TRILOGY TENDED
TO HAVE A NUMBER OF HEROIC

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:11.330
CHARACTERS BUT LUKE SKYWALKER
IN THE FIRST PART OF IT.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.130
I DON'T THINK A PERSON
CAN DECLARE THEMSELVES

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.900
TO BE THE HERO.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.600
A HERO'S DEFINED BY THE
ACTIONS THAT THEY UNDERGO.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.360
A HERO'S DEFINED BY THE EVENTS
THAT HAPPEN TO THEM AND INDEED

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.200
THE RESPONSE - THE SPIRITUAL AND
MORAL RESPONSE TO THOSE EVENTS.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.930
FOR GILGAMESH THERE
WAS ONE EVENT ABOVE ALL

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.600
THAT SYMBOLIZED HIS HEROISM:
WHEN HE SINGLE-HANDEDLY

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.860
ATTACKED AND KILLED
A PRIDE OF LIONS.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.560
THE STORY OF GILGAMESH
AS HEROIC FIGURE

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.230
SPREAD ACROSS
THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.900
KINGS AND PRINCES FROM
PERSIA TO ANCIENT EGYPT

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.900
WERE ALL EAGER TO
EXPLOIT HIS FAME.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.930
ONE KING IN PARTICULAR
SOUGHT TO PROMOTE HIMSELF

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.730
BY CAPITALIZING ON
THE HERO'S POWER.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.560
THIS WAS ASHURBANAPAL,
KING OF ASSYRIA,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.900
WHAT'S NOW
NORTHERN IRAQ.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:31.960
BUT ASHURBANAPAL
HAD ONE BIG PROBLEM.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:38.700
IN 645 BC HARDLY ANYONE COULD
READ A SCRIPT LIKE CUNEIFORM

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.630
SO ASHURBANAPAL DEPARTED
FROM A STORY TOLD IN WORDS

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.330
AND DEVISED INSTEAD A STORY
TOLD THROUGH PICTURES -

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.700
WITH HIMSELF, NOT GILGAMESH,
PLAYING THE LEAD ROLE.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.460
IN A SERIES OF CARVED IMAGES
ASHURBANAPAL SHOWS HIMSELF,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:19.760
LIKE GILGAMESH BEFORE HIM,
AS A SUPREME LION SLAYER.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:34.500
THE FRIEZE IS MADE
UP OF FOUR IMAGES.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.030
IN THE FIRST A SERVANT
LIFTS THE GATE ON A CAGE,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.460
RELEASING A LION.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.960
THE LION SPRINGS OUT AND
RUNS TOWARDS ASHURBANAPAL.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.600
AS IT LEAPS INTO MID AIR
IT'S STRUCK BY AN ARROW.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.230
AND IN A FINAL IMAGE
ASHURBANAPAL FINISHES OFF

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:06.100
THE LION WITH A SWORD
STABBED THROUGH ITS BODY.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.530
THE SCULPTORS WANT US TO
SHARE THE THRILL OF THE ACTION.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.300
THEY'VE CREATED A
SERIES OF FRIEZE FRAMES

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.600
CAPTURING THE EXCITEMENT
OF THE MOMENT.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:24.160
AND DOMINATING THE FRIEZE
IS ITS HERO, ASHURBANAPAL.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.530
ORIGINALLY THESE MAGNIFICENT
FRIEZES WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.460
PAINTED IN BRIGHT,
VIVID COLORS.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.300
ASHURBANAPAL HAD THEM
PROMINENTLY DISPLAYED

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.600
ON THE WALLS OF
THE THRONE ROOM

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.300
OF HIS GREAT
PALACE AT NINEVAH.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.560
ALTHOUGH THE PALACE
NO LONGER EXISTS,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.230
USING THE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL REMAINS

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.660
WE'VE RECONSTRUCTED WHAT IT
MIGHT ONCE HAVE LOOKED LIKE.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.800
ASHURBANAPAL'S STORY COULD BE
APPRECIATED NOT JUST BY THOSE

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:08.560
SELECT FEW WHO COULD READ,
BUT BY EVERYONE WHO COULD SEE.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.330
BUT IN ITSELF THAT
WASN'T ENOUGH.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.430
IMAGINE WATCHING A FILM IN
WHICH THE HERO ONLY APPEARS

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.460
IN ONE SCENE.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.330
WHAT WE NEED TO FIND NEXT
IS A STORY THAT DEVELOPS -

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.160
A STORY WITH A BEGINNING,
MIDDLE, AND END.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.430
IN SHORT: A
GRIPPING YARN.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.930
ASHURBANAPAL HAD A NEW SERIES
OF RELIEFS MADE FOR HIS PALACE.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:52.500
IT'S LIKE A STORYBOARD
FOR AN EPIC BLOCKBUSTER.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.130
WITH A CAST OF THOUSANDS
IT TELLS THE STORY OF

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.730
ASHURBANAPAL'S WAR WITH
HIS ENEMIES, THE ELAMITES,

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:16.300
WHO CAN BE IDENTIFIED
BY THEIR HEADBANDS.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.730
DURING A MIGHTY BATTLE,
THE BATTLE OF TIL-TUBA,

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.960
THE ELAMITES ARE FORCED
TO RETREAT INTO THE RIVER.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.100
SOON IT'S RUNNING
RED WITH THEIR BLOOD.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.400
ACCORDING TO
ASHURBANAPAL

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:52.330
THE RIVER WAS CHOKED WITH
CORPSES FOR THREE LONG DAYS.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:57.060
THESE GRAPHIC IMAGES ARE AS
EXPLICIT AS ANY YOU WOULD SEE

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.930
IN A CONTEMPORARY
FEATURE FILM.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.530
A BIRD IS TEARING
OUT A SOLDIER'S EYE.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.500
AND HERE ONE OF
ASHURBANAPAL'S HENCHMEN

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.230
IS HOLDING THE HAIR OF
THE ELAMITE KING, TEUMMAN,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.530
SEVERING HIS
HEAD FROM HIS BODY.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.060
THE HEAD IS CARRIED AS A TROPHY
THROUGH THE ENEMY LINES.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:27.960
WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A COMPLEX
TALE UNFOLDING OVER MANY SCENES.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.230
NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE A
BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND END

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:39.500
IT HAS SUB PLOTS MAKING
THE STORY MORE INTRIGUING.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.000
AS THE BATTLE WITH
THE ELAMITES RAGES,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.660
SOMETHING ELSE
IS HAPPENING.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.030
A GROUP OF PRISONERS ARE
BEING FORCED TO GRIND DOWN

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:53.130
THE BONES OF THEIR
ANCESTORS TO MAKE BREAD.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.360
JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR VISITORS

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.500
TO SEE THIS STORY ON THE WALL
OF THE GREAT HALL IN NINEVAH.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.630
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO
SPEAK THE ASSYRIAN LANGUAGE

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.200
TO GET THE POINT.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.060
THE ASSYRIANS
LAID THE FOUNDATION

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.660
OF VISUAL
STORYTELLING.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:21.360
THEY ESTABLISHED TWO KEY
ELEMENTS: A HERO AND A PLOT.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:28.730
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
CRITICAL MISSING HERE.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:34.160
WHILE THERE'S LOTS OF
BLOOD AND VIOLENCE -

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.460
HERE TEUMMAN IS HAVING
HIS HEAD LOPPED OFF -

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.600
NO ONE SEEMS TO MIND.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:53.200
THERE'S NO RAGE,
NO TEARS, NO EMOTION.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.060
AND AS A RESULT IT'S HARD
TO BE INVOLVED IN THE STORY,

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.260
LET ALONE TO CARE
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.560
WE JUST DON'T FEEL ENGAGED
WITH THESE CHARACTERS,

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.460
SO WHEN AND HOW DID ANCIENT
ARTISTS MAKE US CARE?

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.430
TO FIND OUR ANSWER WE HAVE
TO LEAVE THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:30.160
WE NEED TO COME TO THE NORTHERN
SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.500
BECAUSE HERE THERE WAS
ANOTHER ANCIENT CIVILIZATION

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.900
WITH A RICH TRADITION OF
VIVID, EVOCATIVE STORYTELLING.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.100
WHO ELSE BUT
THE GREEKS?

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.900
IF ANY CIVILIZATION COULD FIND A
WAY TO CREATE CHARACTERS THAT

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:55.330
PEOPLE COULD BELIEVE IN AND CARE
ABOUT, THEN THE GREEKS COULD.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:17:00.500
THE GREEKS WERE OBSESSED WITH
THEIR EPIC STORIES, THEIR MYTHS.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.260
AND THERE WAS ONE MYTH
ABOVE ALL THAT THE GREEKS

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:10.300
LIKED TO VISUALIZE:
HOMER'S TALE OF ODYSSEUS.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:15.560
HERE ON THE COASTLINE OF
SPERLONGA IN SOUTHERN ITALY

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.400
GREEK ARTISTS CONVERTED
THIS ENORMOUS CAVE INTO A

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:25.130
DINING ROOM WHERE GUESTS WERE
LAVISHLY FED AND ENTERTAINED.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:29.560
TODAY THE CAVE IS EMPTY,
BUT IN THE FIRST CENTURY BC

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.860
DINERS WOULD HAVE
BEEN SURROUNDED BY

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.860
MARBLE SCULPTURES
DEPICTING KEY SCENES

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.900
FROM THE STORY
OF ODYSSEUS.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.200
AND THEY'D BE SEEN AT
THEIR BEST NOT DURING THE DAY

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.200
BUT AT NIGHT TIME, BY THE
LIGHT OF FLICKERING TORCHES.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.460
THE STATUES ARE
NOW IN A MUSEUM,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.760
BUT WITH THE AID OF COMPUTER
GRAPHICS WE CAN REUNITE THEM

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.200
WITH THEIR ORIGINAL LOCATION
IN THE EXACT POSITIONS

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.900
THEY WERE PLACED IN
OVER 2,000 YEARS AGO.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.830
THIS MONUMENTAL SCULPTURE
ILLUSTRATES AN INCIDENT IN THE

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:27.000
DRAMATIC STORY OF ODYSSEUS'S
ENCOUNTER WITH A GIANT CYCLOPS.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:37.400
BUT HOW DO THESE SCULPTURES
ADVANCE VISUAL STORYTELLING?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.530
THE CYCLOPS, A GIANT
ONE-EYED CANNIBAL,

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:46.200
TRAPS ODYSSEUS AND
HIS SHIPMATES IN A CAVE.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.930
ALTHOUGH THEY
FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.330
ODYSSEUS AND HIS
COMPANIONS SEIZE THEIR CHANCE

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:58.730
AND DRIVE A STAKE INTO THE
SINGLE EYE OF THE GIANT.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:05.260
WHAT THE SCULPTORS HAVE
CHOSEN TO SHOW US IS THE

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:10.100
MOMENT OF MAXIMUM TENSION,
JUST BEFORE THE CLIMAX.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.030
BUT WHY? BECAUSE IT'S AT
THIS MOMENT THE CHARACTERS'

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:19.300
EMOTIONS ARE AT
THEIR MOST REVEALING.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.600
WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
THINKING AND FEELING.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.260
BY DEPICTING REALISTIC EMOTIONS
GREEK ARTISTS HAD FOUND A WAY

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.830
TO BRING THEIR
STORIES ALIVE.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.160
WITH THE LION-KILLING EXPLOITS
OF KING ASHURBANAPAL,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.400
ARTISTS DISCOVERED
A STRONG HEROIC LEAD.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.560
WITH HIS BATTLE SCENES THEY
INVENTED A GRIPPING STORYLINE.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.600
AND IN THE CAVE
OF SPERLONGA,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.300
THE GREEKS SHOWED HOW
TO CREATE CHARACTERS

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:56.800
AN AUDIENCE COULD BEGIN TO
IDENTIFY WITH EMOTIONALLY.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.900
BUT SO FAR NONE OF THEM
HAD COMBINED ALL OF THESE

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:06.000
INGREDIENTS IN A
SINGLE VISUAL STORY.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:16.760
WELL, NOT, THAT IS, UNTIL 100
YEARS AFTER THE BIRTH OF CHRIST.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.830
WELCOME TO TRAJAN'S
COLUMN IN THE HEART OF ROME.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.800
IT'S QUITE LITERALLY THE
HIGHEST FORM OF STORYTELLING

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.600
THAT THERE IS.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:58.360
AT 35 METERS HIGH, THE
MARBLE COLUMN STOOD ABOVE

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:03.700
ALL OTHER BUILDINGS
IN ANCIENT ROME.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.900
THE COLUMN WAS BUILT
BY THE EMPEROR, TRAJAN.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.230
IT COMMEMORATES HIS VICTORY
IN THE WAR AGAINST HIS ENEMIES,

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:16.530
THE DACIANS, IN WHAT IS
TODAY MODERN ROMANIA.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.830
THE SPOILS OF THESE WARS
PAID NOT JUST FOR THE COLUMN

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.430
BUT ALSO FOR THE SURROUNDING
COMPLEX OF MARKETS, LIBRARIES,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:29.130
SQUARES, AND PUBLIC
MONUMENTS OF TRAJAN'S FORUM.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:34.430
ALAS, TODAY THE FORUM IS
LITTLE MORE THAN RUBBLE.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:39.630
TRAJAN'S COLUMN ALONE
HAS SURVIVED BECAUSE

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.900
FOR ALMOST 2,000 YEARS
IT'S HELD A FASCINATION

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.500
FOR SOME OF THE MOST
POWERFUL MEN IN HISTORY.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.560
NAPOLEON BONAPARTE
ADMIRED THE COLUMN SO MUCH

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.400
HE WANTED IT DISMANTLED
AND BROUGHT TO PARIS.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:03.830
HE WAS ONLY DISSUADED WHEN TOLD
IT WOULDN'T SURVIVE THE JOURNEY.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.700
THE COLUMN WAS ALSO SPECIAL TO
THE ITALIAN DICTATOR MUSSOLINI.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.060
WHEN THE SECOND
WORLD WAR BROKE OUT

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:15.060
HE HAD IT PROTECTED BY
BOMB-PROOF CLADDING.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.530
SO WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE
COLUMN THAT SO IMPRESSED

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:31.300
ROMAN CITIZENS, EMPERORS,
DICTATORS, AND TOURISTS ALIKE?

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.630
WELL, IT'S HERE THAT ALL
THE VISUAL STORYTELLING

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:41.730
DISCOVERIES OF THE ANCIENT
WORLD CAME TOGETHER.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:49.030
OVER A CONTINUOUS 200 METER LONG
FRIEZE WE'VE GOT A COMPLEX TALE.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:54.430
IT SPIRALS AROUND THE MONUMENT
23 TIMES AND TELLS THE DETAILED

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.300
STORY OF TRAJAN'S CAMPAIGN
AGAINST THE DACIANS.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:03.630
IT'S BEEN CALLED A MOVIE
EPIC FROZEN IN STONE.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.860
IN EMPEROR TRAJAN WE
HAVE AN UNDISPUTED HERO.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.130
HE APPEARS AS A POWERFUL
AND DIGNIFIED LEADER

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.230
IN ALMOST EVERY SCENE.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:31.960
OVER THE MONUMENT AS A
WHOLE, HE APPEARS 59 TIMES.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.060
WE'VE ALSO GOT OUR VILLAIN:
THE DACIAN LEADER, DECEBALUS

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:42.960
- CRAFTY, SCHEMING,
CONVINCINGLY EVIL.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.230
AND WE'VE GOT AN EPIC
SUPPORTING CAST OF

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.800
TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND
EXTRAS WHOSE EMOTIONS

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:56.660
AND FEELINGS ARE MADE
INDIVIDUALLY APPARENT.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.400
BUT THAT'S
JUST THE START.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.460
AS A MASTERPIECE OF
VISUAL STORYTELLING,

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.860
TRAJAN'S COLUMN
HAD SO MUCH MORE.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.930
IT WAS EVEN ANTICIPATING
CERTAIN FILM TECHNIQUES

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.860
THAT DIRECTORS
WOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.030
HERE THE SCULPTOR
HAS DEPICTED A TREE...

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.100
BUT THIS ISN'T JUST TO
ADORN THE LANDSCAPE.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:27.300
THIS TREE HAS A MORE
IMPORTANT ROLE.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:32.400
THE SCULPTORS USED IT TO
DIVIDE TWO DISTINCT SCENES,

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:38.360
JUST AS TODAY A FILM DIRECTOR
WOULD USE A VISUAL CUT.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.830
ELSEWHERE THE SCULPTORS HAVE
USED ANOTHER VISUAL DEVICE

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.800
THAT'S FAMILIAR TO
FILMMAKERS TODAY.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.100
THEY'VE CHOSEN TO
SHOW THE ROMAN ARMY,

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.600
BURIED UNDER THEIR
SHIELDS, FROM ABOVE.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.300
IT'S CALLED "A
BIRD'S EYE VIEW".

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:58.330
THEY'VE ALSO CHOSEN TO SHOW
OTHER SOLDIERS INVOLVED IN THE

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:04.330
SAME SCENE WITH A DIFFERENT
VIEWPOINT: FROM A LOWER ANGLE.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.700
WHAT THE SCULPTORS REALIZED
IS THAT BY OFFERING MULTIPLE

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:12.800
VIEWPOINTS THEY CAN MAKE
THE BATTLE MORE DRAMATIC.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.260
THERE ISN'T A FILMMAKER
TODAY WHO DOES NOT EXPLOIT

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.230
THESE SAME
VISUAL TECHNIQUES.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:25.300
CINEMA IS A KIND OF VISUAL
MUSIC THAT YOU PLAY WITH THE

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:30.000
COLORS AND INSTRUMENTATIONS,
AS YOU WOULD IN AN ORCHESTRA,

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.660
SO WITH VARIOUS SHOTS.
SO THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.760
BETWEEN THE CLOSE-UP AND
THE WIDE SHOT AND SO ON.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.500
THE CREATORS OF TRAJAN'S
COLUMN HAD YET ANOTHER

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.360
TRICK UP THEIR SLEEVES.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.560
THEY FOUND A WAY
OF SUMMARIZING

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.900
THE MOST DRAMATIC
MOMENTS OF THEIR STORY.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.400
BY LOOKING UP THE NORTHWEST
VERTICAL AXIS THE VIEWER COULD

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.630
SEE AT A GLANCE THE HIGHLIGHTED
VERSION OF THIS EPIC.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.030
IT GOES SOMETHING
LIKE THIS:

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.060
ONE EMPEROR WANTS
TO CONQUER THE WORLD.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:12.730
NO ONE STANDS
IN HIS WAY.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:17.800
EXCEPT ONE MAN WHO IS
PREPARED TO SACRIFICE ALL

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.360
TO SAVE HIS PEOPLE.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.430
WAR IS INEVITABLE.

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.900
TORTURE...

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.130
ARSON...

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.630
BETRAYAL...

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:45.860
BUT ONLY ONE SIDE HAS
THE SUPPORT OF THE GODS.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.130
ONLY ONE SIDE CAN WIN
ULTIMATE VICTORY.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:02.800
THERE YOU GO... THE
WORLD'S FIRST EVER TRAILER.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.060
TRAJAN'S COLUMN SEEMS
TO HAVE EVERYTHING.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.360
IT'S THE CULMINATION OF
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.600
DISCOVERIES IN THE ART OF
TELLING STORIES WITH PICTURES.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.860
IT MAY HAVE GRABBED THE
IMAGINATIONS OF ANCIENT ROMANS

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.130
BUT IT DOESN'T DO
MUCH FOR US TODAY.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.630
STANDING IN FRONT OF THIS
MONUMENT IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.600
YOU'VE GONE ON AN
IMAGINARY JOURNEY

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.060
TO THE KILLING
FIELDS OF ROMANIA.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.600
IT JUST DOESN'T DO IT.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.600
EVEN THOUGH IT USES SO MANY
OF THE STORYTELLING DEVICES

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:44.100
OF MODERN-DAY FILMS, IT HASN'T
GOT THE POWER TO CAPTIVATE US.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:48.400
AND THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE
THE PICTURES AREN'T IN MOTION.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:55.500
TRAJAN'S COLUMN SEEMS TO
BE MISSING A FINAL ELEMENT.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:01.600
BUT PERHAPS WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACES.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.200
WE WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TO DO SO.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.730
THIS IS CAMBRIDGE
UNIVERSITY.

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.900
FOR CENTURIES THE
GREAT CENTERS OF LEARNING

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.860
HAD LOOKED
EXCLUSIVELY TO THE WEST

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.930
FOR THE ANSWERS
TO THEIR QUESTIONS.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:22.700
SCHOLARS BELIEVED THAT IT WAS
THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.230
OF GREECE AND ROME
THAT HAD MADE THE GREAT

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.860
BREAKTHROUGHS IN
THE ANCIENT WORLD.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.160
BUT THEY CAME TO REALIZE THAT
THE CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.160
DIDN'T HAVE ALL
THE ANSWERS.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.760
AND SO RESEARCHERS
BEGAN TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.330
RESEARCHERS BEGAN TO
EXPLORE PARTS OF THE WORLD

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.700
MUCH FURTHER AFIELD.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.060
THEY STARTED TO INVESTIGATE
CULTURES THAT UNTIL THEN

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.400
HAD BEEN
TOTALLY IGNORED.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.660
WHAT THEY DISCOVERED
WILL GIVE US THE FINAL PIECE

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.000
OF OUR JIGSAW: A WAY OF
TELLING STORIES WITH PICTURES

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.260
THAT IS TRULY CAPTIVATING.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.300
AND THIS SAME TECHNIQUE IS
ONE THAT HAS PROVED CRUCIAL

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:22.060
TO THE SUCCESS OF EVERY
FEATURE FILM MADE TODAY.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.700
THAT DISCOVERY WAS MADE ON A
CONTINENT THOUSANDS OF MILES

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.160
FROM EUROPE ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD:

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:35.030
AUSTRALIA.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:40.400
WHEN THE FIRST EUROPEANS ARRIVED
HERE BACK IN THE 18TH CENTURY,

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:46.030
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A
SEVERE AND HOSTILE LANDSCAPE.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.560
AS THE EUROPEANS BEGAN
TO EXPLORE THIS LANDSCAPE

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.630
THEY FOUND SOMETHING
THAT BAFFLED THEM.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.730
IN MANY OF THE CAVES
AND ROCK SHELTERS

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:32.160
THEY CAME ACROSS STRANGE
AND MYSTERIOUS IMAGES.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:39.460
HERE IN ARNHEMLAND IN THE
NORTH OF AUSTRALIA ARE SOME

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:47.100
OF THE OLDEST PAINTED IMAGES
FOUND ANYWHERE ON THE PLANET.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:56.660
RECENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN
THAT SOME OF THEM DATE BACK

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.460
OVER 40,000 YEARS.

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:07.960
THESE ARE THE WORLD'S
FIRST ART GALLERIES.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.860
THE EUROPEAN SETTLERS HAD
A SENSE THAT THESE WERE VERY

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.930
OLD IMAGES BUT DISMISSED
THEM AS CHILDISH DOODLES.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.460
THEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
20TH CENTURY AN ENGLISHMAN

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:33.360
ARRIVED IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY
OF OENPELLI IN ARNHEMLAND.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.630
HE WAS A BIOLOGIST
BY TRAINING

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:39.060
AND HIS NAME WAS
BALDWIN SPENCER.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.160
DURING HIS STAY IN OENPELLI,
SPENCER LIVED AMONG

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.760
THE ABORIGINAL PEOPLE.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.330
ALTHOUGH HE'D SPENT TIME WITH
OTHER ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:52.500
HE FOUND SOMETHING HERE
THAT HE'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.900
THE ABORIGINAL
PEOPLE OF OENPELLI

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.630
WERE OBSESSED
BY PAINTING.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.530
WHEREVER HE WENT HE
FOUND ARTISTS AT WORK,

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.900
EITHER PAINTING ON BITS
OF STRINGY BARK FROM THE

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:09.030
EUCALYPTUS TREE OR
ON THE CAVE WALLS.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.060
IT'S THE SAME
EVEN TODAY.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:23.160
SPENCER BECAME MORE AND MORE
INTRIGUED BY THESE PAINTINGS.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:28.030
IT WAS THIS CURIOSITY THAT
LED TO HIS BREAKTHROUGH.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.360
HE NOTICED HOW ABORIGINAL
ARTISTS WERE PAINTING

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.230
THE SAME IMAGES
OVER AND OVER AGAIN:

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.900
THE IMAGE OF THE
BARRAMUNDI FISH...

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.230
THE IMAGE OF THE
EARTH MOTHER, YINGARNA...

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.960
OR THE LIGHTNING MAN.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.660
THIS, FOR INSTANCE, IS A
GROUP OF BARRAMUNDI FISH

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:09.130
PAINTED BY A MODERN
ABORIGINAL ARTIST.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.300
AND THIS IS THE
SAME SUBJECT

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:15.560
PAINTED THOUSANDS
OF YEARS BEFORE.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.600
THIS IS YINGARNA THE EARTH
MOTHER AS PAINTED TODAY...

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.600
AND THIS IS YINGARNA
FROM THE ANCIENT PAST.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:31.260
THE SAME IS TRUE OF MANY OF THE
IMPORTANT ABORIGINAL IMAGES.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.230
WHAT THIS MEANT WAS
THAT HERE IN ARNHEMLAND,

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.600
UNIQUELY IN THE WORLD, THERE
IS A CONTINUOUS ARTISTIC LINK

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:45.960
FROM THE ANCIENT PAST
TO THE PRESENT DAY.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:51.500
SPENCER REALIZED HE NOW
HAD A RARE OPPORTUNITY.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.260
IF HE COULD ONLY DISCOVER THE
INSPIRATION BEHIND 20TH CENTURY

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.830
ABORIGINAL ART HE COULD THEN
UNLOCK THE SECRETS OF THE

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:04.430
ANCIENT PAINTING IN THE CAVES
AND THE ROCK SHELTERS.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.860
AND WHEN HE TALKED
TO ABORIGINAL PEOPLE

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.530
ABOUT THEIR ART
THEY TOLD HIM

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:14.830
THAT THEIR PAINTINGS
WERE TELLING STORIES.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.300
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THESE

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.630
SINGLE IMAGES CAN
TELL A WHOLE STORY.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:36.460
SO HOW DO THEY WORK?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.530
THIS IS
THOMPSON YULIDJIRRI,

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:46.060
ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
ABORIGINAL ARTISTS IN THE AREA.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:51.300
AS HE PAINTED AN IMAGE, THOMPSON
BEGAN TO TELL A STORY ABOUT

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:58.160
THE MOST IMPORTANT ANCESTRAL
SPIRIT: THE RAINBOW SERPENT.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:06.960
IN THE BEGINNING A LITTLE ORPHAN
BOY WAS PLAYING WITH HIS BROTHER

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.500
WHEN HE BECAME HUNGRY.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:14.460
BUT WHEN HE FOUND OUT
HIS FAVORITE FOOD, YAMS,

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.760
HAD BEEN EATEN BY HIS
FAMILY HE BEGAN TO CRY.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.730
HIS KINDLY BROTHER CALLED
UP AN ANCESTRAL SPIRIT,

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:28.030
THE RAINBOW SERPENT,
AND ASKED FOR HIS HELP

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:33.400
AND THE FAMILY WERE PUNISHED
FOR BEING SO GREEDY".

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.700
ABORIGINAL ARTISTS DON'T
PAINT A SEQUENCE OF IMAGES

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.230
TO TELL THEIR STORIES,
INSTEAD THEY USE SINGLE

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.730
STYLIZED IMAGES TO TRIGGER
IN THE MIND OF THE ONLOOKER

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.330
STORIES THEY
WOULD ALREADY KNOW.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.600
IT'S THESE PAINTED STORIES
TOLD IN A SINGLE IMAGE

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.030
THAT HAVE ENDURED
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.530
SO WHAT WAS IT THAT GAVE
THEM THE POWER TO CAPTIVATE

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.300
THE MINDS OF ABORIGINAL
PEOPLE AND TO BE PASSED ON

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.600
THROUGH COUNTLESS
GENERATIONS?

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.030
THIS WOULDN'T BE REVEALED
TO A WORLDWIDE AUDIENCE

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.660
UNTIL THE 1960'S.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.430
IT WAS THEN THAT A YOUNG
BRITISH TELEVISION PRESENTER

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:31.800
CAME WITH HIS CREW
TO THIS REMOTE REGION.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:37.760
HIS NAME: DAVID
ATTENBOROUGH.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.930
I HAVE VERY VIVID MEMORIES OF
SQUEEZING THROUGH CRACKS AND

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.500
COMING UP AND LOOKING UP
AND SEEING THE SURFACE

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.100
OF THE CRACK I'M IN, ONLY A
FEW INCHES FROM MY HEAD,

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.130
AND SUDDENLY BEING
AWARE THERE WERE HUGE

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:59.160
BARRAMUNDI FISH ON THE
CEILING. AND KANGAROOS.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.630
AND THEN SPIRIT FIGURES.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:05.160
STRANGE LITTLE STICK-LIKE
FIGURES THAT WERE HUNTING.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.000
IT WAS UNFORGETTABLE.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.460
>>DAVID ATTENBOROUGH WAS
FASCINATED BY THE STORIES

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.460
TOLD THROUGH
THESE SINGLE IMAGES.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:23.030
LIKE SPENCER, HE TOO
REALIZED THE KEY TO THE PAST

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:29.230
LAY IN UNDERSTANDING
THE PRESENT.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:33.960
THIS IS A SACRED PLACE - A
CAVE SACRED TO THE ABORIGINES

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:36.830
OF THIS PART OF
NORTHERN AUSTRALIA.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.600
THE ABORIGINES
STILL PAINT.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.430
FROM THEM, THEREFORE, WE MAY
BE ABLE TO GET SOME INSIGHT

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.930
INTO THE VERY
ORIGINS OF ART.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:50.960
>>SO DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
BEGAN TO SPEND TIME

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.030
WITH MODERN ABORIGINAL
PAINTERS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.130
WHY THEIR STORIES
HAD LASTED SO LONG.

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:04.130
HE MET AN ABORIGINAL
PAINTER CALLED MUGANI.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.700
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.900
I USED TO SIT WITH HIM AND HE
HAD A BRUSH THAT WAS MADE

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:16.700
BY CHEWING ON THE
END OF A LITTLE STICK

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.430
AND HE'D PUT THESE MARKS
ON THEM AND I'D WATCH THEM.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:27.130
ANYWAY, SO WE GOT TO KNOW
ONE ANOTHER AND SO I WAS

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:32.400
ABLE TO ASK HIM, NOT DIRECTLY,
"WHY ARE YOU PAINTING?"

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:38.130
YOU'D SAY "WHAT OF THIS
FELLOW? WHAT OF THAT?"

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.730
TELL ME ABOUT THIS
PLACE HERE. WHAT'S THAT?

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:43.730
A DOG.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.960
AND THEN ON ONE PAINTING
THERE WAS THIS LONG,

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:51.000
LONG RECTANGULAR SHAPE
AND I SAID "WHAT'S THAT?"

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.500
AND MUGANI LEANED FORWARD AND
SAID RATHER HOARSELY "SECRET".

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:06.000
WHY DO YOU
TALK SO SOFT?

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.860
IF WE TALK HARD
WHO MIGHT HEAR?

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.830
SO I SAID, WELL, COULD
YOU TELL ME WHAT IT WAS?

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:19.260
AND HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT A
BIT AND THEN HE SAID "OKAY.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.100
TOMORROW TIME, YOU
COME TOMORROW TIME".

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:43.560
WE WALKED FOR I SUPPOSE ABOUT 20
MINUTES AND THERE WAS ANOTHER

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:48.200
ENCAMPMENT AND INSIDE THIS
ENCAMPMENT COVERED IN LEAVES,

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.530
VERY SECRET, THERE WAS
THIS HUGE PIPE, DIDGERIDOO,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.700
I MEAN FOUR OR
FIVE FEET LONG.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:03.530
AND THIS WAS WHAT WAS
REPRESENTED IN THE PAINTING.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:07.560
AND THEN WE ENTERED THE
BUSH WHERE A BIG CEREMONY

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.300
WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE
IN WHICH THE TRUMPET WITH

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:16.430
THE DESIGNS THAT IT CARRIED
WAS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:20.530
>>THE STORIES PAINTED BY
ABORIGINAL ARTISTS HAD GAINED

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:26.430
THEIR POWER BECAUSE THEY'D
BEEN COMBINED WITH MUSIC.

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.560
THEY WERE DESIGNED TO
STIMULATE TWO SENSES:

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.960
THE EYES AND THE EARS.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:38.760
AND IT WAS THIS THAT HAD
MADE THEM SO ENDURING.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.000
THE ABORIGINAL
COMMUNITY OF OENPELLI

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.900
STILL PERFORMS STORYTELLING
CEREMONIES TODAY.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.060
SOON WE WOULD WITNESS
WHAT DAVID ATTENBOROUGH SAW

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.960
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.730
PEOPLE SLOWLY ASSEMBLED
IN THE MORNING.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.960
ONE OF THEM STARTING
SINGING WITH CLICK STICKS,

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.160
MORE MEN CAME, AND
THEN THEY STARTED PAINTING

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.530
THEMSELVES WITH TOTEMIC
DESIGNS ON THEIR CHESTS.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.460
IT WAS A SENSE OF PRIVILEGE AND
OF HOLDING THE BREATH, REALLY,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.100
BECAUSE YOU WERE IN THE
PRESENCE OF SOMETHING

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.560
VERY POWERFUL
AND MEANINGFUL.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:42.930
IT'S A HIGHLY EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED MOMENT.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.930
>>THE PREPARATIONS
WERE COMPLETE.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:16.100
THE DANCERS WAITED
FOR NIGHT TO FALL.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.200
THE DANCERS ASSEMBLED
BENEATH A ROCK CANOPY

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.630
COVERED IN ANCIENT
PAINTED STORIES.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:49.160
THE STORIES THEN
BEGAN TO COME ALIVE.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:59.200
(CHANTING)

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:11.900
(CHANTING)

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.900
>>IN THE ANCIENT PAST, LONG
BEFORE THE CLASSICAL

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:17.860
CIVILIZATIONS OF THE WEST
HAD MADE THEIR STORYTELLING

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.000
DISCOVERIES, ABORIGINAL ARTISTS
HAD FOUND A WAY TO CAPTIVATE

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.400
THEIR AUDIENCE AND TRANSPORT
THEM TO IMAGINARY WORLDS.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:33.100
TO TRY AND IDENTIFY THE TRUTH
OF WHICH THOSE PAINTINGS WERE

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.200
A PART, YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE
THAT THEY ARE ONLY A PART.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.260
THEY DON'T EXIST
BY THEMSELVES.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:47.530
THEY'RE ACCOMPANIED BY MUSIC,
BY SINGING, BY DIDGERIDOO,

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.900
BY CLICK STICKS, AND
THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:59.500
NARRATIVES IN SONGS OF
IMMENSELY COMPLEX STORIES.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.560
SO THE MUSIC IS AN INTEGRAL
ELEMENT FROM ALL KINDS OF

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:09.030
POINTS OF VIEW AND TO
ABSTRACT THAT FROM A PIECE

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:14.530
OF PAINTING IS TO...
IMPOVERISH THE PAINTING.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.860
>>THIS, THEN, IS THE
KEY TO THE SECRET

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.400
OF ABORIGINAL
STORYTELLING.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.560
IT'S THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT
HAD GIVEN THEIR STORIES

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:43.130
THE POWER TO SURVIVE
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:47.300
IMAGES PULSING
WITH SOUND.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:51.530
BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD
WOULDN'T COME TO EXPLOIT

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:55.660
THIS TECHNIQUE UNTIL
MUCH, MUCH LATER...

00:44:55.660 --> 00:45:01.030
LONG AFTER THE CLASSICAL
CIVILIZATIONS HAD BEEN AND GONE.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:08.000
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE GREAT
RELIGIONS BEGAN TO REALIZE

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.030
THE FULL POTENTIAL
OF THE SOUNDTRACK

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:14.400
THAT ITS USE BEGAN TO
SPREAD ACROSS THE WORLD.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.260
WHEN IT DID, THE
RESULT WAS EXPLOSIVE.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:25.230
♪ HALLELUJAH, HALLELUJAH!

♪ HALLELUJAH! ♪

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.230
NOW RELIGIOUS STORYTELLERS
COULD USE THE CAPTIVATING

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.230
POWER OF PICTURES
COMBINED WITH MUSIC

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:37.300
TO REINFORCE THEIR
SPIRITUAL MESSAGE.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.260

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:56.830
THEN IN 1894 A NEW VISUAL
STORYTELLING MEDIUM

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:02.160
WAS INVENTED:
MOVING PICTURES.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.200
THIS IS THE FIRST
FEATURE FILM IN HISTORY.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.460
IT TOO COMES FROM AUSTRALIA
AND TELLS THE STORY

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.030
OF THE OUTLAW
NED KELLY.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:16.130
HERE IS A HERO, A PLOT, AND
CHARACTERS WITH EMOTIONS.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:20.660
BUT IT LACKS THAT
CRUCIAL INGREDIENT.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:25.160
AS SOON AS FILMMAKERS
DISCOVERED HOW TO PUT

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:32.730
SOUND INTO THEIR FILMS
CINEMA REALLY TOOK OFF.

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:38.200
FINALLY DIRECTORS COULD
UNLOCK THE FULL POTENTIAL

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:43.730
OF MOVING PICTURES.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:46.660
THEY'D FOUND A WAY TO
MOVE AN AUDIENCE SO MUCH

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.200
THEY FELT AS THOUGH
THEY'D BEEN TRANSPORTED

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.460
TO ANOTHER WORLD.

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:56.860
ONE CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE
THE POWER OF SOUND EFFECTS

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.360
AND MUSIC IN MODERN-DAY
FILMMAKING AND STORYTELLING.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.260
SO THAT WHEN YOU COME TO
SOMETHING LIKE LORENZO'S OIL

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:07.260
WHERE WE HAVE A SCENE WHERE
THE PARENTS HAVING LEARNED OF

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.160
THEIR TERRIBLE DIAGNOSIS
AND PROGNOSIS OF THEIR SON

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:15.730
HAVE TO MAKE THE LONG WALK
OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:23.100
WE ENHANCED THEIR DEMEANOR,
THEIR MOOD, THEIR ANGUISH

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.860
BY THE EXAGGERATED
SOUND OF THEIR FOOTSTEPS...

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:32.800
BY THE LAUGHTER
OF A LITTLE GIRL...

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:38.860
AND WITH THE MUSIC.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:41.830
THEY'RE HIDING THEIR
EMOTIONS BECAUSE THEY

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.400
DON'T WANT THEIR SON TO
KNOW HOW THEY'RE FEELING

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:50.460
AND YET THE MUSIC IS
TELLING US HOW THEY FEEL.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:56.560
WHEN WE GET HOME
CAN YOU READ A STORY?

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:01.800
OF COURSE, MY DARLING.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.260
LET'S GO HOME.

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.030
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY,
WHEN YOU'VE WATCHED A REALLY

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:22.660
GOOD FILM, RATHER THAN LEAVE THE
CINEMA YOU STAY IN YOUR SEAT

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.300
AND LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
PLAYING OVER THE END CREDITS?

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:31.430
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER WORLD;

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.560
AND ONCE THERE, YOU
CAN'T BEAR TO LEAVE.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.860
SO POWERFUL HAS
THAT EXPERIENCE BEEN,

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.800
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
THE MAGIC TO END.
