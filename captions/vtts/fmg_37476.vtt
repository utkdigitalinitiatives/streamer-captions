00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
{00:00:40}{00:00:43}Narrator: JUNE. AND SPRING
 IN CANADA IS...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
FULL BLOWN.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
FOR BOYS, IT MEANS LIFE IS
 ONE BIG PLAYING FIELD.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
A TIME WHEN,
 QUITE LITERALLY,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
THEY'RE FLYING HIGH.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
HUT.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
ASK A BOY THE BEST PART?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
HE CAN COUNT THE DAYS
 TILL FREEDOM.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
JUNE. THE LAST MONTH
 OF SCHOOL.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Children: NO MORE RULERS,
 NO MORE BOOKS,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
NO MORE TEACHERS'
 DIRTY LOOKS.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
AS THIS SCHOOL YEAR
WINDS DOWN,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
THE OBJECT OF
THE TEACHER'S DIRTY LOOK

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
IS NOT LIKELY THE GIRL
SITTING IN THE THIRD ROW

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
BUT THE BOY WHO'S
SITTING BESIDE HER.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'M DAVID GRAY
IN CALGARY.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
BOYS AND SCHOOLS
JUST DON'T ADD UP

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
FAR TOO OFTEN THESE DAYS.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
THEY DON'T READ
AS WELL AS GIRLS,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
THEY DON'T WRITE AS WELL

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
AND THEY'RE BEING
BEATEN OUT

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
FOR SPOTS IN OUR
UNIVERSITIES BY GIRLS.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
THERE'S A PROBLEM
THESE DAYS WITH BOYS.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
WE'RE NOT SAYING
THEY'RE BAD,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
WE'RE NOT EVEN BLAMING BOYS.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
BUT SOME THINGS
CAN'T GO UNNOTICED.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
A STUDY RELEASED
IN 43 COUNTRIES

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
FOUND BOYS LAGGING
BEHIND GIRLS EVERYWHERE,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
INCLUDING HERE IN CANADA.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
THE GREATEST GAP--
READING AND WRITING.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I THINK GUYS CAN BE
JUST AS SMART AS GIRLS

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
IF GUYS JUST BUCKLED DOWN
AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
LIKE, WHAT'S MAKING
THE GIRLS DO SO MUCH BETTER?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
THEY DOING LOTS OF HOMEWORK,
THEY GETTING EXTRA WORK.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
THAT THE GUYS AREN'T DOING?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
WITH BOYS?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
IT ALL STARTED OUT SO WELL.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
LOTS OF INTERESTING
THINGS HAPPEN HERE.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
NAME SIX KINDS
 OF PLANTS.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I THINK WHAT WE HAVE
IN OUR HANDS HERE

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
IS A CLASSIC CASE OF
WHAT LAYMEN REFER TO AS

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
FEAR OF FAILURE.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AS A RESULT,
BART IS AN UNDERACHIEVER

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
AND YET HE SEEMS TO BE...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
HOW SHOULD I PUT THIS?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
PROUD OF IT.
HMM.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
ONE OF HIS PROBLEMS MAY BE
HIS SHORT ATTENTION SPAN

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
WHICH CAN LEAD TO...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
LOOK AT THESE RESULTS.
55, 42, 26.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
A 12 ON STATE CAPITALS?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
OKAY, OKAY.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
WHY ARE WE DANCING
AROUND THE OBVIOUS?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I KNOW IT, YOU KNOW IT.
I AM DUMB, OKAY.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
DUMB AS A POST.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
THINK I'M HAPPY
ABOUT IT?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
THERE, THERE, BART.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Kathleen: THIS IS
LESTER B. PEARSON
HIGH SCHOOL IN CALGARY.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
HELLO, I'M KATHLEEN PETTY

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
AND THIS IS A
C.B.C. NEWS WORLD SPECIAL--

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
THE PROBLEM WITH BOYS.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
THERE ARE 725 BOYS
THAT GO TO THIS SCHOOL

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
AND SOME OF THEM ARE
EXCELLING ACADEMICALLY.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
OTHERS? WELL, THEY'RE NOT
MAKING THE GRADE

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
AND THIS IS TRUE OF
HIGH SCHOOLS
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
EDUCATORS ARE
NOTICING A TREND.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
IT IS CALLED
UNDERACHIEVEMENT.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
AND WE HAVE BROUGHT TOGETHER
A PANEL OF PEOPLE

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
WHO SPEND A CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT OF TIME

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
EXAMINING WHY THIS TREND
IS HAPPENING.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
WILLIAM POLLACK
IS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
AND PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
ALSO THE AUTHOR OF
 REAL BOYS.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
HEATHER BLAIR'S
AN EDUCATION PROFESSOR

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
JEAN-CLAUDE ST-AMANT
HAS RESEARCHED

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
THE EDUCATION GENDER GAP
FOR YEARS.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
HE JOINS US FROM
LAVAL UNIVERSITY,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
ANDREW NIKIFORUK
IS A FATHER OF THREE BOYS

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
AND A COMMENTATOR
ON EDUCATION ISSUES.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US,
APPRECIATE IT.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
LET'S START BY
DEFINING THE PROBLEM

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
AND JEAN-CLAUDE, I'D LIKE TO
START WITH YOU ON THIS.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
WHAT I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
IS WHETHER BOYS
ARE DOING WORSE

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
COMPARED TO BOYS
OF PREVIOUS GENERATIONS

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
OR ARE BOYS DOING WORSE

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
COMPARED TO GIRLS
OF THIS GENERATION?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I THINK THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
IF YOU COMPARE
BOYS WITH BOYS,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
YOU'LL SEE THAT FROM
LET'S SAY THE 80's
UP TO NOW,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
THE BOYS ARE FARING
A LOT BETTER

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
IN SCHOOL
THAN THEY WERE.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
THIS IS TRUE
IN CANADA,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
THIS IS TRUE
IN MOST

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
INDUSTRIALIZED
COUNTRIES.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
UNDERACHIEVEMENT

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
BECAUSE IN
THE SAME SITUATION,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
GIRLS ARE FARING BETTER
ON TWO WAYS.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
IN READING AND WRITING,
FOR ONE,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
THAT'S ON SUBJECT MATTERS,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
AND THE OTHER ONE WOULD BE
DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
BOYS, EVEN WITH
THE SAME GRADES,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
A LOT EASIER
THAN GIRLS DO.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
ALL RIGHT, SO,
WILLIAM POLLACK,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
IF BOYS ACTUALLY
AREN'T DOING WORSE

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
BUT THEY'RE DOING WORSE
COMPARED TO GIRLS

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
WHO, PRESUMABLY, ARE ACHIEVING
MORE THAN THEY ONCE DID,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
WHY ARE WE CONCERNED?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
WE GET A CHANCE TO DISAGREE

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
AT THE OUTSET,
A LITTLE BIT.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
CERTAINLY IN THE DATA
WE SEE IN THE STATES,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
AND THAT WE SEE
IN OTHER PLACES,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
BOYS ARE DOING A LITTLE
WORSE THAN THEY DID

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
TEN YEARS AGO
AND TWELVE YEARS AGO.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
NOT EXCEEDINGLY WORSE,
BUT A LITTLE WORSE

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
AND CERTAINLY IN READING
AND IN WRITING.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
AND THEY ARE DOING WORSE
COMPARED TO GIRLS.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
PART OF THAT IS
GIRLS ACHIEVEMENT.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
BUT PART OF IT IS
BOYS BEING TURNED OFF

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
BECAUSE OFTEN THE CURRICULUM,
THE CLASSROOM

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
DON'T MEET THEIR PARTICULAR
EDUCATIONAL NEEDS

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OR THEIR BEHAVIORAL TEMPO.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
OKAY, AND HEATHER,
DO YOU AGREE

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
WITH THAT ANALYSIS OF IT?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
DO YOU AGREE THAT BOYS ARE
FALLING BEHIND OTHER BOYS?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
WELL, I THINK THAT BOYS ARE
PERHAPS NOT DOING

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THE KINDS OF THINGS
IN SCHOOLS

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THAT WE WOULD, AS EDUCATORS,
LIKE TO SEE THEM DOING.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
THEY'RE DOING A WHOLE
RANGE OF OTHER THINGS

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
AND BASED THEN ON--

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
WE'RE TESTING THEM
ON CERTAIN MEASURES

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
AND PERHAPS THOSE MEASURES
AREN'T ACTUALLY MEASURING

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
WHAT BOYS ARE DOING.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
PERHAPS WE'RE MEASURING
WHAT THEY AREN'T DOING.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Kathleen: LIKE WHAT?
BUT WE'RE NOT GETTING OUT
WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I WOULD SAY SOME OF THEIR
OTHER KINDS OF LITERACIES.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
LITERACY--
THE WHOLE DEFINITION

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
OF LITERACY
HAS CHANGED.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
LITERACY, TODAY,
IS NOT WHAT IT WAS

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
TEN YEARS AGO
OR TWENTY YEARS AGO.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
IT'S NOT JUST
THE SAME KIND OF

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
READING AND WRITING
AS IT USED TO BE.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
THERE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS
THAT COMPOSE LITERACY.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
THE NEW LITERACIES,
INCLUDING DIGITAL LITERACY

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
SO I WOULD SAY, WHERE ARE
THE BOYS ON ALL OF THAT?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
PERHAPS OUR TESTS
DON'T MEASURE THAT.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
OKAY. ANDREW,
WHERE ARE YOUR BOYS?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY
NOTICED A PROBLEM.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
THERE'S A LOT OF SCHOOL
CHOICE IN THIS PROVINCE

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
AND YOU'VE TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF THAT.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
WELL, I HAVE MY BOYS IN THREE
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, ACTUALLY,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
TO MEET THEIR NEEDS.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
AND I THINK THEIR NEEDS
ARE BEING MET SUCCESSFULLY

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
IN THOSE THREE
DIFFERENT SCHOOLS.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
ONE OF THEM IS
A SINGLE GENDER SCHOOL,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
IT'S AN ALL BOYS SCHOOL.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
BUT I THINK THAT
I CERTAINLY--

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
AS A FORMER TEACHER,
I MEAN, I--

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
THERE IS A PROBLEM
OUT THERE.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
AND I THINK WHAT THE BOYS
ARE TELLING US

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
IS QUITE SIMPLY THIS.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
THAT IF WE GIVE THEM
UNPREPARED TEACHERS

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
WHO AREN'T TRAINED
VERY WELL

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
AND THEN WE ADD
ON TOP OF THAT

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
TEXTBOOKS THAT ARE
POORLY DESIGNED,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
AND THEN HAVE WAY TOO MUCH
LANGUAGE IN THEM,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
PARTICULARLY IN OUR
MATH PROGRAMS,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
UM, AND THEN WE GIVE THEM
LANGUAGE PROGRAMS THAT,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
YOU KNOW, FOCUS ON FICTION

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
AND FOCUS ON WRITING
DIARIES AND JOURNALS,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
WHICH WILL APPEAL
TO THE GIRLS

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
BUT NOT TO THE BOYS,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
IT'S NO WONDER THAT WE SEE
A LOT OF ACTING OUT,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
A LOT OF PROBLEMS
IN OUR SCHOOLS.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
BUT HAS EDUCATION
REALLY CHANGED THAT MUCH?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
THERE WERE LOTS
OF WOMEN TEACHING

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
WHEN I WAS THERE,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
AND WE DID MANY OF THE THINGS
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
AND YET THIS IS A PROBLEM
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
HAS IT REALLY
CHANGED THAT MUCH?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
OH, IT'S CHANGING
AND YOU KNOW,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I THINK WE HEARD
WONDERFULLY

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
HOW IT CAN
CHANGE POSITIVELY

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
TO HAVE NEW KINDS
OF LITERACY

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
BUT IN MANY WAYS,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
THE CURRICULUM IS
WHAT WE CALL

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
BEING PUSHED DOWN.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
WHAT YOU AND I LEARNED
IN KINDERGARTEN

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
WERE SOCIAL SKILLS.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
BOYS AND GIRLS
ARE NOW BEING ASKED

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
TO READ AND WRITE
AT A LEVEL

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
THAT WE WOULD DO
IN SECOND AND THIRD GRADE.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
SO IF THE TYPICAL BOY
ISN'T READING YET

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
IN KINDERGARTEN,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
WE SAY THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
HE'S GOT
POOR LITERACY.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
WE'RE MAKING
DEMANDS OF THEM

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
AND OF GIRLS, TOO,
MUCH EARLIER.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
THE GIRLS CAN
JUST GET BY.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
IT'S NOT GREAT
FOR THEM, EITHER.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
BUT THE BOYS START
TO FAIL VERY EARLY

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
AND THEN THEIR
SELF ESTEEM PLUMMETS

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
AND THEN THEY
START TO GIVE UP

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
ALMOST BY THE THIRD
OR FOURTH GRADE.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
OKAY, SO DO GIRLS
HAVE NATURALLY

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
BETTER SELF ESTEEM?
IS IT INNATE IN A WAY

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
THAT IT ISN'T
WITH BOYS, JEAN-CLAUDE?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
NO. FOR ONE THING,
IT'S NOT NATURAL.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
THESE THINGS ARE TAUGHT,
THESE THINGS ARE LEARNED.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
IT HAS NOT VERY MUCH
TO DO WITH BIOLOGY

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
OR BIOLOGY DOESN'T EXPLAIN
THE GENDER GAP SITUATION.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
UH...

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
THE, UH...WAY
OF RAISING BOYS

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
TEND TO LEAD THEM AWAY
FROM SCHOOLS,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
AND FROM
SCHOOL SUBJECTS

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
OR FROM WHAT IS TAUGHT
IN SCHOOL.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
THEY HAVE LOTS OF INTERESTS

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
BUT THEIR INTEREST
DOESN'T MATCH VERY MUCH

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
WITH WHAT IS TAUGHT
IN SCHOOL--

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Kathleen:
BUT DID IT USED TO?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
DID IT EVER MATCH
WHAT THEIR INTERESTS WERE?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
DID-- DID--
BUT IF YOU--

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I THINK MORE ATTENTION
WAS ACTUALLY PAID

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
TO BOYS' INTERESTS
IN SCHOOLS

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
BACK WHEN SCHOOLS
WERE STILL--

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE ONE ROOM SCHOOLHOUSE,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
WHERE BOYS WOULD
BE READING--

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
THEY WOULD BE READING
BIOGRAPHIES

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OF GREAT MEN AND HEROES,
THEY'D BE READING

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
LOTS OF SCIENCE
AND SCIENCE FICTION.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
AND TODAY, THERE'S
THE EXPECTATION THAT,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
NO, YOU GOTTA READ
THE FICTION HERE,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
AND YOU GOTTA PUT
AN ENTRY IN YOUR DIARY

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
AND THAT'S JUST NOT
GONNA APPEAL TO A GUY.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
THAT'S FEMINIZATION,
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Andrew:
THAT'S FEMINIZATION,
IN A WAY, YEAH.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
BUT--BUT-- THAT'S AN
OVER SIMPLIFICATION OF,
I THINK, WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I THINK WHAT'S GOING ON
IS JUST SOME

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
REALLY BAD DESIGN
AND BAD PROGRAMMING

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
BY PEOPLE WHO RUN
OUR SCHOOLS.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Heather: I THINK
THAT WE DO NEED TO
BE CAREFUL, THOUGH,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
ABOUT IT'S JUST
MORE BOY BOOKS
OR MORE NON FICTION

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
IS GOING TO SOLVE
SOME PROBLEM.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I THINK IT'S WAY
BIGGER THAN THAT

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
AND MORE COMPLEX
THAN THAT

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
AND I WOULD BE AFRAID
IF WE STARTED TO BUY--

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
JUST SIMPLE-- YOU KNOW,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
A FEW MORE BOOKS
WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
THE RIGHT KINDS OF BOOKS
OR MAYBE NOT A DIARY

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
BUT SOME OTHER KIND OF
WRITING EXERCISE.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK
MORE COMPREHENSIVELY

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
AT WHAT LITERACY IS.
Kathleen: MM-HMM.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
AND I THINK THERE IS
SOMETHING WE CALL
THE BOY CODE.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
BOYS ARE TAUGHT,
BEFORE THEY EVER
GET TO SCHOOL,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
TO SHUT UP, STAND ON
THEIR OWN TWO FEET,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
AND NOT COMPLAIN.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
SO PART OF WHAT'S GOING ON

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
IS THAT WHEN THEY COME
INTO A CURRICULUM

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THAT MAY NOT BE FLEXIBLE
OR MAY NOT FIT FOR THEM,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
THEY DON'T SAY, "PLEASE
HELP ME OUT, TEACHER."

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
OR "LET'S HAVE
A HEART TO HEART

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
INTERPERSONAL
DISCUSSION."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
WHAT DO THEY DO?
THEY ACT OUT.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THEY BECOME
DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
AND THEN THE TEACHERS HAVE
NEGATIVE FEELINGS TOWARD THEM,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
THEY HAVE NEGATIVE FEELINGS
TOWARD THE TEACHERS,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
THEY HAVE NEGATIVE FEELINGS
TOWARD THEMSELVES.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
IT'S NO ONE'S FAULT.
WE SHOULDN'T DEMONIZE ANYONE

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
AND IT'S NOT
A WIN-LOSE SITUATION.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
BUT I THINK THINGS
ARE SHIFTING IN THE WORLD

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
BUT THE WAY WE SOCIALIZE BOYS
TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
HAS NOT SHIFTED ENOUGH.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
IT'S BETTER TO BE
AN ACHIEVING,
INTELLIGENT GIRL...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
THAN IT IS TO BE
A PRETTY GIRL
THAT HAS NO BRAINS.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
YEAH. AND WHEREAS
WITH BOYS,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
IF THEY SEEM
TOO INTELLIGENT,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
THEY USUALLY GET,
LIKE, TERRORIZED BY
THEIR FRIENDS FOR BEING--

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
NERDS.
NERDS, SPODS, UNCOOL.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
YOU KNOW?
Boy: NO, NO, NO.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
WELL, CLEARLY,
IT'S AN INTERNATIONAL ISSUE,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
BUT IT'S ALSO
A NATIONAL ISSUE

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AND A REAL SORE SPOT
IS QUEBEC.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
36% OF BOYS THERE
DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
MICHELLE, NOW,
WITH THREE BOYS

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
WHO NEARLY JOINED
THEIR RANKS.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
AT 16, DWAYNE SMALL

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
HAS MOST OF HIS LIFE
 AHEAD OF HIM.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
A LIFE FULL OF CHOICES.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
HE COULD STUDY
 TO BECOME WHAT HE WANTS.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
THERE'S ONE THING
 GETTING IN THE WAY, THOUGH.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
SCHOOL.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
MY SIXTH GRADE TEACHER
PRETTY MUCH RUINED EVERYTHING.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Interviewer:
WHY IS THAT?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
UH, JUST ALWAYS
PUTTING ME DOWN,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
SAYING THAT I CAN'T
DO ANYTHING PROPERLY

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
SO I JUST GOT FED UP
WITH GOING TO SCHOOL

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
AND JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO GO BACK.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD
 THOMAS CAMPBELL

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
TWO YEARS AGO,
 HE'D HAD ENOUGH OF SCHOOL.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
READY TO DROP OUT.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO
MANY STUDENTS IN THE CLASS,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I JUST COULDN'T WORK.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
IT WAS TOO MUCH.
TOO MANY PEOPLE.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
AND YOU WEREN'T--

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I WAS AFRAID
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
DARCY LeBLANC THOUGHT ABOUT
 DROPPING OUT, TOO.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Darcy: IT'S THE FACT THAT,
LIKE, WE DON'T FIT IN.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
LIKE MANY BOYS, DARCY WAS
 UNABLE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
TRAPPED IN A RIGID
 SCHOOL SYSTEM

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
BUILT ON QUICK LEARNING.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS,
ACTUALLY,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
IN THAT SCHOOL.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
WE ALL HAD PROBLEMS

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
BECAUSE THEIR CURRICULUM
WAS WAY TOO FAST FOR US.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
THE WAY THEY TEACH,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
THE WAY THEY, LIKE,
RESPECT YOU.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
DOESN'T REALLY WORK
THAT WAY.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
THREE BOYS.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
ALL SHARING SIMILAR PROBLEMS

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
WITH THE WAY THE PRESENT
 SCHOOL SYSTEM IS RUN.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
WE ARE CONFRONTED
WITH A REAL PROBLEM

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
THAT BOYS ARE
DROPPING OUT FROM SCHOOL

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY
THAN GIRLS.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
GERMAIN DULAC
 OF McGILL UNIVERSITY

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
HAS RESEARCHED MALE BEHAVIOR
 FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
IN THAT TIME, HE'S SEEN
 QUEBEC'S DROP OUT RATE

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
RISE STEADILY TO 36%.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
MOST OF THOSE DROP OUTS
 ARE BOYS.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
DULAC DOESN'T FIND
 THE TREND SURPRISING.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT IT.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
HE DROPPED OUT OF
 HIGH SCHOOL HIMSELF.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
BOYS MIGHT BE MORE
PHYSICAL THAN INTELLECTUAL.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
HALF OF THEM HAVE
MAJOR DIFFICULTIES--

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I THINK THIS IS PARTLY
CAUSED BY MALE CULTURE

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
THAT SAYS THAT YOU COULD
GO THROUGH LIFE

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
DOING BY YOUR HAND,
WORKING

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
AND BEING ABLE
TO EARN YOUR LIFE

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
WITHOUT GOING TO SCHOOL.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
TWO OF THE THREE BOYS
 WE SPOKE TO CONFIRMED THAT.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
THEIR CAREER OBJECTIVES?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
GET INTO AUTO MECHANICS.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
AUTO MECHANICS.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
IN QUEBEC, THE DROP OUT RATE
 IS SUCH A PROBLEM,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION
 IS TAKING

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
ALL SORTS OF MEASURES
 TO REVERSE IT.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
( singing )

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
FROM A MUSICAL TOUR

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
THAT SINGS THE PROS
 OF STAYING IN SCHOOL

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
TO MORE CONCRETE
 INITIATIVES,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
SUCH AS FINDING OUT WHY
 BOYS ARE QUITTING SCHOOL.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
ONE OF THE FIRST THING
I WANT TO DO

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
IS FIND WHAT IS OF
INTEREST TO THOSE BOYS.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
PIERRE REID IS QUEBEC'S
 EDUCATION MINISTER.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
IF YOU HAVE
PROBLEMS READING,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
YOU WILL HAVE PROBLEM
LEARNING ABOUT ANYTHING,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
EXCEPT A FEW THINGS.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO
ACT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
ON READING, IN TERMS OF
MAKING READING

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
MORE OF SOMETHING
THAT'S COOL.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
THE CASE FOR BOYS.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
BUT THE BOYS WE SPOKE TO
 WERE COOL TO THAT.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN IDEAS
 ON HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
IF THE TEACHERS
WOULD HAVE HELPED OUT MORE,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
AND GAVE ME MORE TIME,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
'CAUSE THEY PRETTY MUCH WANT
THEIR TIME TO THEMSELVES.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
SMALLER CLASSROOMS.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
AND SOME BETTER TEACHERS.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
DEFINITELY.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
THE TEACHERS,
THE CURRICULUM...

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
IT MAY SEEM EASY TO PUT
 THE BLAME ON SOMEONE ELSE

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
BUT RESEARCHERS SAY UNTIL
 A REAL SOLUTION IS FOUND,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
MANY BOYS WILL BE
 LEFT ON THE OUTSIDE,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
LOOKING IN.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
WELL, THOSE THREE BOYS

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
ARE NOW ATTENDING
A SPECIAL SCHOOL

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
THAT HELPS BOYS
WHO WANT TO DROP OUT

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
AND THEY HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL
DIPLOMA IN THEIR SIGHTS.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
SO, WHAT CAN SCHOOLS
AND TEACHERS

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
DO DIFFERENTLY TO HELP BOYS
BUY IN TO LEARNING?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
WE GET BACK TO
OUR DISCUSSION
TO TALK ABOUT THAT

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
AND ANDREW,
I'D LIKE TO START
WITH YOU ON THIS

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
FACE THAT CHALLENGE

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
IN A VERY UP CLOSE
AND PERSONAL WAY.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
HOW DID YOU DO IT?
Andrew: WELL, I THINK...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
THE REALLY IMPORTANT
THING IS TO GET

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
THE READING AND THE WRITING
DONE PROPERLY.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT
THING TO DO.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
AND WE DON'T TRAIN
TEACHERS WELL ENOUGH,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I MEAN, MOST OF OUR TEACHERS
KNOW ONLY ONE APPROACH.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
THEY SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW
THREE OR FOUR APPROACHES.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
IS IT JUST THE TEACHERS
OR IS IT THE STRUCTURE,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
ALSO, OF MOST SCHOOLS?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
WELL, IT'S
A COMBINATION.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I MEAN-- THE-- IT--

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
YOU KNOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IS THE TEACHER

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
AND IF THE TEACHER DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO TEACH READING,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
AND MOST FACULTIES
OF EDUCATION

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
DO NOT TEACH
THEIR TEACHERS

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
HOW TO TEACH READING,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
PARTICULARLY A DIVERSE
GROUP OF KIDS,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
SO YOU'VE GOT, YOU KNOW,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
CHILDREN WITH ENGLISH
AS A SECOND LANGUAGE,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
YOU'VE GOT ABORIGINAL KIDS,
YOU'VE GOT POOR KIDS,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE MIX,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
AND IF YOU DON'T
HAVE THOSE SKILLS,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF FRUSTRATED GUYS

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
ON YOUR HAND BY GRADE THREE
AND GRADE FOUR.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
SO I'D SAY, NUMBER ONE, THAT
THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
TRAIN OUR TEACHERS,
GIVE THEM THE BEST TOOLS,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
AND PARTICULARLY
IN THE EARLY GRADES.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
OKAY, HEATHER,
ARE TEACHERS
JUST NOT GETTING IT?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
WELL, I HAPPEN TO THINK
THAT WE'RE DOING

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
A REASONABLE JOB
PREPARING TEACHERS

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
BUT I DO THINK WE NEED
TO KNOW MORE ABOUT BOYS.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
AND WE'RE OPERATING ON
SOME OLD UNDERSTANDINGS

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
AND MAYBE WE NEED TO TO--

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
THE KINDS OF RESEARCH
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
AND THE KINDS OF RESEARCH
WE'RE INVOLVED IN,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I THINK WE NEED MORE OF IT.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Kathleen: WHEN YOU SAY
OLD UNDERSTANDINGS,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
IS THAT TO SAY IT'S NOT
THAT BOYS HAVE CHANGED,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
WE'VE JUST NEVER BOTHERED
TO REALLY EXAMINE

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
WHO AND WHAT THEY ARE,
JEAN-CLAUDE?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
BOYS EXISTING AS A GENDER
IS VERY RECENT.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
UH, 10 YEARS AGO,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
ONLY WOMEN WERE THE--

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
THE GENDER QUESTION.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
SO NOW THERE ARE
NEW QUESTIONS RAISED

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
AND A FOCUS MORE ON BOYS

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
AND WE'VE DONE RESEARCH
COMPARING BOYS AS SUCH

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
AND COMPARING BOYS
WITH GIRLS

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
AND FOR INSTANCE,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
BOYS THAT HAVE SUCCESS
IN SCHOOL

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
AND GIRLS THAT HAVE
SUCCESS IN SCHOOL,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
DO THE SAME THINGS.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
THE PERCEIVE THE SCHOOL
THE SAME WAY,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
THEY INVEST THEMSELVES
THE SAME WAY,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
AND THEY'RE VERY,
VERY SIMILAR

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
IN THE WAY THEY DO.
OKAY, WILLIAM?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THAT MAKES SENSE

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
BUT FOR THE BOYS
WHO AREN'T THAT WAY,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
WE HAVE TO HAVE
A MORE BREADTH

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
OF WHAT THE SCHOOL
CAN BE LIKE.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
BOYS, NOT NECESSARILY
BECAUSE OF BIOLOGY,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
ARE MORE ACTION ORIENTED.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
THEY LIKE STORY PLOTS,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
LIKE DOING THINGS
WITH THEIR HANDS.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
THEY DON'T HAVE
TO BE MECHANICS.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
THEY CAN BE
USING COMPUTERS,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
THEY CAN BE
USING VIDEO PIECES,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
USING ALL KINDS
OF NEW TECHNIQUES

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
AND TEACHERS NEED TO
EXPAND THOSE TECHNIQUES

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
SO THE BOYS
REMAIN INTERESTED--

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
BUT DO YOU DIVIDE
THE CLASS THEN?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
DO YOU HAVE A CLASS
WHERE BOYS ARE TAUGHT--

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
NO, NOT BY BOY
AND GIRL.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
--AND TAUGHT DIFFERENTLY?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
NOT BY BOY AND GIRL
BUT BY INTEREST.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
YOU SEE, WHEN YOU INTRODUCE
THAT RANGE OF INTERESTS,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
A WHOLE BUNCH OF GIRLS
WHO NEVER THOUGHT THEY KNEW IT

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
COME OVER TO THAT
INTEREST AS WELL.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
AND YOU EXPAND IT

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
AND IT DOESN'T BECOME
BOY VERSUS GIRL,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
IT BECOMES BOY AND GIRL.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
JEAN-CLAUDE?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
AND WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THAT A WHILE AGO.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
VARIETY DOESN'T
STOP AT TWO.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
WE NEED A VARIETY
OF APPROACHES

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
TO REACH A VARIETY
OF INTELLIGENCES

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY
BOYS AND GIRLS.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
THERE IS A VARIETY
OF WAYS OF LEARNING

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
AND WHEN
THE APPROACHES ARE...

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
MORE, UH...

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
VARIED, THEN YOU'LL
REACH A LOT MORE PEOPLE.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
AND THEN DO YOU PREVENT
THAT NOTION OF A GENDER WAR?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
BECAUSE I KNOW
ALL OF YOU AGREE

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
THAT IS ONE OF THE DANGERS
OF THIS DISCUSSION.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
NOT THAT WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE IT,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
BUT THAT THAT MIGHT BE
WHAT IT LEADS TO. ANDREW?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
I-- I THINK
WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
THAT THE BOYS ARE
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE--
FOR, YOU KNOW-- THE--

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
IT'S NO SURPRISE
THAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
LEARNING HOW
TO READ AND WRITE.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
I-- I, MYSELF,
HAD THOSE PROBLEMS

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
AND I DIDN'T GO AROUND
TELLING PEOPLE,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
"CAN YOU PLEASE
HELP ME LEARN TO READ?"

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
NOW YOU'RE A JOURNALIST--
NO, NO.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS
IN GRADE THREE,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I WENT OUT TO THE YARD
AND I SLUGGED SOMEBODY.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
SO IT TOOK A WHILE TO--

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
FOR THEM TO PUT ALL
THE PIECES TOGETHER.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
BUT-- BUT-- YOU KNOW,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
BUT WHAT WE'VE FORGOTTEN
IS THAT WHAT BOYS NEED IS

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
THEY NEED A LITTLE MORE
DIRECT INSTRUCTION,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
THEY NEED A LITTLE MORE
ACTIVITY IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
THEY NEED SHORTER TIME
PERIODS TO DO THINGS.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
NOT LONG-- THEY DON'T
NEED LONG EXPLANATIONS,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
THEY NEED SHORT ONES.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
AND I CAN SEE HEATHER
ITCHING TO GET IN HERE.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Andrew: WE'VE FORGOTTEN
SOME OF THOSE BASICS.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Heather: WE DO NEED
TO REMEMBER, THOUGH,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
THAT NOT ALL BOYS
ARE THE SAME

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
AND NOT TO
ESSENTIALIZE BOYS.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
THERE ARE BOYS IN MY RESEARCH
PROJECT, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
WHO READ VORACIOUSLY

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
AND HAVE SINCE
THEY STARTED SCHOOL.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
THERE ARE BOYS WHO READ
PRIMARILY NON FICTION.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I MEAN, THEY COME IN
VERY MANY DIFFERENT
KINDS OF CONSTRUCTS.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
William: IN FACT,
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT'S CHANGING.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
ONE WAY TO BE A BOY.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
BUT IF YOU'RE
THE KIND OF WAY

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
THAT DOESN'T FIT IN
TO THE VARIETIES

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
WE PRESENTLY HAVE,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
WE HAVE TO EXPAND
THOSE VARIETIES.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
THE AVERAGE--
THE AVERAGE BOY,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
UP TO THE FIFTH
OR SIXTH GRADE,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
COULD USE SIX
OR SEVEN RECESSES A DAY.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
AND WHAT DOES HE GET?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
BEHAVIORAL TEMPO.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Kathleen:
HEY, I'D TAKE THAT.
WELL, YEAH.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
BUT WHAT DOES HE GET
IF HE SQUIRMS
IN HIS SEAT?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
WE TAKE AWAY
HIS RECESS.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
THEN WE TELL HIM
HE HAS HYPER ACTIVITY

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
AND WE GIVE HIM RITALIN.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
WE DON'T-- YOU KNOW,
YOU HEARD THAT QUESTION.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
WHAT THE BOYS FEEL
AND THINK AND LIKE.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
THEY'RE DIAGNOSED WITH
ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
FAR MORE THAN GIRLS DO.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
William:
FOUR TO ONE IN THE STATES,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
SOME PLACES, TEN TO ONE.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Kathleen: IS THAT
APPROXIMATELY
WHAT IT IS HERE?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Jean-Claude:
APPROXIMATELY.
YEAH, YEAH.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
YEAH, NO, CLEARLY,
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
BUT WE HAVE TO HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
AND THAT'S WHY
OUR STUDY WAS CALLED

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
"LISTENING TO
BOYS' VOICES."

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
A WHOLE RANGE
OF THOSE VOICES,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
WHOLE RANGE OF ETHNICITY,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
BUT SEEING THEM
AS A WIDE GROUP

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
WHO CAN ACTUALLY
TELL US SOMETHING

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
EVEN THOUGH
THEY MIGHT NOT TALK

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
IN THE SAME KIND OF WAY
THAT GIRLS SPEAK TO US.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
HOW MANY BOYS DO YOU KNOW

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
WHO WOULD GIVE UP
SKATEBOARDING

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
OR VIDEO GAMES TO CURL UP
WITH A GOOD BOOK?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
NOT MANY? NO SURPRISE.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
WHAT HAVE YOU BASTARDS
DONE NOW?

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
HEY, THAT WAS KYLE
THAT WENT NUMBER TWO

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
IN THE URINAL.
NO, IT WASN'T,
FAT ASS.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
I SAW YOU DO IT.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
NOW THAT IS SPUNK

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
AND POP CULTURE'S GOT IT.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
YOU, YOU, YOU AND YOU.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
SOUTH PARK SERVES UP
 SAUCY SATIRE

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
AND STARS SOME
 GRADE SCHOOL TOONS

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
WITH TONS OF 'TUDE.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
( screaming )

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I GIVE THIS BOOK A NINE.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
IN THE SIMPSONS,
 THE MAIN MEN

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
ARE INTELLECTUALLY CHALLENGED
 CARTOON BUFFOONS.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
OH!

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
YOU KNOW WHO WE SHOULD GET
TO COACH BOBBY'S TEAM?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
KING OF THEHILL'S
 HANK AND HIS BEER DRINKING BUDS

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
ARE JUST GOOD OL' BOYS.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
( cheering )

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
ONE THING THESE SHOWS
HAVE IN COMMON

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
IS THAT THE MALE CHARACTERS
ARE PORTRAYED

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
AS UNDER ACHIEVING
ANTIHEROS.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
LIKE IT OR NOT, THIS KIND
OF STUFF IS BIG WITH BOYS.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
BRASH T.V. SHOWS,
ACTION PACKED COMPUTER GAMES,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
RISQUE VIDEOS.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
THAT'S WHAT'S COOL
IN GRADE SCHOOL.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
* MONEY MAKE THE WORLD
GO ROUND *

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
* SO LET'S GET MORE

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
* IT'S TIME
TO SHOW THESE PLAYERS *

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
* HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
* YOU GOT PIMP POTENTIAL,
YOU MIGHT COULD BE ONE *

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
50 CENT, EMINEM.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
BLINK 182.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
THESE MAESTROS OF POP
 ARE A HUGE INFLUENCE ON BOYS.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
THEY ARE IDOLS AND ICONS
 FOR KIDS LEARNING ABOUT LIFE.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
* LET'S GO

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
MY NAME'S
GEORGE STROUMBOULOPOLOS--

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
THIS POP COMMENTATOR

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
IS A MUCH MUSIC VJ
 VERY POPULAR WITH TEENS.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
WHAT IS ACTUALLY
THE MESSAGE

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
THAT THESE YOUNG BOYS
ARE GETTING

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
OUT OF POP CULTURE?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
WHAT THEY SEE IS
I CAME FROM NOTHING,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
AND I BECAME SOMETHING.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
* LOVE YOU, SNOOP DOGG

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
* YEAH, I LOVE YOU, TOO

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
* G U IN THE HIZZY

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
I THINK THERE'S
A LOT OF THAT,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
IT'S THE FANTASY
LIFESTYLE.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
UH, YOU KNOW,
ROCK AND ROLL BANDS
AND METAL BANDS

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
DID THE WHOLE SEX, DRUGS,
ROCK AND ROLL THING.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000
IT WAS
AN ASPIRATIONAL LIFESTYLE

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
YOU WANT TO GET TO.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
AND SO I THINK
WHAT HAPPENS IS

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
PEOPLE ARE SEEING
THE IDEA OF ACHIEVEMENT.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
THE ACHIEVEMENT ISN'T
THROUGH EDUCATION.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
HOW IS EDUCATION
PORTRAYED

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
TO YOUNG BOYS
IN POP CULTURE?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
SOMETIMES, I DON'T THINK
IT'S PORTRAYED VERY WELL.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
YOU DON'T SEE
VERY MANY MUSICIANS

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000
RAPPING ABOUT
THEIR SECOND YEAR

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
OF LAW SCHOOL, YOU KNOW.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
OR-- OR WHAT THEY WERE LIKE
WRITING THEIR THESIS.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
YOU DON'T GET
A LOT OF THAT.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
* BABY, THIS IS SIMPLE

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
* YOU CAN'T SEE

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
THE MESSAGE OF MOST
 POP MUSIC?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
WELL, CHECK IT OUT YOURSELF.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
* WHAT YOU HEARD ABOUT ME

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
* BUT YOU CAN'T
GET A DOLLAR OUT OF ME *

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
* NO CADILLAC, NO PERMS,
YOU CAN'T SEE *

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
* I'M A P.I.M.P.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
BUT THERE ARE
 OTHER MESSAGES TOO.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
JACKASS IS ONE OF MTV'S HITS.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
IT'S ALL ABOUT GUYS
 DOING DUMB STUNTS.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
IT'S PART OF A TREND
 THAT THIS FILMMAKER CALLS

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
STUPIDITY CULTURE.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
I THINK THAT, UH,
WE LIVE IN A WORLD NOW

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
WHERE YOU HAVE A MODERN
STUPIDITY CULTURE.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
I WAS STUPID--

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
STUPID.
 STUPID.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
WHICH PUTS A VALUE

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
OR MAKES LIKE
STUPID STUFF COOL.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
THE BEST EXAMPLE
IS JACKASS OR STEVE-O.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
STEVE-O AND JACKASS
PLAYED QUEBEC

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
AND MAYBE OTHER PARTS
OF CANADA.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
THEY OFTEN
HAD ALL AGES SHOWS

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
'CAUSE THEY KNEW THAT
A BIG PART OF THEIR AUDIENCE

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
WAS LESS THAN DRINKING AGE.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
SO I FIND THE DEMOGRAPHIC

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
IS EXACTLY THE KIDS
THAT ARE IN SCHOOL.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
MEANING, YOU KNOW,
ANYWHERE IN BETWEEN,
LIKE 10 AND 18.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
SO IT'S SCHOOL KIDS

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
WHO LOVE JACKASS
AND STEVE-O,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
WHICH IS THE HEIGHT OF

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
ANTI INTELLECTUAL
ACHIEVEMENT.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
AFTER SCHOOL, BOYS ARE
 PLAYING LOTS OF VIDEO GAMES.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
ABOUT 60% OF YOUNG LADS
 IN GRADES THREE TO SIX

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
PLAY EVERY DAY.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Shelley: WHEN BOYS ARE
WATCHING TELEVISION

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
WHEN THEY'RE
WATCHING VIDEOS

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
OR WHATEVER IT IS,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
WHATEVER
POP CULTURE FORMS,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
THEY'RE SEEING
THE STEREOTYPES,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
THEY'RE NOT SEEING
THE NUANCES

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE BOY.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
A LOT OF IMAGES
OF BOYS IN POP CULTURE

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
ARE ONES WHERE THEY'RE
WITH OTHER PEOPLE,
OFTEN BOYS,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
AND THEY'RE DOING
A LOT OF ACTIVE KINDS
OF THINGS WHERE--

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
AND READING DOESN'T
REALLY FIT IN TO THAT.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
WHO ARE THE ROLE MODELS
FOR YOUNG CATS THESE DAYS?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
WELL, IT USED
TO BE ASTRONAUTS.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
YOU KNOW, IT USED
TO BE A FIREMAN

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
AND NOW I THINK
IT IS AMAZING

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000
THAT IF YOU LOOK
AT STEVE-O,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
PEOPLE ARE IN LOVE
WITH THE GUY.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
HE IS A TREMENDOUS
ROLE MODEL TO YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
THEY REALLY LOVE HIM.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
SO IS STUPID CULTURE
AND BY EXTENSION,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
POP CULTURE,
LETTING DOWN
YOUNG BOYS THEN?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
POP CULTURE IS TURNING
YOUNG BOYS INTO MORONS.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
WELL, MORONS
SEEMS A BIT HARSH,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
BUT MORONIC ANTICS,
MORONIC ROLE MODELS?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
PERHAPS.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
SO HOW DO SCHOOLS
COMPETE WITH THAT?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
HOW DO PARENTS HELP SCHOOLS
COMPETE WITH THAT?

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
WE'VE TALKED A LOT
ABOUT WHAT SCHOOLS CAN DO

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
TO HELP BOYS LEARN BETTER.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
WHAT CAN PARENTS DO?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
AND ANDREW,
IT MAKES SENSE TO START

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
WITH OUR FATHER
OF THREE BOYS.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
WELL, THEN, YOU HAVE TO
PROVIDE SOME STANDARDS

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
FOR YOUR BOYS.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
AND YOU HAVE TO SAY,
YOU KNOW,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
"GUYS, THAT IS
MORONIC STUFF"

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA BRING

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
VERY MUCH OF IT
INTO THE HOUSE

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
AND WHAT WE DO BRING
INTO THE HOUSE,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
WE'LL SIT
AND CRITIQUE AND JUDGE

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
AND SO THAT'S NOT
WHERE WE WANT TO GO.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Kathleen:
AND BE A ROLE MODEL?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
WELL, AND BE A ROLE MODEL,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
BUT ALSO TO-- I MEAN,
I TRY FOR MY BOYS

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
TO GIVE THEM
OTHER EXAMPLES THAT--

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
OF-- OF--
OF MEN WHO I FEEL

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
ARE NOBLE
AND DOING GOOD THINGS.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
WHETHER IT'S SOMEONE LIKE
ARAGORN IN LORD OF THE RINGS

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
OR WHETHER IT'S HECTOR
IN THE ILIAD.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
UM, AND WE DISCUSS A LOT
OF GREEK MYTHOLOGY

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
IN OUR HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE
IN A LOT OF THIS MYTHOLOGY,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
YOU FIND FINE EXAMPLES
OF MEN DOING NOBLE THINGS.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
AND I DON'T FEEL I CAN
GIVE MY KIDS ENOUGH OF THAT.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
AND I ALSO--
YOU'RE NOT NOBLE ENOUGH
TO DO THAT,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
THERE'S SO MANY RICH
EXAMPLES TO GIVE THEM.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
TO GIVE THEM.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
AND THEN PUT LIMITS ON ALL

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
THE TECHNOLOGICAL
GARBAGE OUT THERE.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF IT.
Kathleen: OKAY.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
AND SCHOOLS I DON'T
THINK DO A GOOD
ENOUGH JOB, EITHER.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I MEAN, THEY'VE LET
THE POP CULTURE

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
INVADE THE SCHOOL

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
AND LET THAT
SIBLING CULTURE
SORT OF TAKE OVER.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
OKAY, WILLIAM.
William: FIRST OF ALL,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I DON'T THINK
IT'S STUPIDITY.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I THINK IT'S
MASS MASCULINITY.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
THIS IS WHAT MASCULINITY

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
AND BOY AND MALE CULTURE
IS ABOUT

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
AND BOYS ARE BEING
TAUGHT IT ON THE MEDIA.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
IN THE RESEARCH
WE DID ON THE MEDIA,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
BOYS SAID THAT THEY SAW MALES
AS BEING 95% OF THE TIME

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
AGGRESSIVE AND NEGATIVE.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
THEIR OWN PEOPLE
IN SOME WAY.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
WHAT CAN PARENTS DO?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
PARENTS ARE--
OR ADULT CARETAKERS--

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT
PEOPLE IN KIDS' LIVES.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
PEER PRESSURE PALES

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
COMPARED TO
PARENTAL CONNECTION.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
THE LARGEST STUDY
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
ADOLESCENT HEALTH SHOWED

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
THAT IF THERE'S ONE PARENT
IN THE HOUSEHOLD

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
CONNECTED TO THE BOY,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
HE'S TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
TO BE PROTECTED
FROM THAT HARM.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
IF HE'S LOVED,
FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
JEAN-CLAUDE.
YES.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
AND THE DEMOCRATIC
COMMUNICATION

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
WITH CHILDREN, TOO.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
IF YOU ARE--
IF YOU IMPOSE TOO MUCH,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
AND IF YOU LET
THEM GO TOO MUCH,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
IT ALSO HAS
A NEGATIVE IMPACT.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
YOU HAVE TO WORK
BETWEEN THE TWO.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
NEGOTIATE.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Kathleen: WOW.
YES.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
THAT SOUNDS
REALLY HARD.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
AND BEING DEMOCRATIC
IN THE REAL SENSE,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
YOU DO TAKE SOME ADVICE
FROM THEM.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
YOU DO TAKE INFORMATION
FROM THEM

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
AND FROM THAT,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
YOU COME AND ARRIVE
AT CERTAIN RULES

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
AND THEN EXPECT THESE RULES
TO BE RESPECTED.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Kathleen: YEAH.
Heather:
GIVING THEM CHOICE.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
I MEAN, CHOICE IS
REALLY IMPORTANT,
WE CAN'T DOWNPLAY THAT.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
I MEAN, KIDS AND BOYS--
Kathleen: AND THEY CAN
CHOOSE THAT.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
WHAT WE WERE JUST WATCHING,
THEY CAN CHOOSE THAT.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Heather: THERE ARE LOTS
OF THINGS TO CHOOSE FROM.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT ARE BETTER

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
TO CHOOSE FROM
THAN OTHER THINGS.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
SO GIVE THEM MORE
CHOICES TO CHOOSE FROM?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
GIVE THEM CHOICES

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
AND LISTEN TO WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT IT.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
TALK TO THEM ABOUT
THE STUFF THEY'RE DOING.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
THE BOYS IN OUR PROJECT
LOVE FUNNY STUFF.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I MEAN, IF SOMETHING'S FUNNY,
IT HOOKS THEM

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
AND THEY GO
OUT OF THEIR WAY

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
TO MAKE THINGS FUNNY.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
THEY DO, WE CALL,
MORPHING THEIR LITERACY

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
BY BRINGING IN
SOME OF THEIR LITTLE

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
OUT OF SCHOOL
LITERACY PRACTICES

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
TO CREATE THE HUMOR
AROUND SOME OF

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE CLASSROOM,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT
THAT INTERESTED

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
IN SOME OF WHAT GOES ON
IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
SO LISTENING TO KIDS
AND GIVING THEM SOME CHOICES--

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
SO IT'S OKAY IF YOU
BASH YOUR HEAD

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
INTO A BUNCH OF
BOWLING PINS
AND LAUGH AT IT,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
AS LONG AS THERE ARE
OTHER CHOICES BEYOND--

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
William: WELL, THERE
SHOULD BE OTHER CHOICES

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
AND YOU SHOULD BE
TALKING ABOUT IT

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
IN A SHAME FREE WAY
SO THEY'RE ALLOWED
TO NEGOTIATE

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
AND TALK WITH YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
AND YOU CAN DO
ACTION, FUN THINGS

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
THAT AREN'T HURTFUL.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
UM, BUT PARENTS,
TOO OFTEN FEEL

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
THAT WHEN A KID
BECOMES ADOLESCENT,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
ESPECIALLY A BOY,
THEY HAVE TO
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
AND PARENTS SAY TO ME,
"WHAT'S THE WORST THING

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
WE CAN DO WITH
A MALE ADOLESCENT?"

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
I SAY, WHEN HE SAYS,
"LEAVE ME ALONE,"

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
TO ACTUALLY DO IT.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Kathleen: DID YOU LEAVE
YOUR BOYS ALONE?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
YOU'RE NODDING.
NO, I MADE MY BOY--

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
ONE OF THEM IS
GOING THROUGH
ADOLESCENCE NOW.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I MEAN, WE'RE THERE
WITH HIM EVERY DAY.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I MEAN, HE STILL
GIVES US A HUG
BEFORE HE GOES TO BED

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
HEY. GOOD FOR YOU.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
IT'S CONNECTION,
CONNECTION, CONNECTION.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THE DIFFERENCE

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
BETWEEN THE BOYS WHO ENGAGE
IN THOSE THINGS FOR REAL

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
AND THE ONES WHO KNOW
THAT IT'S JUST PLAY--

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Kathleen: AND GIVE THEM NO
CHOICE ABOUT THE CONNECTION.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO IMPOSE
CONNECTION, SOMETIMES.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
NOT IMPOSE,
BUT BE THERE FOR THEM.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
HAIM GINOTT ONCE SAID TO
A PARENT OF AN ADOLESCENT,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
"DON'T JUST DO SOMETHING.
BE THERE."

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Kathleen: OKAY. JEAN-CLAUDE,
YOU'RE NODDING.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
YES, YES,
I COMPLETELY AGREE.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
AND I WOULD SAY
THAT THE--

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
OR IF I MAY ADD
THAT THE POP IMAGES

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
THAT ARE GIVEN TO GIRLS
ARE NOT TOO GOOD EITHER.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
William: POSITIVE.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
NOT TOO POSITIVE, EITHER.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
BUT THERE IS WORK
TO BE DONE THERE

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
AND THERE'S EDUCATION
TO BE DONE THERE, ALSO.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
I'D LOVE TO SEE--
AS PARENTS--

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
I'D LOVE TO SEE
BOYS AND GIRLS

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
AND BOYS' PARENTS
AND GIRLS' PARENTS
UNITE, TOGETHER,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
TO DEAL WITH THIS
POPULAR CULTURE
IN SOME WAY.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
OKAY, THERE'S ALWAYS
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I'M ALL FOR THAT.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
I DON'T SEE THIS
AS AN EXAMPLE

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
OF MASCULINE
BEHAVIOR.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I SEE MORE
AS AN EXAMPLE--

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
THIS IS THE KIND
OF BEHAVIOR YOU GET
WHEN-- WHEN-- WHEN--

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
WHEN THERE ARE NO PARENTS.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
BUT IT APPEALS--
BUT IT APPEALS TO BOYS.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
WOULDN'T YOU THINK THAT
APPEALS TO BOYS, THOUGH,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
MORE THAN GIRLS?
Andrew: WELL, OF COURSE
IT APPEALS TO BOYS,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
BUT-- BUT-- I STILL
FEEL THAT IT'S NOT

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
William:
NOT MASCULINE BEHAVIOR.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS
MASCULINE BEHAVIOR.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
I SAID THIS IS
MASS PRODUCTION
OF MASCULINE BEHAVIOR.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
THIS IS WHAT
THE MEDIA SHOWS US

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
MEN ARE LIKE.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
OR WHAT THE MEDIA
THINKS MEN ARE LIKE.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Kathleen:
YEAH. I THINK THAT'S--

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
BUT I... BUT--
YEAH.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
AS ADULTS DISCUSS
THE PROBLEM,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
BOYS LIVE THE PROBLEM,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
SO THE C.B.C.'s DAVID GRAY

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.000
SAT DOWN WITH
THREE OF THEM
TO GET THEIR TAKE.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
DO YOU GUYS THINK
THERE'S A PROBLEM
WITH GUYS?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
THE WAY GUYS ARE LEARNING?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
IS THERE A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Will: I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A PROBLEM

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
WITH THE WAY GUYS
ARE LEARNING, I JUST...

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
GIRLS ARE DEFINITELY--

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
I'VE NOTICED A LOT OF GIRLS

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
ARE JUST GENERALLY SMARTER
THAN MOST GUYS.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
I DON'T KNOW.
Jeff:
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I THINK-- I KNOW--

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
THERE'S GIRLS THAT WILL SIT
AND TAKE NOTES ALL CLASS

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
AND I COULD STILL
PULL MORE OUT OF IT

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
WHEN I DIDN'T EVEN WRITE
A SINGLE NOTE, YOU KNOW.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
ONE OF IT IS FOLLOWING

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
A STRICT SYSTEM
OF GUIDELINES,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
LIKE THEY'LL BE THERE
TO GET--

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
THEY'RE VERY, YOU KNOW...

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
THEY CAN STAY ON TOP,
FOLLOW--

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
GUYS, MAYBE, ARE MORE UP
AND DOWN, YOU KNOW.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
WHERE THE INTELLECT'S THERE

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
BUT MAYBE SOMETIMES
THE DRIVE IS NOT.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
YOU'RE ALL SMART GUYS,
CLEARLY, YOU KNOW.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
I MEAN, NONE OF YOU...

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
IT'S NOT THAT YOU
CAN'T DO THIS STUFF.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE GIRLS ARE DOING IT.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
FOR THE MOST PART, YOU LOOK
AT THE MARKS OF GIRLS,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
YOU LOOK ACROSS THE BOARD,
THEY'RE DOING FINE, YOU KNOW?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
THEY'RE MOVING AHEAD.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
WHY AREN'T GUYS...

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Jeff:
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
UM...
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
LIKE... IT'S ALMOST
AGAINST, YOU KNOW,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
THE MASCULINE NATURE
OF A GUY

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
TO SIT IN A CLASSROOM FOR
SIX HOURS A DAY, YOU KNOW.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALWAYS
PLAYING HOCKEY,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
OR, YOU KNOW,
SPORTS AND THAT.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
THEY LEARN DIFFERENTLY

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
AND EVEN ONCE THEY GET
TO THE LABOR FORCE...

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I MEAN, THEY TEND TO DO
LABOR INTENSIVE WORK.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
IT'S PART OF THEIR--

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
IT'S PART OF THEIR,
YOU KNOW, THEIR NATURE.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
LIKE, JUST BEING MASCULINE.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH,
YOU KNOW,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
IT'S BETTER TO BE
MORE INVOLVED IN INTELLECT,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
YOU KNOW, ORIENTATED WORK,
IT'S JUST--

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
THAT'S JUST THE WAY
IT TENDS TO GO.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Will: GUYS HAVE A LOT
OF THINGS ON THEIR MIND.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
GUYS WORRY ABOUT CARS,
MAKING MONEY, GIRLS.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
ALL SORTS OF THINGS
LIKE THAT.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I MEAN, I WORRY ABOUT
ALL THAT KIND
OF STUFF, RIGHT?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
BUT I STILL WANNA GET
MY SCHOOLWORK DONE

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
AND HAVE GOOD MARKS.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
BUT...
Jeff:
SOMETIMES INTERFERE.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
MY MARKS ARE NOT BAD
AT ALL, RIGHT?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
BUT WHEN I GO TO SCHOOL,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I DON'T REALLY...

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
I'D SAY I DON'T GIVE 100%
EVERY TIME I GO TO SCHOOL.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
David: STATISTICS SHOW
THEY'RE BEATING YOU GUYS.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
THE GIRLS ARE--

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
MORE OF THEM ARE
GOING TO UNIVERSITY.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT THAT?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
YOU TAKE THAT--
Jeff:
I WORK FOR THE LADIES.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I THINK GUYS COULD BE
JUST AS SMART AS GIRLS,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
IF GUYS JUST BUCKLED DOWN
AS MUCH AS THE GIRLS DID.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
LIKE, WHAT'S MAKING
THE GIRLS DO SO MUCH BETTER?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
THEY DOING LOTS OF HOMEWORK?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
THEY GETTING EXTRA WORK?
WHAT ARE THEY--

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
THAT THE GUYS AREN'T DOING?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
THAT'S THE ANSWER
I'M LOOKING FOR.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
IT'S MOSTLY 'CAUSE THE GIRLS
ARE DRESSING BETTER

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
AND THE GUYS ARE IN CLASS
LOOKING AT THE GIRLS.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
AND YOU CAN'T PAY ATTENTION
WHEN YOU GOT THIS GIRL

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
WEARING LIKE HARDLY
ANY CLOTHES.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
David:
IT'S A CLOTHING--

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
IT'S A FASHION ISSUE,
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Jeff: I THINK IT ALL
COMES DOWN TO...

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
YEAH, JUST TO
THE DRESS CODE,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
BECAUSE...YOU KNOW,
I'D GET A LOT MORE DONE--

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Roger: SO WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING IS YOU WANT
UNIFORMS IN SCHOOL.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Will: I THINK IT'S
A TEACHER-- I THINK
IT'S ABOUT THE TEACHERS.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
I DON'T WANT UNIFORMS.
I WANT...

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
I WANT UNIFORMS,
BUT MINISKIRTS
FOR THE GIRLS.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Will: I THINK
THE TEACHERS...

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
TEACHERS, GENERALLY,
THEY...

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
THEY'RE MORE-- THEY CUT
THE GIRLS MORE SLACK.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
I THINK SO A LOT.
I SERIOUSLY THINK SO.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I'VE NOTICED THAT IN CLASS.
Jeff: ESPECIALLY
THE MALE TEACHERS.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
OH, LIKE, ALSO,
LIKE IN THE CLASSROOM,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I THINK THEY COULD...

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
'CAUSE WHEN A TEACHER'S,
LIKE, ALL MONOTONE,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
AND JUST LIKE,
JUST STRAIGHTFORWARD...

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
I LIKE IT WHEN THEY'RE MORE,
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, EXCITED,

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
'CAUSE IT GETS ME...
LIKE IT DRAWS ME
TOWARDS LEARNING

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
INSTEAD OF JUST LIKE,
ALL DULL AND WHATEVER.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
AND LIKE, I GUESS
THE GIRLS CAN FOCUS MORE.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
HAND ON STUFF MAKES ME
REMEMBER THINGS BETTER.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
LIKE TAKING NOTES DOWN AND
EVERYTHING LIKE THAT...

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
IT'S TOO REPETITIVE.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
BUT SAY YOU'RE IN
SOCIAL CLASS

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
AND YOU LEARN ABOUT NAPOLEON
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
LOOKING AT PLAYS OR...
DOING THE PLAYS.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
NOT NECESSARILY PLAYS,
BUT...

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
MOVIES ABOUT HIM
OR ACTING OUT ROLES,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
THINGS LIKE THAT.
THAT'D BE PRETTY TIGHT.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
WELL, SOME INSIGHTS
FROM THREE YOUNG MEN

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
WHO KNOW THE PROBLEM
UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
AND NOW FOR SOME
FINAL INSIGHTS
FROM OUR PANEL.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE IMPACT
ON SOCIETY AS A WHOLE

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
TO THE TREND THAT
WE'RE SEEING WITH BOYS,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
THIS TREND
OF UNDERACHIEVEMENT,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
AT LEAST AS THEY
COMPARE IT TO GIRLS,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE IMPACT WILL BE

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
IF IT ISN'T ADDRESSED?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT
HOW TO ADDRESS IT,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
IF WE DON'T?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
AND JEAN-CLAUDE,
I'D LIKE TO START WITH YOU.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
WELL, I THINK THE MAIN
ISSUE IS ACCESS TO JOBS.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
UH, MORE AND MORE
NEW JOBS ARE CREATED

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
NEED AT LEAST A SECONDARY
SCHOOL DIPLOMA

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
TO GET ACCESS TO.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
EVEN EXISTING JOBS

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
OR PEOPLE THAT ARE ON
THE WORKING FORCE RIGHT NOW

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
WILL NEED TO GET
MORE EDUCATION,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
OR CHANGE JOBS.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
THEY WILL CHANGE JOBS
MORE OFTEN, ALL THAT,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.000
AND THIS HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA
IS A BASIC NECESSITY

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
FOR THE JOBS COMING.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
SO IT'S ACCESS
TO GOOD JOBS

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
THAT IS THE KEY POINT,
I WOULD SAY.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
ALL RIGHT.
FROM THAT ON,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
WE SHOULD
REMEMBER THAT...

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000
GIRLS WITH
UNIVERSITY DIPLOMAS

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
GET JUST ABOUT
THE SAME SALARY

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
AS BOYS WITH
COLLEGE DIPLOMAS.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
SO THE ACCESS TO JOBS,
I WOULD SAY,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
IS THE MAIN THING AT STAKE.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Kathleen:
OKAY, HEATHER?

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
WELL, I'M NOT NEARLY
AS WORRIED

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
ABOUT BOYS IN THIS
AS SOME ARE.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
I ACTUALLY THINK THE BOYS

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
ARE DOING QUITE WELL
IN A LOT OF WAYS,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
AND I SAY THAT
WHEN I LOOK AT HOW

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
THEY'RE TEACHING
THEMSELVES IN A LOT OF WAYS

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
IN THE DIGITAL WORLD,
THE AMOUNT OF
READING THEY'RE DOING,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
THE KIND OF READING
THEY'RE DOING ON THE INTERNET.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
IT'S NOT WHAT WE THINK OF
AS READING

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
AS NOVELS AND THAT SORT
OF THING,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
BUT THEY'RE FACT FINDING,
THEY CAN RESEARCH

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
AND I THINK THEY'RE
GONNA BE JUST FINE

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE
KINDS OF JOBS.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
I THINK THEY'RE
TEACHING THEMSELVES

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
AND THEY MAY BE
AHEAD OF THE GAME

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
AND MY QUESTION WOULD BE,
WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
WHERE ARE THE GIRLS GONNA BE
IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE?

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
OH, THAT MIGHT BE
OUR NEXT SPECIAL.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
ANDREW?

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
WELL, I THINK WE HAVE
A CULTURAL PROBLEM

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
AND I THINK-- WE CAN SEE
THE EFFECTS OF IT.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
AND THEY'VE BEEN AROUND
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
I MEAN, WE CAN LOOK
AT OUR JAILS

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
AND WE FIND THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
A HUGE POPULATION OF
YOUNG MALES IN OUR JAILS.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
WHY? BECAUSE 70-80% OF THEM
CANNOT READ OR WRITE.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
AND WE FIND THE SAME
PROBLEMS WITH OUR
ABORIGINAL KIDS.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
AND WITH OUR
IMMIGRANT CHILDREN

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
WHO ARE FAILING
OUT OF SCHOOL

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
SO IF WE DO NOT
DEAL WITH IT,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
WITH THE PROBLEM,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
UH, THEN WE'LL PAY FOR IT

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
SOMEWHERE LATER
DOWN THE ROAD.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
OKAY, WILLIAM POLLACK,
THE LAST WORD TO YOU.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I AM WORRIED
ABOUT THE BOYS.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
I THINK WE ARE
ALREADY PAYING FOR IT.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THE GIRLS AS WELL.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
IT'S NOT JUST BOYS,
IT'S BOYS AND GIRLS.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
BUT BOYS WHO CAN'T DO
THOSE COMPLEX FUNCTIONS

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
FOR THOSE JOBS
WON'T GET THEM,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
THEY'LL GET
ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
OR THEY'LL GET
EMOTIONALLY DEPRESSED.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 10 AND 19,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
BOYS ARE FOUR TIMES
MORE LIKELY

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
TO TAKE THEIR LIVES
THAN GIRLS ARE,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
AND OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
THAT NUMBER HAS GONE UP 300%.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
THIS IS NO SMALL MATTER.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
NO. A CHILLING STATISTIC
TO END ON.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
WILLIAM, HEATHER,
JEAN-CLAUDE, ANDREW,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I THINK REALLY A SUPERB
CONVERSATION.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
I THANK YOU ALL
FOR TAKING THE TIME.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK
THE STAFF, THE FACULTY,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
THE STUDENTS AT LESTER B.
PEARSON HIGH SCHOOL.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
ALL OF THEIR ASSISTANCE.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
THEY, TOO,
HAVE BEEN SUPERB.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
AND OF COURSE WE WOULD LIKE
TO THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WEIGH IN
ON THIS, OFFER YOUR VIEW,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
THERE IS A WAY
YOU CAN DO IT. GO TO...

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
WE DO LOOK FORWARD
TO HEARING FROM YOU.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
I'M KATHLEEN PETTY,
GOOD BYE FOR NOW.
