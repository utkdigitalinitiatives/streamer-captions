00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000


3
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.100
Let fame, that all huntafter in their lives,

4
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.370
Live register'd upon ourbrazen tombs

5
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.730
And then grace us in thedisgrace of death;

6
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.630
When, spite of cormorantdevouring Time,

7
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.000
The endeavor of thispresent breath may buy

8
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.570
That honour which shallbate his scythe's keen edge

9
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.600
And make us heirs of alleternity.

10
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.730
Therefore, braveconquerors,--for so you are,

11
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.370
That war against your ownaffections

12
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.130
And the huge army of theworld's desires,--

13
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.200
Our late edict shallstrongly stand in force:

14
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.730
Navarre shall be thewonder of the world;

15
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.800
Our court shall be alittle Academe,

16
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.870
Still and contemplative inliving art.

17
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.470
You three, Biron, Dumain,and Longaville,

18
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.430
Have sworn for three years'term to live with me

19
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.100
My fellow-scholars, and tokeep those statutes

20
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.400
That are recorded in thisschedule here:

21
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.200
Your oaths are pass'd; andnow subscribe your names,

22
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.270
That his own hand maystrike his honour down

23
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.830
That violates the smallestbranch herein:

24
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.270
If you are arm'd to do assworn to do,

25
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.400
Subscribe to your deepoaths, and keep it too.

26
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.930
I am resolved; 'tis but athree years' fast:

27
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.530
The mind shall banquet,though the body pine:

28
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.470
My loving lord, Dumain ismortified:

29
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.900
The grosser manner ofthese world's delights

30
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.430
He throws upon the grossworld's baser slaves:

31
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.230
To love, to wealth, topomp, I pine and die;

32
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.970
With all these living inphilosophy.

33
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.570
I can but say theirprotestation over;

34
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.330
So much, dear liege, Ihave already sworn,

35
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.670
That is, to live and studyhere three years.

36
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.070
But there are other strictobservances;

37
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.530
As, not to see a woman inthat term,

38
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800
Which I hope well is notenrolled there;

39
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.730
And one day in a week totouch no food

40
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.530
And but one meal on everyday beside,

41
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.800
The which I hope is notenrolled there;

42
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.800
And then, to sleep butthree hours in the night,

43
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.300
And not be seen to wink ofall the day--

44
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.200
When I was wont to thinkno harm all night

45
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.070
And make a dark night tooof half the day--

46
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.600
Which I hope well is notenrolled there:

47
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.800
O, these are barren tasks,too hard to keep,

48
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.430
Not to see ladies, study,fast, not sleep!

49
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.100
Your oath is pass'd topass away from these.

50
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.630
Let me say no, my liege,an if you please:

51
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.870
I only swore to study withyour grace

52
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.830
And stay here in your courtfor three years' space.

53
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.970
You swore to that, Biron,and to the rest.

54
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.830
By yea and nay, sir, thenI swore in jest.

55
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.700
What is the end of study?let me know.

56
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.100
Why, that to know, whichelse we should not know.

57
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.470
Things hid and barr'd, youmean, from common sense?

58
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.700
Ay, that is study'sgodlike recompense.

59
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.430
Come on, then; I willswear to study so,

60
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.130
To know the thing I amforbid to know:

61
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.100
As thus,--to study where Iwell may dine,

62
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.370
When I to feast expresslyam forbid;

63
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.970
Or study where to meetsome mistress fine,

64
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.500
When mistresses fromcommon sense are hid;

65
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.830
Or, having sworn too harda keeping oath,

66
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.100
Study to break it and notbreak my troth.

67
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.200
If study's gain be thusand this be so,

68
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.330
Study knows that which yetit doth not know:

69
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.830
Swear me to this, and Iwill ne'er say no.

70
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.600
These be the stops thathinder study quite

71
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.230
And train our intellectsto vain delight.

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.700
Why, all delights arevain; but that most vain,

73
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.630
Which with pain purchaseddoth inherit pain:

74
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.530
As, painfully to pore upona book

75
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.530
To seek the light of truth;while truth the while

76
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.200
Doth falsely blind theeyesight of his look:

77
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.230
Light seeking light dothlight of light beguile:

78
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.530
So, ere you find wherelight in darkness lies,

79
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.130
Your light grows dark bylosing of your eyes.

80
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.400
Study me how to please theeye indeed

81
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.330
By fixing it upon a fairereye,

82
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.100
Who dazzling so, that eyeshall be his heed

83
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.730
And give him light that itwas blinded by.

84
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.030
These earthly godfathersof heaven's lights

85
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.730
That give a name to everyfixed star

86
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.430
Have no more profit oftheir shining nights

87
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.770
Than those that walk andwot not what they are.

88
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.700
Too much to know is toknow nought but fame;

89
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.570
And every godfather cangive a name.

90
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.700
How well he's read, toreason against reading!

91
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.930
Proceeded well, to stopall good proceeding!

92
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.230
Well, sit you out: gohome, Biron: adieu.

93
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.870
No, my good lord; I havesworn to stay with you:

94
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.000
And though I have forbarbarism spoke more

95
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.130
Than for that angelknowledge you can say,

96
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.200
Yet confident I'll keepwhat I have swore

97
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.430
And bide the penance ofeach three years' day.

98
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.770
Give me the paper; let meread the same;

99
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.100
And to the strict'stdecrees I'll write my name.

100
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.070
How well this yieldingrescues thee from shame!

101
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.030
'Item, That no woman shallcome within a

102
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.700
mile of my court:' Haththis been proclaimed?

103
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.570
Four days ago.

104
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.330
Let's see the penalty.

105
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.330
'On pain of losing her tongue.'Who devised this penalty?

106
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.800
Marry, that did I.

107
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.830
Sweet lord, and why?

108
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.600
To fright them hence withthat dread penalty.

109
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.970
A dangerous law againstgentility!

110
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.400
'Item, If any man be seento talk with a woman

111
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.770
within the term of threeyears, he shall endure such

112
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.770
public shame as the rest of thecourt can possibly devise.'

113
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.100
This article, my liege,yourself must break;

114
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.670
For well you know herecomes in embassy

115
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.770
The French king's daughterwith yourself to speak--

116
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.900
A maid of grace andcomplete majesty--

117
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.300
About surrender up ofAquitaine

118
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.030
To her decrepit, sick andbedrid father:

119
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.070
What say you, lords? Why,this was quite forgot.

120
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.100
So study evermore isovershot:

121
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.470
We must of force dispensewith this decree;

122
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.100
She must lie here on merenecessity.

123
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.700
Necessity will make us allforsworn

124
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.770
Three thousand times withinthis three years' space;

125
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.330
If I break faith, thisword shall speak for me;

126
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.030
I am forsworn on 'merenecessity.'

127
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.830
So to the laws at large Iwrite my name:

128
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.270
And he that breaks them inthe least degree

129
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.230
Stands in attainder ofeternal shame:

130
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.530
Suggestions are to otheras to me;

131
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.070
But I believe, although Iseem so loath,

132
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.070
I am the last that willlast keep his oath.

133
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.430
But is there no quickrecreation granted?

134
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:19.770
Ay, that there is. Ourcourt, you know, is haunted

135
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.670
With a refined travellerof Spain;

136
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.730
A man in all the world'snew fashion planted,

137
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.400
That hath a mint ofphrases in his brain;

138
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.570
One whom the music of hisown vain tongue

139
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.730
Doth ravish likeenchanting harmony;

140
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.470
A man of complements, whomright and wrong

141
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.500
Have chose as umpire oftheir mutiny:

142
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:46.170
This child of fancy, thatArmado hight,

143
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.900
For interim to our studiesshall relate

144
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.700
In high-born words theworth of many a knight

145
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.830
From tawny Spain lost inthe world's debate.

146
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.700
How you delight, my lords,I know not, I;

147
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.500
But, I protest, I love tohear him lie

148
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.200
And I will use him for myminstrelsy.

149
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.030
Boy, what sign is it whena man of great spirit

150
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.370
grows melancholy?

151
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.370
A great sign, sir, that hewill look sad.

152
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.800
Why, sadness is one and theself-same thing, dear imp.

153
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.470
No, no; O Lord, sir, no.

154
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.730
How canst thou partsadness and melancholy,

155
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.000
my tender juvenal?

156
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.370
By a familiar demonstration ofthe working, my tough senior.

157
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.000
Why tough senior? whytough senior?

158
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.100
Why tender juvenal? whytender juvenal?

159
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.300
I spoke it, tender juvenal,as a congruent epitheton

160
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.000
appertaining to thy young days,which we may nominate tender.

161
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.430
And I, tough senior, as anappertinent title to your

162
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.470
old time, which we mayname tough.

163
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.500
Pretty and apt.

164
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.270
How mean you, sir? Ipretty, and my saying apt?

165
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.570
or I apt, and my saying pretty?

166
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.330
Thou pretty, becauselittle.

167
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:55.900
Little pretty, becauselittle. Wherefore apt?

168
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.800
And therefore apt, becausequick.

169
00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.630
Speak you this in mypraise, master?

170
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.130
In thy condign praise.

171
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.800
I will praise an eel withthe same praise.

172
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.400
What, that an eel isingenious?

173
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.600
That an eel is quick.

174
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600
I do say thou art quick inanswers: thou heatest my blood.

175
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.500
I am answered, sir.

176
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.670
I love not to be crossed.

177
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.170
You are a gentleman and agamester, sir.

178
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.400
I confess both: they areboth the varnish of a

179
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.530
complete man.

180
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:35.730
I have promised to study threeyears with the duke.

181
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.900
But I hereupon confess Iam in love: and as it is

182
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.570
base for a soldier to love,

183
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.470
so am I in lovewith a base wench.

184
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.030
If drawing my swordagainst the humour

185
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.600
of affection would deliverme from the reprobate

186
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.000
thought of it, I wouldtake Desire prisoner,

187
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.500
and ransom him toany French courtier

188
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.300
for a new-devised courtesy.

189
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:12.270
I think scorn to sigh: methinksI should outswear Cupid.

190
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:20.370
Comfort, me, boy: what greatmen have been in love?

191
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.300
Hercules, master.

192
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.700
Most sweet Hercules! Moreauthority, dear boy,

193
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.400
name more; and, sweet my child,let them be men of good

194
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.470
repute and carriage.

195
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.900
Samson, master: he was aman of good carriage,

196
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.600
great carriage, for he carriedthe town-gates on his back

197
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.230
like a porter: and he wasin love.

198
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.170
O well-knit Samson!strong-jointed Samson!

199
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.900
I do excel thee in my rapier

200
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.330
as thou didst me incarrying gates.

201
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.330
I am in love too.

202
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.530
Who was Samson'slove, my dear Moth?

203
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.870
A woman, master.

204
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.600
Of what complexion?

205
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.430
Of the sea-water green,sir.

206
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.570
Is that one of the fourcomplexions?

207
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.300
As I have read, sir; andthe best of them too.

208
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.630
I do love that country girlthat I took in the

209
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:22.700
park with the rational hindCostard: she deserves well.

210
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.530
My spirit growsheavy in love.

211
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.970
A letter from themagnificent Armado.

212
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:53.370
How low soever the matter, Ihope in God for high words.

213
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.230
A high hope for a low heaven:God grant us patience!

214
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.670
To hear? or forbearhearing?

215
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.900
The matter is to me, sir,as concerning Jaquenetta.

216
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.530
The manner of it is, I wastaken with the manner.

217
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.670
In what manner?

218
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.070
In manner and form following,sir; all those three:

219
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:09.070
I was seen with herin the manor-house,

220
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.230
sitting with her upon the form,

221
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.400
and taken followingher into the park;

222
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.230
which, put together, is inmanner and form following.

223
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.800
Now, sir, for the manner,--

224
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.930
it is the manner of a manto speak to a woman:

225
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.570
for the form,-- in some form.

226
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.000
For the following, sir?

227
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.330
As it shall followin my correction:

228
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.600
and God defend the right!

229
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.000
Will you hear this letterwith attention?

230
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.970
As we would hear anoracle.

231
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.030
Such is the simplicity of manto hearken after the flesh.

232
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.800
'Great deputy, thewelkin's vicegerent and

233
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.400
sole dominator of Navarre,my soul's earth's god,

234
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.530
and body's fosteringpatron.'

235
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.830
Not a word of Costard yet.

236
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:43.800
'So it is,'--

237
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.130
It may be so: but if hesay it is so, he is,

238
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.970
in telling true, but so.

239
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:48.970
Peace!

240
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.570
Be to me and every manthat dares not fight!

241
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.870
No words!

242
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.870
Of other men's secrets, Ibeseech you.

243
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.330
'So it is, besieged withsable-coloured melancholy,

244
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.400
I did commend theblack-oppressing humour

245
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.530
to the most wholesome physicof thy health-giving air;

246
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:11.070
and, as I am a gentleman,betook myself to walk.

247
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:13.000
The time when. Aboutthe sixth hour;

248
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.370
when beasts most graze, birdsbest peck, and men sit down

249
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.070
to that nourishmentwhich is called supper:

250
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.470
so much for the time when.Now for the ground which;

251
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:30.200
which, I mean, I walked upon:it is y-cleped thy park.

252
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.470
Then for the place where;where, I mean, I did encounter

253
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.530
that obscene and preposterousevent, that draweth

254
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.830
from my snow-white penthe ebon-coloured ink,

255
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.530
which here thou viewest,beholdest, surveyest, or seest;

256
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.570
but to the place where; itstandeth north-north-east

257
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.530
and by east from the westcorner of thy curious-

258
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.930
knotted garden: there didI see that low-spirited

259
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.200
swain, that base minnow ofthy mirth,'--

260
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.970
Who?

261
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.970
Me?

262
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.730
'that unletteredsmall-knowing soul,'--

263
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.230
Me?

264
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.330
'that shallow vassal,'--

265
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.830
Still me?

266
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.530
'which, as I remember,hight Costard,'--

267
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.600
O, me!

268
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.030
'sorted and consorted,contrary to thy

'with a child of ourgrandmother Eve,

'Me, an't shall pleaseyou; I am Anthony Dull.

ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

287
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.930
This is not so well as Ilooked for, but the best

288
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.270
that ever I heard.

289
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.730
Ay, the best for theworst. But, sirrah,

290
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.300
what say you to this?

291
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.330
Sir, I confess the wench.

292
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.600
Did you hear theproclamation?

293
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.600
I do confess much of thehearing it but little of

294
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.230
the marking of it.

295
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.530
It was proclaimed ayear's imprisonment,

296
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.700
to be taken with a wench.

297
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.200
I was taken with none, sir:I was taken with a damsel.

298
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.630
Well, it was proclaimed'damsel.'

299
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.000
This was no damsel, neither,sir; she was a virgin.

300
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.800
It is so varied, too; forit was proclaimed 'virgin.'

301
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.830
If it were, I denyher virginity:

302
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.630
I was taken with a maid.

303
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.500
This maid will not serveyour turn, sir.

304
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.370
This maid will serve myturn, sir.

305
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.100
Sir, I will pronounceyour sentence:

306
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.400
you shall fast a weekwith bran and water.

307
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.230
I had rather pray a monthwith mutton and porridge.

308
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:51.030
And Don Armado shall beyour keeper.

309
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.130
My Lord Biron, see himdeliver'd o'er:

310
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:22.330
Sir, the duke's pleasure is,that you keep Costard safe:

311
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.230
and you must suffer himto take no delight

312
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:29.900
nor no penance; but a' mustfast three days a week.

313
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.130
For this damsel, I mustkeep her at the park:

314
00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.170
she is allowed for theday-woman. Fare you well.

315
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:41.070
I do betray myself withblushing. Maid!

316
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.470
Man?

317
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.130
I will visit thee at thelodge.

318
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:51.830
That's hereby.

319
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.170
I know where it issituate.

320
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.530
Lord, how wise you are!

321
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.600
I will tell thee wonders.

322
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.270
With that face?

323
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.670
I love thee.

324
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.530
So I heard you say.

325
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.030
And so, farewell.

326
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.030
Fair weather after you!

327
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.930
Come, Jaquenetta, away!

328
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.770
Villain, thou shaltfast for thy offences

329
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.900
ere thou be pardoned.

330
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.030
Well, sir, I hope, when Ido it, I shall do it on a

331
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.100
full stomach.

332
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.630
Thou shalt be heavilypunished.

333
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.400
I am more bound to you thanyour fellows, for they

334
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.770
are but lightly rewarded.

335
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.000
Take away this villain;shut him up.

336
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.530
Come, you transgressingslave; away!

337
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.430
Let me not be pent up, sir:I will fast, being loose.

338
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.100
No, sir; that were fast andloose: thou shalt to prison.

339
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.030
Well, if ever I do see themerry days of desolation

340
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.870
that I have seen, someshall see.

341
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.200
What shall some see?

342
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.970
Nay, nothing, Master Moth,but what they look upon.

343
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.870
It is not for prisoners to betoo silent in their words;

344
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.500
and therefore I willsay nothing: I thank

345
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.400
God I have as littlepatience as another man;

346
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.770
and therefore I can be quiet.

347
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.700
I do affect the veryground, which is base,

348
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.470
where her shoe, which isbaser, guided by her foot,

349
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.370
which is basest, doth tread.I shall be forsworn,

350
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.270
which is a great argumentof falsehood, if I love.

351
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.630
And how can that be true lovewhich is falsely attempted?

352
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.100
Love is a familiar;Love is a devil:

353
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:26.330
there is no evil angel but Love.Yet was Samson so tempted,

354
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.900
and he had anexcellent strength;

355
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.200
yet was Solomon so seduced,and he had a very good wit.

356
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.070
Cupid's butt-shaft is toohard for Hercules' club;

357
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:45.670
and therefore too much oddsfor a Spaniard's rapier.

358
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.830
Adieu, valour! rust rapier!

359
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:56.070
be still, drum! for yourmanager is in love;

360
00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:06.730
yea, he loveth. Assist me,some extemporal god of rhyme,

361
00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:15.270
for I am sure I shall turnsonnet. Devise, wit;

362
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:24.930
write, pen; for I am forwhole volumes in folio.

363
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.500
Now, madam, summon up yourdearest spirits:

364
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.130
Consider who the king yourfather sends,

365
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.200
To whom he sends, andwhat's his embassy:

366
00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.430
Yourself, held precious inthe world's esteem,

367
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.270
To parley with the soleinheritor

368
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.100
Of all perfections that aman may owe,

369
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.970
Matchless Navarre; theplea of no less weight

370
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.900
Than Aquitaine, a dowryfor a queen.

371
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.500
Be now as prodigal of alldear grace

372
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.670
As Nature was in makinggraces dear

373
00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.970
When she did starve thegeneral world beside

374
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.370
And prodigally gave themall to you.

375
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.900
Good Lord Boyet, mybeauty, though but mean,

376
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.470
Needs not the paintedflourish of your praise:

377
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.730
Beauty is bought byjudgement of the eye,

378
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.030
Not utter'd by base saleof chapmen's tongues:

379
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:18.830
I am less proud to hearyou tell my worth

380
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.830
Than you much willing tobe counted wise

381
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:25.170
In spending your wit inthe praise of mine.

382
00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.830
But now to task thetasker: good Boyet,

383
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:36.630
You are not ignorant,all-telling fame

384
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.900
Doth noise abroad, Navarrehath made a vow,

385
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.870
Till painful study shalloutwear three years,

386
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.000
No woman may approach hissilent court:

387
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.930
Therefore to's seemeth ita needful course,

388
00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.370
Before we enter hisforbidden gates,

389
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.570
To know his pleasure; andin that behalf,

390
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:58.030
Bold of your worthiness,we single you

391
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.600
As our best-moving fairsolicitor.

392
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.330
Tell him, the daughter ofthe King of France,

393
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.930
On serious business,craving quick dispatch,

394
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.070
Importunes personalconference with his grace:

395
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.030
Haste, signify so much;while we attend,

396
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.070
Like humble-visagedsuitors, his high will.

397
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.130
Proud of employment,willingly I go.

398
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:20.400
All pride is willingpride, and yours is so.

399
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:23.300
Who are the votaries, myloving lords,

400
00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.500
That are vow-fellows withthis virtuous duke?

401
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.670
Lord Longaville is one.

402
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.670
Know you the man?

403
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.000
I know him, madam: at amarriage-feast,

404
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.030
Between Lord Perigort andthe beauteous heir

405
00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.630
Of Jaques Falconbridge,solemnized

406
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.600
In Normandy, saw I thisLongaville:

407
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.170
Well, a man of sovereign partshe is esteem'd;

408
00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.430
Well fitted in arts,glorious in arms:

409
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.300
Nothing becomes him illthat he would well.

410
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.170
The only soil of his fairvirtue's gloss,

411
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.600
If virtue's gloss willstain with any soil,

412
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.630
Is a sharp wit matchedwith too blunt a will;

413
00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.500
Whose edge hath power tocut, whose will still wills

414
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.230
It should none spare thatcome within his power.

415
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.830
Some merry mocking lord,belike; is't so?

416
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.130
They say so most that mosthis humours know.

417
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.570
Such short-lived wits dowither as they grow.

418
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:12.670
Who are the rest?

419
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.430
The young Dumain, awell-accomplished youth,

420
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.400
Of all that virtue lovefor virtue loved:

421
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.970
Most power to do mostharm, least knowing ill;

422
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:22.300
For he hath wit to make anill shape good,

423
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.630
And shape to win gracethough he had no wit.

424
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.470
Another of these studentsat that time

425
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.670
Was there with him, if Ihave heard a truth.

426
00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.430
Biron they call him; but amerrier man,

427
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.570
Within the limit ofbecoming mirth,

428
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:34.600
I never spent an hour'stalk withal:

429
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.570
His eye begets occasionfor his wit;

430
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.430
For every object that theone doth catch

431
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:41.530
The other turns to amirth-moving jest,

432
00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.800
Which his fair tongue,conceit's expositor,

433
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.870
Delivers in such apt andgracious words

434
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.900
That aged ears play truantat his tales

435
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.230
And younger hearings arequite ravished;

436
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.000
So sweet and voluble ishis discourse.

437
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.200
God bless my ladies! arethey all in love,

438
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.170
That every one her ownhath garnished

439
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.200
With such bedeckingornaments of praise?

440
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.330
Here comes Boyet.

441
00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.530
Now, what admittance,lord?

442
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.470
Navarre had notice of yourfair approach;

443
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.870
And he and his competitorsin oath

444
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.470
Were all address'd to meetyou, gentle lady,

445
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.100
Before I came. Marry, thusmuch I have learnt:

446
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.270
He rather means to lodgeyou in the field,

447
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.930
Like one that comes hereto besiege his court,

448
00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.400
Than seek a dispensationfor his oath,

449
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.700
To let you enter hisunpeopled house.

450
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.500
Here comes Navarre.

451
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.070
Fair princess, welcome tothe court of Navarre.

452
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.800
'Fair' I give you backagain; and 'welcome'

453
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.230
I have not yet: the roof of thiscourt is too high to be yours;

454
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.600
and welcome to the widefields too base to be mine.

455
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.430
You shall be welcome,madam, to my court.

456
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.130
I will be welcome, then:conduct me thither.

457
00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.830
Hear me, dear lady; I havesworn an oath.

458
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.130
Our Lady help my lord!he'll be forsworn.

459
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.330
Not for the world, fairmadam, by my will.

460
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.070
Why, will shall break it;will and nothing else.

461
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.930
Your ladyship is ignorantwhat it is.

462
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.830
Were my lord so, hisignorance were wise,

463
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.770
Where now his knowledgemust prove ignorance.

464
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.930
I hear your grace hathsworn out house-keeping:

465
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:01.470
Tis deadly sin to keepthat oath, my lord,

466
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.970
And sin to break it.

467
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.500
But pardon me. I am toosudden-bold:

468
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.800
To teach a teacher illbeseemeth me.

469
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.070
Vouchsafe to read thepurpose of my coming,

470
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.330
And suddenly resolve me inmy suit.

471
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.300
Madam, I will, if suddenlyI may.

472
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.000
You will the sooner, thatI were away;

473
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.470
For you'll prove perjuredif you make me stay.

474
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.530
Did not I dance with youin Brabant once?

475
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.170
Did not I dance with youin Brabant once?

476
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.130
I know you did.

477
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.900
How needless was it thento ask the question!

478
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.300
You must not be so quick.

479
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.970
'Tis 'long of you that spurme with such questions.

480
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.530
Your wit's too hot, it speedstoo fast, 'twill tire.

481
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.570
Not till it leave therider in the mire.

482
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.900
What time o' day?

483
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.030
The hour that fools shouldask.

484
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.870
Now fair befall your mask!

485
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.430
Fair fall the face itcovers!

486
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.670
And send you many lovers!

487
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.270
Amen, so you be none.

488
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.100
Nay, then will I be gone.

489
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.870
Madam, your father heredoth intimate

490
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.030
The payment of a hundredthousand crowns;

491
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.170
Being but the one half ofan entire sum

492
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.730
Disbursed by my father inhis wars.

493
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.530
But say that he or we, asneither have,

494
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.000
Received that sum, yetthere remains unpaid

495
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.800
A hundred thousand more;in surety of the which,

496
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.330
One part of Aquitaine isbound to us,

497
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.570
Although not valued to themoney's worth.

498
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:17.370
If then the king yourfather will restore

499
00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.670
But that one half which isunsatisfied,

500
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.970
We will give up our rightin Aquitaine,

501
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:23.970
And hold fair friendshipwith his majesty.

502
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:27.970
But that, it seems, helittle purposeth,

503
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.630
For here he doth demand tohave repaid

504
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.070
A hundred thousand crowns;and not demands,

505
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.930
On payment of a hundredthousand crowns,

506
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.530
To have his title live inAquitaine;

507
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.930
Which we much rather haddepart withal

508
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.930
And have the money by ourfather lent

509
00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.900
Than Aquitaine so geldedas it is.

510
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.570
Dear Princess, were nothis requests so far

511
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.370
From reason's yielding,your fair self should make

512
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.800
A yielding 'gainst somereason in my breast

513
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.400
And go well satisfied toFrance again.

514
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.300
You do the king my fathertoo much wrong

515
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.200
And wrong the reputationof your name,

516
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.800
In so unseeming to confessreceipt

517
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.400
Of that which hath sofaithfully been paid.

518
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.170
I do protest I never heardof it;

519
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.570
And if you prove it, I'llrepay it back

520
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.330
Or yield up Aquitaine.

521
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:11.270
We arrest your word.

522
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.930
Boyet, you can produceacquittances

523
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.330
For such a sum fromspecial officers

524
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.600
Of Charles his father.

525
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.400
Satisfy me so.

526
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.600
So please your grace, thepacket is not come

527
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.770
Where that and otherspecialties are bound:

528
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.170
To-morrow you shall have asight of them.

529
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.400
It shall suffice me: atwhich interview

530
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.500
All liberal reason I willyield unto.

531
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.470
Meantime receive suchwelcome at my hand

532
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.470
As honour without breachof honour may

533
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.730
Make tender of to thy trueworthiness:

534
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.870
You may not come, fairprincess, in my gates;

535
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:46.530
But here without you shallbe so received

536
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.170
As you shall deem yourselflodged in my heart,

537
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.630
Although so denied fairharbour in my house.

538
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.470
Your own good thoughtsexcuse me, and farewell:

539
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.170
To-morrow shall we visityou again.

540
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.630
Sweet health and fairdesires consort your grace!

541
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.330
Thy own wish wish I theein every place!

542
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:18.700
Sir, I pray you, a word:what lady is that same?

543
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.000
The heir of Alencon,Katharine her name.

544
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.630
A gallant lady. Monsieur,fare you well.

545
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.830
I beseech you a word: whatis she in the white?

546
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.200
A woman sometimes, an yousaw her in the light.

547
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.500
Perchance light in thelight. I desire her name.

548
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.300
She is an heir ofFalconbridge.

549
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.700
What's her name in thecap?

550
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.300
Rosaline, by good hap.

551
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.430
Is she wedded or no?

552
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.100
To her will, sir, or so.

553
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:52.900
You are welcome, sir:adieu.

554
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.730
Farewell to me, sir, andwelcome to you.

555
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.300
That last is Biron, themerry madcap lord:

556
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.000
Not a word with him but ajest.

557
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.730
And every jest but a word.

558
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.870
It was well done of you totake him at his word.

559
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.930
I was as willing to grappleas he was to board.

560
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:09.330
Two hot sheeps, marry.

561
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.700
And wherefore not ships?

562
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.370
No sheep, sweet lamb, unlesswe feed on your lips.

563
00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.830
You sheep, and I pasture:shall that finish the jest?

564
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.830
So you grant pasture forme.

565
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.430
Not so, gentle beast:

566
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.970
My lips are no common,though several they be.

567
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.230
Belonging to whom?

568
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.430
To my fortunes and me.

569
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.130
Good wits will be jangling;but, gentles, agree:

570
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.400
This civil war of witswere much better used

571
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.430
On Navarre and his book-men;for here 'tis abused.

572
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:39.800
If my observation, whichvery seldom lies,

573
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.630
By the heart's still rhetoricdisclosed with eyes,

574
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.930
Deceive me not now,Navarre is infected.

575
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.130
With what?

576
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.700
With that which we loversentitle affected.

577
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.700
Your reason?

578
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.300
Why, all his behaviors didmake their retire

579
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.930
To the court of his eye,peeping thorough desire:

580
00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.770
His heart, like an agate,with your print impress'd,

581
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.430
Proud with his form, inhis eye pride express'd:

582
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.700
His tongue, all impatientto speak and not see,

583
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.330
Did stumble with haste inhis eyesight to be;

584
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.170
All senses to that sensedid make their repair,

585
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.800
To feel only looking onfairest of fair:

586
00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.570
Methought all his senseswere lock'd in his eye,

587
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.130
As jewels in crystal forsome prince to buy;

588
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:26.300
Who, tendering their own worthfrom where they were glass'd,

589
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.200
Did point you to buy them,along as you pass'd:

590
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.130
His face's own margent didquote such amazes

591
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:37.770
That all eyes saw his eyesenchanted with gazes.

592
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:42.230
I'll give you Aquitaineand all that is his,

593
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.970
An you give him for mysake but one loving kiss.

594
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.130
Thou art an old love-mongerand speakest skilfully.

595
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.470
He is Cupid's grandfatherand learns news of him.

596
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.770
Then was Venus like her mother,for her father is but grim.

597
00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:07.630
If love make me forsworn,how shall I swear to love?

598
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:13.500
Ah, never faith could hold,if not to beauty vow'd!

599
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.970
Though to myself forsworn,to thee I'll faithful prove:

600
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:24.530
Those thoughts to me were oaks,to thee like osiers bow'd.

601
00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:29.030
Study his bias leaves andmakes his book thine eyes,

602
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:35.630
Where all those pleasures livethat art would comprehend:

603
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:48.430
(♪ singing in French)

604
00:30:48.430 --> 00:31:34.400
(♪ singing in French)

605
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:43.630
Sweet air! Go, tendernessof years; take this key,

606
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.330
give enlargement to the swain,bring him festinately hither:

607
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.830
He must carry me a letter to mylove.

608
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.330
A message well sympathized;

609
00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.900
Horse to be ambassador foran ass.

610
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.130
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

611
00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.300
Marry, sir, you must sendthe ass upon the horse,

612
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.900
for he is veryslow-gaited. But I go sir.

613
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.270
As swift as lead.

614
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.630
The meaning, prettyingenious?

615
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.430
Is not lead a metal heavy,dull, and slow?

616
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.970
Minime, honest master; orrather, master, no.

617
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.270
I say lead is slow.

618
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.800
You are too swift, sir, tosay so:

619
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.430
Is that lead slow which isfired from a gun?

620
00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:29.030
A most acute juvenal;voluble and free of grace!

621
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:35.400
By thy favour, sweet welkin,I must sigh in thy face:

622
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.870
Most rude melancholy,valour gives thee place.

623
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.330
A wonder, master! here's acostard broken in a shin.

624
00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:49.130
Some enigma, some riddle:come, thy l'envoy; begin.

625
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.700
No enigma, no riddle, nol'envoy; no salve in the mail,

626
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.770
O, sir, plantain,a plain plantain!

627
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:59.000
no l'envoy, no l'envoy; nosalve, sir, but a plantain!

628
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.100
By virtue, thouenforcest laughter;

629
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.500
thy silly thought my spleen;the heaving of my lungs

630
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.500
provokes me toridiculous smiling.

631
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.830
O, pardon me, my stars!

632
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.800
Doth the inconsiderate takesalve for l'envoy, for a salve?

633
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.670
Do the wise think them other?is not l'envoy a salve?

634
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:22.930
No, page: it is some epilogueor discourse, to make plain

635
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.370
Some obscure precedencethat hath tofore been sain.

636
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.030
I will example it:

637
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.500
The fox, the ape, and thehumble-bee,

638
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.470
Were still at odds, beingbut three.

639
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:35.400
There's the moral. Now thel'envoy.

640
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.230
I will add the l'envoy.Say the moral again.

641
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.900
The fox, the ape, and thehumble-bee,

642
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.070
Were still at odds, beingbut three.

643
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.530
Until the goose came outof door,

644
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.100
And stay'd the odds byadding four.

645
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.400
Now will I begin your moral,

646
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.670
and do you followwith my l'envoy.

647
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.830
The fox, the ape, and thehumble-bee,

648
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.170
Were still at odds, beingbut three.

649
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.900
Until the goose came outof door,

650
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.030
Staying the odds by addingfour.

651
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.770
A good l'envoy,ending in the goose:

652
00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.070
would you desire more?

653
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.770
How did this argumentbegin?

654
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:07.870
By saying here's a costardbroken in a shin.

655
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.270
Then call'd you for thel'envoy.

656
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.470
True, and I for a plantain:

657
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:15.000
But tell me; how was therea costard broken in a shin?

658
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.400
I will tell you sensibly.

659
00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.100
Thou hast no feelingof it, Moth:

660
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.770
I will speak that l'envoy:

661
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.970
I Costard, running out,that was safely within,

662
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:23.330
Fell over the thresholdand broke my shin.

663
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.100
We will talk no more ofthis matter.

664
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.570
Till there be more matterin the shin.

665
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:33.400
Sirrah Costard, I willenfranchise thee.

666
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.730
O, marry me to one Frances:

667
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.370
I smell some l'envoy,some goose, in this.

668
00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:41.200
By my sweet soul, I meansetting thee at liberty,

669
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.430
enfreedoming thy person;thou wert immured,

670
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:48.270
restrained, captivated,bound.

671
00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.370
True, true; and now youwill be my purgation

672
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.670
and let me loose.

673
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.300
I will give thee thy liberty,set thee from durance;

674
00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:02.730
and, in lieu thereof, imposeon thee nothing but this:

675
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:15.530
bear this significant to thecountry maid Jaquenetta:

676
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:21.770
there is remuneration; forthe best ward of mine

677
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:30.500
honour is rewarding mydependents. Moth, follow.

678
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:37.830
Now will I look to hisremuneration. Remuneration!

679
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.770
O, that's the Latin wordfor three farthings:

680
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.600
three farthings--remuneration.--

681
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.130
'What's the priceof this inkle?'

682
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.770
--'One penny.'--'No, I'llgive you a remuneration:'

683
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.970
why, it carriesit. Remuneration!

684
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.730
why, it is a fairer namethan French crown.

685
00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.470
I will never buy andsell out of this word.

686
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.470
O, my good knave Costard!exceedingly well met.

687
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.030
Pray you, sir, how muchcarnation ribbon may a man

688
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.300
buy for a remuneration?

689
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.370
What is a remuneration?

690
00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:03.830
Marry, sir, halfpennyfarthing.

691
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.570
Why, then, three-farthingworth of silk.

692
00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.070
I thank your worship: Godbe wi' you!

693
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:09.030
Stay, slave; I must employthee:

694
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.570
As thou wilt win myfavour, good my knave,

695
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.400
Do one thing for me that Ishall entreat.

696
00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.030
When would you have itdone, sir?

697
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:15.070
This afternoon.

698
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:16.670
Well, I will do it, sir:fare you well.

699
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.100
Thou knowest not what itis.

700
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.430
I shall know, sir, when Ihave done it.

701
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:20.800
Why, villain, thou mustknow first.

702
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.070
I will come to yourworship to-morrow morning.

703
00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.170
It must be done thisafternoon.

704
00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.170
Hark, slave, it is butthis:

705
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.170
The princess comes to hunthere in the park,

706
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.800
And in her train there isa gentle lady;

707
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:40.730
When tongues speak sweetly,then they name her name,

708
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:45.770
And Rosaline they callher: ask for her;

709
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.730
And to her white hand seethou do commend

710
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:55.500
This seal'd-up counsel.There's thy guerdon; go.

711
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.630
Gardon, O sweet gardon!better than remuneration,

712
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.770
a'leven-pence farthingbetter: most sweet gardon!

713
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:08.600
I will do it sir, in print.Gardon! Remuneration!

714
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:18.230
And I, forsooth, in love! I,that have been love's whip;

715
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.670
A very beadle to ahumorous sigh;

716
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.100
A critic, nay, anight-watch constable;

717
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.530
A domineering pedant o'erthe boy;

718
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:27.500
Than whom no mortal somagnificent!

719
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.670
This whimpled, whining,purblind, wayward boy;

720
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:36.230
This senior-junior,giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;

721
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.930
Regent of love-rhymes,lord of folded arms,

722
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.970
The anointed sovereign ofsighs and groans,

723
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:43.400
Liege of all loiterers andmalcontents,

724
00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.830
Dread prince of plackets,king of codpieces,

725
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.830
Sole imperator and greatgeneral

726
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:55.000
Of trotting 'paritors:--Omy little heart:--

727
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.670
And I to be a corporal ofhis field,

728
00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.170
And wear his colours likea tumbler's hoop!

729
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:06.700
What, I! I love! I sue! Iseek a wife!

730
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.300
A woman, that is like aGerman clock,

731
00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.170
Still a-repairing, everout of frame,

732
00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:12.470
And never going aright,being a watch,

733
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.400
But being watch'd that itmay still go right!

734
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:20.530
Nay, to be perjured, whichis worst of all;

735
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.000
And, among three, to lovethe worst of all;

736
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.470
A wightly wanton with avelvet brow,

737
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.800
With two pitch-balls stuckin her face for eyes;

738
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.000
Ay, and by heaven, onethat will do the deed

739
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Though Argus were hereunuch and her guard:

740
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.470
And I to sigh for her! towatch for her!

741
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.670
To pray for her! Go to; itis a plague

742
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.000
That Cupid will impose formy neglect

743
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.330
Of his almighty dreadfullittle might.

744
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:56.500
Well, I will love, write,sigh, pray, sue and groan:

745
00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:02.870
Some men must love my ladyand some Joan.

746
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.170
Was that the king, thatspurred his horse so hard

747
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.670
Against the steep uprisingof the hill?

748
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.530
I know not; but I think itwas not he.

749
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.770
Whoe'er a' was, a' show'da mounting mind.

750
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.230
Well, lords, to-day weshall have our dispatch:

751
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.900
On Saturday we will returnto France.

752
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.370
Then, forester, my friend,where is the bush

753
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.030
That we must stand andplay the murderer in?

754
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.070
Hereby, upon the edge ofyonder coppice;

755
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.230
A stand where you may makethe fairest shoot.

756
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.900
But come, the bow: nowmercy goes to kill,

757
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.930
The poor deer's blood, thatmy heart means no ill.

758
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.900
Here comes a member of thecommonwealth.

759
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.200
God dig-you-den all! Prayyou, which is the head lady?

760
00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.700
Thou shalt know her, fellow, bythe others that have no heads.

761
00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.870
Which is the greatestlady, the highest?

762
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.930
The thickest and thetallest.

763
00:39:52.930 --> 00:40:00.070
The thickest and the tallest!it is so; truth is truth.

764
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.330
An your waist, mistress,were as slender as my wit,

765
00:40:02.330 --> 00:40:05.430
One o' these maids' girdlesfor your waist should be fit.

766
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:09.170
Are not you the chief woman?you are the thickest here.

767
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.870
What's your will, sir?what's your will?

768
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:14.130
I have a letter from MonsieurBiron to one Lady Rosaline.

769
00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.930
O, thy letter, thy letter!he's a good friend of mine:

770
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.530
Stand aside, good bearer.Boyet, you can carve;

771
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:21.900
Break up this capon.

772
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.700
I am bound to serve.

773
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.030
This letter is mistook, itimporteth none here;

774
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.130
It is writ to Jaquenetta.

775
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.730
We will read it, I swear.

776
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:34.930
Break the neck of the wax,and every one give ear.

777
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.500
'By heaven, that thou artfair, is most infallible;

778
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.200
true, that thou artbeauteous; truth itself,

779
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.530
that thou art lovely.More fairer than fair,

780
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.500
beautiful than beauteous,truer than truth itself,

781
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.470
have commiseration onthy heroical vassal!

782
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:54.000
The magnanimous and mostillustrate king Cophetua set

783
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.530
eye upon the pernicious andindubitate beggar Zenelophon;

784
00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.500
and he it was thatmight rightly say,

785
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:08.030
Veni, vidi, vici; which toannothanize in the vulgar,

786
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.600
--O base and obscurevulgar!--videlicet,

787
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.770
He came, saw, and overcame:he came, one; saw two;

788
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.600
overcame, three. Whocame? the king:

789
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.670
why did he come? to see: whydid he see? to overcome:

790
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.600
to whom came he? to thebeggar: what saw he?

791
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.500
the beggar: who overcamehe? the beggar.

792
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:32.700
The conclusion is victory:on whose side? the king's.

793
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.800
The captive is enriched:on whose side?

794
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.400
the beggar's. The catastropheis a nuptial: on whose side?

795
00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:48.100
the king's: no, on bothin one, or one in both.

796
00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:56.100
I am the king; for sostands the comparison:

797
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.630
thou the beggar; for sowitnesseth thy lowliness.

798
00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.470
What shalt thouexchange for rags? robes;

799
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:08.630
for tittles? titles;for thyself? me.

800
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:14.330
Thus, expecting thy reply, Iprofane my lips on thy foot,

801
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:21.400
my eyes on thy picture. andmy heart on thy every part.

802
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.770
Thine, in the dearestdesign of industry,

803
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:30.300
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

804
00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:37.430
What plume of feathers is hethat indited this letter?

805
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.900
What vane? what weathercock?did you ever hear better?

806
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.700
I am much deceived but Iremember the style.

807
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.530
Else your memory is bad,going o'er it erewhile.

808
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:50.400
This Armado is a Spaniard,that keeps here in court;

809
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:55.500
A phantasime, a Monarcho,and one that makes sport

810
00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:57.700
To the prince and hisbookmates.

811
00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.000
Thou fellow, a word:

812
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.730
Who gave thou this letter?

813
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.000
I told you; my lord.

814
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.170
To whom shouldst thou giveit?

815
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.730
From my lord to my lady.

816
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.200
From which lord to whichlady?

817
00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:12.270
From my lord Biron, a goodmaster of mine,

818
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.200
To a lady of France thathe call'd Rosaline.

819
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.500
Thou hast mistaken hisletter. Come, lords, away.

820
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:26.500
Here, sweet, put up this:'twill be thine another day.

821
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.600
Who is the suitor? who isthe suitor?

822
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.030
Shall I teach you to know?

823
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:35.900
Ay, my continent ofbeauty.

824
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.130
Why, she that bears thebow.

825
00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.730
Finely put off!

826
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.470
My lady goes to killhorns; but, if thou marry,

827
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.470
Hang me by the neck, ifhorns that year miscarry.

828
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.800
Finely put on!

829
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.170
Well, then, I am theshooter.

830
00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:50.230
And who is your deer?

831
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.670
If we choose by the horns,yourself come not near.

832
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.470
Finely put on, indeed!

833
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.430
You still wranglewith her, Boyet,

834
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.600
and she strikes at the brow.

835
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.830
But she herself is hitlower: have I hit her now?

836
00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:05.300
Shall I come upon theewith an old saying,

837
00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.030
that was a man when King Pepinof France was a little boy,

838
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.130
as touching the hit it?

839
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.430
So I may answer theewith one as old,

840
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.500
that was a woman when QueenGuinover of Britain was

841
00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:16.300
a little wench, astouching the hit it.

842
00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.300
Thou canst not hit it, hitit, hit it,

843
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.470
Thou canst not hit it, mygood man.

844
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.270
An I cannot, cannot,cannot,

845
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.700
An I cannot, another can.

846
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.700
O' my troth, most sweet jests!most incony vulgar wit!

847
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.100
When it comes so smoothlyoff, so obscenely,

848
00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.230
as it were, so fit.

849
00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.100
Very reverend sport, truly;

850
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:45.500
and done in the testimonyof a good conscience.

851
00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.730
The deer was, as youknow, sanguis, in blood;

852
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.700
ripe as the pomewater, whonow hangeth like a jewel in

853
00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.970
the ear of caelo, the sky,the welkin, the heaven;

854
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:59.530
and anon falleth like acrab on the face of terra,

855
00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.770
the soil, the land, theearth.

856
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.970
Truly, Master Holofernes,the epithets are sweetly

857
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.070
varied, like a scholarat the least:

858
00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.630
but, sir, I assure ye, it wasa buck of the first head.

859
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.800
Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.

860
00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:16.330
'Twas not a haud credo;'twas a pricket.

861
00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:22.030
Most barbarous intimation!yet a kind of insinuation,

862
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.230
as it were, in via, inway, of explication;

863
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.330
facere, as it were, replication,or rather,

864
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:32.630
ostentare, as itwere, to show, his inclination,

865
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.100
after his undressed,unpolished,

866
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:38.600
uneducated, unpruned,untrained, or rather,

867
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.900
unlettered, or ratherest,unconfirmed fashion,

868
00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.970
to insert again my haudcredo for a deer.

869
00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.970
I said the deer was not ahaud credo; twas a pricket.

870
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.070
Twice-sod simplicity, hiscoctus!

871
00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:54.600
O thou monster Ignorance,how deformed dost thou look!

872
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.700
Sir, he hath never fed ofthe dainties that are bred

873
00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.130
in a book; he hath noteat paper, as it were;

874
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.100
he hath not drunk ink: hisintellect is not replenished;

875
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.170
he is only an animal, onlysensible in the duller parts:

876
00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:10.430
And such barren plantsare set before us,

877
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:12.830
that we thankful should be,

878
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:16.370
Which we of taste and knowledgeare, for those parts which

879
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.800
do fructify in us morethan he.

880
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.430
For as it would illbecome me to be vain,

881
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.270
indiscreet, or a fool,

882
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.500
So were there a patchset on learning,

883
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:29.970
to see him in a school:But omne bene, say I;

884
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:32.730
being of an old father's mind,

885
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:36.000
Many can brook the weatherthat love not the wind.

886
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.130
You two are book-men: canyou tell me by your wit

887
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.330
What was a month oldat Cain's birth,

888
00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:44.200
that's not fiveweeks old as yet?

889
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:47.200
Dictynna, goodman Dull;Dictynna, goodman Dull.

890
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.300
What is Dictynna?

891
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.700
A title to Phoebe, toLuna, to the moon.

892
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.170
The moon was a month oldwhen Adam was no more,

893
00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:01.930
And raught not to five weekswhen he came to five-score.

894
00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.270
The allusion holds in theexchange.

895
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.670
'Tis true indeed; the collusionholds in the exchange.

896
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.470
God comfort thycapacity! I say,

897
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.730
the allusion holdsin the exchange.

898
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.070
And I say, the pollusionholds in the exchange;

899
00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.870
for the moon is neverbut a month old:

900
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.230
and I say beside that,

901
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:21.630
'twas a pricket thatthe princess killed.

902
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.400
Sir Nathaniel, will youhear an extemporal epitaph

903
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.270
on the death of the deer?

904
00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:29.630
And, to humour the ignorant,

905
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:33.500
call I the deer theprincess killed a pricket.

906
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.230
Perge, good MasterHolofernes, perge;

907
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:40.230
so it shall please youto abrogate scurrility.

908
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:45.970
I will something affect theletter, for it argues facility.

909
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.270
The preyful princessprick'd and pierced

910
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.900
a prettypleasing pricket;

911
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.770
Some say a sore;but not a sore,

912
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:56.430
till now made sorewith shooting.

913
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:59.570
The dogs did yell:put L to sore,

914
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:02.570
then sorel jumps from thicket;

915
00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.230
Or pricket sore, or else sorel;the people fall a-hooting.

916
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:11.000
If sore be sore, then L to soremakes fifty sores one sorel.

917
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.630
Of one sore I an hundred makeby adding but one more L.

918
00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.030
A rare talent!

919
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.530
This is a gift that Ihave, simple, simple;

920
00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.830
a foolish extravagant spirit,full of forms, figures,

921
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:33.000
shapes, objects, ideas,apprehensions, motions,

922
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.100
revolutions: these are begotin the ventricle of memory,

923
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:39.500
nourished in thewomb of pia mater,

924
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.970
and delivered upon themellowing of occasion.

925
00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:43.930
But the gift is good inthose in whom it is acute,

926
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:46.300
and I am thankful for it.

927
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:50.800
Sir, I praise the Lord for you;and so may my parishioners;

928
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.500
for their sons arewell tutored by you,

929
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.100
and their daughters profitvery greatly under you:

930
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.570
you are a good memberof the commonwealth.

931
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.170
Mehercle, if theirsons be ingenuous,

932
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:05.430
they shall want no instruction;if their daughters be capable,

933
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:10.930
I will put it to them: but virsapit qui pauca loquitur;

934
00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:16.830
Good master Parson, be sogood as read me this letter:

935
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.270
it was given me by Costard,and sent me from Don Armado:

936
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.230
I beseech you, read it.

937
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:29.030
Fauste, precor gelida quandopecus omne sub umbra

938
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:34.070
Ruminat,--and so forth.Ah, good old Mantuan!

939
00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.300
I may speak of thee as thetraveller doth of Venice;

940
00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.300
Venetia, Venetia,

941
00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.970
Chi non ti vede non tipretia.

942
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.630
Old Mantuan, old Mantuan!who understandeth thee not,

943
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:51.870
loves thee not. Ut,re, sol, la, mi, fa.

944
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.130
Under pardon, sir, whatare the contents?

945
00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.930
or rather, as Horace says inhis--What, my soul, verses?

946
00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:00.200
Ay, sir, and very learned.

947
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:06.630
Let me hear a staff, a stanze,a verse; lege, domine.

948
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:11.070
If knowledge be the mark,to know thee shall suffice;

949
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:15.500
Well learned is that tonguethat well can thee commend,

950
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:22.400
All ignorant that soul thatsees thee without wonder;

951
00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.070
Which is to me some praisethat I thy parts admire:

952
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.570
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears,thy voice his dreadful thunder,

953
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:35.530
Which not to anger bent,is music and sweet fire.

954
00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:39.630
Celestial as thou art, O,pardon, love, this wrong,

955
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:43.200
That sings heaven's praisewith such an earthly tongue.

956
00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.400
You do not find the apostraphas,and so miss the accent:

957
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.630
let me supervise the canzonet.

958
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:56.170
Here are only numbers ratified;but, for the elegancy,

959
00:50:56.170 --> 00:51:00.730
facility, and goldencadence of poesy, caret.

960
00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:09.530
Ovidius Naso was the man:and why, indeed, Naso,

961
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:10.630
Don't know.

962
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.930
For smelling out theodouriferous flowers of fancy,

963
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:19.070
the jerks of invention?Imitari is nothing:

964
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:22.330
so doth the hound hismaster, the ape his keeper,

965
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.500
the tired horse his rider.But, damosella virgin,

966
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.500
was this directed to you?

967
00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:28.830
Ay, sir.

968
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:30.870
I will overglancethe superscript:

969
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:37.030
'To the snow-white hand of themost beauteous Lady Rosaline.'

970
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.970
I will look again on theintellect of the letter,

971
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.370
for the nomination ofthe party writing

972
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:43.700
to the person written unto:

973
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.270
'Your ladyship's in alldesired employment, .'

974
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.170
Biron.

975
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:51.100
Ohhh

976
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.730
Sir Nathaniel, this Biron is oneof the votaries with the king;

977
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:56.400
and here he hathframed a letter

978
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.600
to a sequent of thestranger queen's,

979
00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.900
which accidentally, or bythe way of progression,

980
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:04.570
hath miscarried. Tripand go, my sweet;

981
00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.330
deliver this paper into theroyal hand of the king:

982
00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:09.970
it may concern much. Staynot thy compliment;

983
00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:11.730
I forgive thy duty; adieu.

984
00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:16.370
Sir, you have done this in thefear of God, very religiously;

985
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.870
and, as a certainfather saith,--

986
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:18.700
Sir tell me not of thefather;

987
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.730
But to return to theverses:

988
00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:24.030
Sir Nathaniel. Did they pleaseyou?

989
00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:26.170
Marvellous well for thepen.

990
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:30.370
I do dine to-day at the father'sof a certain pupil of mine;

991
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.070
where, if, beforerepast, it shall please

992
00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.870
you to gratify thetable with a grace,

993
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.130
I will undertake,

994
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:39.900
on my privilege I have with theparents of the foresaid child

995
00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.500
or pupil, your ben venuto;

996
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.870
where I will show thoseverses to be very unlearned,

997
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:50.630
savouring neither of poetry,wit, nor invention:

998
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.600
I beseech your society.

999
00:52:54.270 --> 00:53:00.500
And thank you too; forsociety, saith the text,

1000
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.270
is the happiness of life.

1001
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:10.500


1002
00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:18.170
I will not love:

1003
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:24.700
if I do, hang me; i' faith,I will not. O, but her eye,

1004
00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:28.430
--by this light, but for hereye, I would not love her;

1005
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:33.900
yes, for her two eyes.Well, I do nothing

1006
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:37.530
in the world but lie,and lie in my throat.

1007
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:42.570
By heaven, I do love: andit hath taught me to rhyme

1008
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.670
and to be melancholy; andhere is part of my rhyme,

1009
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.430
and here my melancholy.Here comes one with a paper:

1010
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.270
Ay me!

1011
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:58.900
Shot, by heaven!

1012
00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.330
So sweet a kiss the golden sun

1013
00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:05.200
gives not to those freshmorning drops upon the rose,

1014
00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:09.030
As thy eye-beams, whentheir fresh rays have smote

1015
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:14.670
The night of dew that onmy cheeks down flows:

1016
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:18.130
Nor shines the silver moonone half so bright

1017
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:20.030
Through the transparentbosom of the deep,

1018
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:25.330
As doth thy face throughtears of mine give light;

1019
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:30.570
What, Longaville! andreading! listen, ear.

1020
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:33.470
Now, in thy likeness, onemore fool appear!

1021
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.000
Ay me, I am forsworn!

1022
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.900
In love, I hope: sweetfellowship in shame!

1023
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:43.530
O sweet Maria, empress ofmy love!

1024
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.230
Did not the heavenlyrhetoric of thine eye,

1025
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.400
'Gainst whom the worldcannot hold argument,

1026
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.530
Persuade my heart to thisfalse perjury?

1027
00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:07.430
Vows for thee brokedeserve not punishment.

1028
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.600
A woman I forswore; but Iwill prove,

1029
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:20.970
Thou being a goddess, Iforswore not thee:

1030
00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:24.270
My vow was earthly, thou aheavenly love;

1031
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:29.670
Thy grace being gain'dcures all disgrace in me.

1032
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:33.900
Vows are but breath, andbreath a vapour is:

1033
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.030
Then thou, fair sun, whichon my earth dost shine,

1034
00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:40.570
Exhalest this vapour-vow;in thee it is:

1035
00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:45.700
If broken then, it is nofault of mine:

1036
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:49.670
If by me broke, what foolis not so wise

1037
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:55.100
To lose an oath to win aparadise?

1038
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:58.330
This is the liver-vein,which makes flesh a deity,

1039
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:02.970
A green goose a goddess:pure, pure idolatry.

1040
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:10.270
By whom shall I sendthis?--Company! stay.

1041
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.670
All hid, all hid; an oldinfant play.

1042
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:16.530
O most divine Kate!

1043
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.600
O most profane coxcomb!

1044
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.470
O that I had my wish!

1045
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:21.470
And I had mine!

1046
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:24.030
And I mine too, good Lord!

1047
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:26.300
Amen, so I had mine: isnot that a good word?

1048
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.870
Like a fever shereigns in my blood

1049
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:32.130
and will remember'd be.

1050
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:36.400
Once more I'll read theode that I have writ.

1051
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:42.630
Once more I'll mark howlove can vary wit.

1052
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.570
On a day--alack the day!--

1053
00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:46.700
Love, whose month is everMay,

1054
00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.970
Spied a blossom passingfair

1055
00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:51.770
Playing in the wanton air:

1056
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:54.430
Through the velvet leavesthe wind,

1057
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:57.030
All unseen, can passagefind;

1058
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.830
That the lover, sick todeath,

1059
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:02.170
Wish himself the heaven'sbreath.

1060
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:05.830
Air, quoth he, thy cheeksmay blow;

1061
00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:09.300
Air, would I might triumphso!

1062
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.900
But, alack, my hand issworn

1063
00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:14.230
Ne'er to pluck thee fromthy thorn;

1064
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:16.730
Vow, alack, for youthunmeet,

1065
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:20.270
Youth so apt to pluck asweet!

1066
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:22.730
Do not call it sin in me,

1067
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:24.800
That I am forsworn forthee;

1068
00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.470
Thou for whom Jove wouldswear

1069
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:30.770
Juno but an Ethiope were;

1070
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:33.900
And deny himself for Jove,

1071
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:39.030
Turning mortal for thylove.

1072
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:44.670
This will I send, andsomething else more plain,

1073
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:48.930
That shall express my truelove's fasting pain.

1074
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:51.730
O, would the king, Biron,and Longaville,

1075
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:55.170
Were lovers too! Ill, toexample ill,

1076
00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:58.900
Would from my foreheadwipe a perjured note;

1077
00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:02.530
For none offend where allalike do dote.

1078
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.930
Dumain, thy love isfar from charity

1079
00:58:06.930 --> 00:58:10.600
that in love's griefdesires a society.

1080
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.870
You may look pale, but Ishould blush, I know,

1081
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:16.700
To be o'erheard andtaken napping so.

1082
00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:23.800
You blush; ashis your case is such;

1083
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.430
You chide at him,offending twice as much;

1084
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:30.030
You do not love Maria;Longaville

1085
00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.970
Did never sonnet for hersake compile,

1086
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:33.870
Nor never lay his wreathedarms athwart

1087
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.670
His loving bosom to keepdown his heart.

1088
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:40.000
I have been closelyshrouded in this book

1089
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.630
And mark'd you both andfor you both did look:

1090
00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:52.030
I heard your guilty rhymes,noted well your fashion,

1091
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:56.400
Saw sighs reek from you,observed your passion:

1092
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.900
Ay me! says one; O Jove!the other cries;

1093
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:05.800
One, her hairs were gold,crystal the other's eyes:

1094
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.130
You would for paradisebreak faith, and troth;

1095
00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:13.000
And Jove, for your love,would infringe an oath.

1096
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.400
What will Biron say whenthat he shall hear

1097
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.800
Faith so infringed, whichsuch zeal did swear?

1098
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.500
How will he scorn! howwill he spend his wit!

1099
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:24.230
How will he triumph, leapand laugh at it!

1100
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:26.330
For all the wealth thatever I did see,

1101
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.070
I would not have him knowso much by me.

1102
00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.830
Now step I forth to whiphypocrisy.

1103
00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:35.400
Ah, good my liege, I praythee, pardon me!

1104
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:38.170
Good heart, what gracehast thou, thus to reprove

1105
00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:43.600
These worms for loving,that art most in love?

1106
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:46.600
Your eyes do make nocoaches; in your tears

1107
00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.330
There is no certainprincess that appears;

1108
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:50.500
You'll not be perjured,'tis a hateful thing;

1109
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.700
Tush, none but minstrelslike of sonneting!

1110
00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.500
But are you not ashamed?nay, are you not,

1111
00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.670
All three of you, to bethus much o'ershot?

1112
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:04.200
You found his mote; theking your mote did see;

1113
01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.330
But I a beam do find ineach of three.

1114
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.770
O, what a scene of fooleryhave I seen,

1115
01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:13.870
Of sighs, of groans, ofsorrow and of teen!

1116
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:17.030
O me, with what strictpatience have I sat,

1117
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.470
To see a king transformedto a gnat!

1118
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:23.130
To see great Herculeswhipping a gig,

1119
01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:24.930
And profound Solomon totune a jig,

1120
01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.470
And Nestor play atpush-pin with the boys,

1121
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:29.330
And critic Timon laugh atidle toys!

1122
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.930
Where lies thy grief, O,tell me, good Dumain?

1123
01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.200
And gentle Longaville,where lies thy pain?

1124
01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.600
And where my liege's? allabout the breast:

1125
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.030
A caudle, ho!

1126
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.030
Too bitter is thy jest.

1127
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:42.570
Are we betray'd thus tothy over-view?

1128
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:47.500
Not you to me, but Ibetray'd by you:

1129
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:53.270
I, that am honest; I, thathold it sin

1130
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:55.400
To break the vow I amengaged in;

1131
01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.100
I am betray'd, by keepingcompany

1132
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:04.630
With moon like men, men ofinconstancy.

1133
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:07.130
When shall you see mewrite a thing in rhyme?

1134
01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.570
Or groan for Joan? orspend a minute's time

1135
01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:12.600
In pruning me? When shallyou hear that I

1136
01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.500
Will praise a hand, afoot, a face, an eye,

1137
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.430
A gait, a state, a brow, abreast, a waist,

1138
01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:18.630
A leg, a limb?

1139
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.070
Soft! whither away sofast?

1140
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.800
A true man or a thief thatgallops so?

1141
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.900
I post from love: goodlover, let me go.

1142
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.100
God bless the king!

1143
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.370
What present hast thouthere?

1144
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.300
Some certain treason.

1145
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.700
What makes treason here?

1146
01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.970
I beseech your grace, letthis letter be read:

1147
01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:40.230
Our parson misdoubts it;'twas treason, he said.

1148
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.200
Biron, read it over.

1149
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.600
Where hadst thou it?

1150
01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.470
Of Costard.

1151
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:50.030
How now! what is in you?why dost thou tear it?

1152
01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:52.170
A toy, my liege, a toy: yourgrace needs not fear it.

1153
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.600
It did move him to passion,and therefore let's hear it.

1154
01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.230
It is Biron's writing,and here is his name.

1155
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:59.470
Ah, you whoreson loggerhead!

1156
01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:02.330
you were born to do me shame.

1157
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:07.900
Guilty, my leige, guilty! Iconfess, I confess.

1158
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.130
What?

1159
01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:11.930
That you three fools lack'dme fool to make up the mess:

1160
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:15.900
He, he, and you, and you,my liege, and I,

1161
01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.070
Are pick-purses in love,and we deserve to die.

1162
01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:22.230
O, dismiss this audience,and I shall tell you more.

1163
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.570
Now the number is even.

1164
01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:24.770
True, true; we are four.

1165
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.800
Will these turtles begone?

1166
01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.470
Hence, sirs; away!

1167
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:35.400
Walk aside the true folk,and let the traitors stay.

1168
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:51.930
Sweet lords, sweet lovers,O, let us embrace!

1169
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:54.830
As true we are as fleshand blood can be:

1170
01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:57.600
The sea will ebb and flow,heaven show his face;

1171
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.770
Young blood can not obeyan old decree:

1172
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:03.500
What, did these rent linesshow some love of thine?

1173
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.900
Did they, quoth you? Whosees the heavenly Rosaline,

1174
01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.330
That, like a rude andsavage man of Inde,

1175
01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:12.430
At the first opening ofthe gorgeous east,

1176
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:14.800
Bows not his vassal headand strucken blind

1177
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:18.470
Kisses the base groundwith obedient breast?

1178
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.270
What peremptoryeagle-sighted eye

1179
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:22.830
Dares look upon the heavenof her brow,

1180
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.970
That is not blinded by hermajesty?

1181
01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:27.230
What zeal, what fury hathinspired thee now?

1182
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:29.370
My love, her mistress, isa gracious moon;

1183
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.670
She an attending star,scarce seen a light.

1184
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:33.330
My eyes are then no eyes,nor I Biron:

1185
01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:36.370
O, but for my love, daywould turn to night!

1186
01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:38.830
O, 'tis the sun thatmaketh all things shine.

1187
01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:40.600
By heaven, thy love isblack as ebony.

1188
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.170
Is ebony like her? O wooddivine!

1189
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:45.500
A wife of such wood werefelicity.

1190
01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.670
O, who can give an oath?where is a book?

1191
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:50.330
That I may swear beautydoth beauty lack,

1192
01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:52.800
If that she learn not ofher eye to look:

1193
01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.830
No face is fair that isnot full so black.

1194
01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:58.170
O paradox! Black is thebadge of hell,

1195
01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:00.270
The hue of dungeons andthe school of night;

1196
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.800
And beauty's crest becomesthe heavens well.

1197
01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.800
To look like her arechimney-sweepers black.

1198
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.730
And since her time arecolliers counted bright.

1199
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:10.430
And Ethiopes of theirsweet complexion crack.

1200
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.970
Dark needs no candles now,for dark is light.

1201
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:16.030
Your mistresses dare nevercome in rain,

1202
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:17.270
For fear their coloursshould be wash'd away.

1203
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:20.300
'Twere good, yours did; for,sir, to tell you plain,

1204
01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.100
I'll find a fairer facenot wash'd to-day.

1205
01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.430
I'll prove her fair, ortalk till doomsday here.

1206
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:27.070
No devil will fright theethen so much as she.

1207
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:30.270
I never knew man hold vilestuff so dear.

1208
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:34.700
Look, here's thy love: myfoot and her face see.

1209
01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.100
O, if the streets werepaved with thine eyes,

1210
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.330
Her feet were much toodainty for such tread!

1211
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:43.200
O, vile! then, as shegoes, what upward lies

1212
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:47.300
The street should see asshe walk'd overhead.

1213
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:52.870
But what of this? are wenot all in love?

1214
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:58.070
Nothing so sure; andtherefore all forsworn.

1215
01:04:58.070 --> 01:05:01.000
Then leave this chat; and,good Biron, now prove

1216
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.800
Our loving lawful, and ourfaith not torn.

1217
01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.630
Ay, marry, there; someflattery for this evil.

1218
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:09.870
O, some authority how toproceed;

1219
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.870
Some tricks, some quillets,how to cheat the devil.

1220
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.700
Some salve for perjury.

1221
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.400
'Tis more than need.

1222
01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.100
Have at you, then,affection's men at arms.

1223
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:30.770
Consider what you firstdid swear unto,

1224
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:34.330
To fast, to study, and tosee no woman;

1225
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:36.770
Flat treason 'gainst thekingly state of youth.

1226
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:40.370
Say, can you fast? yourstomachs are too young;

1227
01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:43.400
And abstinence engendersmaladies.

1228
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.870
O, we have made a vow to study,lords,

1229
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:47.970
And in that vow we haveforsworn our books.

1230
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.330
For when would you, myliege, or you, or you,

1231
01:05:50.330 --> 01:05:52.600
In leaden contemplationhave found out

1232
01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.870
Such fiery numbers as theprompting eyes

1233
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:58.230
Of beauty's tutors haveenrich'd you with?

1234
01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:01.470
Other slow arts entirelykeep the brain;

1235
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:03.800
And therefore, findingbarren practisers,

1236
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.770
Scarce show a harvest oftheir heavy toil:

1237
01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:09.470
But love, first learned ina lady's eyes,

1238
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:14.200
Lives not alone immured inthe brain;

1239
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:16.030
But, with the motion ofall elements,

1240
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:18.670
Courses as swift asthought in every power,

1241
01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:20.800
And gives to every power adouble power,

1242
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.530
Above their functions andhis offices.

1243
01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:26.570
It adds a precious seeingto the eye;

1244
01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:29.430
A lover's eyes will gazean eagle blind;

1245
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:33.130
A lover's ear will hearthe lowest sound,

1246
01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:35.200
When the suspicious headof theft is stopp'd:

1247
01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.470
Love's feeling is moresoft and sensible

1248
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:41.800
Than are the tender hornsof cockl'd snails;

1249
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:46.630
Love's tongue proves daintyBacchus gross in taste:

1250
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.370
For valour, is not Love aHercules,

1251
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:51.700
Still climbing trees inthe Hesperides?

1252
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.230
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweetand musical

1253
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:58.930
As bright Apollo's lute,strung with his hair:

1254
01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:03.430
And when Love speaks, thevoice of all the gods

1255
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:09.270
Makes heaven drowsy withthe harmony.

1256
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.970
Never durst poet touch apen to write

1257
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:13.670
Until his ink were temper'dwith Love's sighs;

1258
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:17.700
O, then his lines wouldravish savage ears

1259
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.370
And plant in tyrants mildhumility.

1260
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.970
From women's eyes thisdoctrine I derive:

1261
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:28.070
They sparkle still theright Promethean fire;

1262
01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:30.570
They are the books, thearts, the academes,

1263
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:34.270
That show, contain andnourish all the world:

1264
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:39.900
Else none at all in oughtproves excellent.

1265
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:41.770
Then fools you were thesewomen to forswear,

1266
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:46.270
Or keeping what is sworn,you will prove fools.

1267
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:49.300
For wisdom's sake, a wordthat all men love,

1268
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.970
Or for love's sake, a wordthat loves all men,

1269
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.070
Or for men's sake, theauthors of these women,

1270
01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:57.970
Or women's sake, by whomwe men are men,

1271
01:07:57.970 --> 01:08:05.430
Let us once lose our oathsto find ourselves,

1272
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:10.600
Or else we lose ourselvesto keep our oaths.

1273
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.670
It is religion to be thusforsworn,

1274
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:17.270
For charity itselffulfills the law,

1275
01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:21.130
And who can sever lovefrom charity?

1276
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:29.330
Saint Cupid, then! and,soldiers, to the field!

1277
01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:30.900
Advance your standards,and upon them, lords;

1278
01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.770
Pell-mell, down with them!but be first advised,

1279
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:35.170
In conflict that you getthe sun of them.

1280
01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:37.300
Now to plain-dealing; laythese glozes by:

1281
01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.770
Shall we resolve to woothese girls of France?

1282
01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:43.430
And win them too:therefore let us devise

1283
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.670
Some entertainment forthem in their tents.

1284
01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:47.570
First, from the park letus conduct them thither;

1285
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:49.130
Then homeward every manattach the hand

1286
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:52.170
Of his fair mistress: inthe afternoon

1287
01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:56.030
We will with some strangepastime solace them,

1288
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:59.370
Such as the shortness ofthe time can shape;

1289
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:02.330
For revels, dances, masksand merry hours

1290
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:08.400
Forerun fair Love, strewingher way with flowers.

1291
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.530
Satis quod sufficit.

1292
01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:16.430
I praise God for you, sir:your reasons at dinner

1293
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:20.100
have been sharpand sententious;

1294
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:24.600
pleasant without scurrility,witty without affection,

1295
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.670
audacious without impudency,learned without opinion,

1296
01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:34.170
and strange with- out heresy.

1297
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:37.030
I did converse this quondam day

1298
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:41.470
with a companion of the king's,who is intituled, nominated,

1299
01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:45.670
or called, DonAdriano de Armado.

1300
01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:51.570
Novi hominem tanquam te:his humour is lofty,

1301
01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:55.130
his discourse peremptory,his tongue filed,

1302
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:58.270
his eye ambitious,his gait majestical,

1303
01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:02.130
and his general behavior vain,ridiculous, and thrasonical.

1304
01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:05.900
He is too picked, too spruce,too affected, too odd,

1305
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.170
as it were, too peregrinate,as I may say.

1306
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:13.570
A most singular and choiceepithet.

1307
01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:17.930
He draweth out the threadof his verbosity finer

1308
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:21.700
than the stapleof his argument.

1309
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:25.670
I abhor such fanaticalphantasimes, such insociable

1310
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:29.330
and point-devise companions;such rackers of orthography,

1311
01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:33.430
as to speak dout, fine,when he should say doubt;

1312
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:37.570
det, when he shouldpronounce debt,

1313
01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:42.000
--d, e, b, t, not d, e, t:he clepeth a calf, cauf;

1314
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.570
(laughing throughout speech)

1315
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:54.470
half, hauf; neighbour vocaturnebor; neigh abbreviated ne.

1316
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:58.330
This is abhominable, --whichhe would call abbominable:

1317
01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:01.200
it insinuateth me of insanie:

1318
01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.400
anne intelligis, domine?to make frantic, lunatic.

1319
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.700
Laus Deo, bene intelligo.

1320
01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:14.030
Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! alittle scratch'd, 'twill serve.

1321
01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:20.330
Videsne quis venit?

1322
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.530
Video, et gaudeo.

1323
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:25.770
Men of peace, wellencountered.

1324
01:11:25.770 --> 01:11:28.230
Most military sir,salutation.

1325
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.530
Sir, it is the king'smost sweet pleasure

1326
01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:32.770
and affection to congratulatethe princess at her

1327
01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:36.130
pavilion in theposteriors of this day,

1328
01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:38.300
which the rude multitudecall the afternoon.

1329
01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.170
The posterior of theday, most generous sir,

1330
01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:45.030
is liable, congruent andmeasurable for the afternoon:

1331
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:47.300
the word is well chosen,culled, sweet and apt,

1332
01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.470
I do assure you,sir, I do assure.

1333
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:54.330
Sir, the king is a noblegentleman, and my familiar,

1334
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.570
I do assure ye,very good friend:

1335
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:59.670
for what is inward between us,let it pass.

1336
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:02.370
But I must tell thee, itwill please his grace,

1337
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:07.700
by the world, sometime tolean upon my poor shoulder,

1338
01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:13.370
and with his royal finger,thus, dally with my excrement,

1339
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:19.030
with my mustachio; but,sweet heart, let that pass.

1340
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:21.370
By the world, Irecount no fable:

1341
01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:25.070
some certain special honoursit pleaseth his greatness

1342
01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:33.300
to impart to Armado, asoldier, a man of travel,

1343
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:38.830
that hath seen the world;but let that pass.

1344
01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:41.600
The very all of allis,--but, sweet heart,

1345
01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.700
I do implore secrecy,--thatthe king would have me

1346
01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:47.870
present the princess,sweet chuck,

1347
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:52.030
with some delightfulostentation, or show,

1348
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:57.770
or pageant, orantique, or firework.

1349
01:12:57.770 --> 01:13:00.700
Now, understanding that thecurate and your sweet self

1350
01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:03.770
are good at such eruptions andsudden breaking out of mirth,

1351
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:08.300
as it were, I have acquaintedyou to the end withal,

1352
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.870
to craveyour assistance.

1353
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.970
They have been at a greatfeast of languages,

1354
01:13:18.970 --> 01:13:20.100
and stolen the scraps.

1355
01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.530
O, they have lived long onthe alms-basket of words.

1356
01:13:23.530 --> 01:13:26.700
I marvel thy master hathnot eaten thee for a word;

1357
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:32.770
Sir, you shall present beforeher the Nine Worthies.

1358
01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:35.600
Sir Nathaniel, as concerningsome entertainment of time,

1359
01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.430
some show in the posteriorof this day, to be rendered

1360
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:42.700
by our assistants, atthe king's command,

1361
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.300
and this mostgallant, illustrate,

1362
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:48.300
and learned gentleman,before the princess;

1363
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.870
I say none so fit as topresent the Nine Worthies.

1364
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.370
Where will you find men worthyenough to present them?

1365
01:13:56.370 --> 01:14:01.630
Joshua, yourself;myself, Alexander,

1366
01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:04.700
this gallant gentleman,Judas Maccabaeus;

1367
01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.530
the swain, by reason ofhis great limb or joint,

1368
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.370
shall pass Pompey the Great;

1369
01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:10.730
the page, Hercules,--

1370
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:13.530
Pardon, sir; error: heis not quantity

1371
01:14:13.530 --> 01:14:15.600
for that Worthy's thumb:

1372
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.370
he is not so big asthe end of his club.

1373
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:22.100
Shall I have audience? he shallpresent Hercules in minority:

1374
01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.230
his enter and exit shallbe strangling a snake;

1375
01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:27.270
and I will have an prologueto their purpose.

1376
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:29.970
An excellent device! so, ifany of the audience hiss,

1377
01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:32.000
you may cry 'Welldone, Hercules!

1378
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.170
now thou crushest the snake!'

1379
01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:37.500
For the rest of the Worthies?--

1380
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.870
I will play three myself.

1381
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:42.170
Thrice-worthy gentleman!

1382
01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:43.930
Shall I tell you a thing?

1383
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.130
We attend.

1384
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:51.830
We will have, if thisfadge not, an antique.

1385
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:53.470
I beseech you, follow.

1386
01:14:57.470 --> 01:15:01.270
Via, goodman Dull! thou hastspoken no word all this time.

1387
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:03.870
Nor understood noneneither, sir.

1388
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:07.830
Allons! we will employthee.

1389
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:10.930
I'll make one in a dance,or so; or I will play

1390
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:14.800
On the tabour to the Worthies,and let them dance the hay.

1391
01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.070
Most dull, honest Dull! Toour sport, away!

1392
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:26.170


1393
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:32.200
Sweet hearts, we shall berich ere we depart,

1394
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.230
If fairings come thusplentifully in:

1395
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:38.270
A lady wall'd about withdiamonds!

1396
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:40.830
Look you what I have fromthe loving king.

1397
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.300
Madame, came nothing elsealong with that?

1398
01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:48.200
Nothing but this! yes, asmuch love in rhyme

1399
01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.930
As would be cramm'd up ina sheet of paper,

1400
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:52.830
Writ o' both sides theleaf, margent and all,

1401
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:55.570
That he was fain to sealon Cupid's name.

1402
01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:59.230
That was the way to makehis godhead wax,

1403
01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:01.330
For he hath been fivethousand years a boy.

1404
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:04.130
Ay, and a shrewd unhappygallows too.

1405
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:06.530
You'll ne'er be friends withhim; a' kill'd your sister.

1406
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:08.630
He made her melancholy,sad, and heavy;

1407
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:11.030
And so she died: had shebeen light, like you,

1408
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:13.730
Of such a merry, nimble,stirring spirit,

1409
01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:16.170
She might ha' been agrandam ere she died:

1410
01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:19.570
And so may you; for alight heart lives long.

1411
01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:22.300
What's your dark meaning,mouse, of this light word?

1412
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.170
A light condition in abeauty dark.

1413
01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:26.100
We need more light to findyour meaning out.

1414
01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.170
You'll mar the light bytaking it in snuff;

1415
01:16:28.170 --> 01:16:30.100
Therefore I'll darkly endthe argument.

1416
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:31.430
See what you do, you doit still i' the dark.

1417
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:33.130
So do not you, for you area light wench.

1418
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.670
I weigh not you,and therefore light.

1419
01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:36.500
You weigh me not? O, that'syou care not for me.

1420
01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.300
Great reason; for 'pastcure is still past care.'

1421
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.070
Well bandied both; a setof wit well play'd.

1422
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:45.970
But Rosaline, you have afavour too:

1423
01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:48.000
Who sent it? and what isit?

1424
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.470
I would you knew:

1425
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:51.100
An if my face were but asfair as yours,

1426
01:16:51.100 --> 01:16:54.530
My favour were as great;be witness this.

1427
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:57.700
Nay, I have verses too, Ithank Biron:

1428
01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.530
The numbers true; and,were the numbering too,

1429
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:01.730
I were the fairest goddesson the ground:

1430
01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:05.600
I am compared to twentythousand fairs.

1431
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.000
O, he hath drawn mypicture in his letter!

1432
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.030
Any thing like?

1433
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:12.800
Much in the letters;nothing in the praise.

1434
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.870
Beauteous as ink; a goodconclusion.

1435
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:18.170
But, Katharine, what was sentto you from fair Dumain?

1436
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:20.830
Madam, this glove.

1437
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:22.370
Did he not send you twain?

1438
01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:25.170
Yes, madam, and moreover

1439
01:17:25.170 --> 01:17:27.300
Some thousand verses of afaithful lover,

1440
01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.900
A huge translation ofhypocrisy,

1441
01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:31.330
Vilely compiled, profoundsimplicity.

1442
01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:34.630
This and these pearls tome sent Longaville:

1443
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:38.570
The letter is too long byhalf a mile.

1444
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:40.730
I think no less. Dost thounot wish in heart

1445
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:42.900
The chain were longer andthe letter short?

1446
01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:46.370
Ay, or I would these handsmight never part.

1447
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:49.830
We are wise girls to mockour lovers so.

1448
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:53.700
They are worse fools topurchase mocking so.

1449
01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.530
That same Biron I'lltorture ere I go:

1450
01:17:58.530 --> 01:18:02.170
O that I knew he were butin by the week!

1451
01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:05.600
How I would make him fawnand beg and seek

1452
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.600
And wait the season andobserve the times

1453
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.430
And spend his prodigalwits in bootless rhymes

1454
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.000
And shape his servicewholly to my hests

1455
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.330
And make him proud to makeme proud that jests!

1456
01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:23.900
So perttaunt-like would Io'ersway his state

1457
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:27.570
That he should be my fooland I his fate.

1458
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.470
None are so surely caught,when they are catch'd,

1459
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:32.230
As wit turn'd fool: folly,in wisdom hatch'd,

1460
01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:35.070
Hath wisdom's warrant andthe help of school

1461
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:37.430
And wit's own grace tograce a learned fool.

1462
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:39.430
The blood of youth burnsnot with such excess

1463
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:41.630
As gravity's revolt towantonness.

1464
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:45.270
O, I am stabb'd withlaughter! Where's her grace?

1465
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:46.770
Thy news Boyet?

1466
01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.100
Prepare, madam, prepare!

1467
01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:51.070
Arm, wenches, arm!encounters mounted are

1468
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:54.200
Against your peace: Lovedoth approach disguised,

1469
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:57.030
Armed in arguments; you'llbe surprised:

1470
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.600
Muster your wits; stand inyour own defence;

1471
01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.000
Or hide your heads likecowards, and fly hence.

1472
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.670
Saint Denis to SaintCupid! What are they

1473
01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:08.500
That charge their breathagainst us? say, scout, say.

1474
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.830
Under the cool shade of asycamore

1475
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:11.730
I thought to close mineeyes some half an hour;

1476
01:19:11.730 --> 01:19:14.400
When, lo! to interrupt mypurposed rest,

1477
01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:16.170
Toward that shade I mightbehold addrest

1478
01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:19.730
The king and his companions:

1479
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:22.830
warily I stole into aneighbour thicket by,

1480
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:25.900
And overheard what youshall overhear,

1481
01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.900
That, by and by, disguisedthey will be here.

1482
01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.500
But what, but what, comethey to visit us?

1483
01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.570
They do, they do: and areapparell'd thus.

1484
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:36.900
Like Muscovites orRussians, as I guess.

1485
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:41.130
Their purpose is to parle,to court and dance;

1486
01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.800
And every one hislove-feat will advance

1487
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.130
Unto his several mistress,which they'll know

1488
01:19:45.130 --> 01:19:47.070
By favours several whichthey did bestow.

1489
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:52.170
And will they so? thegallants shall be task'd;

1490
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:54.670
For, ladies, we shallevery one be mask'd;

1491
01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:56.400
And not a man of themshall have the grace,

1492
01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.600
Despite of suit, to see alady's face.

1493
01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:04.600
Hold, Rosaline, thisfavour thou shalt wear,

1494
01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.730
And then the king willcourt thee for his dear;

1495
01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:10.930
Hold, take thou this, mysweet, and give me thine,

1496
01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:14.830
So shall Biron take me forRosaline.

1497
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:16.730
And change your favourstoo; so shall your loves

1498
01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:20.330
Woo contrary, deceived bythese removes.

1499
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:23.730
Come on, then; wear thefavours most in sight.

1500
01:20:23.730 --> 01:20:25.900
But in this changing whatis your intent?

1501
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.830
The effect of my intent isto cross theirs:

1502
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:31.230
They do it but in mockingmerriment;

1503
01:20:31.230 --> 01:20:33.500
And mock for mock is onlymy intent.

1504
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.630
Their several counselsthey unbosom shall

1505
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:38.170
To loves mistook, and sobe mock'd withal

1506
01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:39.900
Upon the next occasionthat we meet,

1507
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.770
With visages displayed, totalk and greet.

1508
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:44.730
But shall we dance, ifthey desire to't?

1509
01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:48.300
No, to the death, we willnot move a foot;

1510
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:50.800
Nor to their penn'd speechrender we no grace,

1511
01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.970
But while 'tis spoke eachturn away her face.

1512
01:20:54.970 --> 01:20:57.430
Why, that contempt willkill the speaker's heart,

1513
01:20:57.430 --> 01:21:00.570
And quite divorce hismemory from his part.

1514
01:21:00.570 --> 01:21:03.930
Therefore I do it; and Imake no doubt

1515
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:07.170
The rest will ne'er comein, if he be out

1516
01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:10.470
There's no such sport assport by sport o'erthrown,

1517
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:14.430
To make theirs ours andours none but our own:

1518
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:16.870
So shall we stay, mockingintended game,

1519
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:19.570
And they, well mock'd,depart away with shame.

1520
01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:21.930
(♪ trumpet)

1521
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:26.530
The trumpet sounds: bemask'd; the maskers come.

1522
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:34.500
All hail, the richestbeauties on the earth!--

1523
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.730
A holy parcel of thefairest dames.

1524
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:43.330
That ever turn'dtheir--backs--to mortal views!

1525
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:45.200
Their eyes, villain, theireyes!

1526
01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.300
That ever turn'd their eyeson mortal views! --Out--

1527
01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.330
True; out indeed.

1528
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:55.970
Boyet: What would thesestrangers? know their minds,

1529
01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:58.300
If they do speak ourlanguage, 'tis our will:

1530
01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.770
That some plain manrecount their purposes

1531
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:02.830
Know what they would.

1532
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:04.430
What would you with theprincess?

1533
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:07.530
Nothing but peace andgentle visitation.

1534
01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:09.370
What would they, say they?

1535
01:22:09.370 --> 01:22:11.830
Nothing but peace andgentle visitation.

1536
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:14.370
Why, that they have; andbid them so be gone.

1537
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:16.130
She says, you have it, andyou may be gone.

1538
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:18.670
Say to her, we havemeasured many miles

1539
01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:22.230
To tread a measure withher on this grass.

1540
01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:25.170
They say, that they havemeasured many a mile

1541
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.900
To tread a measure withyou on this grass.

1542
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:31.030
It is not so. Ask them howmany inches

1543
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:33.900
Is in one mile: if theyhave measured many,

1544
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:37.170
The measure then of one iseasily told.

1545
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.970
If to come hither you havemeasured miles,

1546
01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:41.800
And many miles, theprincess bids you tell

1547
01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.600
How many inches doth fillup one mile.

1548
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:48.500
Tell her, we measure themby weary steps.

1549
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:50.230
She hears herself.

1550
01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:51.830
How many weary steps,

1551
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:54.270
Of many weary miles youhave o'ergone,

1552
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:56.670
Are number'd in the travelof one mile?

1553
01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:59.330
We number nothing that wespend for you:

1554
01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:02.030
Our duty is so rich, soinfinite,

1555
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:04.170
That we may do it stillwithout accompt.

1556
01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:07.300
Vouchsafe to show thesunshine of your face,

1557
01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.100
That we, like savages, mayworship it.

1558
01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.970
My face is but a moon, andclouded too.

1559
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:19.000
Blessed are clouds, to doas such clouds do!

1560
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.200
Vouchsafe, bright moon, andthese thy stars, to shine,

1561
01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.800
Those clouds removed, uponour watery eyne.

1562
01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:31.500
O vain petitioner! beg agreater matter;

1563
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.430
Thou now request'st butmoonshine in the water.

1564
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:38.700
Then, in our measure dobut vouchsafe one change.

1565
01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:42.700
Thou bid'st me beg: thisbegging is not strange.

1566
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:46.800
Play, music, then! Nay,you must do it soon.

1567
01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:51.900
Not yet! no dance! Thuschange I like the moon.

1568
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:55.430
Will you not dance? Howcome you thus estranged?

1569
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:59.670
You took the moon at full,but now she's changed.

1570
01:23:59.670 --> 01:24:06.000
Yet still she is the moon,and I the man.

1571
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:12.900
The music plays; vouchsafesome motion to it.

1572
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.900
Our ears vouchsafe it.

1573
01:24:14.900 --> 01:24:18.100
But your legs should doit.

1574
01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:20.930
Since you are strangersand come here by chance,

1575
01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:23.630
We'll not be nice:

1576
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:31.970
Take hands.

1577
01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:38.930
We will not dance.

1578
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:44.000
If you deny to dance,let's hold more chat.

1579
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.300
In private, then.

1580
01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:54.470
I am best pleased withthat.

1581
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:57.970
White-handed mistress, onesweet word with thee.

1582
01:24:57.970 --> 01:25:01.300
Honey, and milk, andsugar; there is three.

1583
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:03.630
Nay then, two treys, andif you grow so nice,

1584
01:25:03.630 --> 01:25:06.330
Metheglin, wort, andmalmsey: well run, dice!

1585
01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:08.130
There's half-a-dozensweets.

1586
01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:09.300
Seventh sweet, adieu:

1587
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:11.930
Since you can cog, I'llplay no more with you.

1588
01:25:11.930 --> 01:25:14.100
One word in secret.

1589
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:15.600
Let it not be sweet.

1590
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:16.670
Thou grievest my gall.

1591
01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:18.070
Gall! bitter.

1592
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:20.430
Therefore meet.

1593
01:25:20.430 --> 01:25:24.200
Will you vouchsafe with meto change a word?

1594
01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.430
Name it.

1595
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:26.630
Fair lady,--

1596
01:25:26.630 --> 01:25:29.370
Say you so? Fair lord,--

1597
01:25:29.370 --> 01:25:31.670
Take that for your fairlady.

1598
01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:33.130
Please it you,

1599
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:39.330
As much in private, andI'll bid adieu.

1600
01:25:39.330 --> 01:25:41.700
What, was your vizard madewithout a tongue?

1601
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.930
I know the reason, lady,why you ask.

1602
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:46.500
O for your reason!quickly, sir; I long.

1603
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.970
You have a double tonguewithin your mask,

1604
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:52.830
And would afford myspeechless vizard half.

1605
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:56.570
Veal, quoth the Dutchman.Is not 'veal' a calf?

1606
01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:57.570
A calf, fair lady!

1607
01:25:57.570 --> 01:25:58.870
No, a fair lord calf.

1608
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:59.900
Let's part the word.

1609
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.430
No, I'll not be your half

1610
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:04.070
Take all, and wean it; itmay prove an ox.

1611
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:06.530
Look, how you butt yourselfin these sharp mocks!

1612
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:09.830
Will you give horns,chaste lady? do not so.

1613
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.670
Then die a calf, beforeyour horns do grow.

1614
01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:15.800
One word in private withyou, ere I die.

1615
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:20.270
Bleat softly then; thebutcher hears you cry.

1616
01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:23.930
The tongues of mockingwenches are as keen

1617
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:26.970
As is the razor's edgeinvisible,

1618
01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:29.070
Cutting a smaller hairthan may be seen,

1619
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:31.830
Above the sense of sense;so sensible

1620
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:36.000
Seemeth their conference;their conceits have wings

1621
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.300
Fleeter than arrows, bullets,wind, thought, swifter things.

1622
01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:44.570
Not one word more, my maids;break off, break off.

1623
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:48.170
By heaven, all dry-beatenwith pure scoff!

1624
01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:51.930
Farewell, mad wenches; youhave simple wits.

1625
01:26:51.930 --> 01:26:55.230
Twenty adieus, my frozenMuscovits.

1626
01:27:00.170 --> 01:27:04.200
Are these the breed ofwits so wonder'd at?

1627
01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.770
Tapers they are, with yoursweet breaths puff'd out.

1628
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:10.470
Well-liking wits they have;gross, gross; fat, fat.

1629
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:16.070
O poverty in wit,kingly-poor flout!

1630
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:19.500
Will they not, think you,hang themselves tonight?

1631
01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.970
Or ever, but in vizards,show their faces?

1632
01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:25.130
This pert Biron was out ofcountenance quite.

1633
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:27.630
O, they were all inlamentable cases!

1634
01:27:27.630 --> 01:27:30.100
The king was weeping-ripefor a good word.

1635
01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:33.100
Biron did swear himselfout of all suit.

1636
01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:36.700
Dumain was at my service,and his sword:

1637
01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.000
No point, quoth I; myservant straight was mute.

1638
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.800
Lord Longaville said, Icame o'er his heart;

1639
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.170
And trow you what hecalled me?

1640
01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:45.600
Qualm, perhaps.

1641
01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.470
Yes, in good faith.

1642
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.730
Go, sickness as thou art!

1643
01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.470
Well, better wits haveworn plain statute-caps.

1644
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:55.870
But will you hear? theking is my love sworn.

1645
01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:58.570
And quick Biron hathplighted troth to me.

1646
01:27:58.570 --> 01:28:00.770
And Longaville was for myservice born.

1647
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:05.130
Dumain is mine, as sure asbark on tree.

1648
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:08.070
Madam, and prettymistresses, give ear:

1649
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:09.970
Immediately they willagain be here

1650
01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:11.400
In their own shapes; forit can never be

1651
01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.800
They will digest thisharsh indignity.

1652
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.600
Will they return?

1653
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.500
They will, they will, Godknows,

1654
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.500
And leap for joy, thoughthey are lame with blows:

1655
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:23.500
Therefore change favours;and, when they repair,

1656
01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:26.270
Blow like sweet roses inthis summer air.

1657
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:27.430
What shall we do,

1658
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:29.770
If they return in theirown shapes to woo?

1659
01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:33.430
Good madam, if by meyou'll be advised,

1660
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:35.470
Let's, mock them still, aswell known as disguised:

1661
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:38.130
Let us complain to themwhat fools were here,

1662
01:28:38.130 --> 01:28:41.400
Disguised like Muscovites,in shapeless gear;

1663
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.930
And wonder what they wereand to what end

1664
01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:47.830
Their shallow shows andprologue vilely penn'd

1665
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:51.970
Fair sir, God save you!Where's the princess?

1666
01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:53.930
Gone to her tent. Pleaseit your majesty

1667
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:55.730
Command me any service toher thither?

1668
01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:57.330
That she vouchsafe meaudience for one word.

1669
01:28:57.330 --> 01:29:03.170
I will; and so will she, Iknow, my lord.

1670
01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:05.200
This fellow pecks up witas pigeons pease,

1671
01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.070
And utters it again whenGod doth please:

1672
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:09.370
He is wit's pedler, andretails his wares

1673
01:29:09.370 --> 01:29:12.130
At wakes and wassails,meetings, markets, fairs;

1674
01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:14.330
And we that sell by gross,the Lord doth know,

1675
01:29:14.330 --> 01:29:16.930
Have not the grace tograce it with such show.

1676
01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:18.930
This is the ape of form,monsieur the nice,

1677
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:20.970
That, when he plays attables, chides the dice

1678
01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:22.630
In honourable terms: O, he can sing

1679
01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:25.000
A mean most meanly; and inushering

1680
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.300
Mend him who can: theladies call him sweet;

1681
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:31.930
The stairs, as he treadson them, kiss his feet:

1682
01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:33.400
This is the flower thatsmiles on every one,

1683
01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.130
To show his teeth as whiteas whale's bone;

1684
01:29:36.130 --> 01:29:38.070
And consciences, that willnot die in debt,

1685
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:40.930
Pay him the due ofhoney-tongued Boyet.

1686
01:29:40.930 --> 01:29:43.270
A blister on his sweettongue, with my heart,

1687
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:44.770
That put Armado's page outof his part!

1688
01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:46.930
See where it comes!Behavior, what wert thou

1689
01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:50.170
Till this madman show'dthee? and what art thou now?

1690
01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:52.800
All hail, sweet madam, andfair time of day!

1691
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.300
'Fair' in 'all hail' isfoul, as I conceive.

1692
01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:57.170
Construe my speechesbetter, if you may.

1693
01:29:57.170 --> 01:29:59.100
Then wish me better; Iwill give you leave.

1694
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:02.470
We came to visit you, andpurpose now

1695
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:06.870
To lead you to our court;vouchsafe it then.

1696
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.400
This field shall hold me;and so hold your vow:

1697
01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:12.170
Nor God, nor I, delightsin perjured men.

1698
01:30:12.170 --> 01:30:14.500
Rebuke me not for thatwhich you provoke:

1699
01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.430
The virtue of your eyemust break my oath.

1700
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:19.470
You nickname virtue; viceyou should have spoke;

1701
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:22.130
For virtue's office neverbreaks men's troth.

1702
01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:24.500
Now by my maiden honour,yet as pure

1703
01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:26.430
As the unsullied lily, Iprotest,

1704
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:28.770
A world of torments thoughI should endure,

1705
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:30.870
I would not yield to beyour house's guest;

1706
01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:33.670
So much I hate a breakingcause to be

1707
01:30:33.670 --> 01:30:36.100
Of heavenly oaths, vow'dwith integrity.

1708
01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:39.530
O, you have lived indesolation here,

1709
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:43.300
Unseen, unvisited, much toour shame.

1710
01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:46.670
Not so, my lord; it is notso, I swear;

1711
01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:49.330
We have had pastimes hereand pleasant game:

1712
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:53.330
A mess of Russians left usbut of late.

1713
01:30:53.330 --> 01:30:54.770
How, madam! Russians!

1714
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:56.870
Ay, in truth, my lord;

1715
01:30:56.870 --> 01:31:00.070
Trim gallants, full ofcourtship and of state.

1716
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:03.030
Madam, speak true. It isnot so, my lord:

1717
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:04.700
My lady, to the manner ofthe days,

1718
01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.270
In courtesy givesundeserving praise.

1719
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:09.330
We four indeed confrontedwere with four

1720
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:12.270
In Russian habit: herethey stay'd an hour,

1721
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:14.700
And talk'd apace; and inthat hour, my lord,

1722
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.270
They did not bless us withone happy word.

1723
01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:20.130
I dare not call themfools; but this I think,

1724
01:31:20.130 --> 01:31:22.400
When fools are thirsty,they would fain have drink.

1725
01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.300
This jest is dry to me.Fair gentle sweet,

1726
01:31:25.300 --> 01:31:28.700
Your wit makes wise thingsfoolish: when we greet,

1727
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:31.830
With eyes best seeing,heaven's fiery eye,

1728
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:34.130
By light we lose light:your capacity

1729
01:31:34.130 --> 01:31:36.400
Is of that nature that toyour huge store

1730
01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.530
Wise things seem foolishand rich things but poor.

1731
01:31:40.530 --> 01:31:43.730
This proves you wise andrich, for in my eye,--

1732
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:45.270
I am a fool, and full ofpoverty.

1733
01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:47.770
But that you take whatdoth to you belong,

1734
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:49.770
It were a fault to snatchwords from my tongue.

1735
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:52.200
O, I am yours, and allthat I possess!

1736
01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:54.270
All the fool mine?

1737
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:55.770
I cannot give you less.

1738
01:31:55.770 --> 01:31:58.230
Which of the vizards wasit that you wore?

1739
01:31:58.230 --> 01:32:01.170
Where? when? what vizard?why demand you this?

1740
01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:03.970
There, then, that vizard;that superfluous case

1741
01:32:03.970 --> 01:32:06.670
That hid the worse andshow'd the better face.

1742
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:09.930
We are descried; they'llmock us now downright.

1743
01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:12.800
Let us confess and turn itto a jest.

1744
01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:15.970
Amazed, my lord? why looksyour highness sad?

1745
01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:19.330
Help, hold his brows! he'llswoon! Why look you pale?

1746
01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:21.570
Sea-sick, I think, comingfrom Muscovy.

1747
01:32:21.570 --> 01:32:23.870
Thus pour the stars downplagues for perjury.

1748
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:26.270
Can any face of brass holdlonger out?

1749
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:29.530
Here stand I, Lady, dart thyskill at me;

1750
01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:31.830
Bruise me with scorn,confound me with a flout;

1751
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:34.170
Thrust thy sharp wit quitethrough my ignorance;

1752
01:32:34.170 --> 01:32:38.100
Cut me to pieces with thykeen conceit;

1753
01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.900
And I will wish thee nevermore to dance,

1754
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:42.900
Nor never more in Russianhabit wait.

1755
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.770
O, never will I trust tospeeches penn'd,

1756
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:48.430
Nor to the motion of aschoolboy's tongue,

1757
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:49.770
Nor never come in vizardto my friend,

1758
01:32:49.770 --> 01:32:54.530
Nor woo in rhyme, like ablind harper's song!

1759
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:57.330
Taffeta phrases, silkenterms precise,

1760
01:32:57.330 --> 01:32:59.300
Three-piled hyperboles,spruce affectation,

1761
01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:02.030
Figures pedantical; thesesummer-flies

1762
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:07.370
Have blown me full ofmaggot ostentation:

1763
01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:10.470
I do forswear them; and Ihere protest,

1764
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:14.770
By this white glove;--howwhite the hand, God knows!--

1765
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:19.170
Henceforth my wooing mindshall be express'd

1766
01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:22.300
In russet yeas and honestkersey noes:

1767
01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:27.700
And, to begin, wench,--soGod help me, la!--

1768
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:33.330
My love to thee is sound,sans crack or flaw.

1769
01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:35.600
Sans sans, I pray you.

1770
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.530
Yet I have a trick

1771
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:38.100
Of the old rage: bear withme, I am sick;

1772
01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:39.870
I'll leave it by degrees.

1773
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:44.630
These lords are visited;you are not free,

1774
01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:47.900
For the Lord's tokens onyou do I see.

1775
01:33:47.900 --> 01:33:49.670
No, they are free thatgave these tokens to us.

1776
01:33:49.670 --> 01:33:52.670
Our states are forfeit:seek not to undo us.

1777
01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.570
It is not so; for how canthis be true,

1778
01:33:54.570 --> 01:33:57.100
That you stand forfeit,being those that sue?

1779
01:33:57.100 --> 01:33:59.370
Peace! for I will not haveto do with you.

1780
01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:02.000
Nor shall not, if I do asI intend.

1781
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.170
Speak for yourselves; mywit is at an end.

1782
01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:08.530
Teach us, sweet madam, forour rude transgression

1783
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:11.970
Some fair excuse.

1784
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:17.830
The fairest is confession.

1785
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:20.930
Were not you here but evennow disguised?

1786
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:23.200
Madam, I was.

1787
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.130
And were you well advised?

1788
01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:28.500
I was, fair madam.

1789
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.230
When you then were here,

1790
01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:34.800
What did you whisper inyour lady's ear?

1791
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:37.430
That more than all theworld I did respect her.

1792
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:40.930
When she shall challengethis, you will reject her.

1793
01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:42.170
Upon mine honour, no.

1794
01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:44.000
Peace, peace! forbear:

1795
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.270
Your oath once broke, youforce not to forswear.

1796
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:49.200
Despise me, when I breakthis oath of mine.

1797
01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.930
I will: and therefore keepit. Rosaline,

1798
01:34:54.930 --> 01:34:58.970
What did the Russianwhisper in your ear?

1799
01:34:58.970 --> 01:35:01.530
Madam, he swore that hedid hold me dear

1800
01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:04.470
As precious eyesight, anddid value me

1801
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:08.000
Above this world; addingthereto moreover

1802
01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.830
That he would wed me, orelse die my lover.

1803
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:15.000
God give thee joy of him!the noble lord

1804
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:18.200
Most honourably dothunhold his word.

1805
01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.670
What mean you, madam? bymy life, my troth,

1806
01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:22.830
I never swore this ladysuch an oath.

1807
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:25.600
By heaven, you did; and toconfirm it plain,

1808
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.870
You gave me this: but takeit, sir, again.

1809
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:32.230
My faith and this theprincess I did give:

1810
01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:36.030
I knew her by this jewelon her sleeve.

1811
01:35:36.030 --> 01:35:39.370
Pardon me, sir, this jeweldid she wear;

1812
01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:45.200
And Lord Biron, I thankhim, is my dear.

1813
01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:48.730
What, will you have me, oryour pearl again?

1814
01:35:48.730 --> 01:35:54.630
Neither of either; I remitboth twain.

1815
01:35:54.630 --> 01:35:57.730
I see the trick on't: herewas a consent,

1816
01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:59.970
Knowing aforehand of ourmerriment,

1817
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:01.970
The ladies did changefavours: and then we,

1818
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:05.000
Following the signs, woo'dbut the sign of she.

1819
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.970
Now, to our perjury to addmore terror,

1820
01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:09.230
We are again forsworn, inwill and error.

1821
01:36:09.230 --> 01:36:12.300
Much upon this it is: andmight not you

1822
01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:15.570
Forestall our sport, tomake us thus untrue?

1823
01:36:15.570 --> 01:36:16.570
Full merrily

1824
01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:18.930
Hath this brave manage,this career, been run.

1825
01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:21.570
Lo, he is tilting straight!Peace! I have done.

1826
01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:25.070
(♪ Loud drum)

1827
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:27.900
Welcome, pure wit! thoupartest a fair fray.

1828
01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.700
O Lord, sir, they wouldknow

1829
01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:31.330
Whether the three Worthiesshall come in or no.

1830
01:36:31.330 --> 01:36:33.030
Go, bid them prepare.

1831
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:36.800
We will turn it finely off,sir; we will take some care.

1832
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.800
Biron, they will shame us:let them not approach.

1833
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.900
We are shame-proof, mylord: and tis some policy

1834
01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:44.130
To have one show worse thanthe king's and his company.

1835
01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:46.200
I say they shall not come in.

1836
01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:49.170
Nay, my good lord, let meo'errule you now:

1837
01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:52.830
That sport best pleasesthat doth least know how:

1838
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:55.730
Where zeal strives tocontent, and the contents

1839
01:36:55.730 --> 01:36:58.130
Dies in the zeal of thatwhich it presents:

1840
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:01.970
Their form confoundedmakes most form in mirth,

1841
01:37:01.970 --> 01:37:05.000
When great things labouringperish in their birth.

1842
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.970
A right description of oursport, my lord.

1843
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:12.170
Anointed, I implore somuch of your

1844
01:37:12.170 --> 01:37:15.570
royal sweet breath as will uttera brace of words.

1845
01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:17.270
Doth this man serve God?

1846
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:18.370
Why ask you?

1847
01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:20.730
He speaks not like a manof God's making.

1848
01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:23.270
That is all one, my fair,sweet, honey monarch; for,

1849
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:25.570
I protest, the schoolmasteris exceeding fantastical;

1850
01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:29.130
too, too vain, too toovain: but we will put it,

1851
01:37:29.130 --> 01:37:31.930
as they say, tofortuna de la guerra.

1852
01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:36.170
I wish you the peace ofmind, most royal couplement!

1853
01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:44.530
Here is like to be a goodpresence of Worthies.

1854
01:37:44.530 --> 01:37:49.400
He presents Hector of Troy;the swain, Pompey the Great;

1855
01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:53.130
the parish curate,Alexander; Armado's page,

1856
01:37:53.130 --> 01:37:58.100
Hercules; the pedant,Judas Maccabaeus:

1857
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:05.030
I Pompey am,--

1858
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:06.600
You lie, you are not he.

1859
01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.970
I Pompey am,--

1860
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:09.800
With libbard's head onknee.

1861
01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.570
Well said, old mocker: I mustneeds be friends with thee.

1862
01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:16.330
I Pompey am, Pompeysurnamed the Big--

1863
01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:19.930
The Great.

1864
01:38:19.930 --> 01:38:21.570
It is, 'Great,' sir:--

1865
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:24.000
Pompey surnamed the Great;

1866
01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.770
That oft in field, withtarge and shield,

1867
01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:31.070
did make my foe to sweat: Andtravelling along this coast,

1868
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:34.870
I here am come bychance, And lay my arms

1869
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:40.200
before the legs of thissweet lass of France,

1870
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:46.370
If your ladyship would say,'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

1871
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:48.470
Great thanks, greatPompey.

1872
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:50.500
'Tis not so much worth;but I hope I was perfect:

1873
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.100
I made a littlefault in 'Great.'

1874
01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:56.200
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompeyproves the best Worthy.

1875
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:13.630
When in the world I lived, Iwas the world's commander;

1876
01:39:13.630 --> 01:39:16.300
Louder.

1877
01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.100
Shhh.

1878
01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:26.330
By east, west, north, and south,I spread my conquering might:

1879
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:31.670
My scutcheon plain declaresthat I am Alisander,--

1880
01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:34.130
Your nose says, no, you arenot for it stands too right.

1881
01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:37.000
Your nose smells 'no' in this,most tender-smelling knight.

1882
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.930
The conqueror is dismay'd.Proceed, good Alexander.

1883
01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:47.770
When in the world I lived, Iwas the world's commander,--

1884
01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:50.770
Most true, 'tis right; youwere so, Alisander.

1885
01:39:50.770 --> 01:39:52.300
Pompey the Great,--

1886
01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.900
Your servant, and Costard.

1887
01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.470
Take away the conqueror,take away Alisander.

1888
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:59.100
O, sir, you haveoverthrown

1889
01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.000
Alisander the conqueror!

1890
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.270
A conqueror, andafeard to speak!

1891
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:08.130
Run away for shame,Alisander.

1892
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:10.570
There, an't shall pleaseyou; a foolish mild man;

1893
01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:13.400
an honest man, lookyou, and soon dashed.

1894
01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:15.800
He is a marvellous goodneighbour, faith,

1895
01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:19.530
and a very good bowler:but, for Alisander,

1896
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:24.470
--alas, you see how 'tis,--alittle o'erparted.

1897
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:26.070
But there are Worthies a-coming

1898
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:27.800
will speak their mindin some other sort.

1899
01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:30.170
Stand aside good Pompey.

1900
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:40.930
Great Hercules ispresented by this imp,

1901
01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:46.330
Whose club kill'd Cerberus,that three-headed canis;

1902
01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:50.170
And when he was a babe, achild, a shrimp,

1903
01:40:50.170 --> 01:40:54.530
Thus did he strangleserpents in his manus.

1904
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:57.770
Quoniam he seemeth inminority,

1905
01:40:57.770 --> 01:41:03.230
Ergo I come with thisapology.

1906
01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:14.230
Keep some state in thyexit, and vanish.

1907
01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.830
(laughing)

1908
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:24.800
I, Judas am,--

1909
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.870
A Judas!

1910
01:41:25.870 --> 01:41:27.470
(hissing)

1911
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:29.030
Not Iscariot, sir.

1912
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:31.200
Judas, yclipedMaccabaeus.

1913
01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:34.500
Judas Maccabaeus clipt isplain Judas.

1914
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:36.570
I, Judas am,--

1915
01:41:36.570 --> 01:41:38.670
The more shame for you,Judas.

1916
01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:39.770
What mean you, sir?

1917
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:42.270
To make Judas hanghimself.

1918
01:41:42.270 --> 01:41:44.800
Begin, sir; you are myelder.

1919
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.100
Well followed: Judas washanged on an elder.

1920
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.830
I will not be put out ofcountenance.

1921
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:50.530
Because thou hast no face.

1922
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:52.430
What is this?

1923
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:54.430
A cittern-head.

1924
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:55.730
The head of a bodkin.

1925
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:57.570
A Death's face in a ring.

1926
01:41:57.570 --> 01:42:00.730
The face of an old Romancoin, scarce seen.

1927
01:42:01.330 --> 01:42:03.730
And now forward; for we haveput thee in countenance.

1928
01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:05.130
You have put me out ofcountenance.

1929
01:42:05.130 --> 01:42:07.030
False; we have given theefaces.

1930
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:08.200
But you have out-facedthem all.

1931
01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.530
An thou wert a lion, wewould do so.

1932
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:11.100
Therefore, as he is anass, let him go.

1933
01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:16.470
And so adieu, sweet Jude!nay, why dost thou stay?

1934
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:19.070
For the latter end of hisname.

1935
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:23.400
For the ass to the Jude;give it him:--Jud-as, away!

1936
01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:29.200
This is not generous, notgentle, not humble.

1937
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:34.000
A light for Monsieur Judas! itgrows dark, he may stumble.

1938
01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:38.430
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, howhath he been baited!

1939
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:41.330
Hide thy head, Achilles:here comes Hector in arms.

1940
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.030
But is this Hector?

1941
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:45.930
I think Hector was not soclean-timbered.

1942
01:42:45.930 --> 01:42:48.230
His leg is too big forHector's.

1943
01:42:48.230 --> 01:42:49.930
More calf, certain.

1944
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.230
No; he is best endued inthe small.

1945
01:42:53.370 --> 01:42:54.900
This cannot be Hector.

1946
01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:58.700
He's a god or a painter;for he makes faces.

1947
01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:09.330
The armipotent Mars, oflances the almighty,

1948
01:43:10.230 --> 01:43:13.530
Gave Hector a gift,--

1949
01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:14.970
A gilt nutmeg.

1950
01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:15.730
A lemon.

1951
01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:16.870
Stuck with cloves.

1952
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:18.100
No, cloven.

1953
01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:21.730
Peace!--

1954
01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:28.600
The armipotent Mars, oflances the almighty

1955
01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.830
Gave Hector a gift, theheir of Ilion;

1956
01:43:34.830 --> 01:43:39.270
A man so breathed, thatcertain he would fight; yea

1957
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:44.300
From morn till night, from outof his pavilion.

1958
01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:46.730
I am that flower,--

1959
01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:47.870
That mint.

1960
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:49.400
That columbine.

1961
01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:51.400
Sweet Lord Longaville,rein thy tongue.

1962
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:53.900
I must rather give it the rein,for it runs against Hector.

1963
01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:55.770
Ay, and Hector's agreyhound.

1964
01:43:55.770 --> 01:44:00.170
The sweet war-man is deadand rotten; sweet chucks,

1965
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:03.670
beat not the bones of theburied: when he breathed,

1966
01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:08.770
he was a man. But I willforward with my device.

1967
01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:13.030
Sweet royalty, bestow onme the benifit of hearing.

1968
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:16.430
Speak, brave Hector: weare much delighted.

1969
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.000
This Hector far surmountedHannibal,--

1970
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.770
The party is gone, fellowHector, she is gone;

1971
01:44:22.770 --> 01:44:25.030
she is two months on her way.

1972
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.970
What meanest thou?

1973
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:27.330
Faith, unless you playthe honest Troyan,

1974
01:44:27.330 --> 01:44:29.200
the poor wench is castaway: she's quick;

1975
01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:32.100
the child brags in herbelly already: tis yours.

1976
01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:34.670
Dost thou infamonizeme among potentates?

1977
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:35.770
thou shalt die.

1978
01:44:35.770 --> 01:44:37.630
Then shall Hector be whippedfor Jaquenetta that is

1979
01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:40.300
quick by him and hanged forPompey that is dead by him.

1980
01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:42.470
Most rare Pompey!

1981
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:43.600
Renowned Pompey!

1982
01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.370
Greater than great, great,great, great Pompey!

1983
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:48.070
Pompey the Huge!

1984
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:49.270
Hector trembles.

1985
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:51.330
By the north pole, I dochallenge thee.

1986
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:54.370
I will not fight with apole, like a northern man:

1987
01:44:54.370 --> 01:44:57.630
I'll slash; I'll do it bythe sword. I bepray you,

1988
01:44:57.630 --> 01:44:59.600
let me borrow my armsagain.

1989
01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:02.200
Room for the incensedWorthies!

1990
01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:04.070
I'll do it in my shirt.

1991
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:06.170
Most resolute Pompey!

1992
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:07.870
Master, let me take youa buttonhole lower.

1993
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:10.470
Do you not see Pompey isuncasing for the combat?

1994
01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:13.370
What mean you? You willlose your reputation.

1995
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:20.000
Gentlemen andsoldiers, pardon me;

1996
01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.870
I will not combat in my shirt.

1997
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:26.000
What reason have youfor't?

1998
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:31.870
The naked truth of itis, I have no shirt;

1999
01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:34.300
I go woolward for penance.

2000
01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:38.200
(laughing)

2001
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:51.130
God save you, madam!

2002
01:45:51.130 --> 01:45:52.830
Welcome, Mercade;

2003
01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:54.930
But that thou interrupt'stour merriment.

2004
01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:57.330
I am sorry, madam; for thenews I bring

2005
01:45:57.330 --> 01:46:04.170
Is heavy in my tongue. Theking your father--

2006
01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:05.530
Dead, for my life!

2007
01:46:05.530 --> 01:46:10.570
Even so; my tale is told.

2008
01:46:38.370 --> 01:46:43.170
Worthies, away! the scenebegins to cloud.

2009
01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.800
For mine own part, Ibreathe free breath.

2010
01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.970
I have seen the day of wrong

2011
01:46:47.970 --> 01:46:49.370
through the littlehole of discretion,

2012
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:52.830
and I will right myselflike a soldier.

2013
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.870
How fares your majesty?

2014
01:46:59.870 --> 01:47:03.370
Boyet, prepare; I willaway tonight.

2015
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:05.930
Madam, not so; I dobeseech you, stay.

2016
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:12.470
Prepare, I say. I thankyou, gracious lords,

2017
01:47:12.470 --> 01:47:16.230
For all your fairendeavors; and entreat,

2018
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:18.530
Out of a new-sad soul,that you vouchsafe

2019
01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:21.670
In your rich wisdom toexcuse or hide

2020
01:47:21.670 --> 01:47:25.030
The liberal opposition ofour spirits,

2021
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:27.200
If over-boldly we haveborne ourselves

2022
01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:29.100
In the converse of breath:

2023
01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:36.830
Your gentleness was guilty ofit. Farewell worthy lord!

2024
01:47:38.630 --> 01:47:42.300
A heavy heart bears not animble tongue:

2025
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:44.730
Excuse me so, coming tooshort of thanks

2026
01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:48.200
For my great suit soeasily obtain'd.

2027
01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.800
The extreme parts of timeextremely forms

2028
01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.670
All causes to the purposeof his speed,

2029
01:47:52.670 --> 01:47:54.930
And often at his veryloose decides

2030
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:58.430
That which long processcould not arbitrate:

2031
01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:01.100
And though the mourningbrow of progeny

2032
01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:02.770
Forbid the smilingcourtesy of love

2033
01:48:02.770 --> 01:48:05.870
The holy suit which fainit would convince,

2034
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:10.770
Yet, since love's argumentwas first on foot,

2035
01:48:10.770 --> 01:48:13.900
Let not the cloud ofsorrow justle it

2036
01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:15.370
From what it purposed;since, to wail friends lost

2037
01:48:15.370 --> 01:48:18.070
Is not by much sowholesome-profitable

2038
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:22.200
As to rejoice at friendsbut newly found.

2039
01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:25.770
I understand you not: mygriefs are double.

2040
01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:30.800
Honest plain words bestpierce the ear of grief;

2041
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.600
For your fair sakes havewe neglected time,

2042
01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.300
Play'd foul play with ouroaths: your beauty, ladies,

2043
01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:40.930
Hath much deform'd us,fashioning our humours

2044
01:48:40.930 --> 01:48:44.530
Even to the opposed end ofour intents:

2045
01:48:44.530 --> 01:48:47.430
And what in us hath seem'dridiculous,--

2046
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:50.270
As love is full ofunbefitting strains,

2047
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:53.500
All wanton as a child,skipping and vain,

2048
01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:55.800
Form'd by the eye andtherefore, like the eye,

2049
01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.270
Full of strange shapes, ofhabits and of forms,

2050
01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:02.070
Varying in subjects as theeye doth roll

2051
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:06.800
To every varied object inhis glance:

2052
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:09.930
Which parti-coatedpresence of loose love

2053
01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:12.600
Put on by us, if, in yourheavenly eyes,

2054
01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:15.770
Have misbecomed our oathsand gravities,

2055
01:49:15.770 --> 01:49:17.900
Those heavenly eyes, thatlook into these faults,

2056
01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:21.430
Suggested us to make.Therefore, ladies,

2057
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:23.800
Our love being yours, theerror that love makes

2058
01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:28.970
Is likewise yours: we toourselves prove false,

2059
01:49:28.970 --> 01:49:33.000
By being once false forever to be true

2060
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.600
To those that make usboth,--fair ladies, you:

2061
01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.800
We have received yourletters full of love;

2062
01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.900
Your favours, theambassadors of love;

2063
01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:45.000
And, in our maiden council,

2064
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.430
rated them at courtship,pleasant jest and courtesy,

2065
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:52.130
As bombast and as liningto the time:

2066
01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:54.170
But more devout than thisin our respects

2067
01:49:54.170 --> 01:49:57.400
Have we not been; andtherefore met your loves

2068
01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:03.600
In their own fashion, likea merriment.

2069
01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:06.730
Our letters, madam, show'dmuch more than jest.

2070
01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:08.130
So did our looks.

2071
01:50:08.130 --> 01:50:10.430
We did not quote them so.

2072
01:50:10.430 --> 01:50:13.030
Now, at the latest minuteof the hour,

2073
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:16.400
Grant us your loves.

2074
01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.930
A time, methinks, tooshort

2075
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:20.770
To make a world-without-endbargain in.

2076
01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:26.400
No, no, my lord, yourgrace is perjured much,

2077
01:50:26.970 --> 01:50:32.970
Full of dear guiltiness;and therefore this:

2078
01:50:32.970 --> 01:50:35.870
If for my love, as thereis no such cause,

2079
01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:39.630
You will do aught, thisshall you do for me:

2080
01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:43.100
Your oath I will nottrust; but go with speed

2081
01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:46.430
To some forlorn and nakedhermitage,

2082
01:50:46.430 --> 01:50:49.330
Remote from all thepleasures of the world;

2083
01:50:49.330 --> 01:50:52.630
There stay until thetwelve celestial signs

2084
01:50:52.630 --> 01:50:55.700
Have brought about theannual reckoning.

2085
01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:59.430
If this austere insociablelife

2086
01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:03.100
Change not your offer madein heat of blood;

2087
01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:07.430
If frosts and fasts, hardlodging and thin weeds

2088
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:11.300
Nip not the gaudy blossomsof your love,

2089
01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:15.070
But that it bear thistrial and last love;

2090
01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:18.530
Then, at the expiration ofthe year,

2091
01:51:18.530 --> 01:51:24.570
Come challenge me, challengeme by these deserts,

2092
01:51:24.570 --> 01:51:28.130
And, by this virgin palmnow kissing thine

2093
01:51:28.130 --> 01:51:33.970
I will be thine; and tillthat instant shut

2094
01:51:33.970 --> 01:51:37.870

2095
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:40.230
Raining the tears oflamentation

2096
01:51:40.230 --> 01:51:43.800
For the remembrance of myfather's death.

2097
01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:50.630
If this thou do deny, letour hands part,

2098
01:51:50.630 --> 01:51:53.630
Neither entitled in theother's heart.

2099
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:55.700
If this, or more thanthis, I would deny,

2100
01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:58.200
To flatter up these powersof mine with rest,

2101
01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:03.600
The sudden hand of deathclose up mine eye!

2102
01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:12.700
Hence ever then my heartis in thy breast.

2103
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:18.230
But what to me, my love?but what to me? A wife?

2104
01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:21.070
A beard, fair health, andhonesty;

2105
01:52:21.070 --> 01:52:24.800
With three-fold love Iwish you all these three.

2106
01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.230
O, shall I say, I thankyou, gentle wife?

2107
01:52:28.230 --> 01:52:31.000
Not so, my lord; atwelvemonth and a day

2108
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.570

2109
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:36.930
Come when the king doth tomy lady come;

2110
01:52:36.930 --> 01:52:42.570
Then, if I have much love,I'll give you some.

2111
01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:46.400
I'll serve thee true andfaithfully till then.

At the twelvemonth's end

2115
01:52:55.770 --> 01:52:59.300
I'll change my black gownfor a faithful friend.

2116
01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:04.900

2119
01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:14.400
Impose some service on mefor thy love.

2120
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.800
Oft have I heard of you,my Lord Biron,

2121
01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:19.030
Before I saw you; and theworld's large tongue

2122
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:22.330
Proclaims you for a manreplete with mocks,

2123
01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:25.270
Full of comparisons andwounding flouts,

2124
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:27.430
Which you on all estateswill execute

2125
01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:31.270
That come within the mercyof your wit.

2126
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:35.970
To weed this wormwood fromyour fruitful brain,

2127
01:53:35.970 --> 01:53:38.530
And therewithal to win me,if you please,

2131
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:50.570
With groaning wretches;and your task shall be,

2132
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:54.100
With all the fierceendeavor of your wit

2133
01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:57.030
To enforce the painedimpotent to smile.

2134
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:59.630
To move wild laughter inthe throat of death?

2135
01:53:59.630 --> 01:54:01.870
It cannot be; it isimpossible:

2136
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:03.600
Mirth cannot move a soulin agony.

2137
01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.070
Why, that's the way tochoke a gibing spirit,

2138
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:07.930
Whose influence is begotof that loose grace

2139
01:54:07.930 --> 01:54:11.170
Which shallow laughinghearers give to fools:

2140
01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:13.870
A jest's prosperity liesin the ear

2141
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.170
Of him that hears it,never in the tongue

2142
01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:17.570
Of him that makes it:then, if sickly ears,

2143
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:19.800
Deaf'd with the clamoursof their own dear groans,

2144
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:22.200
Will hear your idlescorns, continue then,

But if they will not,throw away that spirit,

2147
01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:29.430
And I shall find you emptyof that fault,
