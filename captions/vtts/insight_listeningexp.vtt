00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.310

        If someone were to ask you,
        "What is the communication
      

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.440

        behavior that humans engage
        in most
      

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.850

        frequently?" You would probably
        say, "Well, talking of course!"
      

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.420

        But no matter how talkative
        a person you are, there's
      

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.720

        another element of
        communication you engage in
      

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.720

        far more frequently.


00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.260

        Though it may surprise you
        to learn this, more than any
      

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.220

        other form of communication
        it is listening that we
      

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.460

        engage in most frequently;
        not that we are very good at
      

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.860

        it mind you.


00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.730

        Study after study has shown
        that rather than improving
      

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.170

        as we grow older, as many of
        our other skills tend to do,
      

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.370

        our listening skills seem to
        decline steadily
      

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.610

        from early childhood
        forward.
      

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.680

        I bet you never considered
        the possibility that a
      

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.040

        kindergarten class could be
        better listeners than high
      

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.710

        school or college students,
        but evidence suggests that
      

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.880

        this is the case.


00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.350

        Moreover when compared with
        the rest of the world,
      

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.520

        Americans tend to be among
        the worst listeners.
      

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.520

        Being an effective
        communicator depends on
      

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.260

        having good
        listening skills.
      

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.330

        I just moved so it's
        been really hard.
      

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.070

        You know I mean my place is
        a lot bigger
      

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.400

        but I miss my
        neighborhood.
      

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.510

        I always felt a real strong
        connection with them and my
      

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.610

        best friend lived
        across the street.
      

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.610

        Now with all the work that
        I have to take home I just
      

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.820

        don't seem to have the same
        kind of support system, you
      

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.120

        know what I mean?


00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.390

        Yeah, and moving
        is expensive too!
      

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.260

        If you have any work that
        you need done, painting,
      

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.460

        carpentry, you've got a
        friend, so let me know.
      

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.830

        Have you ever felt sad about
        having to move from a place
      

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.560

        that you loved?


00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.500

        Well when you have to throw
        something away that you'd
      

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.740

        rather hang on to, that's
        pretty tough, but it's just
      

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.440

        what you have to do
        when you move, you know.
      

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.010

        Either that or
        have a yard sale.
      

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.550

        A good example of a failed
        communication due in part to
      

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.490

        poor listening skills.


00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.190

        There are things you can do
        to become a more skilled and
      

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.720

        conscientious listener if
        you're willing to make the
      

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.730

        effort, but before we give
        you any strategies for
      

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.230

        improving your listening
        skills you'll need to know
      

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.130

        what the term listening
        means, how it works, and the
      

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.640

        many different
        forms it takes.
      

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.310

        In this video we will
        examine the practice of
      

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.240

        listening as it pertains to
        interpersonal communication.
      

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.780

        We'll give a definition of
        interpersonal listening and
      

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.850

        we'll describe different
        types of listening.
      

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850

        We'll talk about the
        role of listening and the
      

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.820

        interpersonal communication
        cycle and we'll identify the
      

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.560

        elements of
        effective listening.
      

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.160

        We will site common barriers
        to effective listening and
      

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.600

        then we'll enumerate
        strategies for improving
      

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600

        listening skills.


00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.070

        We will begin by
        defining the term.
      

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.370

        There are probably as many
        definitions of listening as
      

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.210

        there are textbooks on
        human communication.
      

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.180

        Though they all use
        different language with
      

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.650

        different wording in their
        definitions, they are all
      

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.750

        describing the same thing.


00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.620

        For our purposes the most
        effective way to begin to
      

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.550

        define the practice of
        listening is by comparing it
      

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.260

        to the physiological
        process of hearing.
      

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.930

        You will note that I use the
        term practice for listening
      

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.730

        and process for hearing.


00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.960

        Why?


00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.670

        Well, to use a metaphor I
        learned from a colleague,
      

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.730

        you think of it as the
        difference between a wink
      

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.440

        and a blink.


00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.440

        A blink is a physiological
        process that occurs without
      

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.170

        our conscious awareness.


00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.840

        We blink literally thousands
        of times per day without
      

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.480

        giving it a thought.


00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.950

        A wink, on the other hand,
        is a practice, a conscious,
      

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.450

        deliberate, willful act.


00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.550

        It is the same distinction
        between hearing
      

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.050

        and listening.


00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.960

        Our sense of hearing
        is really an ongoing
      

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.090

        physiological process,
        like our breathing
      

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.490

        or our heartbeat.


00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.830

        The physiological process
        of hearing involves the air
      

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.070

        pressure and vibration of
        sound waves acting upon the
      

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.640

        human ear.


00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.470

        These sound waves are
        picked up by the ear and
      

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.940

        transferred to the central
        nervous system as electrical
      

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.650

        impulses for processing.


00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.810

        Listening, however, adds a
        layer of complexity to this
      

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.350

        process a consciousness, an
        awareness that turns the
      

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.320

        process of hearing into
        the practice of listening.
      

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.760

        Listening is a form of
        meaning making, a cognitive
      

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.460

        practice in which auditory
        stimuli are separated,
      

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.470

        organized, and categorized
        in order for us to make
      

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.100

        sense of them and
        to act upon them.
      

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.540

        But the practice of
        listening is much more than
      

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.970

        a cognitive active meaning
        making, it is also
      

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.840

        influenced by social,
        cultural, and other
      

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.110

        contextual factors with a
        result that there are many
      

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.480

        different types of
        listening, many different
      

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.720

        purposes for listening and
        we will explore some of
      

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.060

        those now.


00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.930

        Different situations
        require different types
      

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.230

        of listening.


00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.670

        For example, your listening
        attitude will change if
      

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.940

        you're in a social
        conversation, at work,
      

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.870

        or listening to the
        news on the radio.
      

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.080

        Discriminative listening
        involves noticing both
      

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.880

        verbal and non-verbal
        aspects of a message.
      

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.650

        Reading verbal and
        non-verbal cues will help to
      

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.850

        understand a speaker's
        full meaning.
      

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.560

        Comprehensive listening is
        listening simply to learn,
      

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.020

        without being
        critical
      

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.530

        or evaluating what's
        being said.
      

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.100

        Critical evaluative
        listening, on the other
      

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.070

        hand, does involve critical
        thinking,
      

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.070

        and evaluating a
        message.
      

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.000

        Empathetic listening
        is when
      

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.810

        we lend a
        non-judgmental ear.
      

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.580

        It is when the listener
        attempts to feel with the
      

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.110

        speaker and focuses on the
        needs and concerns
      

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.550

        of the speaker.


00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.520

        Appreciative listening is
        the enjoyment of messages
      

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.690

        for their own sake, for
        example listening to music
      

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.220

        or another artistic
        performance.
      

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.890

        This has been a
        tough week for me.
      

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.460

        Nothing is going right.


00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.860

        Our project manager just
        told me she's quitting and
      

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.930

        on top of all that my
        mother's getting out of the
      

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.740

        hospital next week and she's
        going to need me to help!
      

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.770

        Wow.


00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.910

        I'm sorry to hear
        that, that is a lot.
      

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.040

        You know there is someone
        in sales that's looking to
      

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.140

        switch departments, maybe he
        can take over temporarily,
      

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.850

        and who knows, maybe
        he could be our guy.
      

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.250

        That's a good idea.


00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.450

        Thanks.


00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.420

        At least to get
        us over the hump.
      

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.320

        I just want everything to
        run smoothly, I don't want
      

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.790

        to let anyone down.


00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.060

        Oh, don't worry about it,
        Matt's a good guy and he
      

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.490

        needs a change.


00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.760

        Hey, listen, if you need to
        take time off to take care
      

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.530

        of your mother, that's fine.


00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.100

        Brad and I, we can command
        the ship together.
      

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.640

        Thanks, I appreciate that.


00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.940

        When we examine the role of
        listening in interpersonal
      

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.840

        communication, we must think
        of the listener as an equal
      

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.580

        partner in the
        communication process.
      

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.810

        The dynamic process of
        listening is an integral
      

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.780

        part of the
        communication cycle.
      

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.320

        This last exchange
        illustrates positive skills
      

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.890

        of listening in a successful
        communication cycle.
      

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.020

        It seems that they have both
        gained something from the
      

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.660

        exchange and therefore they
        have likely strengthened
      

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.860

        their relationship which
        will enable successful
      

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.700

        communication in the future.


00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.670

        This cycle of communication
        is constantly in motion,
      

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.740

        moving between attending,
        staying focused while
      

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.580

        demonstrating interest
        through short affirmations
      

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.880

        that acknowledge and
        recognize the speaker.
      

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.210

        Correlating and storing
        information, absorbing the
      

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.720

        verbal and non-verbal
        information
      

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.390

        being communicated.


00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.820

        Actively seeking feedback,
        questions that help the
      

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.160

        speaker present
        his or her ideas.
      

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.660

        Responding, first with
        feedback to let the speaker
      

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.070

        know how we have interpreted
        and understood his or her
      

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.700

        message and then with a
        reply that advances
      

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.870

        the conversation.


00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.240

        We should also realize that
        skillful listening is as
      

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.310

        active as speaking and
        sometimes
      

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.110

        even more difficult.


00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.550

        We can begin to appreciate
        this when we break down the
      

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.920

        various elements
        of listening.
      

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.690

        Attention, voluntary or
        involuntary, we can only
      

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.560

        attend to a small portion
        of the constant stream of
      

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.660

        auditory stimuli that
        crosses our ears.
      

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.870

        In some cases we will
        readily pay attention to
      

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.740

        another's words as a doctor
        might with a patient or an
      

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.470

        attorney with a client.


00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.940

        In other instances such as a
        radio or TV advertisement,
      

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.480

        someone or some thing must
        attract our attention.
      

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.020

        Interpretation, we must
        think about the things that
      

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.120

        we listen to and ensure that
        we understand them properly
      

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.190

        before we can take any kind
        of action concerning what
      

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.590

        we've heard.


00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.900

        Interpretation begins with
        this understanding and then
      

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.800

        moves into a more evaluative
        mode where we weigh the
      

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.400

        meaning of the message
        and its relationship
      

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:00.400

        to ourselves.


00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.480

        Response feedback, our
        feedback style, how we
      

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.810

        respond to another's words
        will help determine the
      

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.280

        course of the
        interaction to follow.
      

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.220

        We can respond positively,
        negatively, or even in a
      

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.990

        neutral manner and each of
        these response styles will
      

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:24.530

        impact the other
        person's own responses.
      

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.740

        Memory recall, a critical
        dimension of listening is
      

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.510

        storing and retrieving
        the information received.
      

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.780

        Effective listeners will
        continuously compile and
      

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.440

        organize the information
        they receive.
      

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.950

        A good memory, and the
        ability to readily recall
      

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.620

        can be a valuable asset in
        any communicative exchange.
      

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.820

        We can easily improve these
        skills with practice
      

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.630

        and dedication.


00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.130

        Underlying these elements
        are the two over arching
      

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.870

        conditions for effective
        listening; self awareness
      

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.470

        and awareness of the other.


00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:03.700

        Effective listening is built
        upon self awareness;
      

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.670

        our sense of self
        requires our interaction
      

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.270

        with other people.


00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.910

        We are social
        creatures after all.
      

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.550

        We are who we are only in
        relation to the others in
      

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.850

        our world.


00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.480

        In our self-concept our
        conscious awareness of
      

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.490

        ourselves as unique
        individual beings is shaped
      

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.960

        by language because part of
        this self concept or self
      

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.460

        identity is our inner voice.


00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.460

        This inner voice can play
        an important role in our
      

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.430

        abilities as communicators,
        but to become effective
      

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.600

        listeners we must become
        conscious of our inner
      

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.140

        dialog and be aware of its
        role in our attentiveness
      

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.610

        and our understanding
        of others.
      

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.410

        Self awareness also plays an
        important part in listening
      

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.110

        because it means
        knowing one's self.
      

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.280

        Knowing yourself means
        having an awareness of your
      

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.920

        basic beliefs and
        principles, your likes and
      

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.290

        dislikes, your biases,
        everything that informs your
      

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.420

        unique perspective and
        shapes your actions
      

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.760

        and judgments.


00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.990

        By knowing ourselves we'd be
        able to receive, interpret,
      

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.060

        and understand what
        others communicate to us.
      

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.030

        The other fundamental
        condition of listening is
      

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.130

        one's awareness
        of the other.
      

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.270

        An effective listener
        will always aim for an
      

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.500

        understanding of
        the perspective
      

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.610

        of the
        person speaking.
      

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.240

        One can strive to go even
        further though, for a deeper
      

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.080

        understanding of the other's
        perspective, and that is to
      

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.350

        have empathy for
        the other person.
      

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.220

        Empathy is the ability to
        identify with and understand
      

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.490

        another person's feelings.


00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.320

        Empathy will improve your
        overall listening skills and
      

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.290

        can only be achieved through
        effective listening.
      

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.560

        Let's review these crucial
        elements
      

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.130

        for effective listening.


00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:42.300

        Self awareness, awareness
        of the other, and empathy.
      

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.870

        Attention, interpretation,
        response feedback,
      

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.440

        memory recall.


00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.580

        When all the elements of
        effective listening are in
      

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.210

        play, the result is a
        supportive environment for
      

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:57.480

        interpersonal communication.


00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.750

        Defensiveness prevents a
        listener from concentrating
      

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.520

        upon the message.


00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.490

        Defensiveness begins with
        psychological insecurity on
      

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.830

        the part of a
        listener receiver.
      

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.760

        It is really the fear of
        criticism from another.
      

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.460

        Superior and dogmatic
        attitudes are hallmarks of
      

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.830

        the defensive personality.


00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.840

        Defensive climates are
        created by evaluation of the
      

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.840

        other or his or her ideas.


00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.710

        Attempts to control the
        conversation or situation.
      

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:29.980

        Use of strategy or
        concealed motivations.
      

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.520

        Being neutral, uninvolved,
        an attitude of superiority,
      

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.920

        being certain, or dogmatic.


00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.490

        In contrast a supportive
        environment is characterized
      

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.360

        by non-judgmental
        description, spontaneity, or
      

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.840

        non-calculating behavior
        empathy or identification
      

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.440

        with the speaker, equality
        with mutual trust
      

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.210

        and respect.


00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.580

        A shared openness to
        experience and explore in
      

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.780

        the relationship.


00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.950

        Thank you.


00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:10.620

        Okay so for this project I
        will take the airlines and
      

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:15.660

        the automotive and you can
        have direct mail
      

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.930

        and house wares.


00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.270

        Hey, it sounds like you've
        got it all figured out.
      

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.700

        In fact I'll take the
        airlines and automotive
      

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.240

        because I already have
        the contacts for those.
      

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.940

        Do you?


00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.250

        You know I just wish you
        wouldn't come on so strong.
      

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.120

        We're supposed to
        be in this together.
      

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.750

        How would you have started?


00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.050

        Well for starters I wouldn't
        have just said which ones I
      

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.290

        wanted, I would have asked,
        "What parts do you want?"
      

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.660

        Well then what are you
        complaining about?
      

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.700

        If you would have asked me I
        would have told you I wanted
      

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.800

        airline and automotive and
        we'd be right back
      

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.930

        where we started.


00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:58.540

        [sighing]


00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.270

        Here we see both
        parties demonstrating weak
      

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.740

        communication and
        listening skills.
      

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.280

        It's a clear example of a
        defensive environment and
      

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.180

        egocentric attitudes.


00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.250

        Neither person made an
        adequate effort to open the
      

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.220

        lines of communication, to
        empathize, or to create a
      

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.320

        supportive environment, and
        so nothing was resolved and
      

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.620

        communication broke down.


00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.790

        There are many forces that
        prevent us from listening
      

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.360

        effectively, some
        internal, some external.
      

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.430

        Many communication scholars
        use the general term "noise"
      

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.970

        to describe these forces
        which can include anything
      

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.170

        that interferes with the
        sending or reception
      

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.470

        of a message.


00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.640

        Our focus here of course is
        on the receiver's end
      

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:37.740

        of the message.


00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.020

        Distractions, these types of
        noise can be either internal
      

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.290

        or external and can include
        literal sonic noise,
      

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.690

        traffic, construction, loud
        music, or chatter, as well
      

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.690

        as internal noise such as
        tiredness, worries,
      

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.000

        anxiety, etceteras.


00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.500

        All of these can lead
        to a lack of attention.
      

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.210

        Egocentrism, if a person
        believes the world revolves
      

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:11.080

        around him, he will likely
        be a particularly
      

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.680

        poor listener.


00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.850

        Such people tend to downplay
        the concerns of the speaker
      

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.950

        and are likely to respond
        only with their concerns.
      

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.690

        For example, after listening
        to a co-worker describe her
      

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.630

        aches and pains, such a
        person might well exclaim,
      

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.030

        "You!


00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.330

        You think you've got aches
        and pains, well let me tell
      

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.800

        you about me!"


00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.570

        Ethnocentrism, this is
        a cultural barrier to
      

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.280

        listening in which the
        listener's attitude is that
      

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.910

        his culture, be it
        ethnicity, nationality, or
      

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.550

        religion is superior to that
        of the speaker and so he or
      

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.190

        she fails to take the
        speaker seriously.
      

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:03.200

        Lack of empathy, empathy as
        we know, is the ability to
      

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.100

        identify with and understand
        another person's feelings
      

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.530

        or difficulties.


00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.340

        Empathy goes beyond the mere
        ability to relate to another
      

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.910

        person, and into the realm
        of shared experiences.
      

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.280

        Without the benefit of
        empathy the well intentioned
      

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.080

        listener is limited to the
        realm of sympathy which is
      

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.750

        akin to feeling sorry for
        someone without actually
      

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:33.090

        understanding their dilemma.


00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:37.460

        Leading questions, a leading
        question is a question posed
      

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.700

        with the intention
        of producing
      

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.200

        a pre-determined answer.


00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.470

        Leading questions skew
        feedback and distort the
      

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.270

        intended meaning
        of the speaker.
      

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.080

        Defensiveness, when being
        defensive the listener
      

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.920

        reacts emotionally rather
        than intellectually.
      

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.950

        Defensiveness tends to flair
        up when a listener is upset
      

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:04.520

        or is being confronted with
        an uncomfortable truth.
      

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.490

        These scenarios occur most
        often when there is a power
      

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.600

        imbalance between speaker
        and listener and the speaker
      

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.870

        is in the dominant role.


00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.470

        Think of the
        teacher/student,
      

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.740

        boss/worker,
        parent/child dynamic.
      

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.610

        Defensiveness is a
        particularly daunting
      

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.010

        barrier to effective
        communication because once
      

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:30.120

        the listener begins to react
        defensively, he or she is
      

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:34.290

        shutting out everything the
        speaker is saying and no
      

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.120

        further progress
        can be made.
      

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.260

        The unfortunate thing is
        that in these cases the
      

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.430

        speaker often genuinely
        has the listener's best
      

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.730

        interests at heart.


00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.960

        Although there may be many
        barriers that prevent people
      

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.530

        from listening effectively,
        the good news is that there
      

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.800

        are also strategies you can
        employ to consciously become
      

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.740

        a better listener.


00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.640

        By being conscious of the
        barriers that can render
      

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.050

        listening ineffective, you
        will be better prepared to
      

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.650

        recognize these barriers and
        take steps to avoid them.
      

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.850

        The more self aware you are,
        the more effective you will
      

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.690

        be as a listener.


00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.660

        As you listen you can
        practice the skill of
      

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.400

        introspection, this means
        observing your own internal
      

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.300

        and non-verbal reactions.


00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.500

        Monitor your self talk and
        other inner reactions like
      

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:28.140

        getting angry, becoming
        indifferent, or daydreaming.
      

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.880

        Voluntary attention, a best
        case scenario is one where
      

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.380

        the listener willingly and
        enthusiastically lends an
      

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.420

        ear to the speaker.


00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.450

        Patience, listeners often
        find themselves in the
      

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.290

        position of wanting
        to say something.
      

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.130

        It is actually more
        productive to hold your
      

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:51.130

        tongue and let the speaker
        arrive at a conclusion.
      

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.670

        Patience is really a form of
        communicative discipline on
      

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.400

        the listener's part.


00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.300

        It is having the ability to
        allow the speakers to have
      

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.840

        their full say and resist
        the temptation to cut them
      

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:08.150

        off, chastise them, lecture
        them, scold them, etceteras
      

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.250

        which could provoke
        defensiveness or shut down
      

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.220

        the communication entirely.


00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.190

        Patience also entails
        respect and the capacity to
      

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.860

        listen with consideration
        recognizing a speaker's
      

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.330

        expertise in his
        or her own affairs.
      

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.130

        Silence is particularly
        challenging for many of us.
      

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.740

        It's not easy to keep quiet,
        but silence indicates that a
      

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.170

        listener is receptive
        and will not interrupt.
      

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.740

        Observe communication cues.


00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.810

        By this we mean being
        attentive not only to what
      

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.650

        the speaker
        is saying, but
      

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:46.750

        to the entire
        communication environment.
      

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.290

        The context, this includes
        the full range of non-verbal
      

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:55.660

        communication, facial
        expressions, eye behavior,
      

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.570

        tone, pitch, gestures, mode
        of dress, etceteras, as well
      

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.200

        as the physical environment
        where the communication
      

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.100

        takes place.


00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.870

        Empathy, while we really
        can't teach empathy as a
      

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.040

        strategy, it stands to
        reason that the more
      

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.250

        experienced and well rounded
        an individual becomes, the
      

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.690

        greater his or her capacity
        for empathy becomes.
      

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.290

        Non-judgmental responses,
        the manner in which we
      

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.230

        respond to the speaker will
        have a profound impact on
      

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.030

        what he or she says next.


00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:35.770

        The worst thing a listener
        can do is to condemn or
      

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.070

        judge a speaker; this would
        only shut the speaker down
      

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.280

        and bring communication
        to a standstill.
      

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.310

        By the same token we should
        let go of the popular notion
      

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.450

        that criticism is necessarily
        a negative thing.
      

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.820

        The word has a negative
        connotation, but in fact
      

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:58.160

        constructive criticism
        can be effective.
      

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.490

        Constructive criticism
        avoids judgment and
      

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.800

        accentuates feedback
        that can be positive
      

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.330

        or productive.


00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.470

        Questioning, actively
        seeking feedback is a very
      

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.610

        important part of this
        process and questioning can
      

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.210

        be an important technique
        for effective listening.
      

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.550

        We have seen the potential
        damage caused by leading
      

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.580

        questions, but used
        strategically, and
      

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.820

        appropriately questions can
        help the speaker communicate
      

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.190

        while also helping the
        listener to understand.
      

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.090

        Questions should be used
        to facilitate healthy
      

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.100

        communication and not to
        control the conversation.
      

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.970

        The goal of questioning is
        to help the speaker express
      

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.440

        his or herself more fully.


00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.510

        Different types of questions
        can be useful in different
      

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:51.180

        ways to develop a
        communicative exchange.
      

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.080

        These can include questions
        that: clarify, paraphrase,
      

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.590

        summarize, explore, support.


00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.190

        Tone of voice has a lot to
        do with how a question is
      

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:06.260

        received, as in
        "Are you kidding!"
      

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.730

        versus, "Are you kidding?"


00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.000

        The old adage holds true,
        "it's not what you said,
      

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.830

        it's how you said it."


00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.270

        In general effective
        questioning is a technique
      

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.940

        that helps guide and
        give shape to feedback.
      

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.440

        With time and practice you
        will learn how to phrase
      

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.710

        questions so that you elicit
        the greatest clarity
      

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:25.910

        of response.


00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.780

        As a result you'll become
        a truly accomplished and
      

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.380

        effective listener.


00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.720

        Listen I'm really sorry
        that I had asked for Tony's
      

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.250

        opinion on the new campaign.


00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.360

        He said some pretty awful
        things and I just wish I
      

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.160

        didn't ask for his thoughts.


00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.400

        I don't think you have to
        worry about it, but I know
      

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.860

        exactly what you mean.


00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.730

        I think sometimes he just
        shoots his mouth off without
      

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.700

        thinking about it.


00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.170

        I wanted to ask him to write
        me a letter for law school,
      

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:52.870

        but now I'm not so sure.


00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.240

        You're applying
        for law school?
      

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.410

        You'd make a great lawyer;
        you have that fighting
      

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.740

        spirit about you!


00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.750

        Thank you, but I'm a little
        worried about the scores so
      

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.250

        that's why I wanted Tony to
        write me the letter because
      

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.550

        he's got a lot of clout.


00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.020

        This clearly was a
        successful exchange.
      

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.290

        The listener exhibits
        extraordinary listening
      

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:18.460

        skills by relating to and
        empathizing with he speaker,
      

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.070

        thus the ensuing dialog is a
        free and open feedback loop
      

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.270

        of confirming responses
        and good will.
      

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.840

        It's a great example
        of empathic listening,
      

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.840

        questioning, and creating
        a supportive environment.
