WEBVTT

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
JOE LIEBERMAN'S GONNA BE
 THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
HE'S GONNA BE THE PRESIDENT
 OF THE UNITED STATES!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
HE'S GIVING A STATE
OF THE NATION ADDRESS

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
AT 3:15 P.M. TOMORROW.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
IT IS THE MOST
INTENSE WEEK IN POLITICS

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
THAT THIS COUNTRY - MAYBE
EVEN THE WORLD - KNOWS.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I KNEW THE PRIMARIES
WERE HOW THEY PICK

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA
RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THE IMPORTANCE

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
OF THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE ONE.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
IT'S REALLY VERY
EXCITING, ACTUALLY.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
IT'S FANTASTIC
TO BE HERE.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
PEOPLE TOLD ME IT WAS
GONNA BE SOMETHING

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'D REMEMBER FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
AND I KNOW
THAT IT WILL.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
AND THIS NOTE: THE SEVENTH
MAJOR CANDIDATE IN THE

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACE,
THE REVEREND AL SHARPTON,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
IS NOT IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE TODAY.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
THERE IS SO
MUCH AT STAKE.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
CAMPAIGNS ARE LITERALLY
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
THE ENTIRE FOCUS OF
THE POLITICAL WORLD

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
IS ON THIS VERY
SMALL STAGE.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
THE FINAL STAGES
OF PRIMARY SEASON

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
WILL SOON BE
UPON US...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
MASSACHUSETTS
SENATOR JOHN KERRY

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
WITH A STUNNING
VICTORY IN IOWA...

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
NORTH CAROLINA
SENATOR JOHN EDWARDS

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
IS RIDING A WAVE INTO
NEW HAMPSHIRE AS WELL

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
WITH A VERY STRONG
SECOND-PLACE SHOWING.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
HOWARD DEAN
DISAPPOINTS,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
BUT PROMISES THE BATTLE
WILL CONTINUE HERE.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
TODAY THERE'S A LOT
OF TALK ABOUT IOWA,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
BUT TOMORROW NEW HAMPSHIRE
IS A NEW BALL GAME!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
NEW HAMPSHIRE DECIDED
IN 1916 WHEN IT WOULD

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
HAVE ITS PRIMARIES,
BUT THEY WERE NOT

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
THE FIRST STATE
TO HAVE A PRIMARY.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
BUT THEY SET THE DATE
OF THEIR PRIMARY TO BE

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
AT THE SAME DAY THAT THEY
HAD THEIR TOWN MEETINGS,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
AND THAT TURNED OUT TO
BE THE EARLIEST DATE.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
AND AFTER A FEW
PRIMARY YEARS,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
THEY REALIZED WHAT A
GREAT ADVANTAGE THIS WAS,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
AND THEY PASSED
LEGISLATION EVENTUALLY

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
THAT MANDATED THAT THEY
MUST BE THE FIRST STATE.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
FIRST IN THE NATION PRIMARY:
 NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTES.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
ALL RIGHT. GREAT TO
BE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
WE JUST NEED SOME
MORE SNOW UP HERE.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
THANK YOU.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,
BECAUSE OF THIS

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
HISTORY OF BEING
THE FIRST STATE

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
AND HAVING THE EYES
OF THE NATION ON THEM

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
AND ALL THE MEDIA
DESCEND ON THEM,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY
AND STUDY THE CANDIDATES

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
AND SCRUTINIZE
THE CANDIDATES.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
SOME NEW
HAMPSHIREITES SAY,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
"I NEVER VOTE FOR A
CANDIDATE I HAVEN'T MET"

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
WHICH YOU COULD NEVER
SAY IN ANOTHER STATE.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'VE SEEN THE OTHER
FOUR MAJOR CANDIDATES

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
IN THE LAST 24
HOURS, AND WE'RE

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
JUST TRYING TO
SEE ALL OF THEM.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
OFTENTIMES THESE VOTERS
WILL CHECK PEOPLE OUT

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE
THEY'LL MAKE A DECISION.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
IT'S LIKE THE WEEK
BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
AND YOU KEEP GOING
BACK TO THE SAME STORE

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
BEFORE YOU FINALLY
MAKE THE PURCHASE.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'VE BEEN TO TWO
SPEECHES THAT JOHN KERRY

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
HAS ADDRESSED
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
PLEASED TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
NEW HAMPSHIRE'S
VOTERS UNDERSTAND

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
THAT THEIR VOTE IN
THE PRIMARY IS REALLY

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
THEIR MOST SIGNIFICANT
POLITICAL POSSESSION,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
AND THEY DON'T
GIVE IT AWAY

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
ANY SOONER THAN
THEY HAVE TO.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I JUST FEEL A SENSE
OF RESPONSIBILITY

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
TO COME OUT AND LEARN
AS MUCH AS I CAN

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
ABOUT THEM AND
SEE THEM FIRSTHAND.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I'M IMPRESSED
WITH JOHN KERRY,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'M IMPRESSED WITH EDWARDS
AND WITH WES CLARK,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
AND I HAVEN'T MADE
UP MY MIND YET

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
SO I WANTED TO HEAR
THEM IN PERSON.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS
WILL ANSWER HONESTLY

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
A POLLSTER'S QUESTION:

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
"IF THE PRIMARY WERE TODAY,
WHO WOULD YOU VOTE FOR?"

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
BUT THEY DON'T FEEL IN
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
THAT BINDS THEM TO VOTE
THAT WAY WHEN IT COMES.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I THINK WHAT ALWAYS
SURPRISES THE CANDIDATES

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
IS HOW SOFT THE SUPPORT
IS, HOW FAST IT MOVES.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
IT HAS TENDED TO MOVE
ALL IN ONE DIRECTION.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
IT DOESN'T FRACTURE.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
MY TAKE ON THE
POLLS IS THAT

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
THE PEOPLE IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
PARTICULARLY
INDEPENDENT VOTERS,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
MAKE UP THEIR
MINDS VERY LATE,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
AND SO IT WOULDN'T
BE AT ALL ASTONISHING

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
TO ME IN ANY WAY THAT
THERE'S SOME SURPRISES.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
A POT FULL OF PRIMARY
GOLD: UNDECIDED VOTERS.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
HE'S BANKING
ON THE BACKING

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
OF UNDECIDED AND
INDEPENDENT VOTERS.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
IN THE NEW
HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
DEMOCRATS AND
INDEPENDENTS VOTE.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
WHAT WE HAVE UP HERE IS
AN OPEN-PRIMARY SYSTEM.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
YOU CAN REGISTER AS
AN UNDECLARED VOTER

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
OR AS AN INDEPENDENT,
AND THEN ON PRIMARY DAY

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
YOU CAN SHOW UP
AT THE POLLS,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
DECLARE YOURSELF A MEMBER
OF A PARTICULAR PARTY

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
FOR PURPOSES OF
VOTING, AND THEN

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
YOU IMMEDIATELY CHANGE
YOUR REGISTRATION BACK

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
TO UNDECLARED
OR INDEPENDENT

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
AFTER YOU LEAVE
THE VOTING BOOTH.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
SHOW UP AND REGISTER

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
ON THE DAY OF
THE ELECTIONS.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
IF YOU ARE A MEMBER
OF A PARTY, HOWEVER,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
YOU EITHER VOTE IN
YOUR PARTY'S PRIMARY,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
OR YOU CAN CHANGE
YOUR PARTY AFFILIATION

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
BEFORE THE ACTUAL VOTE.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
ABOUT A THIRD OF
REGISTERED VOTERS

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE
UNDECLARED OR INDEPENDENT.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
ANOTHER THIRD
ARE REPUBLICAN.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
25% ARE DEMOCRATS.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
SO WE HAVE FEWER
REGISTERED DEMOCRATS

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
IN THE STATE
THAN REPUBLICANS

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
AND/OR THESE UNDECLARED
OR INDEPENDENT VOTERS.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
THE SENSE IS THAT IT
CLEARLY SPURS TURNOUT

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
AMONG VOTERS WHO
MIGHT NOT TYPICALLY

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
PARTICIPATE IN
A CLOSED PRIMARY.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
ACCORDING TO THE
SECRETARY OF STATE,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
BILL GARDNER SAYS HE
EXPECTS SOME 184,000 PEOPLE

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
TO VOTE IN THE
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
AND MORE THAN 100,000 IN
THE REPUBLICAN CONTEST.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
NOWHERE ELSE IN THE
COUNTRY DO PEOPLE VOTE

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
IN THE NUMBERS THAT
NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTES.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
72% OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE
TO VOTE, VOTE.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
WHICH IS WHY I THINK
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
VERY GOOD INDICATOR OF
GENERAL ELECTION SUCCESS.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
PRESIDENT DEAN!
 PRESIDENT DEAN!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
NEW HAMPSHIRE
 IS MIGHTY COLD!

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
THERE'S A HEIGHTENED
SENSE OF AWARENESS

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
AND SENSITIVITY TO BEING
INVOLVED IN POLITICS.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
PEOPLE DO IT IN NEW
HAMPSHIRE NOT TO GET RICH,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
NOT TO GET FAME, BUT
THEY DO IT BECAUSE

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
IT'S THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
POLITICS IS A
PASSION UP HERE.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE
SPENDING MILLIONS

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
AND MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
TELLING YOU HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
IT DOMINATES YOUR
EVERY WAKING MOMENT

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
IN TERMS OF
THE LOCAL NEWS.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I THINK YOU KIND OF
IMPOSE CIVIC OBLIGATION

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
TO TAKE PART AND
THAT DRIVES NUMBERS.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS, CLEARLY,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
YOU NEED MONEY,
YOU NEED TIME.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
...KERRY USING A HELICOPTER
 TO CROSS THE STATE TODAY.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
HE BEGAN ON
 THE SEACOAST...

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
YOU NEED AN ORGANIZATION
THAT KNOWS THE STATE,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
THAT UNDERSTANDS THE
DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
THAT THE STATE
HAS GONE THROUGH

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU
 WOULD PLEASE VOTE FOR ME.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
YOU NEED AN EFFICIENT
RETAIL POLITICS EXPERIENCE

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
BECAUSE SO MUCH OF
WHAT VOTERS WANT HERE

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
IS DIRECT CONTACT
WITH THE CANDIDATES.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I WAS KIND OF ALREADY
PARTIAL TO HIM,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
BUT HE MADE SOME
GOOD POINTS IN THERE

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
AND IT WAS REALLY
WONDERFUL TO HAVE HIM

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
STOP BY AND TAKE
THE TIME LIKE THIS.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
IN CONCORD,
 SENATOR JOHN EDWARDS

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
HELD HIS 104th
 TOWN HALL MEETING.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
IT'S NOT SIMPLY A MATTER
OF IF YOU MEET MORE VOTERS

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
YOUR POLL NUMBERS
WILL GO UP.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
EVERY FOUR YEARS,
CANDIDATES THINK,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
"IF I JUST DO ANOTHER TEN
TOWN MEETINGS OR I JUST

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
DO ANOTHER 20 EVENTS
WHERE I MEET THE PUBLIC,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THAT'S GONNA MAKE
THE DIFFERENCE."

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
SOMETIMES IT DOES AND
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
YOU HAVE TO MEET THEM,
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
PROVIDE THEM AN
INTERESTING RATIONALE

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
FOR SUPPORTING THEM.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I'M HERE RUNNING TO
BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
OF THE UNITED STATES
BECAUSE I WANT TO

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
BRING A HIGHER STANDARD
OF LEADERSHIP TO AMERICA.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
GENERAL CLARK'S
BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
AT COMMUNICATING A
MESSAGE OF HOPE TO PEOPLE.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I THINK THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE WANT:

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
TO KNOW THAT TOMORROW'S
GONNA BE BETTER THAN TODAY,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
AND THE MORE WE
COMMUNICATE THAT,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
THE MORE
PEOPLE RESPOND.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I'M THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE
TO BEAT GEORGE BUSH.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I'LL STAND UP AND SAY
WHAT'S NOT POPULAR

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
IF I THINK IT'S RIGHT, AND
I'VE DONE THAT ALL MY LIFE.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
YOU HAVE TO FIND
YOUR VOICE EARLY.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
YOU CAN'T KEEP
TRYING OUT MESSAGES

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
AND REINVENTING YOURSELF.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
THE VOTER IS TOO
SMART FOR THAT.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I'M JUST WORKING AS
HARD AS I KNOW HOW.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
SENATOR KERRY HELD
 FIVE EVENTS TODAY

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,
 ALL OVER THE STATE...

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
YOU KNOW, IF THE PARTY
BOSSES JUST GATHER IN A

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
SMOKE-FILLED ROOM ON THE
EVE OF THE CONVENTION

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
AND CHOOSE THE CANDIDATE,
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
KNOW WHETHER THAT
PERSON CAN HANDLE

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
THE KIND OF PRESSURE
THAT A CANDIDATE

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
SOMETIMES COMES UNDER
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
THE PRIMARY SYSTEM
IS THE BEST SYSTEM.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
THEY BEGIN TALKING ABOUT
THINGS ON THE STUMP.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
...SAID HE'D KEEP THE
ECONOMY GROWING.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
NOTHING!

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
NOTHING!

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
THEY GET MORE INFORMATION
BY TALKING TO REAL PEOPLE,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
THEY HEAR ABOUT OTHER
ISSUES AND THAT INFORMS

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
HOW THEY GO ABOUT
PRESENTING THEIR CASE

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
TO THE VOTERS.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO
PUT TOGETHER A TEAM

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
NATIONWIDE IF YOU'RE
GONNA RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
...AND THE
 JOBS WITH THEM,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
AND STICK THE AMERICAN
 PEOPLE WITH THE BILL.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
THAT'S OVER!

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
THERE'S THE "IT" FACTOR.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
A CANDIDATE WILL STRIKE
FOLKS JUST RIGHT.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH FIRST
CAME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
HE HAD ALMOST A
ROCK-STAR QUALITY TO HIM.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
EVERYBODY
WANTED TO BE THERE.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
THE EVENTS WERE SOLD OUT.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
HOWARD DEAN DID THE
SAME THING HERE.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
THAT CROWD MENTALITY
AND THE SENSE OF

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
MOMENTUM BUILT THERE
THAT, "HEY, THIS GUY'S

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
REALLY PUTTING
IT TOGETHER."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
THAT CAN ONLY BE
ACCOMPLISHED, I THINK,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BY BEING
HERE, TALKING TO PEOPLE,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
MEETING PEOPLE.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
PERSONAL COMMUNICATION
SKILLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
PEOPLE TRY TO
SIZE YOU UP WHEN

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
THEY DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT YOU

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AND YOUR HUMAN QUALITIES
BECOME VERY IMPORTANT.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I THINK LATER ON IT'S
A QUESTION OF MESSAGE,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
OF CONTENT, AND OF JUST
SIMPLE PHYSICAL ENERGY.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I THINK VOTERS
DO GET HERE,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE,
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THAT KIND OF FACE-TO-FACE
CONTACT WITH CANDIDATES.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
PEOPLE CATCH FIRE,
AND THEN THAT BECOMES

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
DIFFICULT TO STOP.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
...LOWER CLASS CAN'T
 AFFORD THOSE DRUGS.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
THEY'RE SO EXPENSIVE
 THAT, I KNOW MYSELF...

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
PEOPLE COME UP TO
CANDIDATES AND ASK THEM

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
THE DARNDEST THINGS
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
IT TESTS THEIR
METTLE, I THINK,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
AND IT DOES SO EARLY
ENOUGH IN THE PROCESS

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
THAT YOU CAN WEED
OUT PEOPLE WHO

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
MAYBE LOOK
GREAT ON PAPER,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
BUT THEY END UP BEING
TERRIBLE CAMPAIGNERS.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
PEOPLE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO INTERACT WITH THIS

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
PERSON WHO WANTS TO BE
THEIR REPRESENTATIVE,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
ON A PERSONAL,
ONE-TO-ONE LEVEL.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
RARELY DO YOU HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO INTERACT

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
WITH A PRESIDENT OR A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
THAT CAN BE INSPIRING.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
WELL, GREAT. WE SURE
DO APPRECIATE YOU.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
SO IT COMES OUT IN
A DATABASE AND THEN

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
YOU CAN PRINT IT OUT BY
STREET, I GUESS, RIGHT?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
SO YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE
GOING UP THE STREET,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
WHO'S WHERE,
RIGHT?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
SO WE CAN GET
CANVASSING DONE.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
RIGHT. GREAT.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN HERE?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
A LITTLE OVER A WEEK.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
WE HAVE PEOPLE FLYING IN
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY -

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
COLLEGE STUDENTS,
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
SOME WORKING ON
THEIR FIRST CAMPAIGN.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
GOING DOOR TO DOOR,
CALLING PEOPLE

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
ON THE PHONES,
ET CETERA.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THE NATURE OF A
CAMPAIGN STAFF IS

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
IT'S NORMALLY
YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
WE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY
AMOUNT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
WHO WERE INVOLVED IN
OUR CAMPAIGN WHO WERE

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
VERY INTERESTED,
VERY ARTICULATE,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
VERY ENERGETIC, AND THEY
WANTED TO GET INVOLVED

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
AND THEY DID.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
IT'S EXCITING FOR THEM.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
IF YOU HAVE A BURNING
DESIRE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
YOU GET INVOLVED
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
I REALLY ENJOYED EDWARDS.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
GETTING TO WATCH HIM SPEAK
WAS SO MOVING FOR ME.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AND WATCHING
THE CROWD JUST

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
GET SO INVOLVED
IN THE MUSIC

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
AND HIM ANSWERING
QUESTIONS IN THE MEDIA,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I GOT TO REALLY GET
INVOLVED IN THAT ASPECT.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
THE CANDIDATES AND
 THEIR CAMPAIGN WORKERS

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
AREN'T THE ONLY
 ONES PUTTING IN

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
A LOT OF EXTRA HOURS
 HEADING INTO PRIMARY DAY.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
WITH ALL EYES
 ON NEW HAMPSHIRE,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
MEDIA HAVE ARRIVED FROM
 ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
NEW HAMPSHIRE IS JUST
OVERFLOWING WITH

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA;
NOT JUST FROM THE

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
NETWORKS AND THE MAJOR
NEWSPAPERS IN AMERICA,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
BUT ALSO FROM
LOCAL STATIONS.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
AND THE INTERNATIONAL
MEDIA ARE THERE.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
THE EARLY PRIMARIES
ARE HEAVILY COVERED

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
BY THE MEDIA.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
WE EDIT, WE SHOOT.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
WE EDIT CLIP REELS, WE
FEED MATERIAL BACK TO

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
ABC NEWS TO BE USED ON
ALL THE NETWORK SHOWS.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
IN ADDITION WE'RE
SENDING OUT E-MAILS,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
WE'RE KEEPING OUR
NETWORK INFORMED.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH
THE EYES AND EARS

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
OF THE CAMPAIGN.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
WE HAVE 14 CAMERAS
ON THE EVENT TODAY.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
VERY HARD TO PREDICT
HOW BIG - ANY EVENT -

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
HOW BIG THE PRESS IS.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
SO WE TRY TO HAVE AS MUCH
SPACE AVAILABLE FOR THEM,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
BUT SOMETIMES, LIKE TODAY,
THE ROOM IS PACKED.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
IN 1996, THERE
WOULD BE PERHAPS

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
FOUR OR FIVE
TELEVISION CAMERAS.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
TODAY YOU HAVE
CLOSE TO 20.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO
FIGHT, LITERALLY,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
WITH YOUR ARMS,
YOUR ELBOWS.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
PROBABLY THE
BIGGEST INNOVATION

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
IS THE ADVENT OF
DIGITAL VIDEO,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
DIGITAL AUDIO -
THE DIGITAL WORLD.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
IT USED TO BE IT WOULD
BE A PROCESS OF DAYS.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
NOW IT'S A
PROCESS OF MINUTES.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
BOOM, IT'S OFF
ON THE NET.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
IT'S OFF TO THE
TELEVISION NETWORKS.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
AND BOOM, IT'S ON THE
AIR WITHIN 10 MINUTES.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
IT'S THE SPEED,
IT'S THE TURNOVER,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
IT'S THE REGURGITATION
OF THINGS THAT'S SO MUCH

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
LOOKING AT MAJOR ISSUES.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
AND ALL OF THIS HAS
BEEN MULTIPLIED

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
BY THE ROLE OF
THE INTERNET.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
AND SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO GET
ON TO A CANDIDATE WEBSITE,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
YOU CAN FIND
INFORMATION ABOUT

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
WHERE THEY
STAND ON ISSUES,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
WHAT THE CANDIDATES'
SPEECHES ARE,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
WHAT THEIR ADS ARE -
YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THIS.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
THE OVERARCHING MOTIVE FOR
EVERY CAMPAIGN IS IMAGE.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
JOE LIEBERMAN
 UNDERSTANDS THAT

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
WHEN YOU STRENGTHEN
 THE MIDDLE CLASS,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
YOU STRENGTHEN
 AMERICA.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THE WEEK LEADING UP TO
A PRIMARY, OF COURSE,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
IT'S WALL-TO-WALL ADS.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
YOU CAN'T TURN
ON YOUR TELEVISION

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
WITHOUT SEEING THEM.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
THERE'S OVER 150 TO
200 ADS ON PER DAY.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
THEY'LL BE SPENDING WELL
CLOSE TO $15 MILLION

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
ON ADVERTISING.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
..BECAUSE WE NEED
 AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
FOR ALL OF US.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
PEOPLE VOTE WITH
A POSITIVE REASON,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
AND THEY HAVE
MULTIPLE ALTERNATIVES.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
AND THAT'S WHY,
TRADITIONALLY

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
AND HISTORICALLY,
THE ADS AT PRIMARY

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
ARE VERY MUCH POSITIVE.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
IN A GENERAL ELECTION,
THEY'RE 50-50 POSITIVE

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
TO NEGATIVE.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I WAS BORN
 50 YEARS AGO...

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
THE ADS TEND TO BE
HEAVILY BIOGRAPHICAL,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
BECAUSE WHAT
THE CANDIDATES

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
ARE TRYING TO DO IS
GET THE ATTENTION

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
OF THE PUBLIC AND
TELL WHO THEY ARE.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
...BY TURNING A
 DEFICIT INTO A SURPLUS,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
CREATING JOBS, RAISING
 THE MINIMUM WAGE TWICE...

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
YOU'LL LEARN MORE
ABOUT THE CANDIDATES

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
FROM THEIR ADS
IN TERMS OF FACTS

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
ABOUT THE CANDIDATES
AND WHERE THEY STAND

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
THAN YOU WILL
FROM THE NEWS.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
...AND A PRESCRIPTION
 DRUG BENEFIT FOR SENIORS.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
A FRONTRUNNER STUMBLING,
 A CHALLENGER SURGING,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
AND TWO MEN
 WHO ARE STAKING

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
THEIR POLITICAL FUTURE
 ON NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
THE KIND OF COVERAGE THAT
THE MEDIA TEND TO GIVE

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
IS WHAT IS CALLED
"HORSE RACE COVERAGE",

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
WHO'S AHEAD
AND WHO'S BEHIND.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
...WITH SENATOR JOHN
 KERRY WAY OUT IN FRONT,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
HOLDING STEADY, HOPING
 TO PARLAY HIS IOWA WIN...

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
THE CANDIDATES ARE TRYING
TO GET OUT THEIR MESSAGE,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
AND SO IT'S A
COMPETITIVE SITUATION.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000
DOWN, PLEASE.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
ALL RIGHT, BACK
 UP! GIVE HIM SPACE!

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
BACK IT UP,
 BACK IT UP!

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
RIGHT HERE.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
SENATOR KERRY WAS
 IN TOWN TODAY

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
TALKING ABOUT
 RENEWABLE ENERGY...

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
NO, YOU GOTTA GET DOWN!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
YOU GUYS
 GOTTA GET DOWN!

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
AT SOME POINT IN THE CYCLE
MOST MEDIA OUTLETS MAKE

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
A RESOURCE-BASED DECISION
OR POLITICAL CALCULATION

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
ABOUT WHO IS
OR IS NOT VIABLE.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I MEAN, OVER THE
COURSE OF THREE WEEKS,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I WENT FROM, ACCORDING
TO THE POLLS,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
FIVE PERCENT TO
30-SOMETHING PERCENT.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
SO IT'S HARD FOR SOME
OF THESE CANDIDATES

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
TO GET MUCH
FREE COVERAGE.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
REACTION TO
 PRESIDENT BUSH'S

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
STATE OF THE
 UNION ADDRESS...

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
IF THERE'S SOME KIND
OF WORLD EVENT WHICH

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT
HAS TO DEAL WITH,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT, YOU
KNOW, GETS THE HEADLINES.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR
 COMING OUT HERE TONIGHT

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
TO JOIN US, TO WATCH
 THE STATE OF THE UNION,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AND TALK A LITTLE BIT
 ABOUT OUR COUNTRY.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
LET'S WATCH, AND THEN LET'S
 TALK ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
WE HAVE FACED SERIOUS
 CHALLENGES TOGETHER,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
AND NOW WE
 FACE A CHOICE.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME
PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
REALLY CHAFED AT THE
FACT THAT THE OTHER PARTY

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
WAS GETTING ALL
OF THIS ATTENTION.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
SO WHEN THE DEMOCRATS
WERE CAMPAIGNING AND

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
COMPETING AMONG
THEMSELVES IN 2004,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
HERE WAS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
LOOKING VERY
PRESIDENTIAL

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
AND REPORTING
TO CONGRESS.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
 ARE SHOWING THAT

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
THE STATE OF OUR UNION
 IS CONFIDENT AND STRONG.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
THIS PRESIDENT IS
 IN A STATE OF DENIAL

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
ABOUT THE STATE
 OF THE UNION.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THAT HE HAS NO REAL
 VISION FOR OUR FUTURE

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
AND NO PLAN TO
 GET US THERE.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THE UNION OF THE
 SPECIAL INTERESTS

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
AND THE INSIDERS IN
 WASHINGTON IS STRONG.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
THE PROBLEM IS THERE
 ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
WHO ARE STRUGGLING
 EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
IF YOU COULD THINK
OF A WAY TO EXPRESS

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
YOUR MAIN IDEA
IN YOUR CAMPAIGN

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
IN A VIVID WAY THAT
EVERYBODY WOULD REMEMBER,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
THAT MAKES YOU STAND
OUT FROM THE PACK.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
IN THE PRIMARY.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
SO, IN 2004 JOHN
EDWARDS USED A THEME:

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
"THE TWO AMERICAS".

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
...ONE FOR
 THE PRIVILEGED,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
ANOTHER RATIONED BY
 INSURANCE COMPANIES.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
TWO PUBLIC
 SCHOOL SYSTEMS:

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
ONE FOR THE HAVES AND
 ONE FOR EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
AND THAT IDEA RESONATED
AND WAS EASY TO REMEMBER.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
...WORKING FAMILIES
 PAY MORE.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
TWO GOVERNMENTS: ONE
 FOR POWERFUL INTERESTS

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
AND LOBBYISTS, THE OTHER
 FOR THE REST OF US.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR IS THAT
THE CANDIDATE BE A FIGHTER.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
WE'RE READY TO
 FIGHT FOR THE HEART

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
AND SOUL OF THE
 DEMOCRATIC PARTY!

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
BUT I DECIDED TO
 STAY AND FIGHT,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
BECAUSE I THINK IF YOU
 WANT THIS NOMINATION,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
YOU HAVE TO BE
 WILLING TO FIGHT

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
EVERYWHERE IN
 THE COUNTRY.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
BILL CLINTON, WHO WAS
SLIPPING IN THE POLLS

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
DUE TO SCANDALS,
DESCRIBED HIS EFFORTS

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
TO GET BACK AS "FIGHTING
AGAINST THE ODDS."

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
AND WHEN HE CAME
IN SECOND IN THE

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
NEW HAMPSHIRE
PRIMARY THAT YEAR,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF
AS "THE COMEBACK KID",

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
WHICH IS A KIND
OF FIGHTER IMAGE.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
WELL, I CAN'T TELL
 YOU HOW GREAT IT IS

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
TO COME BACK TO
 NEW HAMPSHIRE

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
AS "THE
 COMEBACK KERRY."

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
BEING THE FIGHTER IS A
VERY DESIRABLE POSITION.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
BEING IN THE
MIDDLE OF THINGS

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
AND SEEING THE
WHOLE IDEA OF

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS
IS REALLY FASCINATING.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
IT'S ONE THING TO
WATCH ON THE NEWS,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO BE A PART OF IT

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
AND MAKE HISTORY.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I DON'T KNOW BUT
 I'VE BEEN TOLD...

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
I DON'T KNOW BUT
 I'VE BEEN TOLD...

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT
AND EXCITING PROCESS

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
BECAUSE DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS SELECT

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
A CANDIDATE WHO
MIGHT VERY WELL

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
WIN THE PRESIDENCY
AND LEAD HIS COUNTRY.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THEY HAVE
BEEN VERY GOOD IN PREDICTING

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
WHO'S GOING TO WIN THE
ELECTION IN THE FALL.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
FROM 1952
TO THE PRESENT,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
THEY HAVE ONLY
BEEN WRONG TWICE.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
THIS WEEK, THE WEEK I
CALL THE SUPER BOWL

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
OF AMERICAN POLITICS,
EVERYBODY'S INVOLVED.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
YOU CANNOT WALK
DOWN THE STREET

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
WITHOUT MEETING
A CANDIDATE.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
THERE ARE SIGNS
EVERYWHERE.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
PEOPLE FEEL EMPOWERED.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I THINK PEOPLE KNOW THAT
THAT VOTE IS AS POWERFUL

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
AN INSTRUMENT TO EFFECT
THE SORT OF POLICY AND

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
POLITICAL COURSE OF THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
AS ANY CITIZEN IN
THE COUNTRY HAS,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
AND YOU OUGHT
TO USE IT.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
AND WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S
AN OBLIGATION THERE.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
THIS MATTERS.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
AND IT'S LIKE, THE FUTURE
BEGINS WITH US NOW.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
IT'S GOOD FOR US TO GET
INVOLVED WITH THINGS

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
LIKE THIS SO
WE CAN UNDERSTAND

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
HOW IT'S GONNA BE.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
WES CLARK!

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
AND SO I ASK YOU TO
 GO TO THOSE POLLS,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
AND DO NOT GO THERE TO
 SEND AMERICA A MESSAGE.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
GO THERE AND SEND
 AMERICA A PRESIDENT,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
BECAUSE THAT'S
 WHAT WE NEED.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
THANK YOU VERY,
 VERY MUCH.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
JOHN KERRY TAKES
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
THE WINNER OF THE IOWA
CAUCUSES MAKES IT

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
TWO IN A ROW WITH
A STRONG VICTORY OVER

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
HOWARD DEAN AND HIS
OTHER COMPETITORS.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
WELL, I LOVE
 NEW HAMPSHIRE!

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
GRANITE
STATE VOTERS

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
TONIGHT ANOINTED
THE JUNIOR SENATOR

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
FROM MASSACHUSETTS AS THE
UNDISPUTED FRONTRUNNER

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:01.000
*

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:14.000
*

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
*

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
*
