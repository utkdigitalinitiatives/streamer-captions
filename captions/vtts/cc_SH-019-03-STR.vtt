00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.330


2
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.470
Good morrow, goodLieutenant:

3
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.770
I am sorry for yourdispleasure;

4
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.770
but all will sure be well.

5
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.430
The general and his wifeare talking of it;

6
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.770
And she speaks for youstoutly: the Moor replies,

7
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.930
That he you hurt is ofgreat fame in Cyprus,

8
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.830
And great affinity, andthat in wholesome wisdom

9
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.070
He might not but refuseyou; but he protests heloves you

10
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.230
And needs no other suitorbut his likings

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.670
To take the safestoccasion by the front

12
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.870
To bring you in again.

13
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.000
Yet, I beseech you,

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.930
Give me advantage of somebrief discourse

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.670
With Desdemona alone.

16
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.230
Be thou assured, goodCassio, I will do

17
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.400
All my abilities in thybehalf.

18
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.430
Good madam, do: I warrantit grieves my husband,

19
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.630
As if the case were his.

20
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.230
O, that's an honestfellow.

21
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.530
Do not doubt, Cassio,

22
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.770
But I will have my lordand you again

23
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.970
As friendly as you were.

24
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.130
Bounteous madam,

25
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.500
Whatever shall become ofMichael Cassio,

26
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.170
He's never any thing butyour true servant.

27
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.770
I know't; I thank you.

28
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.930
You do love my lord:

29
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.970
You have known him long;and be you well assured

30
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.130
You shall in strangenessstand no further off thanin a polite distance.

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.430
Ay, but, lady,

32
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.830
That policy may eitherlast so long,

33
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.970
Or feed upon such nice andwaterish diet,

34
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.370
Or breed itself so out ofcircumstance,

35
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.300
That, I being absent andmy place supplied,

36
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.430
My general will forget mylove and service.

37
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.830
Do not doubt that; beforeEmilia here

38
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.630
I give thee warrant of thyplace: assure thee,

39
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.000
If I do vow a friendship,I'll perform it

40
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.970
To the last article: mylord shall never rest;

41
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.200
I'll watch him tame andtalk him out of patience;

42
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.770
His bed shall seem aschool, his board ashrift;

43
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.330
I'll intermingle everything he does

44
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.630
With Cassio's suit:therefore be merry,Cassio;

45
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.230
For thy solicitor shallrather die

46
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.800
Than give thy cause away.

47
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.500
Madam, here comes my lord.

48
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.470
Madam, I'll take my leave.

49
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.900
Nay, stay, and hear mespeak.

50
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.300
Madam, not now: I am veryill at ease,

51
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.000
Unfit for mine ownpurposes.

52
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.170
Well, do your discretion.

53
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.000
I like not that.

54
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.770
What dost thou say?

55
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.730
Nothing, my lord: or if--Iknow not what.

56
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.000
Was not that Cassio partedfrom my wife?

57
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.500
Cassio, my lord!

58
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.130
No, sure, I cannot thinkit,

59
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.000
That he would sneak awayso guilty-like,

60
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.600
Seeing you coming.

61
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.630
I do believe 'twas he.

62
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.770
How now, my lord!

63
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.270
I have been talking with asuitor here,

64
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.470
A man who languishes inyour displeasure.

65
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.030
Who is't you mean?

66
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.170
Why, your lieutenant,Cassio.

67
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.130
Good my lord,

68
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.030
If I have any grace orpower to move you,

69
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.530
His present reconciliationtake;

70
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
For if he be not one thattruly loves you,

71
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.630
That errs in ignorance andnot in cunning,

72
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.930
I have no judgment of anhonest face:

73
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.300
I prithee, call him back.

74
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.670
Went he hence now?

75
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.400
Yes, faith; so humbled

76
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.970
That he hath left part ofhis grief with me,

77
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.700
To suffer with him.

78
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.430
Good love, call him back.

79
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.430
Not now, sweet Desdemona;some other time.

80
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.500
But shall't be shortly?

81
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.630
The sooner, sweet, foryou.

82
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.770
Shall't be to-night atsupper?

83
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.270
No, not to-night.

84
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.370
To-morrow dinner, then?

85
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.600
No, I shall not dine athome;

86
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.100
I meet the captains at thecitadel.

87
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.370
Why, then, to-morrownight; or Tuesday morn;

88
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.100
On Tuesday noon, or night;or Wednesday morn:

89
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.900
I prithee, name the time,but let it not

90
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.800
Exceed three days: infaith, he's penitent;

91
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.570
And yet his trespass, inour common reason--

92
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.470
Save that, they say, thewars must make example

93
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.270
Out of their best-- is notalmost a fault

94
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.670
To incur a private cheque.

95
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.770
Shh.

96
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.030
When shall he come?

97
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.870
Tell me, Othello:

98
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.700
I wonder in my soul,

99
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.430
What you would ask me,that I should deny,

100
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.570
Or stand so mammering on.

101
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.730
What!

102
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.870
Michael Cassio,

103
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.200
That came a-wooing withyou, and so many a time,

104
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.600
When I have spoke of youdispraisingly,

105
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.230
Hath ta'en your part; tohave so much to do tobring him in!

106
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.470
If I a lady, I could domuch--

107
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.800
Prithee, no more: let himcome when he will;

108
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.330
I will deny thee nothing.

109
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.970
Why, this is not a boon;

110
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.930
'Tis as I should entreatyou wear your gloves,

111
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.570
Or feed off nourishingdishes, or keep you warm,

112
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.470
Or sue to you to do apeculiar profit

113
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.600
To your own person: nay,when I have a suit

114
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.000
Wherein I mean to touchyour love indeed,

115
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.130
It will be full of poiseand difficult weight

116
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.430
And fearful to be granted.

117
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.270
I will deny thee nothing:

118
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.800
Whereon, I do beseechthee, grant me this,

119
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.530
To leave me but a littleto myself.

120
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.270
Shall I deny you?

121
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.000
No: farewell, my lord.

122
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.870
Farewell, Desdemona: I'llcome to thee straight.

123
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.000
Emilia, come.

124
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.170
Be as your fancies teachyou;

125
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.070
Whate'er you be, I amobedient.

126
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.230
Excellent wretch!

127
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.670
Perdition catch my soul,

128
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.570
But I do love thee!

129
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.370
And when I love thee not,

130
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.830
Chaos is come again.

131
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.630
My noble lord--

132
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.800
What dost thou say, Iago?

133
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.800
Did Michael Cassio, whenyou woo'd my lady,

134
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.530
Know of your love?

135
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.700
He did, from first tolast: why dost thou ask?

136
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.670
But for a satisfaction ofmy thought;

137
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.770
No further harm.

138
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.370
Why of thy thought, Iago?

139
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.700
I did not think he hadbeen acquainted with her.

140
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.870
O, yes; and went betweenus very often.

141
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.030
Indeed.

142
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.430
Indeed.

143
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.430
Ay, indeed: discern'stthou aught in that?

144
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.670
Is he not honest?

145
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.000
Honest, my lord?

146
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.030
Honest!

147
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.800
Ay, honest.

148
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.230
My lord, for aught I know.

149
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.470
What dost thou think?

150
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.530
Think, my lord?

151
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.970
Think, my lord.

152
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.000
By heaven, he echoes me,

153
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.330
As if there were somemonster in his thought

154
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.600
Too hideous to be shown.

155
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.600
Thou dost mean something:

156
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.130
I heard thee say even now,thou likedst not that,

157
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.330
When Cassio left my wife:

158
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.670
what didst not like?

159
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.330
And when I told thee hewas of my counsel

160
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.670
In my whole course ofwooing, thou criedst'Indeed!'

161
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.530
And didst contract andpurse thy brow together,

162
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.530
As if thou then hadst shutup in thy brain

163
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.830
Some horrible conceit: ifthou dost love me,

164
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.930
Show me thy thought.

165
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.300
My lord, you know I love you.

166
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.600
I think thou dost;

167
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.530
And, for I know thou'rtfull of love and honesty,

168
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.500
And weigh'st thy wordsbefore thou givest thembreath,

169
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.000
Therefore these stops ofthine fright me the more:

170
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.630
For such things in a falsedisloyal knave

171
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.800
Are tricks of custom, butin a man that's just

172
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.330
They are close delations,working from the heart

173
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.170
That passion cannot rule.

174
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.470
For Michael Cassio,

175
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.330
I dare presume I think heis honest.

176
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.000
I think so too.

177
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.930
Men should be what theyseem;

178
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.300
Or those that be not, wouldthey might seem none!

179
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.770
Certain, men should bewhat they seem.

180
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.570
Why, then, I thinkCassio's an honest man.

181
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.470
Nay, yet there's more inthis:

182
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.300
I prithee, speak to me asto thy thinkings,

183
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.170
As thou dost ruminate, andgive thy worst of thoughts

184
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.370
The worst of words.

185
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.000
Good my lord, pardon me:

186
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.670
Though I am bound to everyact of duty,

187
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.230
I am not bound to that allslaves are free to.

188
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.800
Utter my thoughts?

189
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.530
Why, say they are vile andfalse;

190
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.830
As where's that palacewhereinto foul things

191
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.200
Sometimes intrude not?

192
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.830
Who has that breast sopure,

193
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:46.900
But some uncleanlyapprehensions

194
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.030
Keep leets and law-daysand in session sit

195
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.630
With meditations lawful?

196
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.600
Thou dost conspire againstthy friend, Iago,

197
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.870
If thou but think'st himwrong'd and makest his ear

198
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.200
A stranger to thythoughts.

199
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.970
I do beseech you--

200
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.830
Though I perchance amvicious in my guess,

201
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.930
As, I confess, it is mynature's plague

202
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.970
To spy into abuses, andoft my jealousy

203
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.130
Shapes faults which arenot--

204
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.330
that your wisdom yet,

205
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.130
From one that soimperfectly conjects,

206
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.630
Would take no notice, norbuild yourself a trouble

207
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.570
Out of his scattering andunsure observance.

208
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.370
It were not for your quietnor your good,

209
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.430
Nor for my manhood,honesty, or wisdom,

210
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.830
To let you know mythoughts.

211
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.870
What dost thou mean?

212
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:39.270
Good name in man andwoman, dear my lord,

213
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.330
Is the immediate jewel oftheir souls:

214
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.630
Who steals my purse stealstrash; 'tis something,nothing;

215
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.330
'Twas mine, 'tis his, andhas been slave tothousands:

216
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.400
But he that filches fromme my good name

217
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.030
Robs me of that which notenriches him

218
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.400
And makes me poor indeed.

219
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.430
By heaven, I'll know thythoughts.

220
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.530
You cannot, if my heartwere in your hand;

221
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.100
Nor shall not, whilst 'tisin my custody.

222
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.030
Ha.

223
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.200
O, beware, my lord, ofjealousy;

224
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.870
It is the green-eyedmonster that doth mock

225
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.600
The meat it feeds on; thatcuckold lives in bliss

226
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.200
Who, certain of his fate,loves not his wronger;

227
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.170
But, O, what damnedminutes tells he o'er

228
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.970
Who dotes, yet doubts,suspects, yet strongly loves!

229
00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.630
O misery!

230
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.970
Poor and content is richand rich enough,

231
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.830
But riches fineless is aspoor as winter

232
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.700
To him that ever fears heshall be poor.

233
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.100
Good God, the souls of all mytribe defend from jealousy!

234
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.000
Why, why is this?

235
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.400
Think'st thou I'ld make alife of jealousy,

236
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.800
To follow still thechanges of the moon

237
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.470
With fresh suspicions?

238
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.130
No; to be once in doubt

239
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.270
Is once to be resolved:exchange me for a goat,

240
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:36.570
When I shall turn thebusiness of my soul

241
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.070
To such exsufflicate andblown surmises,

242
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.130
Matching thy inference.

243
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.430
'Tis not to make mejealous

244
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.900
To say my wife is fair,feeds well, loves company,

245
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:52.100
Is free of speech, sings,plays and dances well;

246
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.370
Where virtue is, these aremore virtuous:

247
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.230
Nor from mine own weakmerits will I draw

248
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.770
The smallest fear or doubtof her revolt;

249
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.800
For she had eyes, andchose me.

250
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:22.530
No, Iago; I'll see beforeI doubt; when I doubt,prove;

251
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.370
And on the proof, there isno more but this--

252
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.300
Away at once with love orjealousy!

253
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.130
I am glad of this; for nowI shall have reason

254
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.770
To show the love and dutyI bear you

255
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.300
With franker spirit:therefore, as I am bound,

256
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.330
Receive it from me.

257
00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.600
I speak not yet of proof.

258
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:52.830
Look to your wife; observeher well with Cassio;

259
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.900
Wear your eye thus, notjealous nor secure:

260
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.330
I would not have your freeand noble nature,

261
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.970
Out of self-bounty, beabused; look to't:

262
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.730
For I do know our countrydisposition well;

263
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.500
In Venice they do let Godsee the pranks

264
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.430
They dare not show theirhusbands; their bestconscience

265
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.600
Is not to leave't undone,but keep't unknown.

266
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.900
Dost thou say so?

267
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.900
She deceived her father,marrying you;

268
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.700
And when she seem'd toshake and fear your looks,

269
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.500
She loved them most.

270
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.000
And so she did.

271
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.300
Why, go to then;

272
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.700
She that, so young, couldgive out such a seeming,

273
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.400
As to seal her father'seyes up close as oak--

274
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:37.200
He thought 'twaswitchcraft-- but I am muchto blame;

275
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.570
I humbly do beseech you ofyour pardon

276
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.000
For too much loving you.

277
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.870
I am bound to thee forever.

278
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.730
I see this hath a littledash'd your spirits.

279
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.100
No, not a jot, not a jot.

280
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.630
I fear it has.

281
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.370
I hope you will considerwhat is spoke

282
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.500
Comes from my love.

283
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.900
But I do see you aremoved:

284
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.900
I pray you not to strainmy speech

285
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.870
To grosser issues nor tofurther reach

286
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.170
Than to suspicion.

287
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.430
I will not.

288
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.630
Should you do so, my lord,

289
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.430
My speech should fall intosuch vile success

290
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.870
As my thoughts aim not.

291
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.800
Cassio's my worthyfriend--

292
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.670
My lord, I see you'removed.

293
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.470
No, not much moved:

294
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.100
I do not think butDesdemona's honest.

295
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.500
Long live she so!

296
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.130
And long live you to thinkso!

297
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:36.000
And yet, how nature erringfrom itself--

298
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.130
Ay, there's the point:as--to be bold with you--

299
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.130
Not to affect manyproposed matches

300
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.430
Of her own clime,complexion, and degree,

301
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.970
Whereto we see in allthings nature tends--

302
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:51.470
Foh!

303
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.730
One may smell in such awill most rank,

304
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.900
Foul disproportionthoughts unnatural.

305
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.300
But pardon me; I do not inposition

306
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.670
Distinctly speak of her;though I may fear

307
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.730
Her will, recoiling to herbetter judgment,

308
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.870
May fall to match you withher country forms

309
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.600
And happily repent.

310
00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.030
Farewell, farewell:

311
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:20.700
If more thou dost perceive,let me know more;

312
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.700
Set on thy wife toobserve: leave me, Iago.

313
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.270
My lord, I take my leave.

314
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.630
Why did I marry?

315
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.870
This honest creaturedoubtless

316
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.500
Sees and knows more, muchmore, than he unfolds.

317
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.630
I would I might entreatyou

318
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.830
To scan this thing nofurther; leave it to time:

319
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.030
Though it is fit thatCassio have his place,

320
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.230
For sure, he fills it upwith great ability,

321
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.530
Yet, if you please to holdhim off awhile,

322
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.700
You may by that perceivehim and his means:

323
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.730
Note, if your lady strainhis entertainment

324
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.870
With any strong orvehement suit;

325
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.930
Much will be seen in that.

326
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.100
In the mean time,

327
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.570
Let me be thought too busyin my fears--

328
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.030
As worthy cause I have tofear I am--

329
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.430
And hold her free, I dobeseech your honour.

330
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.670
Fear not my government.

331
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.770
I once more take my leave.

332
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.370
This fellow's of exceedinghonesty,

333
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.200
And knows all qualities,with a learned spirit,

334
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.230
Of human dealings.

335
00:16:56.930 --> 00:17:00.200
If I do prove her haggard,

336
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.470
Though that her jesseswere my dear heartstrings,

337
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.370
I'd whistle her off andlet her down the wind,

338
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.430
To pray at fortune.

339
00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:16.730
Haply, for I am black

340
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:20.330
And have not those softparts of conversation

341
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.430
That chamberers have, orfor I am declined

342
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:27.470
Into the vale of years--yet that's not much--

343
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.270
She's gone.

344
00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.670
I am abused; and my relief

345
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.870
Must be to loathe her.

346
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.800
O curse of marriage,

347
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.630
That we can call thesedelicate creatures ours,

348
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.270
And not their appetites!

349
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.270
I had rather be a toad,

350
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.670
And live upon the vapourof a dungeon,

351
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.170
Than keep a corner in thething I love

352
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.630
For others' uses.

353
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:12.430
Yet, 'tis the plague ofgreat ones;

354
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.370
Prerogatived are they lessthan the base;

355
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.970
'Tis destiny unshunnable,like death:

356
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.530
Even then this forkedplague is fated to us

357
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.770
When we do quicken.

358
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.630
Here she comes: and

359
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:37.030
If she be false, O, thenheaven mocks itself!

360
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.270
I'll not believe't.

361
00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.330
How now, my dear Othello!

362
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.170
Your dinner, and thegenerous islanders

363
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.370
By you invited, do attendyour presence.

364
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.030
I am to blame.

365
00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.970
Why do you speak sofaintly?

366
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.130
Are you not well?

367
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.730
I have a pain upon myforehead here.

368
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:09.030
'Faith, that's withwatching; 'twill awayagain:

369
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.200
Let me but bind it hard,within this hour

370
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.370
It will be well.

371
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.530
Your napkin is too small:

372
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.200
Let it alone.

373
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.070
Come, I'll go in with you.

374
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.930
I am very sorry that youare not well.

375
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.900
I am glad I have foundthis napkin:

376
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.570
This was her firstremembrance from the Moor:

377
00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.130
My wayward husband hath ahundred times

378
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.270
Woo'd me to steal it; butshe so loves the token,

379
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.600
For he conjured her sheshould ever keep it,

380
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.900
That she reserves itevermore about her

381
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.000
To kiss and talk to.

382
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.730
I'll have the work ta'enout,

383
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.870
And give't Iago: what hewill do with it

384
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.770
Heaven knows, not I;

385
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.400
I nothing but to pleasehis fantasy.

386
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.670
How now!

387
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.970
What do you here alone?

388
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.700
Do not you chide;

389
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.900
I have a thing for you.

390
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.500
You have a thing for me?

391
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.630
It is a common thing--

392
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.870
Ha?

393
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.570
To have a foolish wife.

394
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.270
O, is that all?

395
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.430
What will you give me nowfor that samehandkerchief?

396
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.070
What handkerchief?

397
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.600
What handkerchief?

398
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.030
Why, that the Moor firstgave to Desdemona;

399
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.270
That which so often youdid bid me steal.

400
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.830
Hast stol'n it from her?

401
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.230
No, 'faith; she let itdrop by negligence.

402
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.330
And, to the advantage, I,being here, took't up.

403
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.200
Look, here it is.

404
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.400
A good wench; give it me.

405
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.970
Ah, ah, ah.

406
00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.700
What will you do with 't,that you have been soearnest

407
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:11.930
To have me filch it?

408
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.170
Why, what's that to you?

409
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.400
If it be not for somepurpose of import,

410
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.100
Give't me again: poorlady, she'll run mad

411
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.400
When she shall lack it.

412
00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:28.600
Be not acknown on 't; Ihave use for it.

413
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.870
Leave me.

414
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:49.130
In Cassio's lodging, I'lllose this napkin,

415
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.370
And let him find it.

416
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:57.370
Trifles light as air

417
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.570
Are to the jealousconfirmations strong

418
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.330
As proofs of holy writ:this may do something.

419
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.730
The Moor already changeswith my poison:

420
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.670
Dangerous conceits are, intheir natures, poisons

421
00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.630
that at first are scarcefound to distaste,

422
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:22.700
But with a little act uponthe blood.

423
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:24.530
Burn like the mines ofSulphur.

424
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.570
I did say so:

425
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.430
Look, where he comes!

426
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.900
Not poppy, nor mandragora,

427
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.130
Nor all the drowsy syrupsof the world,

428
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.370
Shall ever medicine theeto that sweet sleep

429
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.070
Which thou owedstyesterday.

430
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.670
Ha!

431
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.600
False to me,

432
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.800
to me?

433
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.270
Why, how now, my lord.

434
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.430
No more of that.

435
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.900
Avaunt!

436
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.200
Be gone!

437
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.230
Thou hast set me on therack:

438
00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.400
I swear 'tis better to bemuch abused

439
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.030
Than but to know't alittle.

440
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.000
How now, my lord!

441
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.500
What sense had I of herstol'n hours of lust?

442
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.670
I saw't not, thought itnot, it harm'd not me:

443
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.270
I slept the next nightwell, fed well, was freeand merry;

444
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:42.770
I found not Cassio'skisses on her lips:

445
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.870
He that is robb'd, notwanting what is stol'n,

446
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.500
Let him not know't, andhe's not robb'd at all.

447
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.830
I am sorry to hear this.

448
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.730
I had been happy, if thegeneral camp,

449
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.570
Pioneers and all, hadtasted her sweet body,

450
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.100
So I had nothing known.

451
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.970
O, now, for ever

452
00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:00.100
Farewell the tranquilmind!

453
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.130
Farewell content!

454
00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.370
Farewell the plumed troop,and the big wars,

455
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.870
That makes ambitionvirtue!

456
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.230
O, farewell!

457
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.970
Farewell the neighingsteed, and the shrilltrump,

458
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.870
The spirit-stirring drum,the ear-piercing fife,

459
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.730
The royal banner, and allquality,

460
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.830
Pride, pomp and circumstanceof glorious war!

461
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.930
And, O you mortal engines,whose rude throats

462
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.130
The immortal Jove's deadclamours counterfeit,

463
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.270
Farewell!

464
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.230
Othello's occupation's gone!

465
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.430
Is't possible, my lord?

466
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.530
Villain, be sure thouprove my love a whore,

467
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.430
Be sure of it;

468
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.430
Or by the worth of man'seternal soul,

469
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.130
Thou hadst been betterhave been born a dog

470
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.270
Than answer my wakedwrath!

471
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:57.870
Is't come to this?

472
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.330
Make me to see't; or, atthe least, so prove it,

473
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.430
That the probation bear nohinge nor loop

474
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.730
To hang a doubt on; or woeupon thy life!

475
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.900
My noble lord--

476
00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.030
If thou dost slander herand torture me,

477
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.470
Never pray more; abandonall remorse;

478
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.500
On horror's head horrorsaccumulate;

479
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.270
Do deeds to make heavenweep, all earth amazed;

480
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.470
For nothing canst thou todamnation add

481
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:19.970
Greater than that.

482
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.500
O grace!

483
00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.630
O heaven forgive me!

484
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.230
Are you a man?

485
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.700
Have you a soul or sense?

486
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.500
God be wi' you; take mineoffice.

487
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.830
O wretched fool.

488
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.000
That livest to make thinehonesty a vice!

489
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.330
O monstrous world!

490
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.070
Take note, take note, Oworld,

491
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.100
To be direct and honest isnot safe.

492
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.070
I thank you for thisprofit; and from hence

493
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.570
I'll love no friend, sithlove breeds such offence.

494
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:56.400
Nay, stay: thou shouldstbe honest.

495
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.200
I should be wise, forhonesty's a fool

496
00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.630
And loses that it worksfor.

497
00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.170
By the world, I think mywife be honest and thinkshe is not;

498
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.730
I think that thou art justand think thou art not.

499
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.030
I'll have some proof.

500
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.800
Her name, that was asfresh

501
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.830
As Dian's visage, is nowbegrimed and black

502
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.970
As mine own face.

503
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.070
If there be cords, orknives,

504
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.030
Poison, or fire, orsuffocating streams,

505
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.630
I'll not endure it.

506
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.400
Would I were satisfied!

507
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.500
I see, sir, you are eatenup with passion:

508
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.070
I regret me that I everput it to you.

509
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.300
You would be satisfied?

510
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.270
Nay, and I will.

511
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.530
And may: but, how?

512
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.400
How satisfied?

513
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.470
Would you, the supervisor,grossly gape on--

514
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.670
Behold her topp'd?

515
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.570
Death and damnation!

516
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.470
It were a tediousdifficulty, I think,

517
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.200
To bring them to thatprospect: damn them then,

518
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.770
If ever mortal eyes do seethem bolster

519
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.900
More than their own!

520
00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.470
What then?

521
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.570
How then?

522
00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.870
What shall I say?

523
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.800
Where's satisfaction?

524
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.700
It is impossible youshould see this,

525
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.630
Were they as prime asgoats, as hot as monkeys,

526
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.100
As salt as wolves inpride,

527
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:05.300
and fools as gross asignorance made drunk.

528
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.570
But yet, I say,

529
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.800
If imputation and strongcircumstances,

530
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.970
Which lead directly to thedoor of truth,

531
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:18.070
Will give you satisfaction,you might have't.

532
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:25.900
You give me a livingreason she's disloyal.

533
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.670
I do not like the office:

534
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.400
But, sith I am enter'd inthis cause so far,

535
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.000
Prick'd to' by foolishhonesty and love,

536
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.230
I will go on.

537
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.800
I lay with Cassio lately;

538
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.170
And, being troubled with araging tooth,

539
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.570
I could not sleep.

540
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.830
There are a kind of men soloose of souls,

541
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.600
That in their sleeps willmutter their affairs:

542
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.000
One of this kind isCassio:

543
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.430
In sleep I heard him say'Sweet Desdemona,

544
00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.130
Let us be wary, let ushide our loves';

545
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.130
And then, sir, would hegripe and wring my hand,

546
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.230
Cried 'O sweet creature!'

547
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.430
And then kiss me hard,

548
00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.730
As if he pluck'd up kissesby the roots

549
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.230
That grew upon my lips:then laid his leg

550
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.770
Over my thigh, and sigh'd,and kiss'd; and then

551
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.770
Cried 'Cursed fate thatgave thee to the Moor!'

552
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.770
O monstrous!

553
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:29.930
Monstrous!

554
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:31.530
Nay, this was but hisdream.

555
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.630
But this denoted aforegone conclusion:

556
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.530
'Tis a shrewd doubt,though it be but a dream.

557
00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.900
And this may help tothicken other proofs

558
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.630
That do demonstratethinly.

559
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.070
I'll tear her all topieces.

560
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.900
Nay, but be wise: yet wesee nothing done;

561
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.500
She may be honest yet.

562
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.770
Tell me but this,

563
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:54.200
Have you not sometimesseen a handkerchief

564
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.430
Spotted with strawberriesin your wife's hand?

565
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:05.900
I gave her such a one;'twas my first gift.

566
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:12.070
I know not that; yet sucha handkerchief--

567
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.670
I am sure it was yourwife's--did I to-day

568
00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:20.400
See Cassio wipe hisbeard with.

569
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.800
If it be that--

570
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.830
If it be that, or any thatwas hers,

571
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.970
It speaks against her withthe other proofs.

572
00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:39.400
O, that the slave hadforty thousand lives!

573
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.770
One is too poor, too weakfor my revenge.

574
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.000
Now, look here, Iago;

575
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.830
All my fond love thus do Iblow to heaven.

576
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.230
'Tis gone.

577
00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:03.770
Arise, black vengeance,from the hollow hell!

578
00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.700
Yield up, O love, thycrown and hearted throne

579
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.470
To tyrannous hate!

580
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.500
Swell, bosom, with thyfraught,

581
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.170
For 'tis of aspics'tongues!

582
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.300
Yet be content.

583
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.230
Blood, blood, blood!

584
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.730
Patience, your mindperhaps may change.

585
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.900
Never, Iago:

586
00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.500
Like to the Pontic sea,

587
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.930
Whose icy current andcompulsive course

588
00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.730
Ne'er feels retiring ebb,but keeps due on

589
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.170
To the Propontic and theHellespont,

590
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.030
Even so my bloody thoughts,with violent pace,

591
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.230
Shall ne'er look back,ne'er ebb to humble love,

592
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.830
Till that a capable andwide revenge

593
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.700
Swallow them up.

594
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.430
Now, by yond marbleheaven,

595
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.430
In the due reverence of asacred vow

596
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:50.570
I here engage my words.

597
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.730
Do not rise yet.

598
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.000
Witness, you ever-burninglights above,

599
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.630
You elements that clip usround about,

600
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.100
Witness that here Iagodoth give up

601
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.600
The execution of his wit,hands, heart,

602
00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.670
To wrong'd Othello'sservice!

603
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.230
Let him command,

604
00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.530
And to obey shall be in meremorse,

605
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.530
What bloody business ever.

606
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.970
I greet thy love,

607
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:28.500
Not with vain thanks, butwith acceptance bounteous,

608
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.870
And will upon the instantput thee to't:

609
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:37.170
Within these three dayslet me hear thee say

610
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.970
That Cassio's not alive.

611
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.900
My friend is dead; 'tisdone at your request:

612
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.130
But let her live.

613
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.730
Damn her, lewd minx!

614
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.470
Damn her! Damn her.

615
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.800
Come, go with me apart; Iwill withdraw,

616
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.970
To furnish me with somequick means of death

617
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.100
For the fair devil.

618
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:21.270
Now art thou mylieutenant.

619
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.730
I am your own for ever.

620
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.570
Where should I lose thathandkerchief, Emilia?

621
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.170
I know not, madam.

622
00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.230
Believe me, I'd ratherhave lose my purse

623
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:29.200
Full of crusadoes: and,but my noble Moor

624
00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.530
Is true of mind and madeof no such baseness

625
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.170
As jealous creatures are,it were enough

626
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.770
To put him to illthinking.

627
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:39.230
Is he not jealous?

628
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.970
Who, he?

629
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.570
I think the sun where hewas born

630
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.070
Drew all such humours fromhim.

631
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.730
Look, where he comes.

632
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.230
I will not leave him nowtill Cassio

633
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:54.570
Be call'd to him.

634
00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.870
How is't with you, mylord?

635
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.370
Well, my good lady.

636
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:03.770
O, hardness to dissemble--

637
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.430
How do you, Desdemona?

638
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.300
Well, my good lord.

639
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.430
Give me thy hand:

640
00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.970
this hand is moist, mylady.

641
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:26.400
It yet hath felt no agenor known no sorrow.

642
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.330
This argues fruitfulnessand liberal heart:

643
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:35.130
Hot, hot, and moist:

644
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.130
this hand of yoursrequires

645
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.630
A sequester from liberty,fasting and prayer,

646
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.430
Much castigation, exercisedevout;

647
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:49.930
For here's a young andsweating devil here,

648
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:52.130
That commonly rebels.

649
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.400
'Tis a good hand,

650
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.530
A frank one.

651
00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.370
You may, indeed, say so;

652
00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.400
For 'twas that hand thatgave away my heart.

653
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:09.000
A liberal hand: the heartsof old gave hands;

654
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.330
But our new heraldry ishands, not hearts.

655
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.800
I cannot speak of this.

656
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.000
Come now, your promise.

657
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.870
What promise, chuck?

658
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.600
I have sent to bid Cassiocome speak with you.

659
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.900
I have a salt and sorryrheum offends me;

660
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.200
Lend me thy handkerchief.

661
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.300
Here, my lord.

662
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.530
That which I gave you.

663
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.730
I have it not about me.

664
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.470
Not?

665
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.500
No, my lord.

666
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.600
That's a fault.

667
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.930
That handkerchief

668
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.870
Did an Egyptian to mymother give;

669
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.370
She was a charmer, andcould almost read

670
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.900
The thoughts of people:

671
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.570
She told her, while shekept it,

672
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.830
'Twould make her amiableand subdue my father

673
00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.270
Entirely to her love, butif she lost it

674
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:06.330
Or made a gift of it, myfather's eye

675
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.030
Should hold her loathly andhis spirits should hunt

676
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.830
After new fancies:

677
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.730
she, dying, gave it me;

678
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.570
And bid me, when my fatewould have me wive,

679
00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:19.470
I give it her.

680
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:23.170
I did so: and take heedon't;

681
00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.730
Make it a darling likeyour precious eye;

682
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:31.400
To lose't or give't awaywere such perdition

683
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.930
As nothing else couldmatch.

684
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:35.200
Is't possible?

685
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.930
'Tis true: there's magicin the web of it:

686
00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.100
A sibyl, that had number'din the world

687
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.530
The sun to course twohundred compasses,

688
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:46.370
In her prophetic furysew'd the work;

689
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:50.400
The worms were hallow'dthat did breed the silk;

690
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.600
And it was dyed in mummywhich the skilful

691
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.100
Conserved of maidens'hearts.

692
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.800
Is't true?

693
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.170
Most veritable; thereforelook to't well.

694
00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.770
Then would to God that Ihad never seen't!

695
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.500
Ha!

696
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.570
Wherefore?

697
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.630
Why do you speak sostartingly and rash?

698
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:14.800
Is't lost?

699
00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.900
Is't gone?

700
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.570
Speak, is it out o' theway?

701
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.330
Heaven bless us!

702
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.330
Say you?

703
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.930
It is not lost;

704
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.670
but what an if it were?

705
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.770
How!

706
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.000
I say, it is not lost.

707
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.070
Fetch't, let me see't.

708
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:36.570
Why, so I can, sir,

709
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.700
but I will not now.

710
00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.330
This is a trick to put mefrom my suit:

711
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.700
I pray you, let Cassio bereceived again.

712
00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.300
Fetch me the handkerchief:my mind misgives.

713
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.400
Come, come;

714
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.830
You'll never meet a moresufficient man.

715
00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.930
The handkerchief!

716
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.100
I pray, talk me of Cassio.

717
00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.200
The handkerchief!

718
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.400
A man that all his time

719
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.030
Hath founded the goodfortunes on your love,

720
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.630
Shared dangers with you--

721
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.130
The handkerchief!

722
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.400
In faith, you are toblame.

723
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.600
Zounds!

724
00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.630
Is not this man jealous?

725
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.700
I ne'er saw this before.

726
00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.200
Sure, there's some wonderin this handkerchief:

727
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.930
I am most unhappy at theloss of it.

728
00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:37.930
'Tis not a year or twoshows us a man:

729
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.600
They are all but stomachs,and we all but food;

730
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.470
They eat us hungerly, andwhen they are full,

731
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.870
They belch us.

732
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.370
Look you, Cassio and myhusband,

733
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.370
There is no other way;'tis she must do't:

734
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.430
And, lo, the happiness!

735
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.630
Go, and importune her.

736
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.900
How now, good Cassio!

737
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.530
What's the news with you?

738
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.400
Madam, my former suit: Ido beseech you

739
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.100
That by your virtuousmeans I may again

740
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.930
Exist, and be a member ofhis love

741
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.300
Whom I with all the officeof my heart

742
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.430
Entirely honour: I wouldnot be delay'd.

743
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:18.900
If my offence be of suchmortal kind

744
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.230
That nor my service past,nor present sorrows,

745
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.770
Nor purposed merit infuturity,

746
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.000
Can ransom me into hislove again,

747
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.170
But to know so must be mybenefit;

748
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.230
So shall I clothe me in aforced content,

749
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.670
And shut myself up in someother course,

750
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.830
To fortune's alms.

751
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.230
Alas, thrice-gentleCassio!

752
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:34.830
My advocation is not nowin tune;

753
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:38.970
My lord is not my lord;nor would I know him,

754
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.400
Were he in favour as inhumour alter'd.

755
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.530
So help me every spiritsanctified,

756
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:46.330
I've spoken for you all mybest

757
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.130
And stood within the blankof his displeasure

758
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.130
For my free speech!

759
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.170
You must awhile bepatient:

760
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.830
What I can do I will; andmore I will

761
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.570
Than for myself I dare:let that suffice you.

762
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.000
Is my lord angry?

763
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.230
He went hence but now,

764
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.670
And certainly in strangeunquietness.

765
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.400
Can he be angry?

766
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.400
I have seen the cannon,

767
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.430
When it has blown hisranks into the air,

768
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.630
And, like the devil, fromhis very arm

769
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.570
Puff'd his own brother--is he angry?

770
00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.670
Something of moment then:I will go meet him:

771
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.870
There's matter in'tindeed, if he be angry.

772
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.670
I prithee, do so.

773
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.400
Something, sure, of state,

774
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.570
Either from Venice, orsome unhatch'd practise

775
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.730
Made demonstrable here inCyprus to him,

776
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.900
Hath puddled his clearspirits: and in such cases

777
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.030
Men's natures wrangle withinferior things,

778
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.400
Though great ones aretheir object.

779
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.670
'Tis even so;

780
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.330
For let our finger ache,and it indues

781
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.200
Our other healthful memberseven to a sense of pain:

782
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.130
nay, we must think men arenot gods,

783
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.800
Nor of them look for suchobservances

784
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.830
As fit the bridal.

785
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:03.030
Beshrew me much, Emilia, Iwas, unhandsome warrior asI am,

786
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.800
Arraigning his unkindnesswith my soul;

787
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.930
But now I find I havesuborn'd the witness,

788
00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.670
And he's indicted falsely.

789
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.670
Pray heaven it bestate-matters, as you think,

790
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.270
And no conception nor nojealous toy concerning you.

791
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.000
Alas the day!

792
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.270
I never gave him cause.

793
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:22.770
But jealous souls will notbe answer'd so;

794
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.630
They are not ever jealousfor the cause,

795
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:30.170
But jealous for they arejealous: 'tis a monster

796
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.530
Begot upon itself, born onitself.

797
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.330
Heaven keep that monsterfrom Othello's mind!

798
00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:38.370
Lady, amen.

799
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.330
I will go seek him.

800
00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.100
Cassio, walk youhereabout:

801
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.500
If I do find him fit, I'llmove your suit

802
00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.100
And seek to effect it tomy uttermost.

803
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.300
I humbly thank yourladyship.

804
00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:09.700
Save you, friend Cassio!

805
00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.570
What make you from home?

806
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.570
How is it with you, mymost fair Bianca?

807
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.570
I' faith, sweet love, Iwas coming to your house.

808
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.530
And I was going to yourlodging, Cassio.

809
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.600
What, keep a week away?

810
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.270
Seven days and nights?

811
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.000
Eight score eight hours?

812
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.570
And lovers' hours,

813
00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.070
More tedious than the dialeight score times?

814
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:35.600
O weary reckoning!

815
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:36.970
Pardon me, Bianca:

816
00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.670
I have this while withleaden thoughts beenpress'd:

817
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.400
But I shall, in a morecontinuate time,

818
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.270
Strike off this score ofabsence.

819
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.970
Sweet Bianca,

820
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.730
Take me this work out.

821
00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:47.970
O Cassio, whence camethis?

822
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.870
This is some token from anewer friend:

823
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.530
To the felt absence now Ifeel a cause:

824
00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.000
Is't come to this?

825
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.100
Well, well.

826
00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.570
Go to, woman!

827
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:01.870
Throw your vile guesses inthe devil's teeth,

828
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.030
From whence you have them.

829
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.170
You are jealous now

830
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.670
That this is from somemistress, some remembrance:

831
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.700
No, by my faith, Bianca.

832
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.870
Why, whose is it?

833
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.970
I know not neither:

834
00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.200
I found it in my chamber.

835
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.770
I like the work well: ereit be demanded--

836
00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:15.870
As like enough it will--

837
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:17.200
I'ld have it copied:

838
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.530
So take it, and do't; andleave me for this time.

839
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:19.630
Leave you wherefore?

840
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.900
I do attend here on thegeneral;

841
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.170
And think it no addition,nor my wish,

842
00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.130
To have him see mewoman'd.

843
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.230
Why, I pray you?

844
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.370
Not that I love you not.

845
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.370
But that you do not loveme.

846
00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.730
I pray you, bring me onthe way a little,

847
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.100
And say if I shall see yousoon at night.

848
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.500
'Tis but a little way thatI can bring you;

849
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.430
For I attend here: butI'll see you soon.

850
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.630
'Tis very good; I must becircumstanced.

851
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.030
