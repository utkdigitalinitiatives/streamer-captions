ALSO KNOWN AS THE LOWER

MISSISSIPPI, WHICH HAS DOMINATED
AMERICAN CULTURE AND LIFE.

ON THIS CONFLUENCE LIES THE
LITTLE TOWN OF CAIRO (KAY-ROO).

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.230
THERE'S NO SIGNPOST OR

PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK;

A MODERN DAY
GHOST TOWN.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.530
IT'S LIKE MANY OTHER PLACES
IN THE AMERICAN SOUTH WHERE

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.130
POVERTY IS A KILLER DISEASE
WIPING OUT WHOLE COMMUNITIES.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.200

MAINLY BLACK POPULATION

HAS SHRUNK FROM 15,000
TO LESS THAN 3,000

LEAVING IT A CITY OF ABANDONED
BUILDINGS AND DEAD HOPES.

THERE'S NO HOSPITAL HERE,
NO PARK, NO RESTAURANT.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.160

COMMERCE CENTER
THROUGHOUT CAIRO'S HISTORY.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.660
IF I COULD TRAVEL BACK IN TIME
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT IN DIFFERENT

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.860
DECADES LIKE THE 1880'S AND
90'S WHEN THE RIVERBOATS

WERE PLYING THIS
AREA, INTO THE 30'S

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.400
WHEN THE BLUES FIRST
MIGRATED NORTHWARD.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.830
IT HAD TO BE A
MAGNIFICENT MULTICULTURAL,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.330
FUN, EXCITING PLACE.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.130
>>STACE ENGLAND IS A
LOCAL MUSICIAN WHO GREW UP

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.260
NOT FAR
FROM CAIRO.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.600
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
FASCINATED WITH THIS PLACE

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.630
AND HAS SPENT
MANY YEARS HERE

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.860
RESEARCHING AND WRITING
SONGS ABOUT ITS RICH PAST.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.760
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT
THIS PLACE USED TO BE ONE OF

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.400
THE BUSIEST AND RICHEST
PORTS IN THE COUNTRY.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.030
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE TO
MAKE CAIRO'S WEALTH DISAPPEAR

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.660
IN RECENT YEARS.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.500
THIS BUILDING WAS DUKE'S
BAR WHICH OPENED IN 1933

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.400
AND JUST CLOSED A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO WHICH BROKE MY HEART.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.700
I LOVED THAT PLACE.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.600
THAT WAS MY OFFICE IN
CAIRO DURING MY RESEARCH.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.930
A BAR HERE, FATBOYS, HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A BAR FOR MANY, MANY YEARS

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.330
AND CHANGED
HANDS AND NAMES.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.360
THERE WAS A VERY FAMOUS
NEON MAKER HERE IN CAIRO

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.030
AND MOST OF THE SIGNS
WERE IN NEON SO IN THE 40'S

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.100
YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS
PLACE BLINKING AND LIGHTING UP

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.530
LIKE LAS VEGAS AS
YOU WALKED AROUND.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.100
SO IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL FOR
ME TO BE IN A SPOT LIKE THIS

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.260
AND HAVE A SENSE
OF THAT HISTORY.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.930
>>STACE BELIEVES THAT CAIRO
SHOULD BE CELEBRATED

THE UNIQUE ROLE IT HAS PLAYED

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.930
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.130
IT WAS HERE IN THIS TOWN,
WHICH MARKED THE START

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.100
OF THE AMERICAN NORTH, THAT
BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVES

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.530
COULD CLAIM
THEIR LIBERTY.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.160
FOR OVER 300 YEARS SLAVES WERE
SOLD TO WHITE MASTERS ALL ALONG

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.200
THE MISSISSIPPI BUT THE HARSHEST
CONDITIONS WERE ALWAYS FOUND

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.800
IN THE SOUTHERN STATES AND SO
MANY TRIED TO ESCAPE TO CAIRO;

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.560
THEIR GATEWAY TO A
BETTER LIFE IN THE NORTH.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.060
IMAGINE YOU'RE A SLAVE IN THE
SOUTH OR RIGHT AFTER THE CIVIL

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.900
WAR YOU'RE A FREED SLAVE OR A
SON OF SLAVES, CROSSING INTO

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.260
THE NORTH WOULD HAVE BEEN
AN EVER CHANGING LIFE EVENT.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.530
TO FINALLY FIND YOURSELF ON FREE
SOIL AND SAY I'M A MAN NOW.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.230
NOBODY CAN TELL
ME WHAT TO DO.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.360
SO THIS WAS A DRAMATIC
POINT FOR THAT ACTIVITY.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.660
IN FACT EVEN INTO
THE 40'S IN CAIRO

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.760
THIS WAS A
DEMARCATION POINT.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.800
IF YOU WERE COMING FROM
THE SOUTH ON A TRAIN CAR,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.660
YOU HAD TO RIDE IN THE
BLACK CAR BUT IN CAIRO

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.000
YOU COULD SWITCH AND
RIDE IN THE MIXED RACE CAR.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.160
>>BEFORE THE DAYS
OF MODERN TRANSPORT

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.430

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.830
OF SECRET RIVER
ROUTES AND SAFE HOUSES

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.930
NICKNAMED THE
"UNDERGROUND RAILROAD".

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.700
THEIR JOURNEY WAS FRAUGHT WITH
DANGER AND IF THEY WERE CAUGHT

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.700
THEY'D BE SOLD DOWN RIVER,
A NOTION WHICH BECAME

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.560
SYNONYMOUS WITH
RECEIVING A DEATH SENTENCE.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.460
THE LUCKY ONES REACHED
CAIRO WHERE THEY WERE

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.130
GREETED BY PEOPLE WHO
GAVE THEM HELP AND REFUGE

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.430
AND IT IS SAID THAT ONCE
THE SLAVES ARRIVED HERE

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:45.760
THEY FELL TO THEIR KNEES
AND KISSED THE FREE GROUND.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.600
IF YOU STAND ON THE DOCKS IN
CAIRO TODAY YOU'D BE FORGIVEN

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.330
FOR THINKING THAT THE TOWN
IS STILL AS BUSY AS EVER.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.130
BUT THERE'S ONE
BIG DIFFERENCE.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.130
THESE DAYS BIGGER SHIPS
MEAN BIGGER FUEL TANKS

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.260
AND FEWER
PIT STOPS.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.800
THE RESULT FOR CAIRO
HAS BEEN DEVASTATING.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.000
NOTHING STOPS
HERE ANYMORE.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.600
STACE BELIEVES THAT
NOT ALL IS LOST AND THAT

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.560
IF CAIRO COULD CELEBRATE
AND CASH IN ON ITS PAST

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.000
THEN MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE
SOME CHANCE OF A FUTURE.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.700
DURING THE LATE 60'S AND
70'S MUSICIANS STOPPED

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.200
COMING TO MEMPHIS,
TRAVELING FURTHER NORTH

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.630
TO PLACES LIKE CHICAGO
AND DETROIT INSTEAD.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:52.030
ALL THE BARS AND JUKE JOINTS ON
BEALE STREET HAD TO CLOSE DOWN,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.160
THE RECORDING STUDIOS
STOPPED RECORDING,

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.460
AND THE CITY SEEMED
TO LOSE ITS HEART...

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:03.800
BUT PERHAPS
NOT ITS SOUL.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.430
JUST A STONE'S THROW FROM THE
MISSISSIPPI IS STAX RECORDS.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.230
THIS PLACE USED TO BE ONE OF
THE LARGEST AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.400
BUSINESSES IN
THE UNITED STATES

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.500
AND AN OASIS OF BLACK
AND WHITE INTEGRATION.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.560
STAX WAS ALWAYS A PLACE
WHERE THE COLOR OF YOUR MUSIC

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.430
WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.230
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT
DON'T KNOW THIS LADY, SHE IS,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.360
I CONSIDER, THE
MOTHER OF STAX.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.430
LET'S GIVE A BIG HAND
TO MS. DEANIE PARKER.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:41.130
I WAS WITH STAX RECORDS FROM
ABOUT 1961 WHEN I CAME IN

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:48.230
TO BE A SUPERSTAR AND I REALIZED
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE THE SOULFUL

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:55.100
DELIVERY OF ARETHA FRANKLIN
AND I WASN'T NEARLY AS TALENTED

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.730
AS GLADYS KNIGHT, AND MY
LEGS WERE NEVER GOING TO BE

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.330
AS LONG AND AS GORGEOUS AS
TINA TURNER'S AND SO I DECIDED

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.700
THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING
THAT WOULD PUT ME

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.200
BEHIND THE DESK WHERE
IT REALLY DIDN'T MATTER.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.700
>>WHEN STAX WAS FORCED
INTO LIQUIDATION IN 1976,

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.900
FORMER STAX SECRETARY,
DEANIE PARKER,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.800
REFUSED TO
GIVE UP HOPE.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.860
SHE GREW UP ON THE TOUGH
STREETS OF MEMPHIS AND SO KNOWS

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.300
BETTER THAN MOST HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS TO HOLD ON TO THE DREAM.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.630
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SHE HAS
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN REBUILDING

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.800
STAX, NOT AS A RECORDING
STUDIO BUT AS A MUSIC ACADEMY

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.930
WHICH ONCE AGAIN GIVES STREET
KIDS THE CHANCE TO SHINE.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.100
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT FOR THE
LAST 15 YEARS CHILDREN HAVE

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.230
THOUGHT THEY WERE LISTENING TO
MUSIC WHEN IN FACT THEY WEREN'T.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.960
WHAT THEY WERE LISTENING
TO WAS RHYTHM AND RHYME,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.660
ALSO KNOWN AS HIP HOP,
AND THAT GOD-AWFUL RAP.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.700
AND SO THEY'VE JUST
NOT HAD THE EXPOSURE,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.630
THEY'VE NOT HAD
THE ENCOURAGEMENT,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.700
THEY'VE NOT
HAD THE TRAINING

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.960
BECAUSE WE'RE DETERMINED
TO DO FOR CHILDREN TODAY

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:11.800
AND CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE
WHAT STAX RECORDS DID FOR US.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.700
>>BUT MUCH LIKE IT WAS IN
THE 60'S, STAX IS JUST AN OASIS

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.560
WITHIN A MUCH
HARSHER ENVIRONMENT.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.600
ON THE STREETS OUTSIDE STAX,
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.200
IS STILL STRUGGLING WITH
ENDEMIC RACISM IN A CITY

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.330
WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE
MOST VIOLENT IN AMERICA.

♪

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.330
APART FROM ITS ROLE AS THE
SUPPORT ACT TO SOME OF THE

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.360
BEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD, THE
MISSISSIPPI'S CLAIM TO FAME

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.700
IS THAT IT'S THE
WORLD'S FLATTEST RIVER

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.030
WHERE WATER
SKIING WAS INVENTED

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:56.000
AND WHERE EARLY
RIVER TRADE AND TRAFFIC

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.960
MADE IT THE FIRST SUPER
HIGHWAY OF THE NEW WORLD.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:07.260
BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDE OPEN AND
EVEN, TRAVELING UP AND DOWN

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:10.400
THE MISSISSIPPI IS PLAIN
SAILING FOR THESE TUG BOATS

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.060
WHICH CAN STRETCH UP
TO A MILE LONG AND CARRY

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:18.130
THE SAME AMOUNT OF FREIGHT
AS A THOUSAND RAILROAD CARS.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.830
THESE ARE THE POWER HORSES OF
THE MISSISSIPPI AND THEY'RE A

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.730
VERY DIFFERENT ANIMAL TO
THE ELEGANT VESSELS OF OLD.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.030
THE MISSISSIPPI PADDLE
STEAMERS ARE AS FAMOUS

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:41.560
AS THE RIVER ITSELF, EVOKING
A NOSTALGIC SENSE OF ROMANCE

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.060
AND CAREFREE ADVENTURE.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.630
ON THESE DECKS
200 YEARS AGO

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.530
THERE WOULD BE A
VERY DIFFERENT CROWD.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.660
THERE'D BE SASSY WOMEN RUBBING
SKIRTS WITH CIGAR-SMOKING MEN,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.130
AND RUGGED RIVERBOAT
CAPTAINS KEEPING A LOOKOUT

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.230
FOR ANY MISSISSIPPI
ROGUES OR PIRATES.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.460
ALRIGHT. SEE THAT
BIG SANDBAR THERE?

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.060
QUIT LOOKING THAT WAY.

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.630
THIS LADY KEEPS LOOKING
THAT WAY. QUIT IT.

>>DON LANCASTER HAS
BEEN A RIVERBOAT PILOT

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.630
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.400
AS A YOUNG MAN HE WORKED AS A
POLICE OFFICER PATROLLING THE

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.200
MEAN STREETS OF MEMPHIS
BUT ALWAYS FANCIED HIMSELF

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.760
AS THE ROMANTIC LEAD IN AN
EPIC RIVERBOAT ADVENTURE.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.430
I THINK I'VE LIVED MOST
OF MY LIFE ON THE RIVER.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.660
I THOROUGHLY
ENJOY IT.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.930
I DO IT SIX DAYS A WEEK,
SOMETIMES AS MANY AS

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.100
FIVE TRIPS A DAY.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.130
SOME PEOPLE LIKE RACING,
SOME PEOPLE LIKE FLYING,

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:48.930
I LOVE THE RIVER AND THAT'S
WHERE I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.630
>>DON BEGAN HIS TRAINING
IN THE PARLOR HOUSES

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.130
OF THE GREAT STEAMERS AND
WORKED HIS WAY UP TO CAPTAIN.

HE NOW RUNS DAY TRIPS
FOR SUNDAY SAILORS

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.900
WHO SEEM MORE INTERESTED
IN TAKING IT EASY

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.430
THAN IN TEARING
UP THE MISSISSIPPI.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.930
AT ONE TIME MY YOUNGEST
SON WAS THE YOUNGEST PILOT

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.760
ON THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.030
WE USED TO
HAVE A LOT OF FUN.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.830
WE WORKED FOR A COMPANY
THAT HAD TWO PADDLE WHEELERS

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.100
AND WE'D GET OUT THERE AND
WE'D LOAD IN THE PASSENGERS

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.860
AND THEN WE'D CHALLENGE
EACH OTHER TO A RACE.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:22.800
EVERYBODY
JUST HAD A FIT.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.500
"OH, WE'RE RACING!"

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.900
AND SURE ENOUGH WE'D
GO BY DOWNTOWN MEMPHIS

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.600
WIDE OPEN WITH THE
PADDLE WHEELS FLYING.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.260
I ALWAYS WON, THOUGH.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.060
YOU SEE, I TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING
HE KNEW BUT I DIDN'T TEACH HIM

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:38.700
EVERYTHING I KNEW AND WE
USED TO HAVE A LOT OF FUN.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.100
>>MARK TWAIN WAS
ALSO A RIVERBOAT PILOT

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.830
AND ONE OF AMERICA'S
MOST FAMOUS AUTHORS.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.800
HE WROTE ABOUT THE ORIGINAL
STEAMBOAT RACES AND ABOUT

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.030
ALL THE GAMBLING AND DODGY
DEALS WHICH HAPPENED HERE

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:00.500
BEFORE GAMING WAS
OUTLAWED IN 1870.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.660
IN THE LAWLESS DAYS BEFORE
THE BIG EXPANSION INTO THE

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.530
WILD WEST, THE MISSISSIPPI
WAS AMERICA'S LAST FRONTIER

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.860
WITH ITS BOATS BECOMING
A POPULAR HANGOUT

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:15.600
AND HIDEOUT FOR ALL SORTS
OF COWBOYS AND CHANCERS.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.460
IN THOSE DAYS THERE WOULD
BE MUSIC TO ACCOMPANY

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.260
ALL THE ACTION AND LEGEND HAS
IT THAT JAZZ WAS INVENTED ON A

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.930
MISSISSIPPI PADDLE STEAMER BY
AN ITINERANT MUSICIAN CALLED

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:30.660
JAZBO BROWN WHO GAVE HIS
NAME TO THIS STYLE OF PLAYING.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.160
THEY SAY THAT SOME PARTS OF THE
RIVER HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.530
SINCE TWAIN AND JAZBO'S
TIME BUT LIFE ON THE RIVER

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:52.430
HAS CERTAINLY BEGUN
TO ALTER ITS COURSE.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.860
THIS USED TO BE A COMPLETELY
RURAL FARMING AREA RUN BY

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.660
A FEW WEALTHY WHITE FAMILIES
WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.130
BY GROWING COTTON
AND USING SLAVE LABOR.

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.930
BUT IT'S NOW CHANGING WITH
BIG CORPORATE FARMS MOVING IN

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.500
AND WITH STRIP MALLS, MOTELS,
AND BURGER BARS APPEARING

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.960
WHERE THERE USED TO BE SHOTGUN
SHACKS AND JUKE JOINTS.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.860
UP UNTIL 10 YEARS AGO
TUNICA WAS JUST ABOUT

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.030
THE POOREST TOWN
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.560
IT USED TO BE CALLED AMERICA'S
ZIMBABWE BECAUSE OF ITS HARSH

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:27.000
THIRD WORLD LIVING CONDITIONS
BUT NOW IT HAS HIT THE JACKPOT

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.360
THANKS TO SOME OF THE
STRANGEST LOOKING BOATS

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:35.100
EVER TO TAKE
TO THE RIVER.

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:40.430
WHEN TENNESSEE LEGALIZED
GAMBLING IN THE 1990'S

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:45.600
IT STATED THAT ALL ACTIVITY MUST
TAKE PLACE ON THE MISSISSIPPI

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.730
AND SO TUNICA, LYING A FEW
MILES AWAY FROM THE RIVER,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.360
DIVERTED SOME OF
THE MISSISSIPPI'S FLOW

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.230
TO CREATE SMALL POOLS
ON WHICH THEY COULD

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.760
FLOAT THEIR MODERN DAY
PLEASURE PALACES.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:04.230
THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE BOATS AND
YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE WATER,

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.960
BUT IT IS THERE, UNDERNEATH
ALL THE FLASHING LIGHTS AND

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.100
SPINNING WHEELS AND IT'S
ALLOWED TUNICA TO BECOME

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.030
THE THIRD LARGEST GAMING
REGION IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.700
THE WORLD POKER CHAMPIONSHIP
HAS BEEN HELD HERE

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.300
WITH $10,000 SET AS
THE MINIMUM BUY-IN.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:24.530
FORTUNES HAVE BEEN MADE AND
LOST BUT THE BIGGEST WINNER

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.800
IS TUNICA ITSELF WITH THE
CASINOS NOW PROVIDING

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.960
WORK FOR 10,000 PEOPLE
AND GENERATING ENOUGH

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.830
TAX REVENUE TO
PROVIDE BETTER SCHOOLS,

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:39.430
BETTER ROADS, AND A
BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:47.130
WHAT EFFECT ALL THIS GLITZY
THEME PARKED WEALTH WILL HAVE

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.500
ON THE CULTURE AND
MUSIC OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.700
WE'LL HAVE TO
WAIT AND SEE.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.760
ONE THING IS CERTAIN... TUNICA'S
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS STORY

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.060
SEEMS TO BE THE
EXCEPTION, NOT THE RULE.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:06.160
AS THE RIVER SEEPS DEEPER INTO
THE SOUTH AND INTO THE FAMOUS

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.930
REGION KNOWN AS THE MISSISSIPPI
DELTA WHAT WE WILL SEE IS A

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.600
PLACE THAT MAY NO LONGER BE
BOUND BY SLAVERY BUT IS STILL

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.500
TODAY BOUND BY THE CHAINS
OF MODERN DAY POVERTY.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.000
WE'LL ALSO CATCH GLIMPSES
OF ITS COTTON RICH PAST,

THE MANSIONS
AND VAST ESTATES

OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.800
AS THE MISSISSIPPI
FLOODED AND RECEDED

LAND AND ITS COTTON PLANTATIONS

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.600
WAS ALWAYS ENJOYED BY A
MINORITY OF LOCAL WHITE MASTERS

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.900
BUT ITS RICH
CULTURAL HERITAGE

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.900
FOUND ITS WAY TO THE
REST OF THE WORLD.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.860
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF
THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.400
LIES THE
HOBSON PLANTATION.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.600
IT'S STILL A WORKING FARM
WHICH HAS BEEN OWNED

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.060
BY THE SAME FAMILY
FOR NEARLY 150 YEARS.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.300
BUT LIFE ISN'T EASY HERE
EVEN FOR THE ONCE WEALTHY

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.930
WHITE POPULATION.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.400
EVER SINCE THE DEMAND
FOR COTTON DECREASED

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.500
WITH CHEAPER CROPS BEING
PRODUCED ELSEWHERE

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.030
IN THE WORLD, HOBSON'S
HAS HAD TO DIVERSIFY

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.900
AND IS NOW A STRUGGLING
TOURIST ATTRACTION

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:29.200
AS WELL AS A
STRUGGLING FARM.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.630
DAVID "HONEYBOY" EDWARDS
REMEMBERS THIS PLACE

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:35.530
WHEN IT WAS A BUSY
PLANTATION, WITH HIS FAMILY

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:42.200
ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS DOING
ALL THE COTTON PICKING WORK.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.530
AT 92, HONEYBOY IS THE
LAST LIVING DELTA BLUESMAN

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.360
AND THE TRUE EMBODIMENT
OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.800
AND ITS CULTURE.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.900
HONEYBOY WAS PART OF A
SUBCULTURE OF BLUES ARTISTS

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.430
WHO WERE REFUGEES FROM
THE PLANTATION SYSTEM.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.700
THESE MEN LIVED
ON THE WILD SIDE

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.460
BUT THEIR SONGS CAME
OUT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:29.060
IN THE BACK BREAKING,
HOT, SWELTERING DAYS

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.560
THEY WOULD COMMUNICATE
WITH EACH OTHER BY CALLING

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.600
AND ANSWERING IN
RHYME AND SONG.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:17.500
>>HONEYBOY GREW
UP WITH THE BLUES.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.700
HE WAS BORN IN THESE FIELDS,
THE GRANDSON OF A SLAVE

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.130
AND THE SON OF
A SHARECROPPER.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.930
SHARECROPPING WAS
A TENANCY AGREEMENT

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.830
WHICH ALLOWED FORMER
SLAVES TO RENT OUT

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.660
A THIN STRIP OF LAND
AND WORK IT THEMSELVES,

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.160
BUT IN EFFECT IT BOUND
THE BLACK WORKERS

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.330
EVER MORE CLOSELY
TO THEIR MASTERS.

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.530
THE SHARECROPPERS HAD
TO GIVE HALF THEIR CROP

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.560
TO THE PLANTATION
OWNERS AND PAY BACK

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.960
NEARLY ALL THEIR
PROFITS IN RENT.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.500
THEY ENDED UP OWING MONEY
AND SO WERE KEPT IN CHAINS

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:54.060
AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY
EVER HAD BEEN AS SLAVES.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.800
>>HONEYBOY KNEW HE
HAD TO GET OUT SOMEHOW

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:25.560
AND SO ON HIS 17TH BIRTHDAY
HE PICKED UP HIS GUITAR,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.460
KISSED HIS MAMA ON
THE CHEEK, AND WENT OUT

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:34.830
TO FOLLOW HIS DREAM
OF BECOMING A BLUESMAN.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.930
EVER SINCE SLAVES TRAVELED
UPSTREAM TO THE FREEDOM

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.800
OF THE NORTH, AFRICAN
AMERICANS ALWAYS CHOSE TO

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.930
FOLLOW THE RIVER ROUTE
WHENEVER THEY WENT TRAVELING.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:48.400
HONEYBOY DID THE SAME, KNOWING
THAT THE BLACK COMMUNITIES

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.200
WHICH HAD SETTLED ALONG
THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.330
WOULD PROVIDE HIM WITH
A SAFE HAVEN AFTER DARK.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:05.430
♪

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:12.200
♪

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.130
TODAY, HONEYBOY IS STILL
TRAVELING UP AND DOWN

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:18.060
THE MISSISSIPPI, PLAYING
HIS BLUES TO DELTA FOLK

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.000
AND IS STILL ENJOYING HIS
ROCK AND ROLL LIFESTYLE

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.560
WITH WOMEN
DANCING AT HIS FEET.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.760
COTTON IS STILL GROWN IN THESE
FIELDS BUT MOST OF THE FARMS

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.100
ARE NOW RUN BY BIG
CORPORATE ORGANIZATIONS

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.260
AND THE MANSIONS HAVE BEEN
BOUGHT UP BY RICH BUSINESSMEN

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.000
WHO FANCIED A HOLIDAY
HOME IN THE SOUTH.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.530
MACHINES DO MOST OF THE
HARVESTING WORK WITH MANY

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:52.460
DELTA DWELLERS HAVING TO MOVE
OUT TO FIND JOBS ELSEWHERE.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.230
FOR THOSE THAT REMAIN,
IT STILL SEEMS THAT

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.760
IT'S THE AFRICAN AMERICANS
THAT DO THE HARD WORK

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.300
WHILE WHITE
MANAGERS LOOK ON.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.160
OVER THE YEARS MANY PEOPLE
HAVE REAPED THE REWARDS

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.100
THAT THE MISSISSIPPI
HAS BROUGHT -

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.460
THE RICH SOIL, THE TRADE,
THE DIVERSE CULTURE.

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.730
BUT ALL THIS IS JUST
PART OF THE STORY.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.300
THERE'S ALSO A VERY
DARK UNDERCURRENT

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.660
THAT FLOWS THROUGH
THESE WATERS.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.560
THIS IS AN AWESOME
RIVER WHICH CAN CAUSE

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.430
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
ON A MASSIVE SCALE.

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.300
WHEN HURRICANE KATRINA
HIT NEW ORLEANS IN 2005

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.760
THE WORLD REALIZED THE
FULL EXTENT OF ITS FORCE.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.600
BUT IT WAS ONLY AFTER
THE WATERS HAD RECEDED

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.300
THAT THE REAL TRUTH
FINALLY SURFACED.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:10.000
THE FLOOD WAS NOT JUST AN ACT OF
GOD, IT WAS A MAN-MADE DISASTER

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.760
WHICH SHOULD
HAVE BEEN AVERTED.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:19.200
A SYSTEM OF LEVEES OSTENSIBLY
BUILT TO PROTECT THE POPULATION

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.860
HAD ACTUALLY PUT THEM IN
THE GRAVEST OF DANGER.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.160
A LESSON WHICH SHOULD HAVE
BEEN LEARNED FROM THE PAST

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.630
BECAUSE ALL THIS AND WORSE
HAD HAPPENED BEFORE.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.030
IN 1927, A MASSIVE
FLOOD ENGULFED

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.400
THE WHOLE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI REGION

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.400
WITH ITS EPICENTER IN THE LITTLE
DELTA TOWN OF GREENVILLE.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.430
FROM CAIRO TO NEW ORLEANS,
70,000 SQUARE KILOMETERS

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.700
BECAME COVERED IN UP
TO 15 METERS OF WATER,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.260
WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE LOSING THEIR HOMES,

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.560
THEIR LAND,
AND THEIR LIVES.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.560
TWO OF THOSE WHO
SURVIVED THE FLOOD

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.430
ARE KATHERINE
AND ELLIS SMITH.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.300
THE MISSISSIPPI
HAS NO PREJUDICE,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:16.100
IT DISPLACED AND KILLED
BLACK AND WHITE ALIKE.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.030
ELLIS AND HIS FAMILY WERE
POOR SUBSISTENCE FARMERS

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.360
WHO HAD WORKED THIS
LAND FOR GENERATIONS.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.700
LIVING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF
GREENVILLE RIGHT IN THE HEART

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.600
OF THE DELTA, THEY WERE USED TO
THE FLOODS, GRATEFUL TO THEM,

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.630
IN FACT, FOR IRRIGATING THEIR
CROPS AND RENEWING THEIR SOIL.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:51.860
BUT THAT FATEFUL
WINTER THE RAINS CAME

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.400
IN BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.660
THEY FELL FROM THE SKY
LIKE CRASHING WAVES

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.630
BEATING DOWN ON
THOSE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.160
THE RICH TOWNSFOLK
AND PLANTATION OWNERS

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.960
HAD THE MEANS TO MOVE
AWAY TO HIGHER GROUND

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.100
BUT THE POOR
WERE LEFT BEHIND

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:14.360
AS THE RAIN FELL
AND THE RIVER ROSE.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.030
>>KATHERINE SMITH
LIVED ON HIGHER GROUND

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:14.900
AWAY FROM
THE LEVEES.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.300
AS A YOUNG GIRL OF SIX, SHE
WATCHED IN HORROR AS WHOLE

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:25.100
FAMILIES SCRAMBLED TO FIND
ANYTHING THAT WOULD FLOAT.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:30.030
MY MOTHER HAD A FRIEND WHO
HAD THREE OR FOUR CHILDREN

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.100
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO
MOVE TO ANOTHER PLACE

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:36.030
THAT WAS HIGHER
AND IN THE MOVE

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.900
ONE OF HER CHILDREN FELL
IN THE RIVER AND DROWNED.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.400
THEY COULDN'T GET HIM.
IT WAS JUST TERRIBLE.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.060
I REMEMBER HOW AWFUL I
FELT ABOUT THAT, YOU KNOW.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:53.630
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND
IT BUT THEY LOST HIM.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:59.130
>>THE MISSISSIPPI HAS FLOODED
THESE LANDS FOR THOUSANDS

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:03.060
OF YEARS, BUT IN THE PAST
EXCESS WATER SIMPLY GOT

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.260
SOAKED UP BY THE RIVER'S
NATURAL FLOOD PLAIN.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.660
FROM THE 1800'S, HOWEVER,
MAN DECIDED THAT HE WANTED

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.360
TO CONTROL THE RIVER AND SO
FLOOD DEFENSES, OR LEVEES,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.900
WERE BUILT BY THE ARMY
CORPS OF ENGINEERS

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:22.000
TO CONFINE THE MISSISSIPPI
IN A NARROW CHANNEL.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.030
THESE SOLID BANKS OF
EARTH WERE DESIGNED TO

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:29.160
PREVENT FUTURE FLOODING,
BUT JUST TWO MONTHS AFTER

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.960
THE FLOOD SYSTEM WAS
COMPLETED, THE RISING WATERS,

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.460
FORCED INTO A NARROW
CHANNEL BY THE LEVEES,

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.660
TURNED THE MISSISSIPPI
INTO A VOLCANO OF A RIVER

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:44.960
WHICH ERUPTED ONTO THE
LAND LIKE AN ANGRY SEA.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.900
AS THE WATERS GRADUALLY
SUBSIDED AND THE POOR

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.960
AND DESTITUTE MADE THEIR WAY
BACK TO FIND THEIR FAMILIES

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.400
AND REBUILD THEIR BROKEN
LIVES, IT WAS CLEAR TO ALL

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:01.100
THAT THE MISSISSIPPI
WAS NOT TO BE ENSLAVED.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.260
IF MAN WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH
TO TRY AND CONTROL NATURE,

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.030
OL' MAN RIVER WOULD
ALWAYS, SOMETIMES VIOLENTLY,

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:12.360
BREAK FREE
OF HIS CHAINS.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.730
BUT SOME LESSONS
ARE NEVER LEARNED.

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.630
ONE OF THE MAJOR STRUCTURES
ALONG THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.830
IS THE OLD RIVER CONTROL
WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN 1963.

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:36.760
TO ITS EAST IS THE
STATE OF MISSISSIPPI

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.960
AND TO THE WEST
LOUISIANA.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:47.400
FOR 100 YEARS OR SO, THE
MISSISSIPPI HAD BEEN DIVERTING

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:52.000
MORE AND MORE OF ITS FLOW TO A
SMALLER DISTRIBUTORY CHANNEL.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.130
BUT THE ARMY CORPS OF
ENGINEERS WARNED THAT

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:57.700
IF THIS PROCESS WERE
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.430
THEN IT WOULD HAVE MAJOR
ECONOMIC REPERCUSSIONS

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.660
FOR THE
WHOLE COUNTRY.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.700
ALL THE HEAVY INDUSTRIES
ALONG THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.160
USE HUGE AMOUNTS OF
WATER IN THEIR PRODUCTION.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.400
IF THEY LOST THEIR SUPPLY
THEY'D LOSE THEIR BUSINESS,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.630
AND SO THE OLD RIVER
CONTROL WAS BUILT WITH GIANT

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.430
FLOOD GATES THAT COULD BE
OPENED AND CLOSED AS NEEDED

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:28.730
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE
MISSISSIPPI STAYED ON TRACK.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.860
THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER IS
THE COURSE IT WOULD HAVE

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.160
TAKEN TODAY IF MAN
HAD NOT INTERFERED.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.860
THIS SMALL DISTRIBUTORY
CHANNEL OF THE MISSISSIPPI

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.560
FLOWS OUT OF THE DELTA AND
INTO THE STATE OF LOUISIANA,

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.800
ONE OF THE MOST CULTURALLY
DIVERSE REGIONS IN AMERICA.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:51.030
BUT LIKE THE DELTA, ALSO
ONE OF ITS POOREST.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.830
THERE ARE 37 MILLION POOR
HIDDEN IN THE LAND OF PLENTY

00:35:55.830 --> 00:36:00.260
AND MOST OF THEM
LIVE IN THE SOUTH.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.160
MANY FAMILIES HERE SURVIVE
ON EXTREMELY LOW WAGES

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.300
WITH A QUARTER OF ALL
LOUISIANA'S CHILDREN

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:10.860
LIVING IN
ABJECT POVERTY.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.700

BUT A COUPLE OF MILES
TO THE NORTH OR EAST,

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.960
THE CAJUN BRAVURA
AND THE VOODOO SPELLS

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.830
FALL AWAY LIKE A
MARDI GRAS MASK,

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:51.830
THE STREETS FALL QUIET AND
THE CITY BECOMES A DEAD ZONE.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.660
THIS IS THE NINTH WARD -
ONE OF THE LOWER LYING

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.530
AND CONSEQUENTLY
POORER PARTS OF TOWN.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:18.400
MANY, PERHAPS MOST, OF THE
CITY'S DEAD CAME FROM HERE.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.960
AS WAS THE CASE IN
THE FLOOD OF 1927,

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:24.500
THESE PEOPLE SIMPLY
HAD NO MEANS OF ESCAPE.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.600
THE BODIES WERE WASHED
AWAY WITH THE FLOOD WATERS

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.460
OR LEFT TO ROT IN ATTICS,
WITH THE NUMBER OF DEAD

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.760
LATER FOUND HERE EERILY
RECORDED IN BLACK PAINT

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:41.630
ON THE CARCASSES
OF THEIR HOMES.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.430
THE MEMBERS OF THE NEW
WAVE JAZZ BAND WERE BORN

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:46.830
AND BROUGHT
UP IN THE CITY.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:51.130
JULIUS LEWIS REMEMBERS
HOW THINGS USED TO BE.

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:56.500
BEFORE KATRINA THIS PLACE
WAS ALIVE AND UP AND RUNNING.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.600
THERE WAS PEOPLE EVERYWHERE,
BUSINESSES BOOMING

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.930
AND MOST PEOPLE DOWN
HERE OWNED THEIR HOUSES.

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:06.630
THEY WERE SMALL
BUT MOSTLY OWNED.

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:08.860
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY
DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.630
BUT IT WAS VERY BUSY AND
VERY LIVELY, VERY SPIRITED.

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:15.400
THEY HAD THEIR OWN TYPE
OF CULTURE DOWN HERE.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.560
IT'S SO SAD TODAY
TO SEE IT THIS WAY

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:24.930
WITH NO HOUSES
AND NO PEOPLE.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.860
>>ON THE 29TH OF AUGUST,
2005, AS HURRICANE KATRINA

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.930
PASSED TO THE EAST OF THE CITY,
THE FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:37.030
IN NEW ORLEANS FAILED
IN 53 DIFFERENT PLACES

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:42.060
WITH NEARLY EVERY LEVEE IN
THE METRO AREA BREACHED.

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:45.600
PERCY ELLICE SR. WAS
LUCKY ENOUGH TO OWN A CAR

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.360
AND SO HE PILED IT HIGH WITH
AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE COULD

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.830
AND RACED
OUT OF THE CITY.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:53.760
ONCE THE FLOOD HIT, I WENT OUT
TO THE COUNTRY AND TRIED NOT TO

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.760
LOOK AT THE TELEVISION
BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DEPRESSING

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.960
AND I KNEW EVENTUALLY I
WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.330
AND FACE THE REALITY
THAT EVERYTHING WAS GONE

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:03.600
SO MY THOUGHTS WERE
BASICALLY ON REBUILDING

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.230
MY LIFE FROM SCRATCH
AND MAKING IT MUCH BETTER.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.160
THE DISASTER PART, YOU
HAD TO PUT THAT BEHIND YOU

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.900
AND MOVE FORWARD.
YOU CAN'T DWELL ON IT

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.300
BECAUSE ALL THAT'LL DO
IS MAKE YOU DEPRESSED.

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:17.860
YOU GOT TO PICK UP AND
START OVER AND SAY, HEY,

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.660
GOD DOES EVERYTHING FOR
A REASON AND KEEP GOING.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.400
GO WITH THE FLOW.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.530
>>JULIUS HAD NO WAY OUT.
HE GOT TRAPPED IN THE CITY

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.330
AND WAS LUCKY TO
ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE...

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:33.360
BUT HE LOST HIS HOME,
HIS FRIENDS AND HIS FAMILY.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.860
LIKE MOST OF NEW
ORLEANS' MUSICIANS,

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:39.400
HE'S NOW RELOCATED IN ONE OF
THE OTHER TOWNS UPSTREAM

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:44.630
BUT COMES BACK TO
PLAY WITH HIS BAND.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.830
TODAY, NEW ORLEANS IS
FIGHTING FOR ITS LIFE.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.700
THE FLOOD KILLED
NEARLY 2,000 PEOPLE

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.260
AND WASHED
AWAY MANY MORE.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.760
ONLY HALF OF ITS POPULATION
AND ITS MUSICIANS RETURNED

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.260
TO START REBUILDING
THEIR CITY AND THEIR LIVES.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.600
IT'S A STRUGGLE BUT LIKE MANY OF
THE OTHER PLACES WE'VE SEEN

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.860
ALONG OUR JOURNEY, HOPE
LIVES ON HERE IN THE MINDS

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:11.230
AND HEARTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE
SUFFERED AND LOST THE MOST

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.200
AND IN THE MUSIC OF THE
YOUNGER GENERATION.

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.260
THE BELIEF ON THE STREETS
IS THAT IF THE MUSIC SURVIVES

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:21.860
THEN THE SPIRIT OF NEW
ORLEANS WILL LIVE ON.

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.830
MUSIC IS NEW ORLEANS.

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:26.230
WITHOUT MUSIC THERE'D
BE NO NEW ORLEANS.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.130
THE TRADITION, THE BRASS, THE
JAZZ, THE SOUND, THE FLOW...

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:31.260
IT'S WHAT NEW
ORLEANS IS ALL ABOUT.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:33.260
THE TRADITION
MUST GO ON.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.530
YOU MUST PASS IT DOWN,
KEEP IT GOING, REGENERATE IT,

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.630
KEEP THE ENERGY
AND THE FIRE GOING.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:39.130
THIS IS NEW ORLEANS.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.330
NEW ORLEANS IS JAZZ.
WHEN YOU THINK OF JAZZ,

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:44.860
IT'S HERE THAT YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT - NEW ORLEANS.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.730
>>AND SO AS WE COME TO
THE END OF OUR JOURNEY

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:53.360
ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI AND
AS OL' MAN RIVER QUIETLY

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:56.460
RETIRES TO THE SEA
WEARY FROM THE CENTURIES

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:00.830
OF TRADE, TRAVEL, AND INJUSTICE
THAT HE HAS SEEN ALONG THE WAY,

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:03.600
IT IS THE MUSIC AND
THE SPIRIT OF THE PLACE

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.230
THAT WE TAKE WITH US; A
REMINDER THAT NO MATTER

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:11.430
HOW HARD THE STRUGGLE OR
HOW HARSH THE CONDITIONS,

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.700
THE TRUE SPIRIT OF
BOTH MAN AND THE RIVER

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:18.700
JUST KEEPS
ROLLING ALONG.
