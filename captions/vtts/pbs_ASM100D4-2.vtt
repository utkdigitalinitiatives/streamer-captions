00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.000
SHIFTING SUCH VAST AMOUNTS OF
GOLD IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.960
"WAS HUGELY RISKY, OF COURSE,"

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.200
"YET FROM THE ROTHSCHILDS
POINT OF VIEW,"

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.930
THE HEFTY COMMISSIONS
THEY WERE ABLE TO CHARGE

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:05.160
MORE THAN JUSTIFIED THE RISKS.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.100
THE ROTHSCHILDS SOON
BECAME INDISPENSABLE

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.330
TO THE BRITISH WAR EFFORT.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.000

"AND THOUGH A JEW,"

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.330
WE PLACE A GOOD DEAL
OF CONFIDENCE IN HIM.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.200
THE ROTHSCHILDS WERE SO
EFFECTIVE AS WAR FINANCIERS

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.360
BECAUSE THEY HAD A
READY-MADE BANKING NETWORK

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.530
WITHIN THE FAMILY.

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.300
"NATHAN IN LONDON,
AMSCHEL IN FRANKFURT,"

"JAMES IN PARIS,
CARL IN AMSTERDAM,"

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:45.760
AND SALOMON ROVING
WHEREVER NATHAN SAW FIT.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.600
[SPEAKING FRENCH]

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.160
"IF THE PRICE OF GOLD WAS HIGHER
IN, SAY, PARIS THAN IN LONDON,"

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.760
JAMES IN PARIS WOULD SELL...

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.730
AND NATHAN IN LONDON WOULD BUY.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.130
"I THINK THEIR EDGE OVER
FAMILIES LIKE THE BARINGS,"

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.660
"WITH WHOM THEY WERE COMPETING,"

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.900
WAS THAT THEY HAD THEIR BROTHERS

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.500
IN VERY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL
CENTERS AND COUNTRIES.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.300
"NOW, WHETHER THAT
WAS PREMEDITATED,"

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.560
"WHETHER THEY THOUGHT
THAT THROUGH AS THEY
GOT OUT OF THE GHETTOS,"

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.960
"HARD TO BELIEVE THEY
WENT AS FAR AS THAT,"

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.200
"BUT THATS WHAT HAPPENED,
AND ONCE THEY SAW THAT
IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE,"

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.530
I THINK THEY WORKED
ON THAT ADVANTAGE.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.130
"IN MARCH 1815, NAPOLEON
RETURNED TO PARIS"

HIS IMPERIAL AMBITIONS.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.660
"THE ROTHSCHILDS IMMEDIATELY
RAMPED UP THEIR GOLD OPERATION,"

BUYING UP ALL THE
BULLION AND COINS

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.700
THEY COULD LAY THEIR HANDS ON.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:49.000
NATHANS REASON FOR BUYING THIS
HUGE STOCK OF GOLD WAS SIMPLE--

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.200
"HE ASSUMED THAT, AS
WITH ALL NAPOLEONS WARS,"

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.000
THIS WOULD BE A LONG ONE.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.860
"HIS GOLD WOULD BE MORE
AND MORE SOUGHT AFTER,"

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:58.830
AND IT WOULD RISE IN VALUE.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:05.200
IT PROVED TO BE A
NEAR-FATAL MISCALCULATION.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.300
"WELLINGTON FAMOUSLY CALLED
THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO,"

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:16.800

"FOR WELLINGTON, IT WAS
A GLORIOUS VICTORY."

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:35.060
BUT NOT FOR THE ROTHSCHILDS.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.660
NO DOUBT IT WAS GRATIFYING
TO NATHAN ROTHSCHILD

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:40.860
TO BE THE FIRST TO HEAR THE
NEWS OF NAPOLEONS DEFEAT.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.530
"THANKS TO THE SWIFTNESS OF
THE ROTHSCHILD COURIERS,"

BEFORE MAJOR HENRY PERCY

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.860
DELIVERED WELLINGTONS
OFFICIAL DISPATCH

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.200
"BUT NO MATTER HOW
EARLY HE HEARD IT,"

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:56.200
THE NEWS FROM WATERLOO
WAS ANYTHING BUT GOOD

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.530
FROM NATHANS POINT OF VIEW.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.460
HE HAD BARGAINED FOR SOMETHING
MUCH MORE PROTRACTED.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.960
NOW HE AND HIS BROTHERS WERE
SITTING ON TOP OF A PILE OF CASH

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.660

FOR A WAR THAT WAS OVER.

PEACE, THE GREAT ARMIES

COULD BE DISBANDED.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.200
THAT MEANT NO MORE
GOLD FOR SOLDIERS WAGES

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.360
"AND IT MEANT THE PRICE
OF GOLD, WHICH HAD
SOARED DURING THE WAR,"

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:29.160
WOULD FALL.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.600
NATHAN WAS FACED WITH
HEAVY AND GROWING LOSSES.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.630
[HORNS HONK]

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.530
THERE WAS ONLY ONE
POSSIBLE WAY OUT--

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.230
NATHAN COULD USE
THE ROTHSCHILD GOLD

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.900
TO MAKE A MASSIVE
AND HUGELY RISKY BET

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:55.230
ON THE BOND MARKET.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.160

"REPORTED THAT NATHAN HAD MADE
GREAT PURCHASES OF STOCK,"

MEANING BRITISH
GOVERNMENT BONDS.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.960
NATHANS GAMBLE WAS THAT THE
BRITISH VICTORY AT WATERLOO

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:15.260
WOULD SEND THE PRICE OF
BRITISH BONDS SOARING UPWARDS.

"NATHAN BOUGHT, AND AS THE
PRICE OF BONDS BEGAN TO RISE,"

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.460
HE KEPT ON BUYING.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.560
"DESPITE HIS BROTHERS
DESPERATE ENTREATIES TO SELL,"

"WITH BOND PRICES UP BY
40%, HE SOLD HIS HOLDING."

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.100

APPROXIMATELY 600
MILLION POUNDS TODAY.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.600
THE ROTHSCHILDS HAD SHOWN THAT
BONDS WERE MORE THAN JUST A WAY

"FOR GOVERNMENTS TO
FUND THEIR WARS,"

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.260
THEY COULD ALSO BE
BOUGHT AND SOLD IN A WAY

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.960
THAT GENERATED SERIOUS MONEY.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:07.130

"AS MASTERS OF THE BOND MARKET,"

"BUT NOW THEY HAD
BECOME HATED, TOO."

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.230
THE FACT THAT THE
ROTHSCHILDS WERE JEWISH

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.660
GAVE A NEW IMPETUS

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.700
TO DEEP-ROOTED
ANTI-SEMITIC PREJUDICE.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.630

AS PRACTICED BY JEWS.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.330
IT WAS ABOVE ALL THE
ROTHSCHILDS SEEMING ABILITY

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.360
TO PERMIT OR PROHIBIT WARS

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:22.000
THAT AROUSED THE
MOST INDIGNATION.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.460
YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT
THAT THE ROTHSCHILDS

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.960
ACTUALLY NEEDED WAR.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.800

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.830
WOULDNT HAVE NEEDED
TO ISSUE ANY BONDS

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.630

"AND EVEN MORE SO
WITH REVOLUTION,"

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.530
WAS THAT IT INCREASED THE

"MIGHT FAIL TO MEET
ITS COMMITMENTS,"

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.860

OF THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT BONDS.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:05.360
NOW THEY STOOD TO LOSE MUCH MORE
THAN TO GAIN FROM CONFLICT.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.800
THE ROTHSCHILDS HAD
HELPED DECIDE THE OUTCOME

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.060
OF THE NAPOLEONIC WARS

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.330
BY PUTTING THEIR FINANCIAL
WEIGHT BEHIND BRITAIN.

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:16.000
NOW THEY WOULD HELP
DECIDE THE OUTCOME

"AND ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE WORLD,"

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.360
ANOTHER GREAT WAR

BE THE VANQUISHED

WHO MADE THE BIG BET AND LOST.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:05.100
Man: FIRE!

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.800
THERE IS A VIEW THAT
THE KEY TURNING POINT

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.130

IN THE CIVIL WAR,"

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.000
BECAUSE NEW ORLEANS WAS
THE PRINCIPAL OUTLET

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.300
FOR THE SOUTHS MOST
IMPORTANT EXPORT...

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.760
...COTTON.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.830
"WITHOUT CONTROL OVER
THE COTTON TRADE,"

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.630
"THE SOUTHS CAUSE WAS DOOMED,"

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.730
BECAUSE COTTON HAD BECOME
THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.400
IN AN AMBITIOUS SCHEME

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:05.760
TO BRING THE BOND
MARKET INTO THE WAR.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.560
"LIKE THE ITALIAN CITY-STATES
500 YEARS BEFORE,"

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.630
THE CONFEDERATE TREASURY

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.060
HAD INITIALLY RAISED
MONEY FOR THE WAR

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.900
BY SELLING BONDS TO
ITS OWN CITIZENS.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.560
BUT THERE WAS A FINITE AMOUNT OF
CAPITAL AVAILABLE IN THE SOUTH.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.530
"TO SURVIVE, THE CONFEDERACY
LOOKED TO EUROPE"

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.160
IN THE HOPE THAT THE WORLDS
GREATEST FINANCIAL DYNASTY

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.960
"MIGHT HELP THEM
BEAT THE NORTH,"

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:37.300
AS THEY HAD HELPED
WELLINGTON BEAT NAPOLEON.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.800
INITIALLY THE CONFEDERACY
HAD GROUNDS FOR OPTIMISM.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.000
"IN NEW YORK, THE ROTHSCHILDS
AGENT WAS A NORTHERN DEMOCRAT,"

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
"AUGUST BELMONT, WHO OPPOSED
THE REPUBLICAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN"

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.660
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTION OF 1860

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:57.300
AND WOULD DO SO
AGAIN 4 YEARS LATER.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.830
BUT STILL THE
ROTHSCHILDS HESITATED.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.030
LENDING TO THE
BRITISH GOVERNMENT

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.200
"TO HELP DEFEAT NAPOLEON
HAD BEEN ONE THING,"

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.660
BUT BUYING BONDS FROM A BUNCH

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.630
OF BREAKAWAY
SOUTHERN SLAVE STATES

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.500
SEEMED A RISK TOO FAR.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.530
THE ROTHSCHILDS DECIDED

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:22.300
TO STAY OUT.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.560
"YET, DESPITE THIS SETBACK,"

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:26.300
THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT
HAD AN INGENIOUS TRICK

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.630
UP THEIR SLEEVES.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.930
"THE TRICK, LIKE THE
SLEEVES THEMSELVES,"

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:36.030
WAS MADE OF COTTON.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.800
THE SOUTHS IDEA WAS TO
USE COTTON AS COLLATERAL

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.130
TO BACK ITS BONDS.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.330
INVESTORS WOULD BE COMFORTED

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:45.500
"TO KNOW THAT EVEN IF THE
INTEREST PAYMENTS DRIED UP,"

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.830
THEY COULD STILL DEMAND
THEIR COTTON INSTEAD.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.860
THE SOUTHS AGENTS WENT
TO WORK SELLING THE BONDS

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.660
IN THE FINANCIAL
CENTERS OF EUROPE.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.930
WHEN THE CONFEDERACY TRIED
TO MARKET CONVENTIONAL BONDS

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.730
"IN EUROPEAN FINANCIAL
CENTERS LIKE AMSTERDAMS,"

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.260
INVESTORS WOULDNT TOUCH
THEM WITH A BARGE POLE.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:13.160
BUT WHEN AN OBSCURE FRENCH FIRM
NAMED EMILE ERLANGER AND COMPANY

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.830
"OFFERED COTTON-BACKED BONDS,"

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.600
IT WAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORY.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.500
THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS
OF THE ERLANGER BONDS

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.160
WAS THAT THEY COULD BE
CONVERTED INTO COTTON

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:27.630
AT THE PRE-WAR PRICE
OF 6 PENCE A POUND.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.730
THESE COTTON BONDS
FORMED THE BASIS

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.300
OF THE SOUTHS NEW
FINANCIAL STRATEGY.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.100
"IF THEY COULD RESTRICT
THE SUPPLY OF COTTON,"

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.260
ITS VALUE AND THE VALUE OF
THE BONDS WOULD INCREASE.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.260
"AT THE SAME TIME, THE
CONFEDERATES SET OUT"

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:42.760
TO USE COTTON TO BLACKMAIL

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:50.730
THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD--BRITAIN.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.330
Woman: THE GROWTH OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.760
PROVIDED LIVERPOOL WITH
GROWING BONDS OF TRADE...

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.800
"[CONTINUES, INDISTINCT]"

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.060
...DURING THE 1800s.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.000
"Ferguson: IN 1860,
THE PORT OF LIVERPOOL"

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.860
WAS THE PRINCIPAL GATEWAY
FOR IMPORTS OF COTTON

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.300
"TO THE BRITISH
TEXTILE INDUSTRY,"

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.430
THEN THE MAINSTAY OF THE
VICTORIAN INDUSTRIAL ECONOMY.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.330
MORE THAN 80% OF THE COTTON CAME
FROM THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.760
"NOW, THAT GAVE THE
CONFEDERATE LEADERSHIP HOPE"

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.660
THAT THEY HAD THE LEVERAGE
TO BRING IN BRITAIN

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.200
ON THEIR SIDE IN THE CIVIL WAR.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.000
"TO RATCHET UP THE PRESSURE,"

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.860
THEY DECIDED TO
IMPOSE AN EMBARGO

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:33.200
ON ALL SHIPMENTS OF
COTTON TO LIVERPOOL.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:37.100
"FOR A WHILE, THE SOUTHS
STRATEGY WORKED BRILLIANTLY."

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.460
COTTON PRICES SOARED.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.830
SO DID THE VALUE
OF THE CONFEDERATES

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.030
COTTON-BACKED BONDS.

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.130
AND THE COTTON EMBARGO
DEVASTATED THE BRITISH ECONOMY.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:50.230
MILLS WERE FORCED
TO LAY OFF WORKERS.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.560
"EVENTUALLY, IN LATE 1862,"

00:33:52.560 --> 00:34:01.130
PRODUCTION ALL BUT CEASED.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:04.160
"THIS COTTON MILL IN STYAL,
SOUTH OF MANCHESTER,"

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.660
"EMPLOYED AROUND 400 WORKERS,"

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.430
"BUT THAT WAS JUST A FRACTION
OF THE 500,000 PEOPLE EMPLOYED"

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:12.830
BY KING COTTON
ACROSS LANCASHIRE.

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:14.030
"OBVIOUSLY, WITH NO COTTON,"

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:17.530
THERE WAS NOTHING
FOR PEOPLE TO DO.

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.860
HALF THE ENTIRE WORKFORCE OF
LANCASHIRE HAD BEEN LAID OFF.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:24.260
A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION
WAS ON POOR RELIEF.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.200
"THEY CALLED IT
THE COTTON FAMINE,"

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.930
BUT THIS REALLY WAS
A MANMADE FAMINE.

00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:34.660
"BRITAIN WAS IN THE DOLDRUMS,"

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:38.200
AND THE SOUTHS COTTON
BONDS WERE RIDING HIGH.

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.800
YET THE SOUTHS ABILITY TO
MANIPULATE THE BOND MARKET

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.300
DEPENDED ON ONE
OVERRIDING CONDITION--

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.660
THAT INVESTORS COULD BE SURE
OF TAKING PHYSICAL POSSESSION

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.900
OF THE COTTON WHICH
UNDERPINNED THE BONDS

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:57.730
IF THE SOUTH FAILED TO
MAKE ITS INTEREST PAYMENTS.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.830
AND THATS WHY THE
FALL OF NEW ORLEANS

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.200
"ON APRIL THE 28th, 1862,"

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.300
WAS THE REAL TURNING POINT
IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.960
"NOW THAT THE SOUTHS MAIN
PORT WAS IN UNION HANDS,"

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.200
ANY INVESTOR WHO WANTED TO LAY
HIS HANDS ON SOUTHERN COTTON

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:19.100
HAD TO RUN THE UNIONS
FORMIDABLE NAVAL BLOCKADE.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:31.830
[EXPLOSIONS]

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.060
THE CONFEDERATES HAD
OVERPLAYED THEIR HAND.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:37.330
THEY HAD TURNED
OFF THE COTTON TAP

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.960
BUT THEN LOST THE ABILITY
TO TURN IT BACK ON.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.500
"BY 1863, THE MILLS
OF LANCASHIRE"

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.760
HAD FOUND NEW SOURCES OF COTTON

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.200
"IN CHINA, EGYPT AND INDIA,"

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.330
AND INVESTORS WERE
RAPIDLY LOSING FAITH

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.530
IN THE SOUTHS
COTTON-BACKED BONDS.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:55.430
THE CONSEQUENCES FOR
THE CONFEDERATE ECONOMY

00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.960
WERE DISASTROUS.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.200
WITH ITS DOMESTIC
BOND MARKETS EXHAUSTED

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.060
"AND ONLY 2 PALTRY
FOREIGN LOANS,"

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.130
THE CONFEDERACY REALLY
HAD NO ALTERNATIVE

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.230
BUT TO PRINT PAPER DOLLARS
LIKE THESE ONES HERE

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.030
IN THE LOUISIANA STATE MUSEUM

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.600

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.500
"IN ALL, $1.7 BILLION WORTH."

ALSO PRINTED PAPER MONEY,"

"ITS GREENBACKS WERE STILL
WORTH AROUND 50 PRE-WAR CENTS,"

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.900
WHEREAS A SOUTHERN GRAYBACK
WAS DOWN TO JUST 1 CENT.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.930
"WHATS MORE, WITH MORE
AND MORE OF THIS CASH"

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.660
"CHASING FEWER AND FEWER GOODS,"

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.160
INFLATION IN THE
SOUTH SIMPLY EXPLODED.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.100
"BY JANUARY 1865, THE
PRICE OF SOME GOODS"

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:52.330
WAS UP BY A FACTOR OF 90.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.260
"THE ROTHSCHILDS, MEANWHILE,"

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.100
WHO HAD REFUSED TO BACK
THE CONFEDERATE BONDS

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.830
"AND SO HASTENED
THE SOUTHS DEMISE,"

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.330
HAD AMASSED SO MUCH MONEY

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.730
THAT THEIR WEALTH HAD
BECOME PROVERBIAL.

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.030
"AS THE POET HEINRICH
HEINE OBSERVED,"

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.960
"MONEY IS THE GOD OF OUR TIME,"

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:18.060
AND ROTHSCHILD IS HIS PROPHET.

"HEINE WAS ALSO STRUCK BY THE
WAY THAT FINANCIAL WEALTH,"

"PERSONIFIED BY
THE ROTHSCHILDS,"

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.730
POSED A REVOLUTIONARY CHALLENGE

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:33.330
TO THE OLD WEALTH OF THE
EUROPEAN ARISTOCRACY.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:36.160
PROPERTY OWNERSHIP
WAS ONCE THE PRESERVE

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:38.960
OF AN ARISTOCRATIC ELITE.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:43.030
ESTATES WERE PASSED
DOWN FROM FATHER TO SON

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.860
ALONG WITH TITLES AND
POLITICAL PRIVILEGES.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.060
EVERYONE ELSE WAS A MERE TENANT

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.130
PAYING RENT TO THEIR LANDLORD.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.200
EVEN THE RIGHT TO
VOTE IN ELECTIONS

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.300
WAS ORIGINALLY A FUNCTION
OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:03.330
"IN ONE RESPECT, NOT MUCH
HAS CHANGED IN BRITAIN"

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:04.230

"AROUND 40 MILLION ARE OWNED
BY JUST 189,000 FAMILIES."

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.260
THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT
THEY NO LONGER MONOPOLIZE

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.530
THE POLITICAL SYSTEM.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.830
"INDEED, THANKS TO REFORM

PHASED OUT OF PARLIAMENT.

SUCCESSFUL NARCO STATE.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.560
"AS JARDINE HAD PREDICTED,"

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:40.860
THE ROYAL NAVY MADE SHORT
WORK OF THE CHINESE DEFENSES.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.900
"WITH SOUTHWESTERN CHINA
UNDER BRITISH CONTROL,"

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.560
THE OPIUM TRADE WAS
GIVEN FREE REIGN.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.500
DRUG ADDICTION EXPLODED.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.460
LARGE TRACTS OF THE COUNTRY SLID

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.360
INTO REBELLION AND ANARCHY.

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.800
"BUT FOR JARDINE, MATHESON,"

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.100
"WITH THEIR HEAD OFFICE NOW
ESTABLISHED IN HONG KONG,"

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.600
THE GLORY DAYS OF
VICTORIAN GLOBALIZATION

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:09.300
HAD ARRIVED.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.360
"BY 1900, THE FIRM
HAD DIVERSIFIED"

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.230
INTO MORE RESPECTABLE
LINES OF BUSINESS.

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.960
"IT HAD ITS OWN BREWERIES,
ITS OWN COTTON MILLS,"

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.100
ITS OWN INSURANCE COMPANY

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.400
"AND ITS OWN RAILWAYS,"

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:30.500
LIKE THE ONE THEY BUILT
FROM KOWLOON TO CANTON.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.130
"BACK IN 1913, AN
INVESTOR IN LONDON"

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.730
"HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY RANGE
OF FOREIGN OPPORTUNITIES,"

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.100
AND NOTHING
ILLUSTRATES THAT BETTER

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.300
THAN THE LEDGERS OF N.M.
ROTHSCHILD AND SONS.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.900
JUST A SINGLE PAGE FROM 1913

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.330
"LISTS NO FEWER THAN 20
DIFFERENT FOREIGN SECURITIES,"

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:51.660
"INCLUDING BONDS ISSUED
BY CHILE, EGYPT,"

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:53.630
"GERMANY, HUNGARY, ITALY,"

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.960
"NOT FORGETTING 11 DIFFERENT
RAILWAY COMPANIES,"

00:49:55.960 --> 00:50:00.660
"INCLUDING 4 FROM ARGENTINA, 2
FROM CANADA, AND DOWN HERE,"

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:07.100
THE GOOD OLD KOWLOON
TO CANTON RAILWAY LINE.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.030
"FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY,"

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:11.200
THE WORLD ECONOMY
WAS TRULY UNITED

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.130
BY A COMBINATION OF LOW TRADE

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.530
AND HIGH FINANCE.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.800
"YET, THIS FIRST ERA OF
FINANCIAL GLOBALIZATION"

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.030
WAS TO BE BROUGHT
TO A VIOLENT HALT

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:31.700
BY THE WORLDS FIRST
TRULY GLOBAL CONFLICT.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.060
"ON JUNE THE 28th, 1914,"

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:37.560
"THE HEIR TO THE AUSTRIAN
THRONE, THE ARCHDUKE
FRANZ FERDINAND,"

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:41.700
"WAS ASSASSINATED IN THE
BOSNIAN CAPITAL, SARAJEVO."

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.060
"INITIALLY, FINANCIAL MARKETS
SHRUGGED OFF THE NEWS"

00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:50.560
AS JUST ANOTHER BOUT
OF BALKAN BLOODSHED.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.830
"IN REALITY, THE
ASSASSINATION HAD SPARKED
OFF A CHAIN REACTION"

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:56.800
IN THE WORLDS FINANCIAL MARKETS.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.130
AS INVESTORS BELATEDLY
GRASPED THE LIKELIHOOD

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:01.730
"OF A FULL-SCALE EUROPEAN WAR,"

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:06.200
LIQUIDITY--THE ABILITY TO
BORROW MONEY OR SELL ASSETS--

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.060
WAS SUCKED OUT OF
THE WORLD ECONOMY

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:13.860
AS IF THE BOTTOM HAD
DROPPED OUT OF A BATH.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:17.630
THE RESULTING DISRUPTION
TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCE

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:22.760
SHATTERED GLOBALIZATION.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:25.700
ITS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING
TO FOLLOW THE OUTBREAK

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.900
OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.260
THROUGH THE FINANCIAL
PAGES OF THE LONDON TIMES.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.230
"IT WASNT UNTIL JULY
THE 22nd, 1914,"

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:36.460
THAT ANYBODY APPRECIATED
THAT THE ASSASSINATION

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.560
OF THE ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.060
IN SARAJEVO 3 WEEKS BEFORE

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:43.860
MIGHT HAVE SOME
FINANCIAL REPERCUSSIONS.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:47.400
"JUST 10 DAYS LATER, ON
AUGUST THE 1st, 1914,"

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.930
THE TIMES HAD TO REPORT

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.800
"THE CLOSURE OF THE
STOCK EXCHANGE,"

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.000
"AND CLOSED IT REMAINED UNTIL
JANUARY THE 4th, 1915."

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.760
WHY WERE INVESTORS SO
SEEMINGLY OBLIVIOUS

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:02.230
TO ARMAGEDDON JUST DAYS BEFORE
THE OUTBREAK OF WORLD WAR?

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.500
"WELL, THE ANSWER IS
THAT A COMBINATION"

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.230
OF FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:13.330
HAD MADE THE WORLD SEEM
REASSURINGLY SAFE.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:16.860
"THE LIGHTS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
WERE FLASHING GREEN, NOT RED,"

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.730
UNTIL THE VERY EVE
OF DESTRUCTION.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:24.300
"THERE MAY BE A LESSON
HERE FOR OUR TIME, TOO."

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.830
FINANCIAL GLOBALIZATION MARK I

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.260
"TOOK A GENERATION TO ENGINEER,"

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.300
"BUT IT WAS BLOWN APART
IN A MATTER OF DAYS,"

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.560
AND IT WOULD TAKE
MORE THAN A GENERATION

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:48.330
TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE DONE
BY THE GUNS OF AUGUST 1914.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.900
SO IS NOTHING WE CAN
DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.360
FROM THE THREAT OF
FINANCIAL DISASTER?

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.360
"NEXT TIME ON THE
ASCENT OF MONEY,"

00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:00.200
WELL SEE THAT FINANCE
IS AS MUCH ABOUT RISK

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.960
AS IT IS ABOUT RETURN.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.460
"THE BIG QUESTION
IS, ARE YOU INSURED,"

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:09.130
OR ARE YOU HEDGED?

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:11.730
"NEXT TIME ON THE
ASCENT OF MONEY,"

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.630
SAVING UP FOR THE
PROVERBIAL RAINY DAY

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.630
IS THE FIRST PRINCIPLE
OF INSURANCE.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.160
HOW SHOULD WE DEAL WITH THE
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.430
OF THE FUTURE?

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.730
THIS WALL OF WATER

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.100
HAD TO BE MAYBE 15
TO 20 FEET TALL.

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:25.200
AND MOVING FAST.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.530
"MOVING QUICKLY, JUST
COMING DOWN THIS BOULEVARD"

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:29.830
AND JUST TAKING EVERYTHING
WITH IT AS IT WOULD COME.

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:32.830
THE WORLD CAN BE
A DANGEROUS PLACE.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.300
ARE YOU INSURED?

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.960
THE ASCENT OF MONEY--

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:40.060
A FINANCIAL HISTORY
OF THE WORLD.

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:43.430
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT
THE ASCENT OF MONEY

00:53:43.430 --> 00:54:07.100
"AND WATCH THE FILM, VISIT..."

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:37.230
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE
BY FRIENDS OF NCI

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.630
FUNDING FOR THE ASCENT OF MONEY

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:41.200
WAS PROVIDED BY...

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:44.560
"MY IDEA CREATED JOBS
FOR 2,000 PEOPLE."

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.460
MY IDEA WILL BRING RENEWABLE
ENERGY TO EVERYONE.

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.530
AN ENTREPRENEUR WITH AN
IDEA CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:52.530
I HAVE AN IDEA.
