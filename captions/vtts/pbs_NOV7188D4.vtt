00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.000
NARRATOR: One question:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.460
Why is there such a
stunning diversity of life?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.830
One answer: Evolution.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.760
Charles Darwins brilliant theory

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.730
that explains how
species adapt and change.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.630
Its been called the best
idea anyone ever had.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.800
But theres one big problem:

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.160
How does it actually work?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.360
Now, extraordinary science
is answering that question.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.000
It is uncovering the
hidden mechanisms

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.030
inside creatures bodies

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.830
that can explain astonishing
transformations,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.060
like how birds can
evolve from dinosaurs...

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.030
why a fish was once
your ancestor...

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.460
and, above all,
what makes us human.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.330
Right now on NOVA,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:33.960
youll find out what
Darwin never knew.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:47.360
NARRATOR: The Tree of
Life on earth is one
of stunning diversity.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.630
9.000 species of birds.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.830
350,000 kinds of beetles.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.830
28,000 types of fish.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.060
Two million living
species and counting.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.930
And we are just one of them.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.260
(birds calling)

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.530
But why is there such an
amazing variety of animals?

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.700
Why are there so
many types of fish?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.830
So many different
species of beetle?

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.160
How did this extraordinary

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.660
profusion of life
on earth come about?

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.060
Today, we celebrate the man

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.930
who would ultimately
answer that question.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.660
Charles Darwin.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.330
He was born 200 years ago

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.660
and it is 150 years since
he published the work

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.830
that has become the bedrock

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.830
of our understanding
of life on earth.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.200
CLIFF TABIN: What Darwin wanted

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.160
to understand was how you get

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.130
this extraordinary
diversity of life on earth.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160
He was spot on.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.800
He really nailed it.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.560
NARRATOR: Darwins
theory of evolution--

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.800
his account of why
species adapt and change--

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.860
has been called the best
idea anyone ever had.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.930
But even Darwin admitted that
his work was incomplete.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.260
Vast questions were
still unanswered.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.630
And the biggest
question was: How?

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.900
How did evolution take place?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.600
SEAN CARROLL: He didnt
know any of the mechanics
of that process.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.500
He didnt understand
the physical forces

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.700
that would actually change
the way species appeared.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.160
NARRATOR: But today,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:18.260
we can answer the questions
that Darwin could not.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.000
We can look under
the hood of evolution

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.530
and see exactly how
this mysterious process

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.630
gives rise to such
astounding diversity.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.600
TABIN: Whats incredible
about this time

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.360
from a scientific
perspective is,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.560
were going to be able to
understand that diversity.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.030
And that just adds
to the excitement.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.800
It doesnt demystify it.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.400
It makes it all
the more magical.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.130
NARRATOR: And this is the magic
and mystery of evolution.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.530
Over eons of time, a single
species gives rise to many.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.900
An ancient fish evolves
to become the ancestor

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.130
of all four-limbed
animals, even us.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.360
And one species, our own,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.660
develops a large and
uniquely complex brain,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.500
enabling us to
dominate the planet.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.260
This is the search
for the answers

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:19.030
to what Darwin never knew.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.300
(children chattering)

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.900
Darwin began his love
affair with nature
when he was a child,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.230
just like many of
his modern followers,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.400
including evolutionary
biologist, Sean Carroll.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.200
CARROLL: I developed my interest
in animals the same way I think

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.530
most biologists did,
which was either

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.730
going out in the backyard
or going to zoos.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.160
And anytime I got a
chance, Id flip over logs

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.130
and look for salamanders

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.030
and snakes and frogs
and things like this.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.860
And I was just fascinated with
their patterns and behavior.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.530
NARRATOR: So it was with
the young Charles Darwin.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.560
CARROLL: Young Charles liked to
traipse around the outdoors.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.460
He loved to collect
beetles and things.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.060
He was a completely
ordinary kid.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.500
And he didnt like school.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.200
In fact, he was such a poor
student that his father,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.060
a rather successful physician
and a pretty imposing figure,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.130
was worried about Darwins
direction in life.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.800
NARRATOR: So his father
packed him off to Edinburgh,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:28.800
the finest medical school in
Europe, to become a doctor.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:34.060
But young Charles was
just too squeamish.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.060
CARROLL: And he was really
horrified by medical school.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.660
He witnessed an
operation on a child

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.630
and this is in the era
before anesthetics.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:52.300
And he just fled the operating
theater vowing never to return.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.330
NARRATOR: Next,
his father sent him

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.330
to Cambridge to
study for the clergy.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.300
He didnt succeed
at that either,

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.400
but he did find his
direction in life,

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.960
reviving his childhood
interest in nature.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.360
CARROLL: Darwin starts on his
path to his divinity degree

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.760
and he starts to
mature as a student.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.260
He becomes more serious
about some subjects,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.800
particularly natural history,
and he learns a lot more

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.000
about botany and about
geology and these things.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.100
Hes becoming a pretty
solid field scientist.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.430
NARRATOR: His reputation
as a naturalist

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.430
gained him a
spectacular invitation.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.800
CARROLL: Charles
was offered a place

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.530
on the British Navy
ship the HMS Beagle,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:41.900
whose mission was to survey the
waters around South America.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.500
Now, the captain of the Beagle
wanted a well-educated,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.960
scientific person aboard,
and a dinner companion,

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.800
somebody to share
conversation with.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:08:00.200
And Darwin fit the
bill perfectly.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.630
NARRATOR: And so,
Charles Darwin set off
on a fateful voyage

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.330
that would revolutionize
our understanding

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.960
of lifes great diversity.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.960
The voyage of the Beagle
took nearly five years.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.630
It wove its way from
the Cape Verde islands

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.960
and along the coast of Brazil.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.900
It was in Argentina that he made

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.000
his first important discovery.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.930
CARROLL: Early
on in the voyage,

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.660
Darwin found some
amazing fossils.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.260
He dug up some skulls,
some jaws, some backbones

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.260
of what turned out
to be giant mammals.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.630
Now, these were clearly extinct
and Darwin began to ponder,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.160
what was the relationship
of those fossils

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:57.100
to the living animals
of South America.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.700
NARRATOR: But one port
of call on Darwins voyage

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:06.060
proved more important
than all the others.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:10.000
The Galapagos.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.860
This cluster of 13
isolated islands

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.500
lies 600 miles off the coast of
Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.760
These islands are home
to unusual animals

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.760
found nowhere else on earth.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.000
Penguins that live at the
equator and swim in warm water,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.800
instead of the frigid
seas of the South Pole.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.360
Giant tortoises that
weigh up to 600 pounds.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.730
Iguanas, huge lizards that
swim and dive in the sea.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.200
Everywhere else, they
dwell only on land.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.400
(barking)

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.800
Traveling for the first
time in the Galapagos,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.030
Sean Carroll is seeing
the same creatures

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.630
that so intrigued Darwin.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.100
CARROLL: Of all animals, I
think these marine iguanas

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.630
are the greatest symbol
of the Galapagos,

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.930
what I most wanted to see here.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.700
And to see them in
their native habitat,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.900
blending against
that black rock,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.000
just as Darwin described it...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Its an absolute thrill.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.060
DARWIN (dramatized): Its a
hideous looking creature,

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.660
of a dirty black color,

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.700
stupid and sluggish
in its movements.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.800
Theyre as black as the porous
rocks over which they crawl.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.100
NARRATOR: Darwin
meticulously described
the iguanas in his diary.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.460
But he was far from the
scientific authority

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.960
he would become.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.860
CARROLL: The Darwin
that arrived here

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.330
was not the great theorist
that we know today.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.700
He was a 26-year-old
collector, collecting

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.130
really, almost at random,
any kind of plants,

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.860
any kind of animals,
any kinds of rocks.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.100
He didnt even know the meaning

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.430
of what he was collecting
until much later.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.030
NARRATOR: He was
also fascinated by
the giant tortoises,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.800
which allowed him to
ride on their backs

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.300
as they slowly lumbered around.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.230
DARWIN: I frequently
got on their backs

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.530
and then, upon giving
a few raps on the hinder
part of the shell,

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.960
they would rise
up and walk away.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.060
But I found it very
difficult to keep my balance.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.660
NARRATOR: Darwin measured the
creatures extreme slowness.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.300
About four miles a
day, he calculated.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.600
But the local people knew

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.460
something else
about the tortoises.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.730
(whispering): They
could tell which island
any tortoise came from

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.400
just by looking at its shell.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.930
NARRATOR: Their shells differed

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:52.930
depending on which
island they lived on.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.930
Some tortoises had shells
shaped like a dome.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:08.730
Others had shells arcing over
their heads like a saddle.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.560
Others differed subtly in color.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.660
Or by how much the bottom
of the shell flared out.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.930
Darwin had literally
been sitting on a clue--

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.860
a way to understand the
great diversity of life,

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:35.360
but he didnt yet realize it.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.260
(birds calling)

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:41.530
Instead, Darwin turned
his attention to birds.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.400
The islands were full
of what seemed to be

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:53.000
a familiar assortment
of species.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.360
So, he stuffed
his collecting bag

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.960
with what he thought
were types of finches,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.030
grosbeaks, wrens
and blackbirds.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.700
And then, after five
weeks in the Galapagos,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.800
Darwin and the Beagle went to
other ports in the Pacific

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:16.000
and finally set sail for home.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.560
On board, he started
to sort through

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.160
the vast number of
specimens he had collected

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:28.060
on the five-year voyage.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.800
But it was not until
he returned to Britain

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.700
that he was able to
make sense of them.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.760
It began with a
startling revelation.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.960
All the different
birds he had collected

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:46.530
actually were variations
of a single type.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.930
CARROLL: He learns
that those birds he had
collected on the Galapagos

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:57.760
actually represent 13
different species of finch.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.100
NARRATOR: What
misled Darwin was that they
looked radically different.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.460
Some had wide, tough beaks.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.460
Others had long slender ones.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.560
And these differences depended
on which islands they lived on.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.500
CARROLL: Now, why
would that be?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.460
Why would there be
slightly different birds,

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.100
slightly different species
on different islands

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.730
all in one part of the world?

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.500
NARRATOR: Darwin now thought
back to the Galapagos tortoises.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:33.360
They too differed
from island to island.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.930
His brain began racing.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.300
CARROLL: Thoughts are
starting to crystallize,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.260
take shape in his mind,
bit by bit, bit by bit.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.400
He starts this process he
describes as mental rioting.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.930
Just stream of consciousness

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:50.730
where hes jotting down note
after note after note.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.330
Thoughts as they occur to him.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.930
And finally, they
converge on this one idea.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.960
NARRATOR: What
Darwin now realized

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:13.960
was that somehow, for some
reason, species change.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.460
Originally, there
must have been

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.360
just one type of finch
in the Galapagos,

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.530
but over time it had diversified

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.530
into many kinds, with
different beak shapes.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.460
The same for the tortoises.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.860
One type of tortoise must
have turned into many kinds,

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:43.060
with different shells depending
on which island they lived on.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.730
With this great insight,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.030
Darwin entered
dangerous new territory.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:50.630
The standard view at the time

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.360
was that God had
created every species.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.060
And that what God had
created was perfect

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.560
and could not change.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.000
CARROLL: But Darwin said no.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.900
Why would the Creator
bother with making

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.360
slightly different finches

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.430
for each of these different
islands that all looked alike?

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:17.060
NARRATOR: The prevailing
view just didnt make sense.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.700
But this was only the beginning
of Darwins revolution.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.800
He turned his attention
to the fossils

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.900
he had collected
in South America.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:33.100
One was of a giant sloth.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.800
Another was of a huge
armadillo-like creature.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.130
These animals were extinct,

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.160
but little sloths still
existed in South America.

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.960
And so did smaller armadillos.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.630
What could this mean?

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.760
CARROLL: It dawned on him that
they resembled each other.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.360
So, what he had
found in the ground

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.400
were the buried ancestors of the
living animals of South America.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.600
NARRATOR: So, again,
here was more evidence

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.530
that species changed.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:13.330
Somehow, these ancient giants
must have been transformed

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.360
into the smaller
creatures we see today.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.860
But what Darwin
would later find out

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.960
took this idea of
how species change

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.430
into a completely new league.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:34.360
In Victorian times,
scientists routinely

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.300
studied life-forms at
the embryonic stage.

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.500
How these tiny forms develop
from just a single cell

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.560
into an entire creature
has long been seen

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.860
as one of the wonders of nature.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.330
Watching a developing embryo

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.760
is truly the most glorious
miracle of nature.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.460
I mean, you know, no bologna.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.760
NARRATOR: What Darwin
learned from studying
the embryos amazed him.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.900
In snake embryos, you
could see tiny bumps.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.330
The bony rudiments of legs.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:15.230
But these would never
develop in the adult snake.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.400
Darwin wondered,
Were snakes somehow

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:27.460
descended from
animals with legs?

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.700
He learned that whales, which
have no teeth as adults,

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:36.500
had them as embryos.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:41.860
Those teeth disappeared
before they were born.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.130
To Darwin, it had to mean

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:49.930
whales were descended from
creatures with teeth.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:55.300
But human embryos provided
the most startling evidence.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.300
Under the microscope,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.700
tiny slits around the
neck were clearly visible.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.360
Exactly the same structures
were found in fish.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.730
But in fish, they
turned into gills.

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:18.600
In humans, they became the
bones of our inner ear.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.860
Surely, this showed that humans
must be descended from fish.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.430
Its an astonishing thought.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.900
JUDSON: I dont know about your
ancestors, but mine included

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.700
priests and, you know, the,
the usual, the usual suspects.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.960
But the idea that all
of us have, have fish

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.500
in our family tree,
I think its amazing.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.160
NARRATOR: And
so, Darwin arrived at an
astonishing conclusion,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.900
one that would become
central to his understanding

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.200
of the great diversity of life.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.600
Darwin had this amazingly bold
idea-- the Tree of Life--

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.200
that all species were connected.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.430
And what it meant was,
if you go far enough back

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:06.300
in our family tree of
humans, youll come to fish.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.400
If you go far enough back in
the family tree of birds,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.100
youll come to dinosaurs.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.560
So that creatures that dont look

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.030
anything at all like each other
are actually deeply connected.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:23.760
No one came close to having
this idea before Darwin.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.060
NARRATOR: This seemed
to be an explanation

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.030
for the vast
diversity of animals.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.660
Beginning with a
common ancestor,

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.730
over time across generations,

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.930
species could change
dramatically.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.100
Some might add
new body features.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.600
Others might drop them.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.660
Ultimately, one
type of creature

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.430
could be transformed into
something utterly different.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:57.030
Its a process Darwin called
descent with modification.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.200
But it all begged a question.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.600
Why?

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.460
What was making
creatures change?

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.800
Darwin needed clues.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.730
And he found them in a
very surprising place.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.760
Dogs.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.230
Big, small, fat, tall.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:26.260
The British have long
been obsessed by them.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:34.260
It was a full-blown love
affair in Victorian England.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:39.500
Even Her Majesty was dog crazy.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.530
That love affair
still continues today.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.030
Especially among scientists
like Heidi Parker

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.300
at the National
Institutes of Health.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.230
So, one of the most
interesting things about dogs

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:54.230
is the kind of
variation that you have.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.660
We have dogs the
size of groundhogs

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.030
versus a dog like
Zeppie, the Leonberger,

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.830
who can get to be the
size of a mule deer.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.130
If we had that kind of
size variation in humans,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.960
we would have people running
around the size of Barbie dolls.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.460
NARRATOR: In his day,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.300
Darwin knew this range of sizes
hadnt come about by chance.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.800
Through a careful
process of selection,

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.160
dog breeders mix different dogs

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:27.560
with different physical
traits to create new forms.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.300
Darwin was intrigued
by what he was seeing

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.600
breeders doing with
the domestic dog.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.400
They could select
for individual traits
like size or shape,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.200
and they could actually
change their breed.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.260
NARRATOR: The
Whippet, for example,

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.730
had been developed
to chase rabbits.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.230
It was created by mixing
greyhounds for speed,

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:55.460
with terriers, used
to hunt small game.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.660
And then it hit Darwin.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.960
Was there a similar form of
selection going on in nature,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.800
but without human interference?

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.960
Could natural selection

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.200
explain the great
diversity of life?

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.660
CARROLL: It was brilliant.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.360
He took something very
familiar and comfortable,

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.330
for example, animal breeding,

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.300
and explained that the same sort
of thing was going on in nature

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:28.800
just at a little bit different
pace and with no human guide.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.200
NARRATOR: But what
could be carrying out
selection in the wild?

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:37.300
It was then that Darwin took a
completely fresh look at nature.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.960
The Victorian view of
nature was sentimental.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.800
Lambs lay down with lions.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.060
But Darwins travels
on the Beagle

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:52.400
led him to a different view.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.460
For Darwin, nature was savage.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:04.300
Every creature was
locked in a desperate
struggle for survival,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:22.230
ultimately ending in death.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:28.230
The scale of death in nature
is absolutely horrendous.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.630
And sometimes its not just
that theres a lot of death,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:45.330
but its very unpleasant death.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:51.660
NARRATOR: But in
all this brutal chaos,
Darwin saw a pattern.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.260
CARROLL: Darwin showed that
nature was a battlefield

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.360
and that everything
was in competition.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.960
And this brutal battle,
this war of nature

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:07.960
as Darwin described it, was
actually a creative process.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.600
NARRATOR: The pattern
that Darwin saw

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.930
was that the creatures that
survived were those best adapted

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.800
to the specific
environments they lived in.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:26.860
For instance, some could
handle extremes of climate.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.030
Others were brilliantly
honed killing machines,

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:37.360
perfect for catching
the available prey.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.660
Still others were perfect

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:47.600
to evade those who
might be hunting them.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.300
But how did this
harsh view of nature

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.930
explain the finches
on the Galapagos,

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:56.430
where Darwin observed that the
birds on different islands

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.730
had different beak shapes?

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.930
Somehow, those different beaks

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:10.500
must be helping the
finches survive.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.300
TABIN: The finches of
the Galapagos Islands

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.400
have beaks of many
sizes and shapes.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.900
And theres a reason for that.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.160
They use their beaks as tools.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.130
Now, if you think of the
type of tool you would want

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.430
to crush a seed
thats very tough,

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.330
but is the food that
you really like,

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.260
youd want a beak like this,

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:34.730
which is the type of beak
the ground finch has.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.730
On an island where the
only food is seeds that
are hard to crack,

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:47.500
a short, powerful beak will
mean a finch will survive.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.200
But on another island,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.960
the available food
isnt seeds but flowers.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.100
If you wanted to get into narrow
spaces to get pollen and nectar

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.430
that are very hard to get at,

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.360
you wouldnt need a
big, strong beak,

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.700
youd need a probing beak.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.930
NARRATOR: So, on a
different island,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.930
where you have a
different food source,

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.930
you have a different beak shape.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:13.860
And this pattern was repeated
across the Galapagos.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.000
It seems that the finches beaks

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.800
had altered to fit the diet
of each particular island.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.130
And that was how one
original type of finch

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:35.660
had been transformed into many.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:44.030
But how had these
changes come about?

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:48.760
Here, Darwin had another clue.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.160
He could see it
in his own family.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.760
As every parent knows,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.330
no two children are
ever exactly the same.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.600
Charles looked different
from his brother, Erasmus,

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.800
even though they shared
the same parents.

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:13.600
Charless children looked a bit
like him and his wife Emma.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.500
But they too looked
different from each other.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:21.330
That was something
he called variation.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.330
He realized that not every
individual was the same,

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.800
stamped out like a
toy from a press.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.400
But there was variation.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.500
NARRATOR: Darwin
realized that variation

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.400
must be the starting point
for change in nature.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.360
In any generation, the
animals in a litter

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.700
are never quite the same.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.360
And in the wild,
such a tiny variation

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.130
might make all the difference
between life and death.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.500
Two penguins, for instance,
might differ a tiny bit

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.500
in the thickness
of their blubber--

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.200
a big factor if you
live in extreme cold.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.730
In a harsh climate, the
environment will select

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.430
who will live and who will die.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:15.400
And slowly, Darwin suggested,
over many, many generations,

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.460
these tiny variations would
allow the fit to get fitter

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:26.260
and the unfit would vanish.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.700
These variations accumulate

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.360
and eventually, new
species branch off.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.030
This is evolution by
natural selection.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:44.000
It is one of the keys to
how new species are formed.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.230
And so, in 1859, after years
of painstaking research,

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.460
Darwin finally published
his masterwork,

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.030
On the Origin of Species.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:30:00.660
It is still impossible to
overstate its importance.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.860
It was really a quantum
advance in understanding.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:08.630
It shook people up, it changed
the way people thought.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.600
NARRATOR: Gone was the
idea that all species

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.200
were created perfect
and immutable,

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.360
taken as an article of faith.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.530
In its place, Darwin provided
a proper scientific theory,

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.330
based on facts and observation.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.900
It is much more than the
presentation of simply

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.360
the idea of natural selection.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.260
It is a, its a vision

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.660
of how evolution by
natural selection works.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:42.460
150 years later, his theory
has stood the test of time.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.900
CARROLL: Whats amazing is that
Darwin got so much right.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:52.060
His ideas largely
stay intact today.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.860
NARRATOR: But Darwin himself

00:30:53.860 --> 00:31:00.230
acknowledged that there
were holes in his theory.

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:08.130
He didnt actually
know how it worked.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.760
What was happening
inside a creatures body

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.760
that makes it change?

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:21.760
But now, at last,
modern science is
providing the answers

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:35.300
through a hidden mechanism that
Darwin knew nothing about.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.630
Arizonas Pinacarte Desert
is a harsh and brutal place.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:47.600
Especially if youre
a rock pocket mouse.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.130
NACHMAN: Theyre the
Snickers bar of the desert.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.930
They really are, theyre
eaten by everything.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.200
Theyre probably eaten
by foxes and coyotes

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.260
and rattlesnakes, owls.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.100
NARRATOR: Weighing
just half an ounce,

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.230
this mouse could never fight
off these large predators.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:08.560
Its best hope for
survival is camouflage.

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:10.560
Not surprisingly,

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.530
its fur matches the color
of the Pinacarte rocks.

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:18.000
But in some sections
of the desert,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.100
the environment is different.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.630
Ancient volcanoes erupted

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.230
and now the desert
is a patchwork

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:32.830
of dark lava and light rock.

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:40.160
But of course, a light mouse on
a dark rock is easy pickings.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:49.200
So, something has happened that
Darwin might have predicted.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.400
The mice now living
on the dark rocks

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.560
have evolved darker fur.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:05.660
Those that stayed on the
light rocks remain light.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.960
Michael Nachman was fascinated.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.000
How had this happened?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.300
To find out, he first
needed to catch some mice.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.230
So, with Sean Carroll,

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.330
he visits a line of traps
he set the previous night.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.860
NACHMAN: All of the dark
ones have a white underbelly

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.400
and presumably, theres no
selection for dark on the belly

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.030
because predators are
going, coming from above.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.360
NARRATOR: This much
Darwin could have done.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:31.230
Find some mice and compare
the color of their fur

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.930
to their environment.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.500
But Nachman can now do something

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.360
that Darwin never could.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:49.900
He can look inside
the animals DNA.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.800
The study of DNA is one

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.560
of the great triumphs
of modern science.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.860
It has taken our understanding

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:02.400
of how creatures
evolve and develop

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:08.060
to a level that Darwin could
never have dreamed of.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.830
CARROLL: The DNA molecule is one
of the real secrets of life.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.330
Its a perfect system

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.230
for storing the vast
amounts of information

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:21.100
thats necessary for building
all kinds of creatures.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.630
NARRATOR: DNA consists
of one long molecule

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:31.030
spiraling around
in a double helix.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:36.760
That helix is, in turn, made
up of four smaller molecules,

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:43.230
called by the letters
G, A, T and C.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:51.400
DNA can be found in the cells
of every living thing on earth.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.030
JUDSON: The thing about DNA
that I think is remarkable

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:58.830
is that the molecule
itself is so elegant.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.500
With a small
number of letters,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.200
you can say almost
infinite words.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.130
NARRATOR: And that is the key.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:13.700
DNA is a code and its
double strand contains

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.360
all the information
to make living things

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.630
grow and develop.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.960
Lined along each DNA
molecule are ranged

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:34.900
special sequences of this
code that form our genes.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:41.730
Many genes get
translated into proteins.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:46.230
And these proteins make
the stuff of our bodies.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.330
One protein makes hair.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.900
Another makes cartilage.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.400
Others make muscle.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:56.760
CARROLL: What makes
DNA so amazing

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.800
is that it just
contains four letters,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.300
but all sorts of combinations
of those four letters

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.200
contains all the
information for making

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.460
all the creatures that
are on the planet.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.200
NARRATOR: Its a
gene that determines

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.300
whether our eyes
are blue or not.

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.960
Another gives us freckles.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.630
Another gives us dimples.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:26.630
But DNA has one
other vital quality.

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:31.300
It doesnt stay the same.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:35.060
(crying)

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.900
When a baby is conceived,
the fertilized egg receives

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.560
half its DNA from the mother
and half from the father,

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.230
creating wholly
new combinations.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.630
Its why we look a
bit like our parents,

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:56.200
but also different.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:03.800
Another way that DNA
can change is mutation.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.530
CARROLL: Mutation is
a critical ingredient

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:07.530
in the recipe for evolution.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.960
Without mutation, everything
would stay constant

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.960
generation after generation.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:18.130
Mutation generates
variation, differences
between individuals.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:21.700
NARRATOR: Mutations can happen
as our DNA copies itself

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:27.460
when our cells divide
and our bodies develop.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.730
An A for instance,
can be replaced by a G

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.730
or a C by a T.

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:39.660
This can cause minute changes
that no one is even aware of.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.330
But when mutations occur

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.060
in the cells we pass
down to our children,

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:52.500
they can cause big changes.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.830
Like turning a
light-colored mouse dark.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.630
Mutation seems to mean that
something bad has happened.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:02.960
Well, mutations are
neither good or bad.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.560
Whether they are favored,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.230
or whether they are rejected,
or whether theyre just neutral

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.960
depends upon the conditions
an organism finds itself.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.630
So for the pocket mouse,

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:13.830
a mutation that caused
the mouse to turn black...

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.630
That is good if youre living

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.630
on black rock, its
bad if youre living

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:22.300
out in the sandy desert.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.300
NARRATOR: It was
that mutation,

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.260
the one that turned a
light-colored mouse dark,

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:36.460
that Michael Nachman
was hunting for.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.660
Back in the lab, he began
the painstaking business

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.600
of comparing the genes
of the two types of mice,

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.200
trying to pinpoint
any differences.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.360
NACHMAN: Science is fun

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:57.160
when you really dont know
what youre going to find.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.300
NARRATOR: One by one the
genes in the two mice

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.900
proved identical.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:10.360
But then, in one gene,
he found something.

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.860
There were four places
where the sequence

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:18.860
of As, Ts, Cs
and Gs were different..

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.630
When a mouse is born
with these mutations,

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:27.360
its fur grows dark.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.930
And that means it can
survive on the dark rocks

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:34.200
when others would not.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.960
Here was a clear
example of evolution

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:43.230
and natural selection at work.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.460
I think Darwin would
have been delighted

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.930
to know that we
can find the genes

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:53.160
that are responsible for
evolutionary change.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.100
NARRATOR: And this was
just one of many links

00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:01.600
that have been found between
genetic mutations and evolution.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.100
Scientists can now pinpoint

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:11.760
a range of examples of
evolution in action.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.600
The Colobus monkey
can see in color

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.160
because of a
mutation in one gene.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.460
It can now tell
nutritious red leaves

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.330
from tough, old green ones.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:26.760
A genetic glitch gave
this Antarctic fish

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.560
a potent antifreeze
in its blood.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.830
So it can survive
in the icy waters

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:35.060
when others cannot.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.460
So powerful was
this link between

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:43.230
genetic mutation and evolution
that an idea took hold.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:45.900
To understand how
evolution works,

00:40:45.900 --> 00:41:05.000
all you need to do is
compare creatures genes.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.630
One might think that you could
understand all of evolution

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.460
simply by mapping the
genes of every creature.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.360
Identify all the genes,
identify all the differences

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.800
and you could explain the
differences between, say,

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.100
mouse and monkeys and humans.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.060
NARRATOR: So when the Human
Genome Project began in 1990,

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.630
the scientific world
was on tenterhooks.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.200
All three billion
letters of our DNA

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.200
were going to be
identified in order.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.030
In parallel, the
DNA of some animals

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.130
and plants was also
being sequenced.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.400
Surely, this would be a quantum
leap in our understanding

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.560
of how different
life-forms evolved.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:50.030
With this came another idea:
that complex animals like us

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.960
would have many more
genes than simpler ones.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.530
Here we are, the most complex

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:57.730
and sophisticated animal
on the planet, right?

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.130
You might think
that would require

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:01.400
a whole lot more
genetic information.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.800
NARRATOR: The betting was on.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:08.360
Just how big would our genome be
compared to other life-forms?

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.200
There were estimates
that humans would have

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:22.930
between, lets say,
80,000 and 120,000 genes.

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:30.630
NARRATOR: So when
the final answer came in
2003, it was a shocker.

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:39.400
23,000 genes-- the same
number as a chicken...

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.660
less than an ear of corn.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.330
LEVINE: I mean, people
were freaked out

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:49.230
by the relatively
small number of genes.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.830
Its down to something
like 22,000 or 23,000

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.900
protein-coding genes
in the human genome.

00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.530
The simple nematode worm
has about that same number.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.300
And there are plants that
have considerably more genes

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.630
than the glorious human genome.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.300
The whole human genome
project has been

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.460
a humbling experience,
as weve discovered

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.960
that, actually, it
doesnt take as many genes

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.500
to make a human as
we had all hoped.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.430
NARRATOR: And it wasnt just
that we had so few genes,

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:21.460
but many of our key
genes were identical

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:25.800
to those of other animals.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.900
Huge though the
breakthrough had been,

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.860
the genetic revolution
had opened up

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.160
a whole new set of puzzles.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.730
As a solution to the mystery
of how evolution works,

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:44.230
genes and their mutations
were only part of the story.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:47.560
There had to be something
else more subtle

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.860
and more mysterious going on.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.030
CARROLL: We have
to explain then,

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.030
How do you get all
these differences

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.560
if you have really
similar sets of genes?

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.030
NARRATOR: The quest to uncover

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:07.260
what Darwin never knew
would have to start again.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:11.600
The first tantalizing clues
would come from those life-forms

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:17.130
that Darwin himself
had studied: embryos.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.300
Look at these embryos.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.030
It is almost impossible to tell
just days after conception

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:25.230
which is the
chicken, the turtle,

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:28.130
the bat, the human.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:33.900
They look almost the same.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:39.230
Only as they grow does it
become clear which is which.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.060
Darwin wondered, as
scientists do today,

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.460
How could they
start out so similar

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:49.400
and end up so different?

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.560
LEVINE: There is
something profound

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.730
about what the embryo
was telling us.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:58.130
And we have rediscovered what
Darwin was talking about

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.560
all along, that the embryos
where the action is.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.300
In terms of animal diversity,

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:09.960
it is the platform
for diversity.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.530
NARRATOR: What fascinates
modern biologists

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.460
is that all these
different animals

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.900
dont just look the same,

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.530
they are using virtually
the same set of key genes

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:27.460
to build their bodies.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.200
The body plan genes determine
where the head goes,

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.800
where the limbs go, and
what form they take--

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.660
whether they are arms,

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:41.760
legs or wings.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.430
Another set of genes

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.900
determines an animals
body patterning:

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.660
the blotches, the
stripes and spots.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.360
It is the same genes at
work in every creature

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:56.600
from the leopard to the peacock

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.160
to the fruit fly.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:08.100
And yet they produce
radically different results.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:11.800
This has led scientists
to a crucial insight

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.200
about how animal
bodies have evolved.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:19.160
Its not the number
of genes that counts.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.930
CARROLL: Its not
the genes you have,

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.960
but how you use
them that generates

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.700
the great diversity
of the animal kingdom.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.300
NARRATOR: Finding out
just how these same genes

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.460
are used to create
such amazing diversity

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:35.660
has been the work
of Sean Carroll

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:41.760
and an unlikely hero
of modern science.

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:47.230
The fruit fly.

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.760
As much as Id like to
study the mammals of
the African Savannah,

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.900
they make poor choices
for laboratory animals.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.560
Theyre large, expensive and
they reproduce very slowly.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.230
To get data, we have to
find the simplest examples

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:03.060
to the phenomenon we
want to understand.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.700
NARRATOR: But the humble
fruit fly does weird

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:11.060
and wonderful things.

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:16.160
This fruit fly is
dancing for sex.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.960
A rapt female takes in the show.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.530
Shes particularly besotted

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:27.960
by the dark spots
on the males wings.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.930
Watching it all is an equally
besotted Sean Carroll.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.160
CARROLL: You might think them

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.230
just be annoying, but
theyre really charming.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.800
And the males of this species

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.660
does a rather elaborate
courtship dance,

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:43.460
where he displays these spotted
wings in front of the female.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:50.960
To us, its as magnificent
as what a peacock does.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.730
NARRATOR: But in some
species of fruit fly,

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:58.300
the males dont have wing spots.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.460
CARROLL: Theres another
fruit fly species

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.100
thats different from
the spotted species

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.860
in two important ways:

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:06.800
it doesnt have
spots on its wings

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.230
and it does a lot less dancing.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:13.130
NARRATOR: Here, then, is a
classic evolutionary puzzle.

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:17.130
Why does one type of fly have
spots and the other doesnt?

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.100
Sean Carroll wanted to know.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:23.430
What is going on in their genes
that makes them different?

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.260
CARROLL: So we
wanted to take apart

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.960
the genetic machinery
for making wing spots

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:33.800
to understand how those
wing spots evolved.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.760
NARRATOR: Carroll began the
process of sifting through

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:39.060
the two types of flies DNA.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:43.230
He had one clue to
set him on his way.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:47.460
He already knew the gene that
codes for the black wing spots.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:53.130
He calls it the
paintbrush gene.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:54.630
But surprisingly,

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:57.900
when he compared the
genes of the two flies,

00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.900
they both had that gene.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:06.860
And yet, only one had spots.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.930
CARROLL: When we look at that
gene in the two species,

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.660
really they both have
this paintbrush gene.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.360
So the big difference

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.660
is not having the gene,
its how they use it.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:19.530
One species uses it in
the wing to make spots.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:25.300
The other one doesnt.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.830
NARRATOR: So why did
the paintbrush gene create
spots in one type of fly,

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:34.860
but not in the other?

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.130
In search of answers,

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:40.260
Carroll turned to one of the
least understood regions of DNA:

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:51.700
the vast stretches that were
once known as junk.

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:56.460
It has been called the
dark matter of the genome.

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.800
Mysterious.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.860
Uncharted.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.030
Strange.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:05.900
The vast bulk of
the double helix,

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.460
some 98% of it, doesnt
code for proteins,

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.130
which make the
stuff of our bodies.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:18.460
The genes which do,
comprise just two percent.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:20.700
Even now, no one is sure

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:24.430
what much of this huge
non-coding area actually does,

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.400
but it has long beckoned

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.060
evolutionary detectives,
like Sean Carroll.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.800
So, this is a bend.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.000
Thats the fragment
to test. Yeah.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.430
NARRATOR: Carroll had
already learned that the
paintbrush gene itself

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:38.330
was identical in the
two types of fly.

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:41.700
So he extended his search
through their DNA.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:46.730
And in one place, just
outside the paintbrush gene,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:50.230
he found an important clue.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.300
A stretch of DNA
that was different

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.960
in the fly with wing spots.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:51:00.300
What could this mean?

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.500
So Carroll conducted
an experiment.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.600
He decided to put
that mysterious

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.830
stretch of DNA that he had
found in the spotted fly

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:13.830
in the unspotted fly.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.300
To help him see if
it had any effect,

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.100
he attached it to a
gene from a jellyfish,

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:24.300
a gene that codes for a protein
that makes the jellyfish glow.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.460
We cut the DNA up
into little pieces,

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.400
and we hook it up to a protein
that glows in the dark.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:35.100
And then we inject that
into the unspotted fly.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:40.730
NARRATOR: And then, something
remarkable happened.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.960
CARROLL: When we looked
at those unspotted flies,

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:47.730
we see now their wings are
glowing in the dark with spots.

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:50.960
NARRATOR: Somehow that
mysterious stretch of DNA

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.460
had turned on the
paintbrush gene

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.060
in the unspotted flys wings.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.300
Once spotless, now it
had luminous spots.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:01.800
CARROLL: Bingo.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.300
Wed found the piece
of DNA that mattered.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.900
NARRATOR: Carroll had
found something that
is revolutionizing

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.300
our understanding
of how different

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.100
animal bodies have evolved.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:19.130
A piece of DNA
called a switch.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.460
Switches are not genes.

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:23.460
They dont make
stuff like hair,

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.800
cartilage or muscle.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:33.960
But they turn on and
off the genes that do.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.360
CARROLL: Switches are very
powerful parts of DNA,

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.030
because they allow
animals to use genes

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.360
in one place and not another,

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.560
at one time and not another.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.330
And so, choreograph the spots

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.960
and stripes and blotches
of animal bodies.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:53.260
NARRATOR: In the case
of the fruit fly,

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.160
its a mutation--

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:57.900
a change in just a
few letters of the DNA

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:04.300
that has caused the paintbrush
gene to be switched on.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.460
And so, a whole new
species with wing spots

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:10.930
has been created.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:15.760
But switches are now
explaining far more than that.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.160
They are helping to solve many

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.230
perplexing evolutionary
questions.

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:24.530
Like how one creature

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:28.130
can become another creature

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:36.060
by losing it legs.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:43.730
It all goes back to what Darwin
had seen in the snake embryo.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:50.230
The rudiments of leg bumps.

00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:53.060
This convinced him that
a snake must have evolved

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.900
from some four-legged animal.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.160
Over the years that same
mysterious process,

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.800
the losing of legs, has been
seen in other creatures.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.130
Like the whale.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:11.130
Its front flippers
have all the bones

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.630
of a land creatures arm,

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:17.560
even the fingers.

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.800
And further back in its body...

00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:27.630
...it has the
vestiges of a pelvis.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.460
Clearly, it is descended

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:31.660
from an animal that
walked on the land.

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:32.930
KINGSLEY: Lots of animals

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:36.730
have evolved to slither through
the ground like snakes.

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:39.230
Other animals slither or
swim through the water

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:40.430
like whales.

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:43.160
So if you need a
streamlined body,

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.100
its good to get
rid of these things

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:49.900
that stick out from
the body, like limbs.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.330
NARRATOR: Like the whale,

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:57.230
the manatee is another huge
mammal that lives in the sea.

00:54:57.230 --> 00:55:01.130
And it, too, has
lost its hind legs.

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:09.460
How?

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:13.530
Darwin could never have
answered that question.

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:16.130
But now, thanks to
our understanding

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.830
of how DNA is
switched on and off,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.600
and a very small fish,

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.460
we are getting a little closer.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:28.500
In this lake in
British Columbia,

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:32.730
there is a creature that
really shouldnt be here.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:38.130
A stickleback.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:41.460
Most sticklebacks
live in the ocean.

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:44.600
But some 10,000 years ago,

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:47.560
a few were left
stranded in this lake,

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:53.230
cut off from the Pacific.

00:55:53.230 --> 00:56:05.430
And over the years,
they have evolved.

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:07.760
The ocean stickleback

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.830
has a pair of fins on its belly

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:13.130
that are like spikes.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.300
They are for defense.

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:39.560
The spikes make the
stickleback hard to eat.

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.700
But the lake sticklebacks

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:50.730
have lost those spikes
on their bellies.

00:56:50.730 --> 00:56:53.460
And its this that
intrigues researchers

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:59.230
David Kingsley and his
colleague, Dolph Schluter.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:02.630
To understand whats behind
it, they first identified

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.660
the gene that makes the
sticklebacks spikes.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.360
Its one of those key body plan
genes and, not surprisingly,

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.800
they found it to be
identical in both

00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.300
the ocean and the
lake stickleback.

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:18.400
The question was, why
hadnt in been turned on

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.460
in the lake stickleback,
which had lost its spikes?

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:26.630
Kingsley felt the answer
might lie in a switch.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:28.700
KINGSLEY: We know these
genetic switches exist,

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.500
but theyre still
very hard to find.

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.300
We dont have a genetic code

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:35.730
that lets us read along
the DNA sequence and say,

00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:38.500
Theres a switch, to turn a
gene on in a particular place.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:42.630
NARRATOR: But eventually,
hunting through
the vast stretch of DNA

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:46.400
that does not code for
proteins, he found it.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.630
A section of DNA that had
mutated in the lake stickleback.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:54.130
These mutations meant that
the switch was broken.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:58:03.460
It didnt turn on the
gene that makes spikes.

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.660
But this work may
have implications

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.900
far beyond sticklebacks.

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.360
They are convinced
that there is a link

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.600
between the stickleback
losing its spikes

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.700
and other creatures,
like a manatee,

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.430
losing their legs.

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:22.300
And they have two
tantalizing clues.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.730
One-- the same body plan gene

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:27.730
that is responsible for
the stickleback spikes,

00:58:27.730 --> 00:58:33.460
also plays a role in the
development of the hind limbs.

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:38.460
The second clue
is more tentative.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:41.400
The lake stickleback may
have lost its spikes,

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:47.360
but evolution has left
behind some tiny remnants...

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.300
the traces of bones,
and they are lopsided--

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.300
bigger on the left
than on the right.

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.460
KINGSLEY: We thought,
Wouldnt it be amazing

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.400
if in fact this
classic unevenness is

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.800
the signature of
using the same gene

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:13.230
to control hind limb loss in an
incredibly different animal?

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:16.860
NARRATOR: So Kingsley and his
team went looking in manatees,

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:23.000
searching for this
lopsided pattern.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.530
And they found it.

00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:27.260
In box after box of
manatee skeletons,

00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:28.830
they saw pelvic bones

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:33.800
that were bigger on the left
and smaller on the right.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.600
Right now, Kingsley and
his team are looking

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.400
for the same switch
in the manatee

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.930
that caused the lake
stickleback to lose its spikes.

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:45.030
And if they find it, they will
have a powerful explanation

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:47.230
for something that
baffled Darwin--

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:50.630
how creatures like
manatees, whales and snakes

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:54.560
can evolve away their legs.

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:57.800
But all this begs
another question:

00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.600
If switches can play
such a profound role

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.260
in the different shapes and
patterns of animal bodies--

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.800
from wing spots, to
spikes to hind legs--

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:17.030
what is throwing those
switches in the first place?

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.960
Researchers would see
the answer in animals

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:27.130
very familiar to Darwin--
those Galapagos finches.

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:31.300
Arkat Abzhanov and Cliff
Tabin have spent years trying

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.430
to find out exactly how
those Galapagos finches

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.230
got their different beaks.

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:39.730
Their starting point was
what they had learned

01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:43.200
from Darwin himself.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.560
Their beaks were vital
to the birds survival.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.260
On an island where the
main food was seeds,

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:53.360
finches had short, tough
beaks for cracking them open.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.300
On an island where the main
food was from flowers,

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:03.930
birds had long pointy beaks for
sucking up nectar and pollen.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:08.460
And they knew something else.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:13.230
The finches are born with
their beaks fully formed.

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:14.630
So the answer to why they had

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.330
such different beaks
must lie in something

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:21.100
that happened to them
as embryos in the egg.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:22.800
TABIN: Something amazing

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.160
is happening inside those eggs.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:26.660
Genes are turning
on and turning off.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.460
And depending on exactly
how they turn on and off

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:36.060
will determine what
type of finch is formed.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.060
NARRATOR: To find out
just what was going on,

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.800
the researchers first
had to collect some eggs.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.060
(whispers): There she is.

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:46.600
She just came back. Yeah.

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.460
To lay eggs.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.730
Its really likely that she
already has a clutch; great.

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:53.560
Shes coming out.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.460
NARRATOR: Abzhanov checks
a ground finch nest

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:58.460
and finds a single egg.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.100
He wont remove it,

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:04.900
because the mother
might abandon the nest.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.600
Another nest already
has three eggs.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.860
He takes one for his research,

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.860
as he knows the mother
will lay a replacement.

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:17.130
The team collects
several eggs,

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:20.800
with embryos at different
stages of development.

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.030
That way they will be
able to chart exactly

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:28.500
how the different beaks grow.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:37.100
Back in the lab, they
can begin the process.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.330
This cactus finch embryo
is well on the way

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:43.000
to its signature
long, pointy beak.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.900
And this ground finch embryo is
growing a short, thick beak.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.460
What we wanted to do was
try and understand the genes

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.330
that were involved in making
the beak the way it was--

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:56.960
making a big, broad
thick beak different

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.400
from a long, thin beak
or a short, thin beak.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.630
NARRATOR: They concentrated
on a group of genes

01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:06.960
known to control the
growth of birds faces.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:15.560
As they looked, they saw
something intriguing.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.600
One particular body plan gene

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.430
became active in
the ground finch

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:23.360
with the short, thick beak, on
the fifth day of development.

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.000
But it didnt go to work
in the cactus finch

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.230
with its long, slender
beak for another 24 hours.

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:34.030
This was a revelation.

01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:36.560
The same genes were
responsible for the beaks

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.160
in all types of finch.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.460
Any differences were in
timing and intensity.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.460
TABIN: Weve got
it! We nailed it!

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:48.060
Its the same genes in
making a sharp, pointy beak

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:50.300
or a big, broad
nut-cracking beak.

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.130
Whats essential, what
makes the difference,

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.230
and all the difference, is how
much you turn the gene on,

01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:00.300
when you turn it on,
when you turn it off.

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.130
NARRATOR: And the
revelations didnt end there.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:06.300
There was something
special about this gene.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.130
Like all body plan
genes, it doesnt actually

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:12.030
make the stuff of our bodies.

01:04:12.030 --> 01:04:16.300
It didnt make the cartilage
for the finches beaks.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.860
It throws switches.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.960
And the switches then
turn on or off the genes

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.630
that do make the beak.

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.860
CARROLL: These are a
different type of gene.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:32.230
Theyre genes that boss
other genes around.

01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:36.460
Scientists now realize that not
all genes are created equal.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.230
Some make the stuff
of our bodies.

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:40.730
And switches are needed

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:44.230
to turn many of these
stuff genes on and off.

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.760
The body plan genes are
what throw these switches,

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.160
which tell the stuff
genes what to do and when.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.260
This subtle choreography
can have profound effects

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:59.930
on how different animal
bodies are formed.

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.460
And this knowledge
is helping us solve

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.630
perhaps the biggest
Darwinian puzzle of all:

01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:14.960
the mystery of the
great transformations.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.800
It all goes back to Darwins
idea of the tree of life.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.500
That all life-forms are
ultimately related.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.730
And from the earliest
common ancestor over
billions of years,

01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:30.130
they have changed
and diversified

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.000
so that creatures that
started out looking the same

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:40.200
evolved to become
completely different.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:46.060
And scientists have made
some amazing connections.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.400
That dinosaurs share a
common ancestor with birds.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.130
And that a fish must
have been the ancestor

01:05:54.130 --> 01:06:01.300
of all four-limbed
creatures-- even us.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.800
Of all his ideas,
this was probably

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.130
Darwins most astonishing.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.660
CARROLL: It was
one thing to grasp

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.860
how two species of finch
could become different,

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:14.000
how their beak
shape could change.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.460
That was a small step.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.060
But what about the
big differences?

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.700
The differences, say, between
the fish that swim in the sea

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.460
and the animals
that walk on land?

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:24.000
How did those
changes take place?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.260
NARRATOR: Over the years,

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:30.860
evidence for these great
transformations has been found.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.800
For instance, just a year
after Darwin published

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.900
On the Origin of Species,

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:40.900
a fossil called
archaeopteryx
was discovered.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:47.230
It had features of both
birds and dinosaurs.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:53.200
And Darwin had seen equally
persuasive evidence in embryos.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.560
Those slits in the ear of all
land creatures, even humans.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:05.560
In us, they become tiny
bones in the inner ear.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.460
But in fish, they
become gills.

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:12.760
A tantalizing hint
that land animals

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:16.160
must be descended from fish.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:20.830
But the stumbling block
has always been how.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:30.660
How could a fish develop
legs and walk on land?

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:41.730
Darwin had no idea.

01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:46.000
But Neil Shubin was determined
to tackle that problem.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.430
SHUBIN: It captured
my imagination.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:50.230
I mean, heres a fin and on
the other side was a limb.

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:52.730
And they looked
different in many ways.

01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:55.900
And I thought, Well, what a
first-class scientific problem

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.160
to devote my research to.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.900
And Ive been
devoting pretty much

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.560
my research to it ever
since, over 20 years.

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.630
NARRATOR: The first
stage in Shubins quest
was to find a fossil.

01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:12.530
If Darwin were right,
somewhere out there,

01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:15.000
there had to be a
transitional form,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.130
a fossil that was part fish,
but had the beginning of legs.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:25.630
But where to look?

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.330
He had one clue.

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:30.300
The fossil record shows
that creatures with legs

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:35.060
first appeared some
365 million years ago.

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:44.460
Before that, they
were only fish.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.430
So, summer after summer,
Shubin set up camp

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:50.360
on Ellesmere Island,
just a few hundred miles

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.900
from the North Pole.

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:56.330
It has exposed rock from that
crucial transitional time.

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:58.330
The scientists own video shows

01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:02.060
how remote and
bleak the place was.

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.560
SHUBIN: Its cold.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.060
Its about freezing every
day over the summer.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.530
Winds are high.

01:09:07.530 --> 01:09:09.400
They can get up to
50 miles an hour.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.300
There are polar bears there.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.660
We have to prepare
ourselves by carrying guns.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.160
Its a beautiful place.
Youve got to love it.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:19.300
Its my summer home.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.730
NARRATOR: Each expedition was
costly, but after three of them

01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:25.360
there was little to
show for their efforts.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:31.530
A fourth trip seemed pointless.

01:09:31.530 --> 01:09:34.300
SHUBIN: I remember
having a conversation with
my colleagues saying,

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.300
Well, should we go? Is this
really a waste of money?

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.830
This was our do-or-die moment.

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:45.300
And we almost didnt go.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:54.800
NARRATOR: But they decided
to try one last time.

01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:01.600
After three days, they
still hadnt found anything.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.700
Then, just when no one was
expecting anything to happen...

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.260
A colleague was cracking rocks

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.400
and I was working about
five feet from him.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:19.930
And I hear, Hey! Hey,
guys, whats this?

01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:24.030
Sticking out of the cliff
was the snout of fish.

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:28.030
And not just any fish,
a fish with a flat head.

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:29.960
By seeing a flat-headed fish

01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.900
in rocks about 375
million years old...

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.730
we knew we had found
what we were looking for.

01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:43.060
NARRATOR: A flat snout
with upward staring eyes--

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:44.760
the signature of an animal

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.900
that pushes its head
out of the water.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:52.160
And for that, it would have
needed something like arms.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.330
SHUBIN: What we did
at that moment was all
jump around high-fiving.

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:57.100
It was, uh, you know,
there were only six of us

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:03.360
in the field that time,
so it was quite a scene.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.800
NARRATOR: Back at home, Shubin
and his team got to work,

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:14.960
examining their
375-million-year-old fossil.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.530
They named their new
finding Tiktaalik,

01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:22.600
an Inuit word for
a freshwater fish.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.300
Tiktaalik is a perfect
transitional form.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.700
Much of its body
is that of a fish.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.060
Its covered in scales.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:41.500
But it also had something
very un-fishlike...

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:50.760
an arm-like fin, or
perhaps a fin-like arm.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.600
Tiktaalik had the bone
structure that is seen

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:58.400
in the arms and legs of
every four-limbed animal.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.460
One big bone at the top,

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:02.460
two bones underneath,

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:10.000
leading to a cluster of
bones in the wrist and ankle.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.030
Its the same pattern that
is found in everything

01:12:12.030 --> 01:12:17.430
from sheep, to sheepdogs,
to Shubin himself.

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:19.060
You now have an animal

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.460
that can push itself
up off the substrate,

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:27.600
either on the water
bottom or on land.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.200
NARRATOR: One
obvious question was:

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:37.300
Why had Tiktaalik evolved
this new structure?

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:43.860
One possible answer is suggested
by other fossils found near it.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.900
There are large predatory fish

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:51.730
about ten to 15 feet long
living alongside Tiktaalik.

01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:54.300
NARRATOR: Tiktaalik was prey.

01:12:54.300 --> 01:13:01.830
To survive, it
had few choices.

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.330
You can get big,
you can get armor

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.960
or you can get out of the way.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:12.130
NARRATOR: Shubin thinks
Tiktaalik got out of the way.

01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:15.360
With those arm-like fins, it
could have dragged itself

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:22.300
to safety on land
or in the shallows.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:27.060
But this was only
half the answer.

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.430
What it doesnt show us is the
actual genetic mechanism,

01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:32.960
the genetic recipe
that builds a fin

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:41.430
into that which builds a limb.

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:44.860
NARRATOR: At 375
million years old,

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:49.000
Tiktaaliks DNA had
vanished long ago.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Shubin needed a next-of-kin,

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.360
a fish relative that
was still alive.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.100
SHUBIN: What we
needed was a creature

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.730
that was in the right part
of the evolutionary tree,

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:05.200
but also a fish that
has a very fleshy fin.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.730
So the search was on.

01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:14.060
NARRATOR: A number
of fish fit the bill.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:20.160
But Shubin favored
one in particular...

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.860
the paddlefish.

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.160
SHUBIN: The paddlefish
is a really weird fish.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.460
They developed this
really long snout.

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.930
And theyre really voracious.

01:14:28.930 --> 01:14:30.200
They eat each other.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.030
So oftentimes youll
lose a lot of your fish

01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:36.300
when they swim together,
because theyll eat each other.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.130
NARRATOR: Living in the shallow
waters of the Mississippi,

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:43.000
its also a living fossil.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.760
Scientists have spent years
working out the relationships

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.160
between different
species of fish

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.700
and they know that
the paddlefish

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.230
is one of the last survivors

01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:56.000
of the class to which
Tiktaalik once belonged.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.860
But unlike Tiktaalik,

01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:01.030
the paddlefish is
in plentiful supply.

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:03.560
Paddlefish is a common
source for caviar.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.630
So wed get our paddlefish
from caviar farms.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:13.130
NARRATOR: Intriguingly, even
though Tiktaalik is extinct,

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:16.530
the paddlefish is actually
the more primitive form.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:18.260
Its fins bear far less relation

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.760
to an arm or leg
than Tiktaaliks.

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.900
And because they are related,

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:32.360
the two kinds of fish should
share the same genes.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:36.230
So Shubin began looking
at paddlefish embryos,

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:42.400
hunting for the genes
that built its fins.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.430
And soon he zeroed in
on one particular group

01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:56.130
of body plan genes
called Hox genes.

01:15:56.130 --> 01:16:00.230
Hox genes have been found
in all complex animals

01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:05.130
from the velvet worm,
that dates back some
600 million years,

01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:08.960
to the modern human.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.500
And in all that time,
the letters of their DNA

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.730
have remained
virtually unchanged.

01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:19.400
They are aristocrats
of the gene community,

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.860
near the very top of
the chain of command.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:28.600
They give orders that cascade
through a developing embryo...

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.760
activating entire networks
of switches and genes

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:39.900
that make the parts of the body.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.200
They are absolutely critical
to the shape and form

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.300
of a developing creature.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.830
CARROLL: These genes
determine where the front

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:48.930
and the back of the
animals going to be--

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:51.260
the top, the bottom,
the left, right,

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.660
the inside, the outside-- where
the eyes are going to be,

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:56.360
where the legs are going to be,
where the guts going to be--

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.130
how many fingers
theyre going to have.

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:03.860
NARRATOR: Shubin found that
Hox genes had a key role

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:09.730
in the formation
of paddlefish fins.

01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:12.660
One set of Hox genes orders

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:15.200
the first stage of
fin development--

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:22.030
a sturdy piece of cartilage
that grows out from the torso.

01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:26.900
Amazingly, in all four-limbed
animals, even us.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:36.260
Exactly the same genes create
the long upper arm bone.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.000
In the paddlefish,
another set of Hox genes

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.060
command the next stage
of fin development.

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:45.900
Again, exactly the same genes

01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:54.960
control the growth of
our two forearm bones.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.400
Finally, the same genes,
working in a different order,

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:03.360
make the array of bones
at the end of the fin.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:06.560
The same sequence
of the same genes

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:11.860
makes our fingers and toes.

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:20.100
This was a massive revelation.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.730
Suddenly the origin of
creatures with arms and legs

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:27.200
didnt seem such a
huge leap after all.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.100
If the same genes were
at work in Tiktaalik,

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:36.430
then many of the genes
needed to make legs and arms

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:42.900
were already being carried
around by prehistoric fish.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:48.000
All it needed was
a few mutations--

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.860
a few changes to
the timing and order

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.030
of what was turned off and on,

01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:57.030
and a fin could become a limb.

01:18:57.030 --> 01:19:00.330
SHUBIN: Oftentimes
the origin of whole new
structures in evolution

01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:02.600
doesnt involve the
origin of new genes

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.860
or whole new genetic recipes.

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:08.660
Old genes, old genetic
pathways can be reconfigured

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:23.130
to make marvelously
wonderful new things.

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:28.300
NARRATOR: So it is now possible
to answer what Darwin didnt know

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.200
and explain how all
four-legged creatures

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:38.830
could be descended from fish.

01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:43.060
Around 375 million years ago,

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:47.300
a creature like Tiktaalik
was under attack...

01:19:47.300 --> 01:20:00.060
harried by predators.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:03.460
But some random changes to
the activity of the Hox genes

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:12.400
led to its fins, developing
a structure like a limb.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:23.060
Tiktaalik could now haul itself
out of danger, onto dry land.

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:30.530
On land, it would have found a
world of plants and insects...

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:35.960
a world ripe for colonization...

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:45.860
a world perfect for
animals with arms and legs.

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:48.700
And so, over
millions of years,

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:54.260
these new limbs evolved,
changed and diversified.

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:58.860
Some became adapted for running.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:04.500
Others for flying.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:11.200
Some for digging.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:16.360
Others for swinging.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.360
And so four-limbed creatures
took over the world

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:27.730
in a multitude of
different ways.

01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:34.200
And all because of some changes
to an ancient set of genes.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.460
And this is the true wonder

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:41.800
of where our new understanding
of DNA has led us to.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.000
There are genes that make
the stuff of our bodies,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.630
switches that turn
them off and on,

01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:52.900
and still other genes that
give those switches orders.

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:58.160
Together in a complex cascade
of timing and intensity,

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.160
they combine to produce
the amazing diversity

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.560
of life on this planet.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:14.830
That truly is something
that Darwin never knew.

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:17.000
But can this new
science also explain

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.830
perhaps the most fundamental
question of all?

01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:31.530
What makes us human?

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:36.700
The scope of human activity
is simply astounding.

01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.960
What fascinated me were

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.060
all the crazy things
that humans do.

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:43.130
You look around the world,

01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:45.330
and if there is something
bizarre and interesting

01:22:45.330 --> 01:22:46.560
that you could be doing,

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:51.200
humans are up to it
somewhere in the world.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:53.630
And when you look
at all of this,

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:56.300
you just have to ask yourself,
what makes us special?

01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:03.260
What is the basis
for this humanness?

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.430
NARRATOR: For all
natures wonders,

01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:11.460
the achievements of the
human mind are truly unique.

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.730
We are the only species

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:16.560
to think about what
others think about us,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:20.260
to punish those who
have harmed others,

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:24.030
to create art...

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:26.960
music...

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.260
architecture...

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:33.230
to engage in science...

01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:37.100
medicine...

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:45.730
the microchip.

01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:55.430
Only we can destroy millions
at the push of a button.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:58.830
Hardly surprising, then, that
for centuries we thought

01:23:58.830 --> 01:24:01.460
that humans were different
from all other species,

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:09.860
better, created in
the image of God.

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:14.130
But then Darwin began to draw
conclusions from evidence

01:24:14.130 --> 01:24:17.330
like gill slits in human embryos

01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:23.700
that showed that we were
descended from fish.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.560
(people exclaim)

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.930
But it was when he drew
parallels with other

01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:34.330
close relatives that he
got into real trouble.

01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:37.100
CARROLL: Shortly after
Darwin returned from
his voyage, in London,

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.100
an orangutan named
Jenny went on exhibit.

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:41.030
And this was a huge sensation.

01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:43.660
This was the first great ape
to be exhibited in captivity.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.560
And Darwin was absolutely taken

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.400
with how she was sort of
childlike in her ways.

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.900
And he saw a lot
of human behavior

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:57.600
in the way this
orangutan behaved.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.560
NARRATOR: When Darwin suggested

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.530
that human beings must actually
be descended from apes,

01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:05.630
he was savaged.

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:08.030
He was accused of
attacking that core belief

01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:11.860
that humankind had been
created in the image of God

01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:14.560
above all other creatures.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.100
But today the idea that we share
a common ancestor with apes

01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:22.700
is completely
accepted in biology.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.100
Instead, as a result of
having sequenced the genomes

01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:30.030
of both humans and apes, we
face a very different puzzle.

01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:34.200
Katie Pollard is an
expert on chimp DNA.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.000
Given all the obvious
differences between humans

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.700
and chimps, you might expect
our DNA to be really different.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:47.500
But in fact, its more
like 99% identical.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:54.760
NARRATOR: Just a one-percent
difference in the
DNA of humans and chimps.

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.030
The mystery facing
modern science is

01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:00.830
not how can such different
animals be related,

01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:06.130
but how can such closely related
species be so different?

01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:10.060
That really is something
that Darwin never knew,

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:16.900
but slowly, scientists are
starting to find the answers.

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:21.400
And one answer begins with
insights into the genetics

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:27.800
of a key human
organ, our hands.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:35.230
The human hand is a marvel,
nimble and dexterous.

01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:39.100
Nothing quite like it exists
anywhere else in nature.

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:41.430
It offers us a
unique combination

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:44.160
of precision and power,

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:51.400
and much of that is down to one
particular digit, our thumb.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:56.300
One of the features of the
human hand is our ability

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:59.660
to touch all four
fingers with the thumb.

01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:02.000
And that allows us to
make grips like this,

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.800
gives us a lot of precision.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.900
The power grip is the ability
to put a lot of strength

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:12.800
into this sort of contact.

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.160
So if youre holding a ball,
youre basically pinching it,

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:21.430
and we can put a lot
of strength into that.

01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:27.960
NARRATOR: The better to
throw a fastball with.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.060
Finding out why we have
such versatile hands

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.560
compared to our nearest
relatives is the task

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.500
of Jim Noonan at
Yale University.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.160
He began sifting through that
vital one percent of DNA

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.730
that is different in
humans from chimps.

01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:47.000
NOONAN: Its kind of one of
the fundamental questions

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.160
in science is: What
makes us who we are?

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:54.230
And thats really what
were trying to get to;

01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:56.800
what makes humans human.

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.130
NARRATOR: It was slow work.

01:28:00.130 --> 01:28:02.000
One percent may not
sound like much,

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.430
but its still some 30 million
of DNAs chemical letters--

01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:09.560
As, Ts, Cs and Gs.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.600
NOONAN: The genomes a big place.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.100
And just by looking at
sequence, you really cant tell,

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:19.730
for the most part, what is
important and what isnt.

01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:26.030
NARRATOR: But eventually, in
human DNA he spotted something.

01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:39.760
A sequence that was different in
13 places compared to chimp DNA.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.900
The trouble was,
he had no idea

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:48.160
what this piece of
DNA actually did.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:54.530
To find out, he inserted it
into the embryo of a mouse.

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:57.630
To make the effects of
the DNA easier to follow,

01:28:57.630 --> 01:29:01.630
he attached it to another gene
that gives off a blue color.

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:02.900
That way he could see

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:06.460
where the gene became
active in the embryo.

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:10.760
As the embryo
developed, the piece of
DNA seemed to be active

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.860
all over the place.

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:16.030
But most intriguingly,

01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:23.930
it was doing something
in the growing paw.

01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:25.900
Well, I thought Wow,
this is really cool.

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:30.730
It was a really striking image.

01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:34.600
NARRATOR: What Noonan saw was
that the human DNA became active

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:41.130
in the mouse embryos
thumb and big toe.

01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:45.560
It seems that Noonan
may have found a switch

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:49.530
that helps form that
key human attribute:

01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:51.560
our thumb,

01:29:51.560 --> 01:30:00.960
the part of our hand that gives
us so much power and precision.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.200
Its that power and
precision that enables us

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.700
to hold a paintbrush...

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.930
manipulate tools...

01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:19.730
pilot a jet fighter,
record our thoughts.

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:30.660
All those things that
separate us from other apes.

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:34.800
Of course, having a
nimble hand is one thing,

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:37.130
but you have to
know how to use it.

01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:39.530
And for that, you need to have

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:44.260
humankinds other
signature organ:

01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:51.400
our brain.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.860
The human brain is vast,

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.030
three times bigger
than a chimps,

01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:59.400
and is structured
very differently.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.800
How this extraordinary
organ evolved is central

01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:07.560
to understanding why
we are the way we are.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:10.460
It is something that Darwin
himself was at a loss

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:14.760
to explain, which is
why many of his critics
remained unconvinced

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:22.630
by his account of human origins.

01:31:22.630 --> 01:31:25.830
But now part of the
answer to why we have

01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:32.200
such a remarkable brain may have
come from a surprising source.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.330
Hansell Stedman is
a dedicated athlete

01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:37.000
and a medical doctor.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.760
He never imagined he would
come up with an answer

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:42.960
to a profound
evolutionary mystery.

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:46.530
He has devoted his
career to trying

01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:48.160
to cure muscular dystrophy--

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:54.300
a distressing and sometimes
fatal degenerative disease.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.060
His quest is very personal.

01:31:57.060 --> 01:32:00.900
STEDMAN: My
first exposure to muscular
dystrophy was inescapable;

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:03.030
my younger and my older brother

01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:06.030
both born with
muscular dystrophy.

01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:10.260
NARRATOR: Muscular dystrophy
is a genetic disease.

01:32:10.260 --> 01:32:14.530
Its sufferers have a mutation in
one gene that robs their muscles

01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:18.260
of the ability to
repair themselves.

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:22.830
STEDMAN: Typical workout here
on the rocks might blow through

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:26.100
a few thousand muscle cells,
but theyll regenerate overnight

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:29.360
and, if anything, be a little
stronger the next day I come in

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:32.100
as a result of all of that.

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:38.230
Whereas in muscular dystrophy,
the injury process is

01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:42.430
greatly accelerated and the
injury process outstrips

01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:45.160
the bodys ability to repair.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:50.030
NARRATOR: In search
of a cure, Stedman is
investigating the hundreds

01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:54.200
of genes that control the
development of muscles.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.200
So when the Human Genome
Project took off,

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.700
Stedman seized his chance.

01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:02.000
STEDMAN: When the horsepower of
the entire Human Genome Project

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.300
kicked in, we knew
exactly what to look for.

01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:11.960
NARRATOR: Stedman was hunting
for any new muscle-making genes.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:14.000
And so, as the human
genome was sequenced,

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:21.260
he began sifting through
the vast mountains of data.

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:25.600
Eventually he found what
he was looking for--

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:30.300
a previously unidentified
muscle-making gene.

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:33.160
But there was something
strange about this new gene.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:36.430
It didnt look like any
other muscle-making genes.

01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:40.000
Two letters were missing.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.860
This gene should
cause a disease.

01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:50.100
STEDMAN: It became
very clear early on

01:33:50.100 --> 01:33:53.130
that if you have a
mutation of this type,

01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:59.530
you get some serious
muscle problem going on.

01:33:59.530 --> 01:34:01.300
NARRATOR: Here was a puzzle.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:05.400
Why would humans carry a gene
that was clearly damaged?

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.630
Perhaps it was simply
a mistake in the data.

01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:14.230
Stedman decided to
dig a little deeper

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:18.200
and look in another
human subject.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.200
STEDMAN: In the department
of true confessions,

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.300
we do certain experiments
first on ourself,

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:23.800
largely out of convenience.

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:29.600
You can swab your own cheek
and get working on some DNA.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.330
NARRATOR: To his
utter amazement,

01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:35.530
he found the same
damaged gene in himself.

01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:37.500
Im seeing this in my own DNA,

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:39.760
and its suggesting
that Wait a minute.

01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.500
That means theres a muscle
disease here somewhere,

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.030
a muscle disease
that Im unaware of.

01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:47.500
And I thought it would be
worth checking this out

01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.160
in some other
members of the lab.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.460
NARRATOR: A few
swabs later and...

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:57.630
STEDMAN: Sure enough,
at the end of the day,

01:34:57.630 --> 01:34:59.500
every single person
had the same glitch

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:05.960
in their same DNA
at the same place.

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.130
NARRATOR: Here then
was a real mystery.

01:35:09.130 --> 01:35:13.460
It seemed that this
particular muscle-making gene

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:15.600
was common in humans.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:19.700
But when he identified
the same gene in apes,

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:23.360
it was just like any
other muscle-making gene.

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.400
Why was there such a difference?

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.830
What did this gene
enable one species to do

01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:33.330
that the other could not?

01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:38.700
Stedman began to research the
role of this gene in apes.

01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:43.030
And he found it made one
particular kind of muscle--

01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:45.160
the muscle for chewing.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:51.230
In fact, the muscle
used to close the jaw.

01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.300
In humans, that genetic
glitch meant that we chew

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:57.730
with just a fraction
of the force of an ape.

01:35:57.730 --> 01:36:01.900
This in itself
was interesting,

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:05.500
but where Stedman went
next was truly intriguing

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:08.800
and highly controversial.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.560
He drew a direct connection

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:14.330
between the power
of our jaw muscle

01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:25.400
and the evolution
of the human brain.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:29.630
Stedmans thinking
goes like this.

01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:31.630
The skulls of apes and humans

01:36:31.630 --> 01:36:35.730
are made of several
independent bone plates.

01:36:35.730 --> 01:36:41.830
They let our heads
get bigger as we grow.

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:46.600
The muscles for chewing
pull against these plates.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:51.300
And in an ape, these
forces can be enormous.

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:54.800
STEDMAN: In the
gorilla, the muscle--

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:57.360
the size of a human
thigh muscle--

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.760
lives here and has to go
through this large space

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:04.100
to power the jaw
moving back and forth.

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.600
Were not talking
biceps, tricep,

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.060
were talking quad here.

01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:10.300
This is an enormous muscle

01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:13.060
that has to come right
through this hole here

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:19.400
to power the
jaw-closing apparatus.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.960
NARRATOR: Stedman contends
that all this muscle power

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:29.300
forces an apes skull
plates to fuse together
at an early stage,

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:33.760
and this puts limits on how
much the brain can grow.

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:38.230
STEDMAN: In a chimpanzee,
gorilla, orangutan,

01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:41.530
those growth plates are
pretty much shut down,

01:37:41.530 --> 01:37:45.130
closed for business by about
three, four years of age.

01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:55.930
In a human, they remain open
for growth to perhaps age 30.

01:37:55.930 --> 01:37:59.600
NARRATOR: This, Stedman
believes, is the key.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:03.960
A mutation in our jaw muscle
allows the human skull

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.030
to keep expanding
into adulthood,

01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:14.960
creating a bigger
space for our brain.

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:23.560
And so our most important
organ is able to grow.

01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.200
Its very cool to us to
think that some kind

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:30.760
of muscle-altering mutation
might have actually been

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.700
a signature event
in the evolution

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:40.800
of what makes us
distinct as a species.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:43.700
It might have been an
absolute prerequisite

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:52.200
for us landing
where we are today.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:56.400
NARRATOR: But having the space
for a big brain is one thing.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:06.760
What is needed to
actually grow one?

01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:11.300
That is the question that Chris
Walsh is trying to answer.

01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:14.030
Hes another scientist
who never expected

01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:16.630
to be taking on what
even Darwin didnt know.

01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:18.860
WALSH: I never thought that
Id be studying evolution.

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:20.360
Im a neurologist

01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:24.700
interested in the brain and kids
with neurological problems.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:27.930
How you doing, buddy? Are
you doing all right, huh?

01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:29.830
You doing okay?

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.930
No one was more
surprised than us

01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:35.600
to find that the study of kids
with disabilities would lead us

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.000
into these fascinating
evolutionary questions.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.560
Is his breathing generally
okay during the day?

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:44.100
Sometimes when he
gets startled, it will
go up fast, like...

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.360
(panting)

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:49.260
...but then he calms
himself right back down...

01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:53.130
NARRATOR: Walsh
is a specialist in a rare
disorder called microcephaly.

01:39:53.130 --> 01:39:57.300
Children with microcephaly
are born with brains

01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:00.660
that can be half
the normal size.

01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.330
WALSH: This disorder
can be very devastating

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:03.860
for the kids that have it.

01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:06.860
They typically will have
severe mental retardation,

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.230
and so will not be able to
achieve normal language

01:40:09.230 --> 01:40:11.100
and normal schooling.

01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:14.460
And so its really an event
that defines the whole family.

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:16.930
It defines the lives
not only of the child,

01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:18.530
but of the parents
of that child.

01:40:18.530 --> 01:40:21.730
And these families
are desperately eager

01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:24.960
to try to understand at least

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.030
what caused the
disorder in their kids.

01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:30.260
NARRATOR: The purpose
of Walshs work

01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:33.930
was initially to help families
that might be carrying

01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:36.530
any defective genes
causing microcephaly

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.460
to plan their lives.

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:42.800
Were able to offer those
families predictive testing,

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.760
so that if theyre planning on
having additional children,

01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.400
we can tell them ahead of time

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:52.360
whether that child is likely
to be affected or not.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.730
NARRATOR: First Walsh
had to decide where to
look in the vast genome

01:40:56.730 --> 01:41:01.000
to find any possible
microcephaly-causing genes.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.860
So he focused on one
particular area of DNA.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.360
Other research suggested
it contained a gene

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.360
involved in the condition.

01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:13.030
That gene is known to control

01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:17.130
how and when brain
cells divide in animals,

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:19.660
such as fruit flies and mice.

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:22.560
What this gene seems
to do is help control

01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:25.700
the fundamental decision
that the brain has to make,

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:27.630
which is When do
I stop making cells?

01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:29.130
When is the brain
big enough?

01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:32.400
NARRATOR: Then his
team began searching

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:39.130
for that same gene in a family
with a history of the disease.

01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:43.560
And sure enough,
they found something.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:47.630
A gene that helps
direct brain growth.

01:41:47.630 --> 01:41:53.100
And crucially,
it was defective.

01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:56.200
Walsh decided to check this
finding in other patients.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.400
WALSH: Once we
found this gene,

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:04.130
we sequenced it in our kids
with microcephaly disorder.

01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:06.260
And we found that one
family after another

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.200
had a disabling
change in the gene

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:13.060
that completely
removed its function.

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:16.830
NARRATOR: In total he has found
some 21 different mutations

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:21.130
responsible for microcephaly.

01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:24.200
Sometimes one of the
DNAs chemical letters

01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.900
is replaced with another letter.

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:28.460
Sometimes letters
are missing entirely.

01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:32.300
But whatever the defect is,
they all stop the brain cells

01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:39.730
from dividing at a very
early stage of development.

01:42:39.730 --> 01:42:44.330
Walsh was now certain-- thanks
to his microcephaly patients--

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:51.160
he had found a gene key to the
growth of the human brain.

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:54.760
Now he decided to compare
normal versions of the gene

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.530
found in healthy humans with
the same gene in chimpanzees,

01:42:58.530 --> 01:43:03.400
our closest relatives.

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:09.830
And what he found
was astonishing.

01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:12.560
The gene in humans was
radically different

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:17.930
from that found in chimps.

01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:24.460
There had been a large
series of mutations.

01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:27.930
It could be that these
mutations were a major factor

01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:32.760
in the evolution
of our huge brains.

01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.360
And this discovery came about

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.400
only because of Walshs
work with his patients.

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:41.630
I think one of the
amazing things for us

01:43:41.630 --> 01:43:44.360
was the extent to which
studying human disease

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:45.660
can unexpectedly enlighten us

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:55.230
about something like
human evolution.

01:43:55.230 --> 01:43:58.160
NARRATOR: But this is only the
beginning of our understanding

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:00.900
of the evolution
of the human brain.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:03.960
Its an area of research that
is now attracting scientists

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:15.330
with a range of skills that
Darwin would have marveled at.

01:44:15.330 --> 01:44:18.430
Katie Pollard is a
biostatistician.

01:44:18.430 --> 01:44:20.930
Her life is spent
crunching numbers.

01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:23.900
POLLARD: What I love about
my work is geeking out

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.200
on a computer and
writing programs

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.460
and thinking about biology.

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:31.260
And that in doing this, Im
actually working on something

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.460
that not just
scientists care about,

01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:35.930
but really every human
being can relate to

01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:40.430
and cares profoundly about,
and thats what makes us human.

01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:44.530
NARRATOR: Pollard has
constructed an ambitious
computer program.

01:44:44.530 --> 01:44:47.060
Its designed to highlight DNA

01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:49.960
that is similar in
apes and other animals,

01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:54.500
but which is very
different in humans.

01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:01.800
That way, she hopes to identify
the key DNA that makes us, us.

01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:04.130
POLLARD: Out of these
15 million letters

01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:06.530
that make humans
different from chimps,

01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:09.730
we need to try to figure out
which ones were important.

01:45:09.730 --> 01:45:13.430
And so we use a technique
which is to look for places

01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:15.330
where human is
different from chimp,

01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:20.360
but chimp looks almost
identical to the other animals.

01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:25.730
NARRATOR: She too is looking for
DNA relating to the human brain.

01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:28.830
POLLARD: The brain is one of the
things thats changed the most

01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:30.260
during human evolution,

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:32.830
both in terms of its
complexity and its size.

01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:35.430
And so when we look
to find the parts

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:38.700
or our genome that
make us human,

01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.700
were particularly interested
in finding out whether

01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:44.960
these are things that are
involved in the brain.

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:48.700
NARRATOR: It is a huge
feat of number crunching,

01:45:48.700 --> 01:45:51.700
as Pollard loaded
in DNA sequences

01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:54.630
from both humans and chimps.

01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:57.160
POLLARD: You basically take a
bunch of computer hard drives

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.160
and you stack them up together.

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.730
We were able to take a
task that would have run

01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:03.630
for 35 years on a
desktop computer

01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:09.730
and do it in one afternoon.

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:12.600
NARRATOR: And at the
end of that afternoon,

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.760
they had a whole
array of material

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:20.600
charting the differences
between humans and chimps.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.230
Importantly, many
of those differences

01:46:23.230 --> 01:46:25.860
were not in the actual genes.

01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:29.830
They were in switches.

01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:32.000
POLLARD: It turns out
that the vast majority

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.500
are not genes.

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.160
Instead theyre pieces of our DNA

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.230
that we can think
of as switches--

01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:43.260
theyre pieces of DNA that turn
a nearby gene on or off...

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:46.530
that tell it where, in
what cells in our body,

01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:52.200
in what tissue, at what time or
at what level to be operating.

01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:54.400
NARRATOR: And there was
something even more intriguing

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.700
about those switches.

01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.660
A large number of
them, more than half,

01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:05.700
were nearby a gene that
was involved in the brain.

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:07.260
NARRATOR: In Pollards work,

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:12.860
one particular piece
of DNA stood out.

01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:15.560
It was a piece of DNA
that is known to be active

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.060
in the development of one of the
key parts of the human brain

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:21.000
in the embryo...

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:24.360
the cortex.

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:30.430
The cortex is that wrinkled
outer layer of our brain.

01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:33.430
Its vital for those
defining human capabilities

01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:45.630
like language, music
and mathematics.

01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:48.400
When she looked at
that DNA in chimps

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:51.300
and compared it to the
same DNA in a chicken,

01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:56.100
it was different in
just two letters.

01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:01.860
But in humans it was
different by 18 letters.

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:08.100
A massive mutation.

01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.800
This was about as great of a
eureka moment as you could have

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.130
as a scientist.

01:48:14.130 --> 01:48:17.500
NARRATOR: So here is another
intriguing piece of evidence

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:22.630
suggesting how DNA can shape our
distinctive human qualities.

01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:27.460
We now know that DNA works
in many different ways,

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:30.430
through genes that make
the stuff of our bodies,

01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:34.230
through switches that turn
those genes on and off

01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:37.360
and through sequences
of DNAs chemicals

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.560
that throw those switches.

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.300
Taken together, what
this all adds up to

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:45.130
is a way that we can
at last understand

01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:50.860
how small differences in DNA
can generate enormous change.

01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:55.000
POLLARD: Basically, you
can make massive changes

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.430
just changing those switches.

01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:59.260
So a small change, a couple
of DNA letters, could have

01:48:59.260 --> 01:49:03.760
a profound effect.

01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:07.230
NARRATOR: And so that
final Darwinian puzzle--

01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:11.100
how a human can be so
closely related to an ape

01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:22.900
and yet be so different-- is
now slowly being answered.

01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:28.800
150 years after Darwin first
put forward his grand theory

01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.330
to explain the great
diversity of life,

01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:37.500
the scientists who carry on his
legacy have advanced his work

01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:41.060
in wondrous ways.

01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.400
I think if Darwin
were here today,

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:45.760
hed be absolutely stunned,

01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:52.700
delighted, even moved to see
how much his theory has grown.

01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:54.900
TABIN: What we now
are able to understand

01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:57.560
on the one hand would
just blow him away.

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.900
But I also think it would give
him enormous satisfaction,

01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:03.030
because ultimately everything
weve been learning validates

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:05.930
the things that he said.

01:50:05.930 --> 01:50:08.400
JUDSON: I think that Darwin
was a remarkable scientist

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.460
and absolutely
should be celebrated.

01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:15.000
However, I do not think that
he was the end of evolution.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.860
On the contrary, I think
he was the beginning.

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:20.360
He outlined the major points,
but we have discovered more

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:26.860
than I think he would
have imagined possible.

01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:30.860
NARRATOR: As we celebrate the
200th birthday of Charles Darwin

01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:35.130
and the 150th anniversary
of his great work,

01:50:35.130 --> 01:50:37.900
there is still much
more to understand

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:51.000
about how the endless forms
of nature have arisen.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.900
And in rising to
that challenge,

01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:57.030
it is likely that we will
continue to advance medicine

01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:59.360
and come to a better
understanding

01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:09.800
of ourselves as well.

01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:12.360
