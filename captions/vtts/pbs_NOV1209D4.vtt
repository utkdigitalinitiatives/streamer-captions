WEBVTT

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.860
NARRATOR: We are inseparable.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.830
We're best friends.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.530
MAN: Anywhere you find humans

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.700
you will almost
certainly find dogs.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.060
NARRATOR: And they are smarter
than we ever imagined.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.100
Astonishing new
research is revealing

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.800
that dogs are far more than
merely tamed wild animals.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.700
MAN: What makes our
relationships so special
is the dog's ability

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.460
to be able to read our
emotions so effectively.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.430
NARRATOR: Have they evolved
a new kind of intelligence?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.630
WOMAN: Suddenly
there were dogs doing

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.800
something that not
even chimps could do.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.100
NARRATOR: Have
dogs developed a language to
communicate complex emotions?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.430
MAN: Anger, fear,
happiness, despair.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.830
MAN: You can almost understand
what they're thinking.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.800
NARRATOR: Why do we love
an animal that was once
a fearsome predator?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.430
How did dogs go from this...

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.160
to this?

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.260
Is it in the genes or
the way we treat them?

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.630
And when did it all begin?

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.930
The bones tell one story...

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.400
We start seeing the
first things 1 2,000
or 13,000 years ago.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.930
NARRATOR: The
genes tell another.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.130
100,000 years or more.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.700
NARRATOR: The answer is more
important than you might think.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.130
MAN: Without dog
domestication,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.200
civilization just would
not have been possible.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:41.130
NARRATOR: ''Dogs Decoded,''
right now on NoVA.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.960
Major funding for NoVA is
provided by the following...

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.060
ExxonMobil, taking on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300
the world's toughest
energy challenges.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.600
And by:

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:07.560
And...

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.760
And by the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:26.230
and by contributions to your PBS
station from viewers like you.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.100
Corrie, come here.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.500
NARRATOR: There are more pet
dogs than babies in the world--

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.960
nearly half a billion.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.300
Good boy. Sit.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.560
Come on.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.330
NARRATOR: We treat them as if
they are fellow human beings

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.900
with all the
thoughts, feelings

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.760
and emotions of a family member.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.930
Good girl.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.060
NARRATOR: It's an incredibly
close relationship.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.860
We share our lives, our homes,
even our beds with them.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.700
We're very close;
we're best friends.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.630
Pippin sleeps with us.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.100
He loves being in the bed
with his head on the pillow.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.660
He just seems to fit in.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.500
She's there with my slippers
first thing in the morning.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:11.130
She's part of the family,
she is the family.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.600
NARRATOR: For decades,
science has dismissed dogs

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.360
as being unworthy
of legitimate study.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.630
But all that has changed.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.100
Scientists are now
attempting to understand dogs

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.030
like never before.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.260
What kind of bond do we
really have with our dogs?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.260
Can we read each
other's emotions?

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.100
Are they smarter than we think?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.230
And how and when did this
unique relationship develop?

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.200
Dogs are all over the
world, they're everywhere.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.860
Anywhere you find
humans, you will almost
certainly find dogs.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.600
We're now beginning to realize

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.000
that we can answer
certain questions in dogs

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.660
that we can't really answer
in any other species.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.560
JULIANE KAMINSKI: There's been
this explosion in dog research,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.260
I think really because they are
specially tuned into humans

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:13.260
and this makes dogs extremely
interesting as a model.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
NARRATOR: Here at England's
University of Lincoln,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.860
Professor Daniel
Mills specializes

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.500
in veterinary
behavioral medicine.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.530
He's using eye
tracking technology

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.360
to probe how close our
relationship really is.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.900
MILLS: What we're
trying to do here

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.000
is see the world from
a dog's perspective

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.300
rather than just
impose our own views

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.230
as to how we think the
dog sees the world.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.830
NARRATOR: He's
attempting to discover

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.400
if dogs are as good at
reading our emotions

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.430
as their owners claim.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.160
WOMAN: He'll know
what I'm thinking

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.760
even before it's turned
into a thought bubble.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.430
WOMAN: He is clearly an animal.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.530
I accept that he is
totally an animal.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.460
I am not under any
illusions that he isn't,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.200
but he's more knowing than I
would expect an animal to be.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.560
He will look at me
with sorrowful eyes

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.860
and then give me one
big lick on the hand

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.630
as if to say,
''It's all right.''

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.260
It's this sixth
sense that dogs have.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.260
MILLS: One of the things that
a lot of people comment on

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.360
is that dogs seem to be
naturally attuned to them

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.800
and be able to sense
their moods and whatever,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.230
and part of our work here

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.830
is actually to look into the
scientific basis of that.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.760
NARRATOR: The key to a dog's
ability to read our emotions

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.130
might lie in something we
all do without knowing it.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.130
MILLS: When we express our
emotions in our faces,

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.930
we don't do it symmetrically.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.160
It's been shown that if
you take somebody's face

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.100
when they're
expressing some emotion,
like happiness or anger

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.360
or something like that,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.630
there is a difference between
the left and right side.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.660
NARRATOR: Composite
faces consisting of two
right or two left sides

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.900
look very different.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.400
MILLS: One of the
theories is that

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.900
maybe our emotions are
more faithfully presented

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.700
in the right side of our face,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.430
and that's the side
that we tune into.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.000
And when we look at a face,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.560
we have what's known as a
natural left gaze bias,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.800
so you naturally look much
more towards the left,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.360
i.e., the right-hand
side of somebody's face.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.500
NARRATOR: Eye-tracking
software demonstrates

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.800
that when presented
with a human face,

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.530
we nearly always
look left first.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.100
Daniel Mills wants to find out
if dogs use the same trick

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.400
to read human faces.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.560
MILLS: Shifting the
direction of your gaze

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.360
we thought was fairly
unique to people

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.030
until we started
looking at dogs.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.360
(whistles ) Taz, Tazy!

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.230
NARRATOR: To test the theory,

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.360
his team recreates this
experiment with dogs.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.730
Moose, what's that?

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.830
NARRATOR: They present a series
of images showing human faces,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.800
dog faces and inanimate objects

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.500
and record the direction of a
dog's gaze with a video camera.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.630
ANAIS RACCA: We
found that dogs,

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.700
when they are looking at
pictures of dog faces

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.200
or objects,

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.330
they will look randomly
on the left or the right.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.430
NARRATOR: But when it
comes to human faces,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.960
they make a
remarkable discovery.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.630
RACCA: So now we have Taz
looking at a human face,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.130
so first she's looking in
the middle of the screen,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.360
and here is the first eye
movements on the left.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.100
She's in the middle and
she's going on the left.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.630
Now this is Moose.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.700
And then we can see really
well that this is a left gaze.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.130
From here to here.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.400
We can see the white here.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.860
She's even moving her head.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.800
NARRATOR: Does this mean dogs
can read human emotions?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.930
As far as we know,
no other animal

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.300
has this relationship
with the human face.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.200
And dogs don't do
this with each other.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.100
This suggests that dogs
have acquired a new skill

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.430
enabling them to communicate
with us on an emotional level.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.100
Being able to detect
when somebody is angry

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.330
or potentially going
to be harmful to them,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.200
you could understand that there
may be a biological advantage

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.630
in being able to read
people's emotions

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.330
and equally that it makes sense

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.760
for a dog to approach somebody
when they're smiling.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.430
If dogs can read
human emotion,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.760
and increasingly the
scientific evidence

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.130
is beginning to point
in that direction,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.800
that's going to form the
basis of a very powerful bond

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.960
between human and dog.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.900
NARRATOR: Evidence like
this appears to underpin

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.600
our conviction that
dogs understand us

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.000
in a way other animals cannot.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.300
But for many dog owners,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.260
this unique relationship is much
more than a one-way street.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.260
I like to think we
can understand him.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.730
Yes, but he woofs and we talk.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.700
That's because he wants to
be part of the conversation.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.030
If he's bored, he'll take
a deep sigh and go...

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.930
(imitates dog whine)

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.530
I think he's got a bark
when he wants to go out.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.130
Ruff!

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.800
And I think he's got a bark
when he hears strange noises.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.030
(growls )

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.260
Sometimes when he
tells the kittens off

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.600
he goes (barks and
growls )... like that.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.260
If you're in a
certain mindset,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:06.360
you can almost understand
what they're thinking.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.000
NARRATOR: The idea that
we can understand barking
almost like a language

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.200
has always been
dismissed by scientists.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.000
But in Hungary, an
experiment is underway

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.460
looking for evidence to back up
the claims made by dog owners.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.460
Here in Budapest is one
of the world's first

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:27.830
research facilities dedicated
to the human/dog relationship.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.500
Dr. Adam Miklosi wants to see

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.200
if humans really can
understand the barks of dogs.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.230
Today he's out on
a field expedition

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.360
collecting recordings.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.560
(barking)

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.060
ADAM MIKLOSI: Scientists
used to think that
barking is a random noise

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.900
without any specific
information or content.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.060
However, we have
a different idea.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.730
Dogs might tell us something
about their emotions--

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.700
anger, fear,
happiness, despair.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.660
So these are basic emotions

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.030
which I think humans
might be able to recognize

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.160
in the barking sound.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.000
NARRATOR: To test this idea,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.760
Adam and his team act
out a number of scenarios

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.830
provoking dogs to bark
in different ways.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.060
When other people listen
to these recordings,

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.860
will they be able to match
the bark to the emotion?

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:25.730
Alone bark.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:31.560
(whimpering)

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.360
That sounds like a dog
asking for attention.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.660
(whimpering yelp)

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.860
Aww, it's anxious.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.100
It's sad.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.730
Distressed.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.760
(high-pitched yelp)

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.330
Want to be let off a chain
or something like that.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.360
(barking)

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.000
I think that one's playful.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.900
(barks )

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.300
Excitement.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.000
MAN: It seems as though

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.800
they're actually asking
their owner for something.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.100
(barking)

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.700
It sounds as if it may want a
ball or a toy or something.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:08.660
She could be playing with it.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:15.430
(barking)

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.730
Angry.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.930
This is a sound
that she would make

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.060
if she saw somebody behind
the fence walking along.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.100
(barking)

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.600
It's a stranger, I think.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.030
It's a stranger
encroaching on territory.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.830
(barking)

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.660
NARRATOR: The results
of Miklosi's research
are remarkable.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.630
It shows a strong
agreement between people

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.730
about the meaning
of different barks.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.960
(recording of barking)

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.000
MIKLOSI: Overall in
the study you could say

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.130
that people can
discriminate six barks

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.030
and most of them were
quite successful in this.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.730
NARRATOR: Dr. Miklosi
has created a system
to analyze the barks.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.500
It's helping him decode how
dogs communicate meaning.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.060
MIKLOSI: I measure the three
features of this sound.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.860
One was the frequency, the
other was the tonality

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.030
and the third was the interval
between the barking sounds.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.960
And probably this is also what
the judgment of people is based

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.260
when they are
describing the bark

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.000
in terms of emotional content.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.500
NARRATOR: But what's
more surprising

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.230
is not our ability to
interpret the barks,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.800
but what the barks
reveal about dogs.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.060
In the natural world, dogs'
wild relatives, wolves,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.730
only bark as a warning.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.600
Amazingly, during the
course of domestication,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.200
dogs may have evolved their
elaborate vocal repertoire

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.000
especially to
communicate with us.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.160
MIKLOSI: At the basic
level, everyone can do it

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.260
and there is a good
chance that barking

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.030
is a very good means to
communicate with humans.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.600
NARRATOR: The evidence from
these recent experiments

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.200
seems to confirm what dog
owners have asserted all along:

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.560
that dogs and people are
incredibly attuned to each other

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.630
in a way that no
other two species are.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:08.830
And new research techniques now
allow us to study more precisely

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.860
the nature of this bond.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.230
Some scientists believe
that our interaction

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.030
has a biochemical signature
that may be similar

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:29.260
to what happens between
a mother and a baby.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.400
It's really hard to describe.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.660
It's just an amazing feeling.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.400
NARRATOR: In Sweden, Professor
Kerstin Uvnas-Moberg

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.900
has been studying the role
of the hormone oxytocin

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.330
in creating the bond between
mothers and their newborns.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.500
UVNAS-MOBERG: Oxytocin is a
little, little peptide hormone.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.730
It's just nine amino acids.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.560
It's produced in a very
old part of the brain

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.160
called the hypothalamus.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.460
And oxytocin helps the
mother quickly establish

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.700
the positive feelings
and the bond to the baby.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.460
NARRATOR: Each time
a mother breastfeeds,

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.760
she has a new
release of oxytocin,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.030
which may reinforce the bond.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.730
UVNAS-MOBERG: It's sort of in
a way difficult to understand

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.830
how you can be
familiar with somebody

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.900
who is actually a stranger
so quickly, don't you think?

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.900
Yeah.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:31.330
NARRATOR: Professor
Uvnas-Moberg believes
oxytocin plays a similar role

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.160
in the bond between
dogs and their owners.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.330
To test the theory,

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.630
blood samples are taken
from dogs and their owners

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.100
before and during
a petting session.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.900
UVNAS-MOBERG: We had
a basal blood sample

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.960
and there was nothing, and
then we had the sample taken

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.160
at one minute and three minutes

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.060
and you could see this
beautiful peak of oxytocin.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.900
The fascinating
thing is, actually,

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.700
that the peak of oxytocin

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.500
is similar to the one we see
in breastfeeding mothers.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.660
NARRATOR: Surprisingly,
it's not just the owners
who are affected.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.900
Blood samples taken from
dogs reveal a similar burst

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.100
of oxytocin.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.200
It is a mutual kind of
interaction, you know.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.630
The owner touches with her hands

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.230
and they both smell,
hear and see each other.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.330
That is a very nice way of
triggering oxytocin release

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:27.060
in the two of them.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.130
NARRATOR: Oxytocin has a
powerful physiological effect.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.030
It can lower the heart
rate and blood pressure

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:34.800
and may lead to reduced
levels of stress.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.460
Research indicates that owning a
dog could even extend your life.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.760
UVNAS-MOBERG: If
you have a dog,

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.000
you are much less likely
to have a heart attack.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.160
If you have a heart attack,

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.530
you are three to four times
more likely to survive it

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.000
if you have a dog
than if you don't.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.060
NARRATOR: Our relationship
with dogs goes
back thousands of years.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.960
So, how did it begin?

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.060
Where did the first
dog come from?

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:09.200
Darwin recognized our unique
relationship with dogs,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.100
but even he couldn't
say for sure

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.230
which animal was the true
ancestor of today's dogs.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:21.730
It's a complex puzzle that both
archaeologists and geneticists

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.760
are working to solve.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.700
There's a huge amount of
variation in present-day dogs.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.730
Consider the difference between
a Pekinese and a Great Dane.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.260
Could they really
all be descended

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.730
from one wild ancestor?

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.700
GREGER LARSON: It could
have been a coyote

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.200
that may have
intergressed with a wolf

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.830
and then that may have been
slightly selected upon

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.960
to create one
particular breed of dog.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.030
Or jackals or African wild dogs.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.930
Any number of these
other dog-like species

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.760
that are out there must
have somehow come together,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.200
and that's where that
variation must have come.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.100
NARRATOR: Until the
advent of genetics,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.660
archaeology had
few firm answers.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.330
LARSON: All you have to
play with are the bones

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.000
and so when you
look at the bones,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.830
if you don't have a very small,
flat-faced, round-headed pug

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.100
in the archaeological record,

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.600
you don't know where
that came from.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.400
Those are questions
that before genetics

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.760
you really couldn't answer.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.700
NARRATOR: To unravel the
evolutionary origins of dogs,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.000
geneticists compare
DNA from dogs

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.900
with that of their
wild relatives.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.560
Specifically they look at
mitochondrial DNA sequences

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:36.160
which pass unchanged
down the maternal line.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.430
Since mitochondrial DNA
changes little over time,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.100
it can act as a
kind of signature

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.830
left by an animal's ancestors.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.660
Those markers in domestic
dogs show them to be

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.160
much more closely
related to gray wolves

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.000
than they are to
any other species.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.330
There's no admixture,

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.730
so we never see a mitochondrial
signature of, say,

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:58.700
an African wild dog or jackal
or coyote in a domestic dog.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.200
Of the thousands upon
thousands of mitochondrial DNA

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.630
that's been extracted
from domestic dogs,

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.400
every single one of them just
looks just like a gray wolf.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.960
(howling)

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.930
NARRATOR: This
controversy is settled.

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.830
Dogs are domesticated wolves.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.430
But a mystery remains.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.830
When and how did this
change take place?

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.060
What is clearly a dog?

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.260
Clearly a dog is something
which is clearly not a wolf.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.060
Well, here's a wolf skull,

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.860
and as you can see, it's
a long, quite low skull

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.960
with a relatively flat top.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.160
The teeth are quite large and
the thing is quite narrow.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.930
Compare that with
a domestic dog.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.600
This is a cairn terrier.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.030
And as you can see, the
process of domestication

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.030
has gone really
quite a long way.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.060
The whole face is
very much shorter;

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.930
it's been contracted
towards the brain case.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.130
The brain case itself
has a much steeper front

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.060
and a much more
bowed upper surface.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.960
So if you found that,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.760
you'd be in no doubt you were
dealing with a domestic dog.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.560
But this is a
domestic Alsatian,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.560
and telling these apart

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.760
really would be
substantially difficult.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.330
NARRATOR: And since early dogs
were probably very wolf-like,

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:13.460
it's hard to pinpoint when
domestication happened

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.560
by looking at the
shape of the bones.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.930
ROWLEY-CONWY: The best
I can give you is around

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.060
1 2,000 or 13,000 years ago.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.700
We start seeing the first things
that everybody would accept

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.060
as being domestic dogs.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.360
NARRATOR: But mitochondrial DNA
offers a different set of clues.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.260
LARSON: The original genetic
dates that were coming out

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.500
seemed to suggest that
domestication was happening

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.960
on a far earlier timescale
than was suggested

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.530
by anything in the
archaeological record.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.130
The first dates that were
coming out were on the order

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.500
of a hundred thousand
years or more,

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.230
which a lot of archaeologists
raised their eyebrows at.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:53.060
NARRATOR: It's hotly
debated exactly when
dogs were domesticated,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.700
but geneticists and
archaeologists agree

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.860
on one thing: our relationship
with dogs goes back

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.000
thousands of years, further
than with any other pet.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.830
It was a time when we were
still hunter-gatherers.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.800
ROWLEY: Dogs were certainly the
first animal to be domesticated

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.530
and they fit into hunting
and gathering societies

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.430
better than any other
species out there.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.400
LARSON: At this stage, when
we're hunting and gathering

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.000
and killing wild animals,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.360
after you finish with them

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.960
you're creating a
relatively large pile

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.600
of bone and leftover meat,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.400
things that these wolves would
have been very attracted to.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.900
Those wolves that were able to
take advantage of that resource

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.930
and were a little
bit less afraid

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.530
and could approach
the human camp

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.560
were then setting themselves up

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.600
into a closer
relationship with humans.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.400
We are carnivores, we
are social carnivores,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.930
we hunt in groups and
we hunt in daylight.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.200
There are not many other
species that do that.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.060
The wolf is a social carnivore
that hunts by daylight.

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:59.730
And therefore I think there's
natural potential for teamwork

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:05.630
between those two species.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.300
LARSON: We became much
better hunters with dogs.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.960
We are more successfully
taking down large game,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.600
which means we have
more food to eat,

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.030
which means we can
have more offspring,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:21.200
which means the overall
populations of humans grow.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.360
NARRATOR: Dog domestication
may have helped pave the way

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.560
for a fundamental change
in human lifestyle.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.530
ROWLEY-CONWY: It's hard
to see how early herders

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.960
would have moved and protected
and guarded their flocks

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.730
without domestic
dogs being in place.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.030
And one has to wonder

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.130
whether agriculture would
ever really have made it

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.230
as a viable alternative
to hunting and gathering.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.130
NARRATOR: Some believe
that the influence of
dogs on our development

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.430
was not just
important but pivotal.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:51.330
LARSON: Dogs absolutely
turn the tables.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.600
Without dogs, humans would
still be hunter-gatherers.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.730
Without that initial starting
phase of dog domestication,

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.400
civilization just would
not have been possible.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.000
NARRATOR: We look at our dogs
and we see an intelligence,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.300
an ability to interact with us

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.330
unlike any other
domesticated animal.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.360
But are dogs
really that clever,

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.060
or are they just dumb animals
taught to perform tricks

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.760
that mimic human behavior?

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.530
I think she's very smart.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.200
She learns tricks
fairly quickly.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.600
If I'm packing a suitcase,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.660
they will go and
sit in the suitcase

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:29.760
because they know that suitcase
is going to go somewhere.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.430
When I'm talking to him,

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.600
most of the time his little
head usually jilts to the side

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.860
as if he knows what I'm saying.

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.200
I do talk to her and she picks
up on what I say to her.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.260
I know it sounds stupid,
but I do actually have

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.660
a conversation with my dog.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.800
NARRATOR: So how does the
intelligence of a dog

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.100
compare in the animal kingdom?

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.360
New research is discovering
that in certain ways,

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.060
dogs may actually
think more like us

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.460
than any other animal,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.530
including our nearest
relative, the chimpanzee.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.200
KAMINSKI: Of all the questions

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.130
around the evolution
of human cognition,

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:09.600
of course people would focus
in on chimps quite naturally.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.760
And suddenly there were
dogs doing something

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.660
that not even chimps could do.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.930
NARRATOR: Cognitive psychologist
Juliane Kaminski compares chimps

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:34.500
with dogs in a series of
revealing experiments.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.430
At Leipzig Zoo, Kaminski
is testing chimps

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.860
to see if they can understand
human gestures, like pointing,

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:52.730
to find a hidden treat.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.900
As simple as it seems to us,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.260
even our nearest
primate relatives

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:59.230
fail the task miserably.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.060
KAMINSKI: She's not
really focusing on me

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.860
and she's simply
making her own choice.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.230
Most of the time you can see
that she makes a decision

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.930
long before I give my gesture.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.660
She doesn't even wait
for my information.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.530
It's such a cooperative
interaction,

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:17.760
so it's like really I'm
providing information for her

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.360
to find food, which is
just simply something

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.360
which would never happen
in a chimp group, really.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.060
I mean a chimp wouldn't
go like, ''Oh, look,
there's the banana,''

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:33.100
and then another chimp
could go and get it.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.400
NARRATOR: Since we're
the only species that
makes this gesture,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.630
it would be remarkable if any
animal could understand it.

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:42.860
Good boy.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.430
NARRATOR: But dog owners
take it for granted

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:48.060
that their dogs
respond to pointing.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.330
Good boy!

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.600
NARRATOR: For
Kaminski, it's proof

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.830
of their extraordinary
social intelligence.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.660
KAMINSKI: If you really
look at that gesture,

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.700
it's an informative gesture,

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.030
so it's, in its essence, a
very cooperative interaction.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.400
So I'm really helping
you to find something.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.760
And for dogs,

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.830
following pointing
seems to be very natural

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:12.260
and it makes dogs
extremely interesting.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.930
NARRATOR: In fact, dogs are so
tuned into our social cues,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.200
they can even pick up
on something as subtle

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.460
as the direction of our gaze.

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.930
(speaking German )

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.600
Humans have unique
almond-shaped eyes

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.700
with exposed white sclera
visible on each side.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.960
KAMINSKI: One hypothesis is
that we have evolved those eyes

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.530
because we use it
for communication,

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:39.800
so you can...

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.500
really with human eyes
you can really tell easily

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.200
which direction I'm looking.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.400
NARRATOR: But these aren't
skills dogs use with each other.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.400
They are abilities
dogs only use with us.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.230
KAMINSKI: I think it's
very easy to imagine

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.760
that they develop special skills
in interacting with humans

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.460
because that's their
new social partner.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.500
So they kind of learn to
interpret human communication,

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.000
which is different
from dog communication.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.930
So they kind of learned
a second language.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.360
So you could probably say
they are bilingual, yes.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.230
NARRATOR: Even puppies
as young as six weeks old

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:18.630
seem to respond
to human gestures.

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.130
At least some of the time.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.260
KAMINSKI: If they learn it,
they learn it very quickly,

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.500
and it's obvious that
they are ready to do it.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.400
So from the very beginning,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:34.860
they are ready to receive
human communication.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.900
NARRATOR: Dogs are primed
to communicate with us,

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.400
but just how smart are they?

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.500
New research reveals
their abilities extend

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500
way beyond what anyone thought.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.400
Professor Kaminski
has discovered

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.600
a remarkable border
collie living in Austria

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.160
just outside Vienna.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.800
She's conducted a
series of experiments

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.160
and is amazed at the
dog's intelligence.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.330
She can distinguish
objects by name,

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.630
which is really amazing.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.800
And she has, like,
many, many words.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.660
Kase.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.960
Das Zebra.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.430
NARRATOR: With a vocabulary
of over 340 words,

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.300
Betsy is pushing the boundaries

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.260
of what we think
dogs are capable of.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.730
Karotte.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.500
Sandwich.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.630
NARRATOR: Betsy's owner, who
prefers to remain anonymous,

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.500
explains how this all started.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.760
OWNER: I think it was when she
was four or five months old,

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.700
when she spontaneously started
to connect human words to items.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.760
When we were discussing

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.030
''shall we play with the
rope or with the ball?''

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.860
she immediately started
to bring those items,

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.030
so it was actually her
idea and from this time on,

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.160
we started to really train
her on different words.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.530
It was maybe one toy
per week and it worked.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.460
KAMINSKI: I think on average a
well-trained dog maybe knows

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:58.200
like 15 commands or something.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.460
There are just a very few
individuals who can do

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.460
what she does.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.000
I can tell you that I
tried it with my own dog

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.230
and it didn't work at all.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.100
So he could maybe
distinguish two objects

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.500
after a while and after
extensive training.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.600
But she is really able
to learn this easily.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.960
More than 300 objects--
that's pretty amazing.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.000
NARRATOR: Betsy's
understanding of vocabulary

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.600
rivals that of a two-year-old,

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.400
so Kaminski wants to
test her comprehension

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.100
on other skills as well.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:30.230
Can you go find me one
of them over there? Yeah?

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.160
NARRATOR: Two-year-olds are
just beginning to understand

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.600
how to use symbols
such as scale models

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.860
to represent something else.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.260
Though it looks easy, it
requires abstract thinking

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:44.430
way beyond the capacity
of almost all animals.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.400
But would Betsy be
able to do this, too?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.900
(giving instructions in German )

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.160
Ja...!

00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.000
(speaking encouragingly
in German )

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.500
KAMINSKI: This was something the
owners had never tried before

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.000
so when I came and I said,
''I want to do this,''

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
they were really, like,
''Oh, no way, that's
not going to work.''

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.200
I was the first one
doing that with her

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.160
and she had no problem doing
it right from the beginning.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.430
This is surprising
because in its essence,

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.930
if I hold out an object,

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:19.830
she turns it into
something communicative

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:24.300
and that's so interesting.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.630
NARRATOR: Children
also begin to grasp

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:30.360
that a drawing or photograph
can depict a real object.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.630
Thank you very
much, well done.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.000
KAMINSKI: In its
essence, the picture is

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.830
something very
different as the object

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:39.360
so it's a... it's a
piece of paper, but...

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.030
and it's two-dimensional but
it's representing something,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.460
so she obviously interprets
that as representing an object,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.830
a three-dimensional object,
and that's so interesting

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.860
that she does this.

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.060
''I know exactly what you want.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.460
This is the one you
want and I'm going to
go and get it for you.''

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.900
Ja, gut, super!

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.430
Braves Madchen,
gut gemacht, super.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:05.800
NARRATOR: Kaminski is
unsure how many dogs might
have similar abilities,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.200
but Betsy has shown that certain
dogs may have the potential

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:18.560
to be more intelligent than
we ever thought possible.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.930
So how did dogs acquire
these unique abilities?

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.430
Did these evolve over
thousands of years,

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.130
or is it rather the way
dogs have been raised

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:32.300
in a human environment?

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.030
(howling)

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:38.000
Dogs and wolves are still
the same species today.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.930
They can easily interbreed.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:47.830
Overall, wolves and dogs are
99.8% genetically identical.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.000
Given that they're
biologically so similar,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.930
is it the way we raise them in
our homes that makes a dog?

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:59.200
Researchers in Hungary set
out to answer this question.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.730
KUBINYI ENIK?: We wanted to see

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:05.400
whether the special relationship
between humans and dogs

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.530
are due to nature or nurture.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.030
So we wanted to see what happens

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.830
if a wolf is raised in a
human environment, in a home,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:21.130
whether it would act
like a dog or not.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.000
NARRATOR: A litter
of five-day-old cubs

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.660
is taken from a wolf
sanctuary outside Budapest.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.500
Several young researchers
are their adoptive parents,

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.900
caring for them 24 hours a day.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.300
As a control
for the experiment, they
already raised puppies.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.330
Now they aim to raise the
wolf cubs in the same way.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.630
So we were especially
nice with our cubs

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.530
because we wanted to maintain

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:53.030
a very good
relationship with them.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.960
They were really cute, so
it was not very difficult

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.930
to carry them
everywhere we were going

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.430
and we also slept
together with the cubs.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:04.960
So the bonding, it was good.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.230
I mean, I really liked my cubs

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.160
and there was a strong, really
strong relationship between us.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.030
NARRATOR: Then
something changed.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.200
Despite raising the cubs in
the same way as the puppies,

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:25.800
at eight weeks, differences
start showing up.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.060
ENIK?: Dog puppies were always
interested in what I was doing.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:35.060
There is a very strong
cooperative tendency in dogs

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.960
and this was missing in wolves.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.760
They had their own ideas.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:46.500
They were not much
interested in my activities.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.430
NARRATOR: The researchers
want to find out
exactly what is going on

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.660
and decide to run a series of
tests comparing the wolf cubs

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.860
with puppies of the same age.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.230
(toy yipping)

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:00.630
The puppies engage...

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:11.530
The wolves don't.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.660
Unlike dogs, the wolf cubs
do not respond to pointing.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:23.330
In fact, they hardly make eye
contact with humans at all.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.260
The cubs behave the same
as they would in the wild.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:34.860
(cub growling)

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:36.360
ENIK?: She was
really possessive.

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.330
If she wanted to
grab an object,

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.000
it was really difficult
to get it back,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.730
and if we wanted to
open the refrigerator
and have breakfast,

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.130
the pup was immediately in the
middle of the refrigerator

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.460
and grabbed something.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:57.260
It is not like with a dog that
you say, ''No, you shouldn't.''

00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.830
It just didn't care.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.160
(growling)

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.360
NARRATOR: The battles worsened.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.500
ENIK?: After the second month,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.760
we started to have
more and more conflicts

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.960
and the wolves wanted
to destroy everything.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.960
And of course when the cub
is a small cub, it's nothing,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.830
but when they reach 40 or
50 kilograms, you know,

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.660
it starts to be
really dangerous.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:33.400
We just could not keep
them in the house anymore.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.860
Hoo!

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.860
NARRATOR: After four
months, the cubs had to be
returned to the reserve.

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.630
The experiment shows that
upbringing has little impact.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.700
It's impossible to
turn a wolf into a dog,

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.460
no matter how much it
is loved and nurtured.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.800
ENIK?: So according
to our experiences,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.530
the dog is not a
socialized wolf at all.

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.330
These differences we experienced

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.300
in the communicative
ability and in the
social behavior of dogs,

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.160
this is the effect
of domestication.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.500
NARRATOR: The
differences must lie

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.160
in the way dogs have
been bred by humans

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.100
over thousands of years.

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:18.130
Their unique abilities are
now part of their nature.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:22.100
But how did dogs evolve
these innate attributes?

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.430
Can we figure out
what made them tame?

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:30.660
A remarkable experiment in
Siberia may hold the key

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.730
to understanding how wolves
evolved into domesticated dogs.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:36.300
(horn honks )

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.300
Half a century ago,

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.800
Soviet scientists set
up a breeding program

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.460
to see if they could
domesticate silver foxes.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.360
Foxes are closely
related to wolves.

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.700
The project, which has
attracted the attention

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.930
of scientists
across the world,

00:35:52.930 --> 00:36:00.700
is opening a remarkable window
on the process of domestication.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.060
Here on a farm outside
the city of Novosibirsk,

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.930
the experiment still
continues today,

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.130
overseen by Dr. Lyudmila Trut.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.500
The breeding program
began in 1959

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:21.460
when the first foxes were
selected from local fur farms.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:23.160
(Trut speaking Russian )

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.960
(translated): We approached
the animals in the cages

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.730
and recorded their
reaction to us.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.560
We could see

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.430
that some of the foxes
showed aggressive behavior.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.330
Others were frightened.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.060
But only one percent of them
showed neither signs of fear

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:45.730
or aggression.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:49.300
NARRATOR: This one percent
is selected to become
the founding generation

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.160
of a new population of foxes.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.030
At every generation, the
selection process is repeated.

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:00.630
Only the tamest foxes
are allowed to breed.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.830
Within just three generations,

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:10.360
the aggressive behavior
begins to disappear.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.660
The radical changes
came through in the
eighth generation,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.800
when foxes started to
seek contact with humans

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.030
and show affection to them.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:24.400
The amazing thing was that cubs
who had just started to crawl

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:28.430
opened their eyes and started
showing affection to humans

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:34.130
by breathing heavily, wagging
their tails and howling.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:42.730
This kind of response
was a big surprise to us.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:46.400
NARRATOR: Half a century and
nearly 50 generations later,

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.530
the foxes are tamer than ever.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:52.830
It's an accelerated model

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:59.330
of how dogs might have been
domesticated from wolves.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:02.730
In order to understand the
role that genetics plays

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:04.700
in the taming process,

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:16.560
the scientists also bred a group
of foxes to be more aggressive.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:29.030
(foxes yipping)

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.260
(speaking Russian )

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:39.230
(translated): It
just bit my hand.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.560
I didn't even open the cage.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:43.330
I just put my hand out

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:52.860
and it managed to bite
me through the bars.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.430
This isn't a fox,
it's a dragon.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.460
(fox shrieking)

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.230
NARRATOR: This experiment
allows researchers

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:02.600
to make unique comparisons

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:09.260
between tame and
aggressive foxes.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.160
(translated): We did
an experiment with
cross-fostering,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:17.500
where we gave aggressive cubs
to tame mothers and vice versa.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.900
We found out that the mother's
behavior does not influence

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.160
that of the cub.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:29.000
This cub was brought
up by a tame mother.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.600
NARRATOR: The results are clear.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.660
The difference between
tame and aggressive foxes

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:39.200
is almost entirely genetic.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.060
We even took the experiment
one stage further

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:45.200
and transplanted embryos
from aggressive mothers

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:50.160
into tame mothers, but the
results were the same.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.500
It proved that you can't change
the gene of aggressiveness

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500
and it will be
kept and preserved

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.030
for the next generation.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.330
NARRATOR: Geneticists
have already located

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:06.100
several regions on the fox
genome responsible for tameness.

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.430
They're now taking blood samples
from tame and aggressive foxes

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.560
in an attempt to pinpoint
the specific genes.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.100
Dr. Anna Kukekova,
the scientist leading
this research team,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.430
makes the 5,000-mile journey
to Siberia to study the foxes.

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.700
KUKEKOVA: Behavior is complex.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.760
We're pretty sure there
will be not a single gene,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.900
definitely the
orchestra of genes,

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.530
which is responsible
for this behavior.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:40.300
NARRATOR: One fascinating result
to come out of this experiment

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.860
is the fact that tamer foxes
are producing less adrenaline.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:47.530
With lower adrenaline levels,

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:53.300
the foxes experience less
fear and are less aggressive.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.860
He is like a doggy, you know,
like the puppy who's very happy

00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.260
when somebody picks
him up from the floor.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.300
(fox panting excitedly )

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.230
It's unbelievable how they
trust, how they trust people

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:20.730
and I just really
admire these animals.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.830
TRUT: So within 50 years

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.960
of our intensive
selection process,

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.400
this fire-breathing dragon has
turned into a human friend.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.830
If foxes were brought up
in a domestic environment,

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.460
interacting with other
animals and humans,

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.560
they would make fantastic pets.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.500
They are as independent as cats

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:52.800
but at the same time as
devoted as any dog could be.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.160
NARRATOR: One surprising
result of this experiment

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:00.800
is that as the foxes'
behavior changes,

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.800
so does their
physical appearance.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.200
Just a few generations
into the experiment,

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.030
scientists noticed a
curious phenomenon.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.000
The normal pattern and
silver color of the coat

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.760
changed dramatically in
some of the tame foxes.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.500
Their tails often became
curly instead of straight.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.830
Some young foxes kept
their floppy ears

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.200
for much longer than usual,

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:27.360
and their limbs and tails
generally became shorter

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.160
than their wild counterparts'.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.430
In effect, the
tame silver foxes

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:40.230
were beginning to
look more like dogs.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:43.830
BRIAN HARE: What
this shows is that when you
select against aggression,

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:47.160
you get almost all the same
suite of changes that you see

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.430
when you compare dogs to wolves.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.260
NARRATOR: Evolutionary
anthropologist Brian Hare

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.930
is visiting the breeding
program in Siberia.

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:59.300
He believes once you
select for tameness,

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.200
changes in appearance
will naturally follow.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.060
HARE: I think the surprise when
thinking about dog origins

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.600
is that there are so many ways

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.160
that dogs are
different from wolves,

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.930
so is it that you had to select

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:14.830
for each of these
traits individually?

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:17.700
Well, the answer from
the fox work is no.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.500
If you just select
for behavior,

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.960
a lot of the morphological
and physiological changes

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.630
that we see between
wolves and dogs,

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:24.700
they just get dragged along.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.360
You end up with this crazy
variance, you know--

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.060
floppy ears, curly tails... you
know, all these other things

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.900
that are really
cute to talk about

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.960
so you get a lot
of stuff for free

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.230
when you select
against aggression.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:42.030
NARRATOR: For Hare, this wide
variety of physical traits

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.230
reveals something fundamental
about domestication.

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:48.730
HARE: When you're selecting
against aggression,
what you're doing

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.060
is you're favoring
juvenile traits.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:56.100
Juveniles and infants show much
less aggression than adults,

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.060
and so basically you've
frozen development

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:01.030
at a much earlier stage,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:05.030
and so you have an animal as an
adult that looks and behaves

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.200
much more like a juvenile.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.560
It's amazing that you get

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.500
all this variance that's
hidden under the surface.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:10.730
It starts to express itself,

00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:12.960
and then, of course, later
people can directly decide,

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.860
''I really like the
one with the curly tail

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.500
''and I'm going to
take two of them

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.960
and I'm going to
put them together.''

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.660
And then you can end up having
dogs that sort of shift

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:29.230
in ways that people
want them to go.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:30.800
NARRATOR: In the past
few hundred years,

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.730
we've taken dogs'
infantile features

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.860
and emphasized them even further
through selective breeding.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.230
We've created hundreds
of breeds to fulfill
different roles,

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:45.660
but some of them have been
bred purely for their looks.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.360
MORTEN KRINGLEBACH: I
think this kind of breeding

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.360
really tells us a lot about
what kind of people we are,

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.830
what it is that we
like about dogs.

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:55.230
How would you describe Nelly?

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.430
One word.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.700
Uh,

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.760
Cute.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.460
GIRL: Cute, adorable

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.600
and funny.

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.300
I just look at her
and I... I just smile.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.430
Particularly when
she's sleeping.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.600
She's very, very cute.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.160
NARRATOR: We all know
we find them cute,

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:16.660
but what is it exactly

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.660
that makes us respond
to dogs so powerfully?

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.160
Psychiatrist Morten
Kringlebach has a theory

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.460
as to why the way dogs look has
such a profound impact on us.

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:31.560
The need to nurture I think is
something that is so deep in us

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.900
that we find it very
difficult to resist.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:38.600
Dogs, puppies have very
infant-like features,

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.030
and maybe that's
one of the reasons

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.900
why we think they
are, you know, so cute

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:45.160
is that they remind
us of the infants

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.760
that we are, so to speak,
programmed to like.

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:50.260
There's something about the way

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.160
that the facial
features are organized

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.860
that makes us want
to care for them,

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.100
and it's about having
a large forehead,

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.730
it's about having
large eyes, big ears,

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.060
and there's something about that

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:05.260
that almost unconsciously
we cannot help ourselves

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:09.300
but actually like.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:10.660
How are you feeling in there?

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.500
WOMAN: Good.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.660
We're just going to
go one more scan.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.560
NARRATOR: Dr.
Kringlebach is exploring

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.500
how strongly we respond to
these infantile features.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.400
He uses an extremely powerful
machine called a MEG scanner

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.300
that allows him to
measure in real time

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:36.900
the brain's response to pictures
of baby and adult faces.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.660
KRINGLEBACH: What we
found was that within
a seventh of a second,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.400
there was activity in the
frontal part of the brain,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.460
just over the eyebrows, in
the orbitofrontal cortex,

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.100
that was present when you were
looking at the infant faces

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:52.760
but not when you were
looking at the adult faces.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.500
This part of the brain
is very much involved

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.660
in emotional responses,

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.360
and so what we think we may
have stumbled across here

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.030
is really in many ways
the brain equivalent

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.300
of the parental instinct.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:10.130
There's almost like a
wired-in automatic reaction.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.230
Just as with the infant, when
you are looking at dogs,

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.600
you find it very hard to
control your emotions.

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:23.230
You find it very hard not
to get that need to nurture.

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:25.730
Wow, look at that--
what a nice belly.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.860
Mushu, mushu...
hey (laughing).

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.530
(in baby-talk voice): Oh, Boo,
you're so cute, yes, you are.

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:33.530
Oh, yes...

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:36.100
NARRATOR: But when we treat
dogs as if they were children,

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.260
do we sometimes allow them
to replace our children?

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:43.360
They are essentially moving our
focus away from having children

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.200
on to having pets.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:47.960
ROWLEY-CONWY: I think
we can think of little
puppies brought home

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.460
as parasites.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.500
They don't do anything useful.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.100
They're not perceived
as a food source.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.000
They're not perceived
as a guard dog.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.600
They are simply
brought home for fun.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.630
The cuckoo is perhaps
quite a good analogy,

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:02.330
because the baby
cuckoo, of course,

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.200
being planted in
somebody else's nest,

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.930
prompts mother bird to
look after baby cuckoo,

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:11.260
even though there's nothing in
it for the mother bird at all.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.730
KRINGLEBACH: I think
it's safe to say

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.960
that dogs have evolutionarily
been very successful.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.360
If you compare them to wolves,

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.500
you will see that wolves are
now an endangered species,

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:23.060
while dogs, of course,
are all around the world.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:27.300
NARRATOR: Whether they
are viewed as parasites
or beloved companions,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.460
no one can deny the
evolutionary success

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.200
of the domesticated dog.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.230
In fact, there are over
400 million worldwide.

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:41.660
And humans have created over 400
genetically distinct breeds.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:46.700
Research on dogs is heading
in exciting new directions.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.660
Geneticists have already mapped
the genome of one breed--

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.000
the boxer.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.430
Studying this genome,
scientists now realize
that it offers

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.060
tremendous promise in
curing human disease.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:02.500
Dr. Elinor Karlsson,
of the Broad Institute,

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.330
was part of the team that mapped
the boxer genome in 2005.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.800
KARLSSON: If you looked in,

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.530
you know, a
population of humans,

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:11.900
you'd have quite a lot of
genetic variation across them.

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.200
People would be quite
different from one another.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.030
But within a breed, dogs are
very similar to each other.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:21.300
NARRATOR: Dr. Karlsson believes
that she can use that similarity

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:25.160
to understand the
genetics of human disease.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.630
KARLSSON: I think there's
hundreds of diseases
that are in common

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:29.000
between dogs and humans.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.260
There's diabetes, there's
various cardiac diseases,

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.130
there's epilepsy,

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.030
there's a lot of
different cancers--

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.460
bone cancers, breast
cancers, brain tumors.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:42.200
NARRATOR: Today the
team is taking blood
samples from boxers,

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.260
which are susceptible
to a fatal heart disease

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.900
called cardiomyopathy.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:50.460
The DNA in their blood
could hold vital clues

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.860
to the causes of the disease.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.130
KARLSSON: Once we had
the dog genome sequenced,

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.260
we could design a gene chip
which would allow us to compare

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.200
all of our sick dogs
and our healthy dogs

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.060
and find the genes that
are causing diseases.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:08.360
NARRATOR: Using a genotyping
machine, Dr. Karlsson
simultaneously analyzes

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.960
thousands of regions of DNA

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.960
from boxers with and
without this disease.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:15.260
KARLSSON: So what you see

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.330
when you compare the sick
dogs to the healthy dogs

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:19.730
and go across the genome from
chromosome 1 to chromosome 2

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.300
and across, is that most of
the points are right near zero

00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.930
and there's not a
lot of differences

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:25.600
between the healthy
dogs and the sick dogs

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:28.130
until you get to chromosome 1
7 and there, all of a sudden,

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.600
you have a huge
number of differences,

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.960
and this is really exciting
because this means that this is

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.100
the region of the genome

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.830
that holds the gene that's
causing our disease.

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.560
NARRATOR: Now, with the
mutation's identity known,

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.930
the team is able to locate the
corresponding gene in humans.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.330
It's accelerated a process
that, without dogs,

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.260
could have taken decades.

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.260
KARLSSON: I think that there's
probably a lot of diseases

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.930
that are so
complicated in humans,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.200
that dogs basically give us
a huge head start on that.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.700
We can really say that dogs
are good for our health.

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:03.960
NARRATOR: For a pet that
has been around so long,

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.230
dog research is a surprisingly
new area of science.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:12.930
Experiments have shown what dog
owners have always suspected--

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:16.630
after thousands of years
of living together,

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:20.760
dogs are attuned to us
like no other animal.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.230
It's a very important part of
life to actually know a dog

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.630
and especially a dog that
adores you like this.

00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:31.300
It's got to be
good for your self.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:33.300
It's kind of impossible
to have a bad day

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:34.430
when you're coming home

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.700
to a wet nose and a
waggy tail, I think.

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:40.400
I can't imagine
life without her.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.460
WOMAN: It's quite strange.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:43.630
We weren't lacking anything
before we had him,

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:46.730
and yet now we would feel we
were lacking if he wasn't here.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:51.300
They just enrich your life;
they are the best thing ever.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.260
They keep you young.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.930
NARRATOR: New research has
taken our understanding

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.930
of how dogs evolved
to a whole new level,

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:04.530
getting us closer to
what it means to be tame.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:07.000
MILLS: While we can
have good relationships

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.800
with a wide
variety of animals,

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.660
historically our relationship
with dogs seems to have been

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:13.230
the longest one with
any domestic animal.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.630
LARSON: I think one reason

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:16.860
that there are almost seven
billion people on earth

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.700
is in large part due to the
role that dogs have played

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.330
in our evolutionary existence.

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.730
Personally I don't think
it's any coincidence

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:44.160
that the dog is referred
to as man's best friend.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.800
the exploration continues
on NOVA's website,

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.900
