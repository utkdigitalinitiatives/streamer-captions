00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770


2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.270
Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.130
Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.930
Let me be clear of thee.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.730
Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you;

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670
nor I am not sent to you by my lady,

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.970
to bid you come speak with her;

8
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.270
nor your name is not Master Cesario;

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.400
nor this is not my nose neither.

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.230
Nothing that is so is so.

11
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.000
I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else:

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Thou know'st not me.

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.430
Vent my folly! he has heard that word

14
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.070
of some great man and now applies it to a fool.

15
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.930
Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,

16
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.300
will prove a cockney. I prithee now,

17
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.970
ungird thy strangeness

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.700
and tell me what I shall vent to my lady:

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.100
shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.330
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me:

21
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.900
There's money for thee: if you tarry longer,

22
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.130
I shall give worse payment.

23
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.300
By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.470
that give fools money get themselves a good report--

25
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.100
after fourteen years' purchase.

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.300
Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.

27
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.030
Why, there's for thee, and there, and there.

28
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.470
Are all the people mad?

29
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.030
Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.

30
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.530
This will I tell my lady straight:

31
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.600
I would not be in some of your coats for two pence.

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.870
Come on, sir; hold.

33
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.330
Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work with him;

34
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.930
I'll have an action of battery against him,

35
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.270
if there be any law in Illyria:

36
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730
though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.

37
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.970
Let go thy hand.

38
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330
Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier,

39
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.100
put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.

40
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.830
I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now?

41
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.230
If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.

42
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.500
What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two

43
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.530
of this malapert blood from you.

44
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.970
Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!

45
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.430
Madam!

46
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.230
Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,

47
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.100
Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,

48
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.670
Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!

49
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.170
Be not offended, dear Cesario.

50
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.370
Rudesby, be gone!

51
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.130
I prithee, gentle friend,

52
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.830
Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway

53
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.870
In this uncivil and thou unjust extent

54
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.330
Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,

55
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.770
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks

56
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.500
This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby

57
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.230
Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:

58
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.470
Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,

59
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.200
He started one poor heart of mine in thee.

60
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.570
What relish is in this? how runs the stream?

61
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.330
Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:

62
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.570
Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;

63
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.030
If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

64
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.130
Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!

65
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.000
Madam, I will.

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.670
O, say so, and so be!

67
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.270
Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;

68
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.170
make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate:

69
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.170
do it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.

70
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.470
Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in't;

71
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.200
and I would I were the first that ever

72
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.870
dissembled in such a gown. The competitors enter.

73
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.430
Jove bless thee, master Parson.

74
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.830
Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of Prague,

75
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.670
that never saw pen and ink,

76
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.270
very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc,

77
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.430
'That that is is;'

78
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.270
so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson;

79
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.630
for, what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?

80
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.900
To him, Sir Topas.

81
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.230
What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!

82
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.200
The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.

83
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.470
Who calls there?

84
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.630
Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.

85
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.900
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.

86
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.500
Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!

87
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.800
talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

88
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.770
Well said, Master Parson.

89
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.070
Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged:

90
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.730
good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad:

91
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.200
they have laid me here in hideous darkness.

92
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.070
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most

93
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.230
modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones

94
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.700
that will use the devil himself with courtesy:

95
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.670
sayest thou that house is dark?

96
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.630
As hell, Sir Topas.

97
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.200
Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,

98
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.100
and the clearstores toward the south north

99
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.830
are as lustrous as ebony;

100
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.700
and yet complainest thou of obstruction?

101
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.830
I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.

102
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.700
Madman, thou errest:

103
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.430
I say, there is no darkness but ignorance;

104
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.000
Fare thee well.

105
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.330
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

106
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.570
My most exquisite Sir Topas!

107
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.030
Nay, I am for all waters.

108
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.070
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown:

109
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.900
he sees thee not.

110
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.030
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how

111
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.100
thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this knavery.

112
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.330
If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were,

113
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.370
for I am now so far in offence with my niece

114
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.300
that I cannot pursue with any safety

115
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:15.830
this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.

116
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.430
[Singing]

117
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.900
'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,

118
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.030
Tell me how thy lady does.'

119
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.100
Fool!

120
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.870
'My lady is unkind, perdy.'

121
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.870
Fool!

122
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.230
'Alas, why is she so?'

123
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.930
Fool, I say!

124
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.300
'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?

125
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.430
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand,

126
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.430
help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:

127
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:49.130
as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.

128
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.130
Master Malvolio?

129
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.470
Ay, good fool.

130
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.400
Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?

131
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.830
Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused:

132
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.170
I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.

133
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.800
But as well? then you are mad indeed,

134
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.470
if you be no better in your wits than a fool.

135
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.170
They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,

136
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.270
send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can

137
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.030
to face me out of my wits.

138
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.070
Advise you what you say; the minister is here.

139
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.300
Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!

140
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.230
endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.

141
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.370
Sir Topas!

142
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.970
Maintain no words with him, good fellow.

143
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.600
Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.

144
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.400
Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.

145
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.400
Good fool, some ink, paper and light;

146
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.530
and convey what I will set down to my lady:

147
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.400
it shall advantage thee more

148
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:40.400
than ever the bearing of letter did.

149
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.330
I will help you to't. But tell me true,

150
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.530
are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?

151
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.130
Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.

152
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:02.400
Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.

153
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.970
I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

154
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.130
Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree:

155
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:08.300
I prithee, be gone.

156
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:09.100
[Singing]

157
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.100
I am gone, sir,

158
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.830
And anon, sir,

159
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.900
I'll be with you again,

160
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.530
In a trice,

161
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.570
Like to the old Vice,

162
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.730
Your need to sustain;

163
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.700
Who, with dagger of lath,

164
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.070
In his rage and his wrath,

165
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.230
Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:

166
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.500
Like a mad lad,

167
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.030
Pare thy nails, dad;

168
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.530
Adieu, good man devil.

169
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:41.400


170
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.230
This is the air; that is the glorious sun;

171
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.070
This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;

172
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.870
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,

173
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:07.230
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?

174
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.470
I could not find him at the Elephant:

175
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.530
Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,

176
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.000
That he did range the town to seek me out.

177
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.700
His counsel now might do me golden service;

178
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.400
For though my soul disputes well with my sense,

179
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.030
That this may be some error, but no madness,

180
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.470
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune

181
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.400
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,

182
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.930
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes

183
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.030
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me

184
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:40.900
To any other trust but that I am mad

185
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.970
Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,

186
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:49.070
She could not sway her house, command her followers,

187
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.030
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch

188
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.470
With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing

189
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.700
As I perceive she does: there's something in't

190
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.770
That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.

191
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.530
Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,

192
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.330
Now go with me and with this holy man

193
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.070
Into the chantry by: there, before him,

194
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.170
And underneath that consecrated roof,

195
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.470
Plight me the full assurance of your faith;

196
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.130
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul

197
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.470
May live at peace. He shall conceal it

198
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.800
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,

199
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.170
What time we will our celebration keep

200
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.730
According to my birth. What do you say?

201
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.800
I'll follow this good man, and go with you;

202
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.130
And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.

203
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:47.170
Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,

204
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.430
That they may fairly note this act of mine!

205
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.130
