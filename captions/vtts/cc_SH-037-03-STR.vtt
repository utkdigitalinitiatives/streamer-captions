00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330


2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.330
(clock chimes)

3
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.000
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.070
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.270
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop

6
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.200
To see the making of her carcanet,

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.470
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.700
But here's a villain that would face me down

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.470
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.730
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.630
And that I did deny my wife and house.

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.800
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.200
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.300
That you beat me at the mart,

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.630
I have your hand to show:

16
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.570
If the skin were parchment,

17
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.530
and the blows you gave were ink,

18
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.870
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

19
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.430
I think thou art an ass.

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.530
Marry, so it doth appear

21
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.830
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.300
I should kick, being kick'd;

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.630
and, being at that pass,

24
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.970
You would keep from my heels

25
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.870
and beware of an ass.

26
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.470
You're sad, Signior Balthazar:

27
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.570
pray God our cheer

28
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.530
May answer my good will

29
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230
and your good welcome here.

30
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.570
I hold your dainties cheap, sir,

31
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.270
and your welcome dear.

32
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.670
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,

33
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.700
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

34
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.930
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

35
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.500
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

36
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.300
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

37
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.730
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:

38
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.470
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;

39
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.430
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.

40
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.530
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

41
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.370
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

42
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.170
Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,

43
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.370
idiot, patch!

44
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.670
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.

45
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.530
Dost thou conjure for wenches,

46
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.430
that thou call'st for such store,

47
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.500
When one is one too many?

48
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.900
Go, get thee from the door.

49
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.430
What patch is made our porter?

50
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130
My master stays in the street.

51
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.400
Let him walk from whence he came,

52
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.100
lest he catch cold on's feet.

53
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.170
Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

54
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.300
Right, sir; I'll tell you when,

55
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.870
an you tell me wherefore.

56
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.230
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

57
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.370
Nor to-day here you must not;

58
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.770
come again when you may.

59
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.230
What art thou that keepest me out

60
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.300
from the house I owe?

61
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.430
The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.

62
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.500
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office

63
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.930
and my name.

64
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.400
The one ne'er got me credit,

65
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.100
the other mickle blame.

66
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.300
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,

67
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.000
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name

68
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.500
or thy name for an ass.

69
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.430
What a coil is there, Dromio?

70
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.070
who are those at the gate?

71
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.700
Let my master in, Luce.

72
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.900
Faith, no; he comes too late;

73
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.430
And so tell your master.

74
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.030
O Lord, I must laugh!

75
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.100
Have at you with a proverb--

76
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.630
Shall I set in my staff?

77
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.370
Have at you with another; that's--

78
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.570
When? can you tell?

79
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.430
If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce,

80
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.130
thou hast answered him well.

81
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.870
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?

82
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.800
I thought to have asked you.

83
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.000
And you said no.

84
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.170
So, come, help: well struck!

85
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.730
there was blow for blow.

86
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.770
Thou baggage, let me in.

87
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.500
Can you tell for whose sake?

88
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.330
Master, knock the door hard.

89
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.830
Let him knock till it ache.

90
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.070
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

91
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.270
What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

92
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.370
Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?

93
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.100
By my troth, your town is troubled

94
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.430
with unruly boys.

95
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.530
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

96
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.570
Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

97
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.670
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

98
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.900
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome:

99
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.930
we would fain have either.

100
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.230
In debating which was best,

101
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.300
we shall part with neither.

102
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.730
They stand at the door, master;

103
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.700
bid them welcome hither.

104
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.470
There is something in the wind,

105
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.270
that we cannot get in.

106
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.200
You would say so, master,

107
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.230
if your garments were thin.

108
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.100
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

109
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.700
Break any breaking here,

110
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.070
and I'll break your knave's pate.

111
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.570
A man may break a word with you, sir,

112
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.130
and words are but wind,

113
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.900
Ay, and break it in your face,

114
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.870
so he break it not behind.

115
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.300
It seems thou want'st breaking:

116
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.000
out upon thee, hind!

117
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.670
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

118
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.200
Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!

119
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.430
Herein you war against your reputation

120
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.970
And draw within the compass of suspect

121
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.970
The unviolated honour of your wife.

122
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.230
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,

123
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.500
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,

124
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.900
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:

125
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.230
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse

126
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.700
Why at this time the doors are made against you.

127
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.370
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,

128
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.430
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,

129
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.430
And about evening come yourself alone

130
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.230
To know the reason of this strange restraint.

131
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.270
If by strong hand you offer to break in

132
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.130
Now in the stirring passage of the day,

133
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.170
A vulgar comment will be made of it,

134
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.200
And that supposed by the common rout

135
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.770
Against your yet ungalled estimation

136
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.800
That may with foul intrusion enter in

137
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.070
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;

138
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.300
For slander lives upon succession,

139
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.430
For ever housed where it gets possession.

140
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.570
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,

141
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.200
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.

142
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.100
I know a wench of excellent discourse,

143
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.400
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:

144
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.170
To her will we to dinner.

145
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.100
Get you home

146
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.500
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:

147
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.770
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;

148
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.770
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--

149
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.500
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--

150
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.700
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.

151
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.630
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,

152
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.470
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

153
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.400
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

154
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.830
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

155
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.900
And may it be that you have quite forgot

156
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.000
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.

157
00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.470
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?

158
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.830
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?

159
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.670
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,

160
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:14.070
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:

161
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:23.600
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;

162
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.900
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:

163
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.830
Let not my sister read it in your eye;

164
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.700
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;

165
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:43.630
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;

166
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.570
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;

167
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.000
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;

168
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.070
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;

169
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:03.600
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?

170
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:10.470
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?

171
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.030
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed

172
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.470
And let her read it in thy looks at board:

173
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:24.070
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;

174
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.170
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.

175
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:35.200
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,

176
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.970
Being compact of credit, that you love us;

177
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.770
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;

178
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.430
We in your motion turn and you may move us.

179
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.730
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;

180
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.970
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:

181
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.630
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,

182
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.000
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

183
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.400
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,

184
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.430
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--

185
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.370
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not

186
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.170
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.

187
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.170
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;

188
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.070
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,

189
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.600
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,

190
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.800
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.

191
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.630
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you

192
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.870
To make it wander in an unknown field?

193
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.170
Are you a god? would you create me new?

194
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.530
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.

195
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.000
But if that I am I, then well I know

196
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.270
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,

197
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:54.930
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe

198
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.130
Far more, far more to you do I decline.

199
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.200
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,

200
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.670
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:

201
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:10.670
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:

202
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.900
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,

203
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.030
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,

204
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.600
And in that glorious supposition think

205
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.270
He gains by death that hath such means to die:

206
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.600
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

207
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.330
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?

208
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.430
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

209
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.200
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

210
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.030
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

211
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.370
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.

212
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.270
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

213
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.800
Why call you me love? call my sister so.

214
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.970
Thy sister's sister.

215
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.470
That's my sister.

216
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:56.270
No; It is thyself, mine own self's better part,

217
00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.100
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,

218
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.470
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,

219
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.730
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

220
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.570
All this my sister is, or else should be.

221
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.000
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.

222
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.900
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:

223
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.370
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.

224
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.770
Give me thy hand.

225
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.370
O, soft, air! hold you still:

226
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.400
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.

227
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.400
Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?

228
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:46.970
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?

229
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.130
am I myself?

230
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.400
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

231
00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.200
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.

232
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.870
What woman's man? and how besides thyself?

233
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.530
Marry, sir, besides myself,

234
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.770
I am due to a woman;

235
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.630
one that claims me, one that haunts me,

236
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.200
one that will have me.

237
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.000
What claim lays she to thee?

238
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.700
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay

239
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.570
to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that,

240
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.970
I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,

241
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.930
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

242
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.270
What is she?

243
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.830
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man

244
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.000
may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'

245
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.600
I have but lean luck in the match,

246
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.470
and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.

247
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.430
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

248
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.930
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;

249
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.570
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp

250
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.770
of her and run from her by her own light.

251
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.030
I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them

252
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.670
will burn a Poland winter:

253
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.770
if she lives till doomsday,

254
00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:59.500
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.

255
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.730
What complexion is she of?

256
00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.170
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing

257
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.670
half so clean kept: for why, she sweats;

258
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.670
a man may go over shoes in the grime of it.

259
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.700
That's a fault that water will mend.

260
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.370
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.

261
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.370
What's her name?

262
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.330
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters,

263
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.130
that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure her

264
00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.530
from hip to hip.

265
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.300
she is spherical, like a globe;

266
00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.700
I could find out countries in her.

267
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.970
In what part of her body stands Ireland?

268
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.130
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.

269
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.800
Where Scotland?

270
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.100
I found it by the barrenness;

271
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.630
hard in the palm of the hand.

272
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.400
Where France?

273
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.830
In her forehead; armed and reverted,

274
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.500
making war against her heir.

275
00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.670
Where England?

276
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.930
I looked for the chalky cliffs,

277
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.930
but I could find no whiteness in them;

278
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.600
but I guess it stood in her chin,

279
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.700
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

280
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.330
Where Spain?

281
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.530
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.

282
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:14.100
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

283
00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.870
Oh, sir, I did not look so low.

284
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:28.630
To conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me,

285
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.070
call'd me Dromio; swore I was assured to her;

286
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.030
told me what privy marks I had about me,

287
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.270
as, the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck,

288
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.030
the great wart on my left arm,

289
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.470
that I amazed ran from her as a witch:

290
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.170
And, I think, if my breast had not been made

291
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.470
of faith and my heart of steel,

292
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.170
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog

293
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.300
and made me turn i' the wheel.

294
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.230
Go hie thee presently, post to the road:

295
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.830
An if the wind blow any way from shore,

296
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.800
I will not harbour in this town to-night:

297
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.630
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,

298
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.830
Where I will walk till thou return to me.

299
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.200
If every one knows us and we know none,

300
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.270
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

301
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.300
As from a bear a man would run for life,

302
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:13.530
So fly I from her that would be my wife.

303
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.930
There's none but witches do inhabit here;

304
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.330
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.

305
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.770
She that doth call me husband,

306
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.200
even my soul Doth for a wife abhor.

307
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.900
But her fair sister,

308
00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.730
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,

309
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.200
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,

310
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.630
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:

311
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.200
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,

312
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.830
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

313
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.300
Master Antipholus,--

314
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.770
Ay, that's my name.

315
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.870
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.

316
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.370
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:

317
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.500
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

318
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.630
What is your will that I shall do with this?

319
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.870
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.

320
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.630
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

321
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.630
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.

322
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.770
Go home with it and please your wife withal;

323
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.770
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you

324
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.030
And then receive my money for the chain.

325
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.770
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,

326
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:48.900
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

327
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.030
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.

328
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.000
What I should think of this, I cannot tell:

329
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.770
But this I think, there's no man is so vain

330
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.170
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.

331
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.830
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,

332
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.330
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.

333
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.570
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay

334
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.170
If any ship put out, then straight away.

335
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:26.200
(music)

336
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.530
