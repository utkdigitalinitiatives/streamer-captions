WEBVTT

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.164
...say bye-bye...

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.698
Narrator:
Children's experiences

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:07.400
during their first five years

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.870
are more consequential
than we ever thought.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.872
Woman:
We know that the brain

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.509
develops the most
in the first five years of

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.181
By age 6, 95% of a child's brain
is already developed.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.515
By age 6!

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:25.678
So these early years
are very very important.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.321
Narrator:
And of all people,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.255
not just parents,

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.324
pediatricians and teachers,

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.225
but economists
are paying attention.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.331
Man:
Neural synaptic connections

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.333
are occurring in a child's brain

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.770
age zero to three
at a rate of 700 a second.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.405
The worst fallacy in
this business

00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:48.842
is to assume that the abilities,
the motivations,

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:51.845
the skills of people are fixed
at birth - they are not.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:52.779
Dugger:
What happens in that

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.348
36-month period is important

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.218
as far as whether a child
is going to be trusting

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.353
and curious, and active

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:01.955
and able to interact with

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.082
other people in a
productive way.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.126
Heckman:
What I came to understand

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.628
was that ability
was multiple in nature,

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.531
that you could actually start,
even at the earliest years,

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.266
and increase the possibilities

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.102
of individuals for their life.

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.804
So that became
very exciting to me.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:20.039
(children screaming
in excitement)

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.564
It's moving!
You woke it up!

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.611
Man:
Here I am,

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.813
at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Minneapolis,

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:30.216
my expertise is
pre-Civil War banking,

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.886
I worried a lot about
business cycles

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:34.420
and financial crises,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.752
and unemployment
and inflation.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.293
How does somebody
with that background

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:42.495
get involved with
early childhood,

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.622
prenatal to five?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.804
You have to figure out
what's the best investment?

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.107
It's going to be early
childhood education.

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:55.768
Making sure these kids
start healthy

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.707
and ready to learn.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.978
Narrator:
Science has demonstrated

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:02.081
that a child's earliest
experiences are vital

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:06.186
to building the foundation
for life-long individual success

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:08.288
in school and in life.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.121
We can put dollar values
on almost anything...

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.760
Narrator:
Economists are adding new data

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.328
to this argument,

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:17.964
studying two initiatives
in particular:

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:22.435
high-quality early care
and preschool,

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:24.704
calculating how much they cost,

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:28.072
and how much they pay off
to our economy.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.110
And they're worried.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.513
Not because we're spending
too much,

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.182
but because we're spending
too little

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:37.673
where it matters most.

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:40.820
Rolnick:
You can make moral arguments

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.389
for Higher Ed, for K-12,

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.326
for reducing crime,
for reducing pollution.

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.062
But policy makers need more
than moral arguments.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.064
We asked
a very direct question

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.033
that most economists
or business people would ask:

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.933
"What was the return
on the investment?"

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.706
Narrator:
The first study to catch

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.208
the attention of Rolnick and
other economists

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.078
was from a high quality
early childhood experiment

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.414
for low-income children
in Ypsilanti, Michigan,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.882
called Perry Preschool.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.421
Founded in 1962,

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:18.891
Perry Preschool grew out
of the spirit of that time-

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.994
the growth of the
civil rights movement,

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:23.656
desegregation
and equal opportunity.

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.367
The Perry children
had master's level teachers

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:30.336
and low
student-to-teacher ratios.

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:34.374
Educators even visited the
families at home every week.

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.175
Polk:
The children that were receiving

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.613
the Perry intervention
received three hours per day

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:43.750
of a cognitively rich
preschool program.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.452
They focus on things
such as math,

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:49.222
literacy, play-based
approaches,

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.458
focus on engaging
their imagination

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.188
and their own investment
in their learning.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:04:58.898
Narrator:
The Perry kids

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:01.234
were compared to
a group of their peers,

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:05.138
a control group,
who weren't in the program.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:09.742
Both groups have been
followed for 40 years.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.044
Rolnick:
They found that the children

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.147
that were in
the high-quality program

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.418
were less likely to be retained
in the first grade,

00:05:18.418 --> 00:05:22.322
were less likely
to need special ed,

00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:25.158
were more likely to be literate
by the sixth grade,

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:30.496
graduate high school, get a job,
pay taxes, start a family.

00:05:30.496 --> 00:05:33.599
And the crime rate
between the two groups,

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.935
the randomized group
and the control group,

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.063
the crime rate
goes down 50%.

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.607
So those looked like
pretty good outcomes!

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:45.945
They became what we think of as
model citizens in our country,

00:05:45.945 --> 00:05:47.879
despite their modest beginnings.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.317
Narrator:
And those outcomes

00:05:51.317 --> 00:05:53.920
equal hard dollars.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.855
The program was expensive.

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.692
But economists calculated
the benefits:

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.361
the Perry students
were more likely

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.096
to stay on track in school,

00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:07.300
have higher skilled jobs
and contribute more in taxes,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.836
and less likely
to incur the social costs

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:12.638
of welfare and prison.

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.140
Polk:
The youngest children

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.809
of the Perry Preschool studies
are now 52

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.112
and the oldest children of the
Perry Preschool studies

00:06:19.112 --> 00:06:20.680
are now 56.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.315
So we've been following children

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:25.718
from the Perry Preschool
experiment for 50 years.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.621
What did we learn?
Many things.

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.123
It's very successful

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:32.692
in terms of the economic
performance of the children.

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:34.627
For each dollar invested,

00:06:34.627 --> 00:06:38.531
you get back somewhere between
7% and 10% per annum

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:40.400
over the lifetime of the child.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.095
Which is a huge rate of return.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:44.670
Narrator:
That translates,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.142
depending on the study,
to a payoff of $7 to $16

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:53.346
for every dollar spent
on the program.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:54.347
Heckman:
What we found is

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.515
some of those same traits

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.251
that are starting to
be fostered early in life -

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.421
solving problems but also
getting along with others

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.023
and basically planning
in a wise way-

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:07.857
pay off,
and pay off substantially.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.165
Narrator:
Yet, despite the benefits,

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:14.667
today, public investment
in affordable,

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.569
high-quality programs
like Perry

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.507
is so low, only a fraction of
our children can attend them.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.512
But up north,
just across the U.S. border,

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:28.714
one place took note
of the lessons

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.376
offered by the Perry model.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:39.926
Twenty years ago,

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:44.297
Quebec was the poorest
province in Canada.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:46.299
It was stuck in a recession,

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:49.496
and one-quarter of its citizens
lived in poverty.

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.438
The Prime Minister was alarmed

00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:55.374
by skyrocketing
social welfare costs.

00:07:57.109 --> 00:07:59.445
He asked psychologist
Camil Bouchard

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:02.540
to head a task force
to come up with solutions.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.586
Bouchard and his
friend Lyse Brunet,

00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:08.821
a feminist and
political activist,

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:12.621
became allies in a growing
political movement.

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:32.078
Brunet:
In those days in Quebec,

00:08:32.078 --> 00:08:34.347
there was a lot of marches
in the street,

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.449
and it was a context, I think,

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:40.353
where the women's movement
was very strong,

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.822
and it was really the women

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.882
who put forward
the daycare issues.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:49.629
Narrator:
Nine years later,

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:53.199
investments in high quality
early childcare programs

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.535
became central
to Bouchard's strategy

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.871
for reining in Quebec's
rising social costs.

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:01.807
His team was inspired -
ironically enough -

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:05.845
by research coming out
of the United States.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:08.214
Bouchard found
the evidence compelling.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.616
And not just Perry Preschool,

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.285
but also Abecedarian,

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:15.154
an intensive
experiment like Perry,

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:19.625
this one in North Carolina,
which ran for five years.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.861
It provided infant and
toddler care,

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.963
as well as preschool.

00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:25.698
One gain?

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.166
Kids from the program

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:30.836
were four times as likely
to graduate from college.

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:33.072
The kids in the treatment group
were no smarter.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:36.809
But you could measure
their performance in class,

00:09:36.809 --> 00:09:39.178
and later ratings of how
successful they are

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.846
in controlling their anger,

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.481
dealing with
their fellow students,

00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:45.384
negotiating with each other.

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.186
Narrator:
Economists calculated all

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:50.323
the costs and benefits
30 years later.

00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:52.858
The net return to society?

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:57.023
Nearly $100,000 for every child.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:02.535
The Canadians also studied
the Child Parent Center,

00:10:02.535 --> 00:10:04.570
a special half-day pilot program

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:08.908
for low-income preschool
children in Chicago.

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:12.578
The net return to society
in reduced social costs alone

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:18.618
from the Chicago program was
more than $84,000 per child.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.386
Bouchard:
It was pretty clear that

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:24.056
in applying that type
of social programs

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:26.425
we would have success

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:29.462
in diminishing the vulnerability
of our children.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.829
It was inspiring also because
the methodology was beautiful.

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:35.067
Narrator:
Bouchard and his team

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:38.437
looked to the U.S. research
and asked themselves:

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.306
Could investing in
young children

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:43.674
and their families improve
personal outcomes

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.507
and reap economic
benefits in Quebec?

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.715
They were convinced it could,

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:53.419
and released a report
with 53 recommendations.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.321
Bouchard:
But the main thrust of it was

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:59.458
that we were to approach
the problems

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.587
well before they manifest
themselves, well before.

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:06.999
We had decided that
the government should invest

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.763
in the period from 0 to 5.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:11.470
If you had to choose,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.871
this is where you had
to start with.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:15.975
Narrator:
When Bouchard and his team

00:11:15.975 --> 00:11:18.678
released the report in 1992,

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.846
the public reaction
was ecstatic.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:22.648
Bouchard:
The title of the report

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.617
was kind of smashing-

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.712
"We're Crazy About Our Kids,"
Quebec Fou de Ses Enfants.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.590
I was just astonished
at how many reporters,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.592
from all over the place
was at the press conference,

00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:36.429
for a governmental report.

00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:38.531
And there was something special,

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:40.658
there was a buzz
around the title.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:42.868
Narrator:
Advocates for children

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:44.670
were galvanized.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.272
Bouchard:
We met with very, very,

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.174
very involved people

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.342
and interested people
in the community.

00:11:50.342 --> 00:11:53.212
They had read the report,
they were ready to do something.

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:56.148
And there was an enormous
pressure on the government

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.583
to create something significant.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.736
If you just put the report
on the table

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:17.670
and then say to government:

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.906
"You should do that," and go
to fishing or hunting

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:23.209
or to do something else,
it won't happen.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:27.646
You have to have a constituency
around the report.

00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:31.917
It was, like, little projects
for a couple of months

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:36.388
and after that, they wouldn't
have any money to continue.

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:40.493
So it was step-by-step
asking the government

00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:43.462
to put in place a real
strong system.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:47.600
Narrator:
By 1997, advocates

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.068
had broad support,

00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:51.771
and the government
started a childcare system

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.899
intended for any family
in Quebec.

00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:58.567
The tuition: five dollars a day.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:03.883
It would cost almost a
billion dollars

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:05.451
in the first year alone,

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:07.920
and no one knew if it
would actually

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.082
reduce poverty and social costs.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.592
Woman:
Investing in early childhood

00:13:13.592 --> 00:13:15.928
is a no-brainer at this point.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:17.930
But when you start
a network like that,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:22.935
knowing not only the initial
investment to get it going

00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:25.871
and really the structural change
that you're putting in place,

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:31.877
and the annual recurring cost,
there are a lot of risks.

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:34.113
(speaks French)

00:13:34.113 --> 00:13:35.948
Narrator:
Any Robillard directs

00:13:35.948 --> 00:13:39.418
a child development center,
known as a CPE,

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:41.216
in the Montreal neighborhood
of Villeray.

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:48.289
Today, sixteen years later,
parents pay seven dollars a day.

00:14:19.258 --> 00:14:20.960
Narrator:
Most every afternoon

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.530
Alexi Chartrand,
a freelance media producer,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.464
picks up his son Vladimir.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.948
Narrator:
CPE spots are coveted-

00:14:42.948 --> 00:14:45.384
there still aren't enough
to go around.

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:49.388
Vladimir was on a waiting list
for two years.

00:14:49.388 --> 00:14:50.723
Alexi:
It's actually,

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:53.292
it's like a call from God.

00:14:53.292 --> 00:14:57.529
I have tons of friends that
are on the list and waited.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.331
When they called us...
at first we didn't believe it,

00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:00.900
because normally most
of my friends

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.568
called before they
have their child

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.832
so, "Oh, you're pregnant!
All right, let's call."

00:15:08.374 --> 00:15:10.476
Narrator:
Alexi's wife Veronique works

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.311
part-time in the evenings,

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.473
and by day pursues
her education.

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:18.384
The CPE system has
turned out to be

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:22.588
a good investment for Vladimir,
but also for his family.

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.890
Veronique's schooling will
boost her family's

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.382
life-long income
and well-being.

00:15:28.327 --> 00:15:32.331
If Vladimir had not gotten
a spot at a CPE,

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.663
none of this would
have been possible.

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:38.737
Narrator:
Quebec's childcare system

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:41.273
is costly, and most
of the returns

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.833
will pay out when
children grow up.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.880
But one benefit
appeared right away.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.515
Woman:
We used to have a lower

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:53.118
labor force participation
compared to the rest of Canada,

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:55.688
but since the new family policy,

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.890
we have surpassed
the rest of Canada.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:03.462
Now, having mothers with young
children in the labor force

00:16:03.462 --> 00:16:05.464
is very beneficial
for the government,

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.900
because people paying
income tax

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.569
are less dependent on
government subsidies

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:13.772
and hence, for every dollar
that is invested

00:16:13.772 --> 00:16:15.407
in the childcare system

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:19.878
the government gets back
about a dollar and four cents,

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:21.107
so it pays for itself.

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:25.117
Narrator:
Affordable childcare is not

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:27.779
the only investment
Quebec makes in its families.

00:16:30.289 --> 00:16:34.927
Bylaw, all mothers can take
40 weeks of paid maternity leave

00:16:34.927 --> 00:16:37.429
at 75% of their salary,

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:40.092
and most of the leave
can be shared with the father.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.635
But that's not all...

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:46.472
Mothers receive free
universal pre- and

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:48.507
post-natal care and services.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:51.410
Businesses must
provide flex-time

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.979
and nursing breaks for mothers.

00:16:53.979 --> 00:16:56.081
James:
You have common situations

00:16:56.081 --> 00:17:00.085
of parents being able
to take up to year off

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:03.255
and the
participation of fathers,

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:04.957
because you can share
their times into that,

00:17:04.957 --> 00:17:07.426
has changed the dynamic
in so many ways.

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:11.761
That, too, is important
and can't be neglected.

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:15.667
Alexi:
This time is so important.

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:18.303
They're so small, and you're
not going to live that again,

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:22.832
so I think it's important just
to live this with your child.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.012
Narrator:
Only 60% of Quebec's

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:28.313
children have access

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:33.251
to subsidized childcare spaces,
and the demand keeps growing.

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.859
While it's too early to measure
how these kids

00:17:40.859 --> 00:17:42.327
will fare as adults,

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:45.456
the short-term social
benefits are promising.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.535
Japel:
Having more mothers,

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:52.371
participating in the
labor force,

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:54.506
of course the income goes

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:57.176
So that's why Quebec
has the lowest rate

00:17:57.176 --> 00:18:00.304
of children growing up
in poverty.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.382
There's still lots
of people waiting

00:18:03.382 --> 00:18:06.018
so we still have
to develop spaces,

00:18:06.018 --> 00:18:08.783
and we have to work
on quality.

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.924
Narrator:
Family policy in Quebec

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.118
has wide support.

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:18.555
No politician would dare try
to dismantle it.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.837
More and more, the U.S.
has become an outlier

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:27.169
in its child and
family policies.

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:33.112
Every other rich nation
guarantees paid maternal leave,

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:36.411
and many offer paid leave
for fathers as well.

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.352
Most provide
affordable childcare

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:43.515
or free preschool for
all children.

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.893
Like Perry, teachers usually
have a degree in education.

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:51.396
(singing in Chinese)

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:55.234
And now China is applying
the lessons of Perry Preschool,

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:57.636
Abecedarian and Chicago -

00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:01.406
investing billions in
early education.

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:04.109
Dugger:
In years traveling in East Asia

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:05.544
and elsewhere in the world,

00:19:05.544 --> 00:19:09.381
top people managing
large amounts of resources

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.049
asked me again and again,

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:14.052
"Rob, why are Americans
not investing

00:19:14.052 --> 00:19:15.821
in their own children?"

00:19:15.821 --> 00:19:20.092
And I tried my best to explain,
but their answer back to me was,

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.494
"Rob, this makes no sense -
this is nuts!"

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.796
Heckman:
A month ago I was in Beijing,

00:19:24.796 --> 00:19:26.498
and what really encouraged me

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:29.468
was that as part of their
long-run planning policy

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:32.070
to reduce poverty in China,

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.507
they were starting to develop
early childhood programs.

00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:37.176
It sees early childhood

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.445
and sees their whole policy
towards early years

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:44.783
as being fundamental for
its success in the future.

00:19:44.783 --> 00:19:45.918
Narrator:
If research from

00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.619
our own country's experiments

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:50.622
is inspiring governments
around the world,

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:53.751
why haven't we applied
these lessons ourselves?

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.596
It's not for lack of trying.

00:19:59.831 --> 00:20:03.135
Back in 1971,
Congress passed a bill

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.770
offering comprehensive,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.539
high-quality
childcare and other services

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:10.975
for a//American children -
birth to age five.

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:18.578
It was vetoed
by President Nixon.

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:23.689
n the decades since,

00:20:23.689 --> 00:20:27.359
most childcare in America
has remained a patchwork,

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.796
too often tough to find,
hard to afford,

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.196
and mediocre in quality.

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:36.068
Only one in ten
childcare centers

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.628
across the country
is accredited.

00:20:40.806 --> 00:20:43.075
California inspects cemeteries

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:46.442
more often
than child-care facilities.

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:51.817
And the price families pay
can be staggering.

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:55.721
Spots at Head Start and other
subsidized programs are limited,

00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:59.091
while private center-based care
for a four-year-old

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:01.787
can run $12,000 a year
or more.

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:08.767
Families are expected
to do it alone.

00:21:08.767 --> 00:21:10.736
Yet other sectors of our society

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:13.905
receive billions in
state support.

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.374
When we considered a
new location

00:21:15.374 --> 00:21:16.275
for our headquarters,

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:18.410
Virginia presented
a great business case

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.003
for assuring a

00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:23.582
Rolnick:
Economic development,

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:26.218
the way it is conventionally
practiced in this country

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:28.120
is seriously flawed.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.888
I'm talking billions of dollars,

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:31.720
and the return is
virtually zero.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.393
Narrator:
Across the nation,

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:37.462
cities and states
compete for each other's jobs -

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.865
enticing companies
with tax breaks,

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:41.466
land and other subsidies.

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:44.561
Come to Texas!
We're wide open for business!

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.705
When we allow cities and states

00:21:46.705 --> 00:21:49.975
to try to lure each other's
companies with subsidies,

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:53.412
from a national perspective,
not one new job is created.

00:21:53.412 --> 00:21:55.614
...the Texas enterprise fund...

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:58.817
Narrator:
In 2011, this cost taxpayers

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.286
more than $80 billion -

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:04.956
enough to fund more than
5,000 child development centers

00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:08.927
for 10 years.

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:10.962
Instead, most states have
cut their investments

00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:13.557
in child development programs.

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.300
Dugger:
When we say

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.169
that we have a budget crisis,

00:22:17.169 --> 00:22:20.572
it's not a shortage of money
that we're talking about.

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:23.575
There's plenty of money.

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:25.310
This is lobbying power,

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.447
which assures that
our political system

00:22:28.447 --> 00:22:34.019
continues to try to keep
the spending patterns unchanged.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:35.020
Rolnick:
The economics of it

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.788
just doesn't hold up.

00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:39.157
You want to make sure you have
sustainable economic growth,

00:22:39.157 --> 00:22:39.920
invest in your kids.

00:22:42.027 --> 00:22:44.162
Everyone's saying, earlier,
the better.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:45.130
It's more efficient.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.198
If you wait, it's going to cost

00:22:46.198 --> 00:22:48.166
you a lot more money, and you're
going to fail a lot more.

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:52.104
Dugger:
We are not producing

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:53.662
the workforce we need.

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:58.677
We are producing a large,
large number of people

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.145
who are going to be unable

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.381
to compete effectively on
a global basis.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.784
And we create
a two-tiered society,

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.486
so we say to those kids:

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.888
"Sorry, we're not
going to help,"

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:11.323
even though we know
how to help

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:13.492
and we can do it
in an effective way.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:16.328
We know it has a great return
on investment.

00:23:16.328 --> 00:23:18.697
We know it helps children's
life-long learning.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:20.899
Why do we not do it?

00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.163
It's a question
I ask myself daily.

00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:32.978
Narrator:
Despite everything we know,

00:23:32.978 --> 00:23:34.913
most states still
confront fiscal

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:37.649
challenges the old
fashioned way-

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:39.885
offering subsidies to business

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:42.354
while cutting back
on social services

00:23:42.354 --> 00:23:44.379
including child development.

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:49.861
When Utah Republican
State Senator Aaron Osmond

00:23:49.861 --> 00:23:52.697
was appointed to the state's
education committee,

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:56.101
what he found sent him
in a different direction.

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.869
Senator Osmond:
Our special education growth

00:23:57.869 --> 00:24:00.338
is outpacing our normal
student growth.

00:24:00.338 --> 00:24:03.375
We're spending a lot of money
on special education

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:05.571
without the outcomes
that we really want.

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:09.514
Narrator:
Nationwide, special education

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:12.918
is provided for children
with developmental delays.

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:15.079
In Utah,
the costs were spiraling.

00:24:16.621 --> 00:24:19.391
When Senator Osmond
went looking for solutions,

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:21.086
one school district stood out.

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:25.897
Granite District
in Salt Lake City is large

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:28.389
and many of its families live
in extreme poverty.

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:33.405
n 2006,

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:38.243
the district decided to invest
in high quality early education,

00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:41.338
like Perry Preschool had
40 years earlier.

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:44.916
Woman:
Children coming from

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:46.451
at-risk family situations,

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:50.055
often look like children
who have disability,

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:53.957
and yet what they really have
is a lack of opportunity.

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:56.962
Narrator:
Many of these kids

00:24:56.962 --> 00:24:59.464
come from homes
where English is not spoken

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:04.402
and in the past, would have been
steered to special education.

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:05.337
Osmond:
What impressed me most

00:25:05.337 --> 00:25:07.439
about their preschool program,

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:11.176
was how engaged
these young children were

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:12.911
in the educational process...

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.680
This one is "0"...
Can you say "0"?

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.816
Osmond:
...and how organized that

00:25:17.816 --> 00:25:19.351
the entire set-up was.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:21.586
Is this the letter "0"?

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:23.255
Osmond:
These teachers knew exactly

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:24.189
what was going on,

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:25.657
the kids knew
what was going on,

00:25:25.657 --> 00:25:29.094
and they were participating
in the process.

00:25:29.094 --> 00:25:30.262
I always tell our staff

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:32.531
that I know that we're
right on target

00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.499
and the kids are
right there with you,

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:36.968
when they're kind of coming
up out of their seats

00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:39.538
and they're leaning forward
and want to get to the teacher.

00:25:39.538 --> 00:25:40.872
The letter's "A"...

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.040
Van Gorder:
We know we've got them

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.308
engaged in an activity,

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:45.003
when you're engaged,
you're learning.

00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:47.712
Narrator:
The children were given

00:25:47.712 --> 00:25:50.715
standardized tests
at the start of preschool

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:53.480
and their progress has been
carefully calculated.

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:58.657
238 children -
a third of all tested -

00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:01.826
scored so low they would likely
need special education

00:26:01.826 --> 00:26:03.522
when entering elementary school.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.831
But after two years in Granite's

00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.067
high quality early
education program,

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:13.664
only 11 of those 238 students
were assigned to special ed.

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:21.309
Jason, Rey, Diego and Maria were
among the low-scoring students.

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:23.915
They are in 5th grade now,

00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:27.485
and have been testing as well
in math and language arts

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:29.681
as the kids
in high-income schools.

00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:34.392
The first time I did it, I got
11 minutes and 26 seconds.

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:38.730
And the second time,
I got 8 minutes.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.399
At first when he gives us
the homework,

00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:46.338
I look at it, and I think,
do I know this or do I not?

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:50.442
Will I need help
or will I just do it by myself?

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:54.779
And then once I get home,
I've already thought about it.

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:56.615
Teacher:
How many of you are planning

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.283
to get that alumni award?

00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.884
Van Gorder:
Allot these four children

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:03.188
were in a range where
they were potentially eligible

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:05.256
for special education
at that moment...

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:07.359
My mom wanted to move me
to another school,

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.427
but I'm like,
"No, please - please.

00:27:09.427 --> 00:27:11.157
We didn't put them
in special ed.

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:16.935
Woman:
We found that over four years

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:21.873
the state alone
saved $1.4 million,

00:27:21.873 --> 00:27:23.875
and if you include
the federal savings,

00:27:23.875 --> 00:27:26.378
it was an additional
$1.1 million,

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:28.213
for a total combined state

00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.841
and federal savings of
$2.5 million.

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:34.653
Osmond:
We have an opportunity

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:36.254
to mainstream these students

00:27:36.254 --> 00:27:38.390
and save significant dollars
down the road.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.925
And there is the
statistical historical

00:27:40.925 --> 00:27:42.621
evidence that it will work.

00:27:43.728 --> 00:27:45.130
Narrator:
In the face of

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.231
ongoing opposition,

00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:50.235
Senator Osmond continues
to push forward two bills,

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.971
one to start more
pilot preschools,

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:55.269
the other to keep them
all sustainable.

00:27:56.574 --> 00:27:57.742
Osmond:
The concept of

00:27:57.742 --> 00:28:00.011
sustainable financing
is allocating

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:03.314
budget right now as a set-aside

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:06.284
to be able to reinvest again
in the future

00:28:06.284 --> 00:28:09.954
based on future savings that
you hope that you will realize,

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:12.123
thus creating kind
of cyclical nature

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:13.925
that there is always
funding available

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.994
for this particular program.

00:28:15.994 --> 00:28:17.295
reality is, though,

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:19.831
that we still need to prove
to the legislature

00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:21.599
and to many groups in the state

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:23.368
that that investment
is worth it.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:26.638
It seems like we do a lot
of this early intervention,

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:28.840
but it seems to wash out

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.477
by the time students get in the
seventh or eighth grade.

00:28:32.477 --> 00:28:33.378
And let's...

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:36.281
I'd like to find out why
that's the case.

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:37.816
We're not seeing the washouts.

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.284
Not only are they
not washing out,

00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:40.652
they're still at the top
of their class.

00:28:40.652 --> 00:28:43.688
They left preschool and entered
kindergarten at the top,

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:46.124
and they are maintaining
at the top.

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:47.325
Narrator:
And if they're maintaining

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:48.493
at the top,

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:50.562
Granite district's
preschool program

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:54.699
is reversing a seemingly
intractable national trend,

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.568
where the
achievement gap between

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:58.470
high-income and
low-income children

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.338
has widened by 40% since 1970.

00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:05.176
Janis:
A 22-point gap

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:08.179
between low-income
and high-income schools

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:10.582
in the Granite School District
in language arts

00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:14.085
was reduced for the preschoolers
to a five-point gap.

00:29:14.085 --> 00:29:18.156
It's so compelling you cannot
avoid having the conversation:

00:29:18.156 --> 00:29:19.783
"Why not invest early?"

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.032
Narrator:
High quality child-care

00:29:28.032 --> 00:29:30.558
and preschool is just one
of the solution.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:33.772
Polk:
Early childcare education

00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:35.540
is not a panacea.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.576
You have to have clean,
safe neighborhoods, good food,

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:43.207
good communities, you have
a support system around us all.

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:47.085
Narrator:
Economists are clear

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:48.887
about the equation:

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.055
our system is paying
for failure,

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.251
rather than
investing in success.

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:56.094
Not just one study, there
are actually four

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:58.396
independent longitudinal
studies on early ed,

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:02.060
all getting very, very high
annual rates of return.

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.969
Narrator:
The question is,

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:07.472
What will we do about it?

00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:11.609
How much are we willing
to invest for the long term?

00:30:11.609 --> 00:32:46.664
When are we going to get crazy
about our kids?
