00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730


2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.830
(â™ªsinging) Take, O, takethose lips away,

3
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:24.830
That so sweetly wereforsworn;

4
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.270
And those eyes, the breakof day,

5
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.470
Lights that do mislead themorn:

6
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:47.430
But my kisses bring again,

7
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.800
Seals of love, but sealedin vain,

8
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.900
But my kisses bring again,

9
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:16.030
Seals of love, but sealedin vain.

10
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.330
I cry you mercy, sir;

11
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.230
and well could wish

12
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.570
you had not found me hereso musical:

13
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.230
Let me excuse me, andbelieve me so,

14
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.000
My mirth it much displeased,but pleased my woe.

15
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.870
'Tis good; though musicoft hath such a charm

16
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.970
To make bad good, and goodprovoke to harm.

17
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.530
I pray, you, tell me, hathany body inquired

18
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.730
for me here to-day?

19
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.270
much upon this time have Ipromised here to meet.

20
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.200
You have not been inquiredafter:

21
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.630
I have sat here all day.

22
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.070
I do constantly believeyou.

23
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.830
The time is come even now.

24
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.870
I shall crave yourforbearance a little:

25
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.830
may be I will call uponyou anon,

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.370
for some advantage toyourself.

27
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.300
I am always bound to you.

28
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.930
Very well met, and wellcome.

29
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.900
What is the news from thisgood deputy?

30
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.100
He hath a gardencircummured with brick,

31
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.800
Whose western side is witha vineyard back'd;

32
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.430
And to that vineyard is aplanched gate,

33
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.000
That makes his openingwith this bigger key:

34
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.970
This other doth command alittle door

35
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.100
Which from the vineyard tothe garden leads;

36
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.470
There have I made mypromise

37
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.330
Upon the heavy middle ofthe night

38
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.170
To call upon him.

39
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.030
But shall you on yourknowledge find this way?

40
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.770
I have ta'en a due andwary note upon't:

41
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.200
With whispering and mostguilty diligence,

42
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100
In action all of precept,he did show me

43
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.200
The way twice o'er.

44
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.400
Are there no other tokens

45
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.270
Between you 'greedconcerning her observance?

46
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.200
No, none, but only arepair i' the dark;

47
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.470
And that I have possess'dhim my most stay

48
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.770
Can be but brief;

49
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.230
for I have made him know

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.800
I have a servant comeswith me along,

51
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.570
That stays upon me,

52
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.130
whose persuasion is I comeabout my brother.

53
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.270
'Tis well borne up.

54
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.300
I have not yet made knownto Mariana

55
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.570
A word of this.

56
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.870
I pray you, be acquaintedwith this maid;

57
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:04.930
She comes to do you good.

58
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.830
I do desire the like.

59
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.700
Do you persuade yourselfthat I respect you?

60
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.170
Good friar, I know you do,and have found it.

61
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.600
Take, then, this yourcompanion by the hand,

62
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.030
Who hath a story ready foryour ear.

63
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.030
I shall attend yourleisure: but make haste;

64
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.500
The vaporous nightapproaches.

65
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.730
Will't please you walkaside?

66
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.830
O place and greatness!

67
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.400
millions of false eyes

68
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.530
Are stuck upon thee:

69
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.630
volumes of report

70
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.630
Run with these false

71
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.800
and most contrariousquests

72
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.500
Upon thy doings:

73
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.300
thousand escapes of wit

74
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.570
Make thee the father oftheir idle dreams

75
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.570
And rack thee in theirfancies.

76
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.070
Welcome, how agreed?

77
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.730
She'll take the enterpriseupon her, father,

78
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.830
If you advise it.

79
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.700
It is not my consent,

80
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.270
But my entreaty too.

81
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.670
Little have you to say

82
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.000
When you depart from him,but, soft and low,

83
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600
'Remember now my brother.'

84
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.870
Fear me not.

85
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.230
Nor, gentle daughter,

86
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.270
fear you not at all.

87
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.170
He is your husband on apre-contract:

88
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.170
To bring you thustogether, 'tis no sin,

89
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.470
Sith that the justice ofyour title to him

90
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.470
Doth flourish the deceit.

91
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.970
Come, let us go:

92
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.930
Our corn's to reap,

93
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.230
for yet our tithe's tosow.

94
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.970
Come hither, sirrah.

95
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.870
Can you cut off a man'shead?

96
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.230
If the man be a bachelor,sir, I can;

97
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.470
but if he be a marriedman,

98
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.200
he's his wife's head,

99
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.270
and I can never cut off awoman's head.

100
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.570
Come, sir, leave me yoursnatches,

101
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.100
and yield me a directanswer.

102
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.270
To-morrow morning are todie Claudio

103
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.500
and Barnardine.

104
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.570
Here is in our prison acommon executioner,

105
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.330
who in his office lacks ahelper:

106
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.770
if you will take it on youto assist him,

107
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.700
it shall redeem you fromyour gyves;

108
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.400
if not,

109
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.870
you shall have your fulltime of imprisonment

110
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.200
and your deliverance withan unpitied whipping,

111
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.300
for you have been anotorious bawd.

112
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.000
Sir, I have been an unlawfulbawd time out of mind;

113
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.570
but yet I will be contentto be a lawful hangman.

114
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.870
I would be glad to

115
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.900
receive some instructionfrom my fellow partner.

116
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.000
What, ho! Abhorson!

117
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.170
Do you call, sir?

118
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.870
Sirrah, here's a fellowwill help you to-morrow

119
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.930
in your execution.

120
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.670
If you think it meet,

121
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.330
compound with him by theyear,

122
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.270
and let him abide herewith you;

123
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.330
if not, use him for thepresent and dismiss him.

124
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.170
He cannot plead hisestimation with you;

125
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.500
he hath been a bawd.

126
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.170
A bawd, sir? fie upon him!

127
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.070
he will discredit ourmystery.

128
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.530
Go to, sir; you weighequally;

129
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.070
a feather will turn thescale.

130
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.930
Pray, sir, by your goodfavour,

131
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.100
for surely, sir, a goodfavour you have,

132
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.800
but that you have ahanging look,

133
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.400
do you call, sir, youroccupation a mystery?

134
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.530
Ay, sir; a mystery

135
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.370
Painting, sir, I haveheard say,

136
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.070
is a mystery; and yourwhores, sir,

137
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.030
being members of myoccupation,

138
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.030
using painting,

139
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.130
do prove my occupation amystery:

140
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.870
but what mystery thereshould be in hanging,

141
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.430
if I should be hanged, Icannot imagine.

142
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.200
Sir, it is a mystery.

143
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.000
Proof?

144
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.770
Every true man's apparelfits your thief:

145
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.670
if it be too little foryour thief,

146
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.330
your true man thinks itbig enough;

147
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.900
if it be too big for yourthief,

148
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.130
your thief thinks itlittle enough:

149
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.030
so every true man'sapparel fits your thief.

150
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.830
Are you agreed?

151
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.530
Sir, I will serve him;

152
00:06:58.530 --> 00:06:59.570
for I do find your hangman

153
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.300
is a more penitent tradethan your bawd;

154
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.600
he doth oftener askforgiveness.

155
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.600
You, sirrah, provide yourblock and your axe

156
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.470
to-morrow four o'clock.

157
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.900
I will instruct thee in mytrade.

158
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.630
I do desire to learn, sir:and I hope,

159
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.870
if you have occasion touse me

160
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.270
for your own turn,

161
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.770
you shall find me yare;

162
00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:35.670
for truly, sir,

163
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:42.230
for your kindness I oweyou a good turn.

164
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.300
Here's the warrant,Claudio, for thy death:

165
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.430
'Tis now dead midnight,and by eight to-morrow

166
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.970
Thou must be madeimmortal.

167
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.130
Where's Barnardine?

168
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.070
As fast lock'd up in sleepas guiltless labour

169
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.170
When it lies starkly inthe traveller's bones:

170
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.100
He will not wake.

171
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.000
Who can do good on him?

172
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.770
Well, go, prepareyourself.

173
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.370
(â™ªbells ring)

174
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.300
But, hark, what noise?

175
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.700
Heaven give your spiritscomfort!

176
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.070
I hope it is some pardonor reprieve

177
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.630
For the most gentleClaudio.

178
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.930
Welcome father.

179
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.500
The best and wholesomestspirts of the night

180
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.830
Envelope you, goodProvost!

181
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.270
Who came here of late?

182
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.400
None, since the curfewrung.

183
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.270
Not Isabel?

184
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.500
No.

185
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.370
They will, then, ere't belong.

186
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.170
What comfort is forClaudio?

187
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.170
There's some in hope.

188
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.230
It is a bitter deputy.

189
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.700
Not so, not so; his lifeis parallel'd

190
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.600
Even with the stroke

191
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.430
and line of his greatjustice:

192
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.100
He doth with holyabstinence subdue

193
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.500
That in himself which hespurs on his power

194
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.700
To qualify in others:

195
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.370
were he meal'd with thatwhich he corrects,

196
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.530
then were he tyrannous;

197
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.370
But this being so, he'sjust.

198
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200
Have you no countermandfor Claudio yet,

199
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.500
But he must die to-morrow?

200
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.970
None, sir, none.

201
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.500
As near the dawning,provost, as it is,

202
00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.470
You shall hear more eremorning.

203
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.030
Happily you somethingknow;

204
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.770
yet I believe there comesno countermand;

205
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.200
no such example have we:

206
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.170
Besides, upon the verysiege of justice

207
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.200
Lord Angelo hath to thepublic ear

208
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.200
Profess'd the contrary.

209
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.630
How now? What noise?

210
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.270
That spirit's possessedwith haste

211
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.630
that would the insistingposting

212
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.770
with these strokes

213
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.470
This is his lordship'sman.

214
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.270
And here comes Claudio'spardon.

215
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.270
My lord hath sent you thisnote;

216
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.200
and by me this furthercharge,

217
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.370
that you swerve not

218
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.970
from the smallest articleof it,

219
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.700
neither in time, matter,or other circumstance.

220
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.600
Good morrow; for, as Itake it, it is almost day.

221
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.300
I shall obey him.

222
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.670
This is his pardon,purchased by such sin

223
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.570
For which the pardonerhimself is in.

224
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.870
Hence hath offence hisquick celerity,

225
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.400
When it is born in highauthority:

226
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.430
When vice makes mercy,mercy's so extended,

227
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.030
That for the fault's loveis the offender friended.

228
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.670
Now, sir, what news?

229
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.000
I told you. Lord Angelo,

230
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.730
belike thinking me remiss

231
00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:28.700
in mine office,

232
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.030
awakens me with thisunwonted putting-on;

233
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.330
methinks strangely, for hehath not used it before.

234
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.300
Pray you, let's hear.

235
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.670
'Whatsoever you may hearto the contrary,

236
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.530
let Claudio be executed byfour of the clock;

237
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.970
and in the afternoonBarnardine:

238
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.100
for my bettersatisfaction,

239
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.770
let me have Claudio's headsent me by five.

240
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.530
Let this be dulyperformed;

241
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.370
with a thought that moredepends on it

242
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.870
than we must yet deliver.

243
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.400
Thus fail not to do youroffice,

244
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.800
as you will answer it atyour peril.'

245
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.430
What say you to this, sir?

246
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:15.330
What is that Barnardine

247
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.500
who is to be executed inthe afternoon?

248
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.970
A Bohemian born,

249
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.670
but here nursed un andbred;

250
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.300
one that is a prisonernine years old.

251
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.030
How came it that theabsent duke

252
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.530
had not either deliveredhim to his liberty

253
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.570
or executed him?

254
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.870
I have heard it was everhis manner to do so.

255
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.300
His friends still wroughtreprieves for him:

256
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.230
and, indeed, his fact,till now in the government

257
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.770
of Lord Angelo, came notto an undoubtful proof.

258
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.070
It is now apparent?

259
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.500
Most manifest, and notdenied by himself.

260
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.130
Hath he conducted himselfpenitently in prison?

261
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.200
how seems he to betouched?

262
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.270
A man that apprehendsdeath no more dreadfully

263
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.970
but as a drunken sleep;

264
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.830
careless, reckless, andfearless

265
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.300
of what's past, present,or to come;

266
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.370
insensible of mortality,and desperately mortal.

267
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.400
He wants advice.

268
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.170
He will hear none:

269
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.270
he hath evermore had theliberty of the prison;

270
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.870
give him leave to escapehence, he would not:

271
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.370
drunk many times a day,

272
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.470
if not many days entirelydrunk.

273
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.500
We have very oft awakedhim,

274
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.230
as if to carry him toexecution,

275
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.470
and showed him a seemingwarrant for it:

276
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.130
it hath not moved him atall.

277
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.100
More of him anon.

278
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.230
There is written in yourbrow,

279
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.030
provost, honesty andconstancy:

280
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.030
if I read it not truly,

281
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.200
my ancient skill beguilesme;

282
00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.800
but, in the boldness of mycunning,

283
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.770
I will lay myself inhazard.

284
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.070
Claudio, whom here youhave warrant to execute,

285
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.370
is no greater forfeit tothe law

286
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.470
than Angelo who hathsentenced him.

287
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.700
To make you understand thisin a manifested effect,

288
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.200
I crave but four days'respite;

289
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.170
for the which you areto do me a present

290
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.770
and a dangerous courtesy.

291
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:00.970
Pray, sir, in what?

292
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.730
In the delaying death.

293
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.030
A lack, how may I do it,

294
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.130
having the hour limited,

295
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.130
and an express command,under penalty,

296
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:13.600
to deliver his head in theview of Angelo?

297
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.230
I may make my caseas Claudio's,

298
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.030
to cross this in the smallest.

299
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.870
By the vow of mine order Iwarrant you,

300
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.500
if my instructions may beyour guide.

301
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.430
Have this Barnardine bethis morning executed,

302
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:27.770
and his head born toAngelo.

303
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.230
Angelo hath seen themboth,

304
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.670
and will discover thefavour.

305
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.170
O, death's a greatdisguiser;

306
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.670
and you may add to it.

307
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:36.730
Shave the head, and tiethe beard;

308
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.030
and say it was the desireof the penitent

309
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.230
to be so bared before hisdeath:

310
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.800
you know the course iscommon.

311
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.430
If any thing fall to youupon this,

312
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.900
more than thanks and goodfortune,

313
00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.730
by the saint whom Iprofess,

314
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.900
I will plead against itwith my life.

315
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.870
Pardon me, good father; itis against my oath.

316
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.800
Were you sworn to theduke, or to the deputy?

317
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.600
To him, and to hissubstitutes.

318
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.900
You will think you havemade no offence,

319
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.630
if the duke avouch thejustice of your dealing?

320
00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.970
But what likelihood is inthat?

321
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.300
Not a resemblance, but acertainty.

322
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:12.670
Yet since I see youfearful,

323
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.270
that neither my coat,integrity,

324
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.630
nor persuasion can withease attempt you,

325
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.230
I will go further than Imeant,

326
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.270
to pluck all fears out ofyou.

327
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.970
Look you, sir,

328
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.830
here is the hand and sealof the duke:

329
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.470
you know the character, Idoubt not;

330
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.130
and the signet is notstrange to you.

331
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.230
I know them both.

332
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.270
The contents of this isthe return of the duke:

333
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.530
you shall anon over-readit at your pleasure;

334
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.830
where you shall find,

335
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.870
within these two days hewill be here.

336
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.230
This is a thing thatAngelo knows not;

337
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.330
for he this very day

338
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.270
receives letters ofstrange tenor;

339
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.800
perchance of the duke'sdeath;

340
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.500
perchance entering intosome monastery;

341
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.670
but, by chance, nothing ofwhat is writ.

342
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:58.600
Look, the unfolding starcalls up the shepherd.

343
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.530
Put not yourself intoamazement

344
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.070
how these things shouldbe:

345
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.030
all difficulties are buteasy when they are known.

346
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.600
Call your executioner,

347
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.600
and off with Barnardine'shead:

348
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.930
I will give him a presentshrift

349
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.970
and advise him for abetter place.

350
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.470
Yet you are amazed;

351
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.730
but this shall absolutelyresolve you.

352
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.900
It is almostclear dawn.

353
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:27.530
I am as well acquaintedhere

354
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.470
as I was in our house ofprofession:

355
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.030
one would think it wereMistress Overdone's own house,

356
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.730
for here be many of herold customers.

357
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.500
First, here's young MasterRash;

358
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.800
he's in for a commodity ofbrown paper

359
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.030
and old ginger,

360
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.230
ninescore and seventeenpounds;

361
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.530
of which he made fivemarks, ready money:

362
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.330
marry, then ginger was notmuch in request,

363
00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:54.270
for the old ladies wereall dead.

364
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:57.500
Then is there here oneMaster Caper,

365
00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.900

for, look you, thewarrant's come.

403
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.830
You rogue, I have beendrinking all night;

404
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.770
I am not fitted for 't.

405
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.270
O, the better, sir;

406
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.200

409
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.530
Look you;

410
00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.670
here comes your ghostlyfather:

411
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.530
do we jest now, think you?

412
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.200
Sir, induced by mycharity,

413
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.930
and hearing how hastilyyou are to depart,

414
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.970
I come to comfort you, adviseyou, and pray with you.

415
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.230
Friar, not I I have beendrinking hard all night,

416
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.230
and I will have moretime to repair me,

417
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.700
or they'll beat outmy brains with billets:

418
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.500
I will not consent to diethis day, that's certain.

419
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.330
O, sir, you must:

420
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.370
and therefore I beseechyou

421
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.530
Look forward on thejourney you shall go.

422
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.770
I swear I will not dieto-day

423
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.330
for any man's persuasion.

424
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.270
But hear you.

425
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.900
Not a word: if you haveany thing

426
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.130
to say to me, come to myward;

427
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.930
for thence will not Ito-day.

428
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.130
Now, sir, how do you findthe prisoner?

429
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.000
A creature unprepared,unmeet for death;

430
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.400
And to transport him inthe mind he is

431
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.570
Were damnable.

432
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.130
Here in the prison,father,

433
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.600
There died this morning ofa cruel fever

434
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.600
One Ragozine, a mostnotorious pirate,

435
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.670
A man of Claudio's years;

436
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.570
his beard and head just ofhis colour.

437
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.100
What if we do omit thisreprobate

438
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.400
till he were wellinclined;

439
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.530
And satisfy the deputy

440
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.270
with the visage ofRagozine,

441
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.570
more like to Claudio?

442
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.470
O, 'tis an accident thatheaven provides!

443
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.830
Dispatch it presently; thehour draws on

444
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.270
Prefix'd by Angelo:

445
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.370
see this be done,

446
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.530
And sent according tocommand;

447
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.900
whiles I persuade thisrude wretch

448
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.270
willingly to die.

449
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.070
This shall be done, goodfather, presently.

450
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.770
But Barnardine must diethis afternoon:

451
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.030
And how shall we continueClaudio,

452
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.800
To save me from the dangerthat might come

453
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.670
If he were known alive?

454
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.570
See this be done.

455
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.430
Put them in secret holds,

456
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.070
both Barnardine andClaudio:

457
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.270
Ere twice the sun hathmade his journal greeting

458
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.630
To the under generation,

459
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.370
you shall find your safetymanifested.

460
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.630
I am your free dependant.

461
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.030
Quick, dispatch, and seethe head send to Angelo.

462
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.700
Now will I write lettersto Angelo,

463

464
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.030
Shall witness to him I amnear at home,

465
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.070
And that, by greatinjunctions, I am bound

466
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:08.430
To enter publicly: himI'll desire

467
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.930
To meet me at theconsecrated fount

468
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.000
A league below the city;and from thence,

469
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.700
By cold gradation andwell-balanced form,

470
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.400
We shall proceed withAngelo.

471
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.300
Here is the head; I'llcarry it myself.

472
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.770
Convenient is it. Make aswift return;

473
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.170
For I would commune withyou of such things

474
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.100
That want no ear butyours.

475
00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.600
I'll make all speed.

476
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.800
(â™ªbells ring)

477
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.970
(from outside) Ho, peace behere!

478
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.630
The tongue of Isabel.She's come to know

479
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.030
If yet her brother'spardon be come hither:

480
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.270
But I will keep herignorant of her good,

481
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.500
To make her heavenlycomforts of despair,

482
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.930
When it is least expected.

483
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.670
Hath yet the deputy sentmy brother's pardon?

484
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:22.100
He hath released him,Isabel, from the world:

485
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.970
His head is off and sentto Angelo.

486
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.300
Nay, but it is not so.

487
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.270
It is no other: show yourwisdom, daughter,

488
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.670
In your close patience.

489
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.700
O, I will to him and pluckout his eyes!

490
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:36.470
You shall not be admittedto his sight.

491
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:49.500
Unhappy Claudio! wretchedIsabel!

492
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.730
Injurious world! mostdamned Angelo!

493
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.730
This nor hurts him norprofits you a jot;

494
00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.430
Forbear it therefore; giveyour cause to heaven.

495
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.970
Mark what I say, which youshall find

496
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.500
By every syllable afaithful verity:

497
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.600
The duke comes hometo-morrow;

498
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.400

Who do prepare to meet himat the gates,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.930
There to give up theirpower.

504
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.700
If you can, pace yourwisdom

505
00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.470
In that good path that Iwould wish it go,

506
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.100

If I pervert your course.Who's here?

524

Good morning. Friar,where's the provost?

525
00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.930
Not within, sir.

526
00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.970
O pretty Isabella,

527
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.330
I am pale at mine heart

528
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.600
to see thine eyes so red:

529
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.570
thou must be patient.

530
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.600
I am fain to dine and supwith water and bran;

531
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.930
I dare not for my headfill my belly;

532
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.200
one fruitful meal wouldset me to 't.

533
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.200
But they say the duke willbe here to-morrow.

534
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.170
By my troth, Isabel, Iloved thy brother:

535
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.430
if the old fantasticalduke

536
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.970
of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.

537
00:23:54.970 --> 00:24:00.200
Sir, the duke is marvellouslittle beholding

538
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.100
to your reports; but thebest is,

539
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.630
he lives not in them.

540
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.030
Friar, thou knowest notthe duke

541
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.370
so well as I do:

542
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.170
he's a better woodman thanthou takest him for.

543
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.430
Well, you'll answer thisone day. Fare ye well.

544
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.770
Nay, tarry; I'llgo with thee

545
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.330
I can tell thee prettytales of the duke.

546
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.770
You have told me too manyof him already, sir,

547
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:18.630
if they be true;

548
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.630
if not true, none wereenough.

549
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.800
I was once before him

550
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.700
for getting a wench withchild.

551
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.170
Did you such a thing?

552
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.270
Yes, marry, did I

553
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.830
but I was fain to forswearit;

554
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.870
they would else havemarried me

555
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.800
to the rotten medlar.

556
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.870
Sir, your company isfairer than honest.

557
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.130
Rest you well.

558
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.430
By my troth, I'll go withthee

559
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.800
to the lane's end:

560
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.300
if bawdy talk offend you,

561
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.370
we'll have very little ofit.

562
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.330
Nay, friar, I am a kind ofburr; I shall stick.

563
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.200
Every letter he hath writhath disvouched other.

564
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.770
In most uneven anddistracted manner.

565
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.170
His actions show much liketo madness:

566
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.830
pray heaven his wisdom benot tainted!

567
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.330
And why meet him at thegates,

568
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.300
and redeliver ourauthorities there

569
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.900
I guess not.

570
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.800
And why should we proclaimit

571
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.770
in an hour before hisentering,

572
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.670
that if any crave redressof injustice,

573
00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.530
they should exhibit theirpetitions in the street?

574
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.630
He shows his reason forthat:

575
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.430
to have a dispatch ofcomplaints,

576
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.070
and to deliver us fromdevices hereafter,

577
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.100
which shall then have nopower

578
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.500
to stand against us.

579
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.530
Well, I beseech you,

580
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.830
let it be proclaimedbetimes i' the morn;

581
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.900
I'll call you at yourhouse:

582
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.270
give notice to such men ofsort and suit

583
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.900
as are to meet him.

584
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.400
I shall, sir. Fare youwell.

585
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.430
This deed unshapes mequite,

586
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.170
makes me unpregnant

587
00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:51.600
And dull to allproceedings.

588
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.200
A deflower'd maid!

589
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.970
And by an eminent bodythat enforced

590
00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.200
The law against it!

591
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.930
But that her tender shame

592
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.770
Will not proclaim againsther maiden loss,

593
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.400
How might she tongue me!

594
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.630
Yet reason dares her no;

595
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.700
For my authority bears ofa credent bulk,

596
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.070
That no particular scandalonce can touch

597
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.400
But it confounds thebreather.

598
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.070
He should have lived,

599
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:24.430
Save that riotous youth,with dangerous sense,

600
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.430
Might in the times to comehave ta'en revenge,

601
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.630
By so receiving adishonour'd life

602
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:31.130
With ransom of such shame.

603
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.930
Would yet he had lived!

604
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:42.230
A lack, when once ourgrace we have forgot,

605
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:49.330
Nothing goes right: wewould, and we would not.

606
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.630
To speak so indirectly Iam loath:

607
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.170
I would say the truth; butto accuse him so,

608
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.830
That is your part: yet Iam advised to do it;

609
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.770
He says, to veil fullpurpose.

610
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:00.930
Be ruled by him.

611
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.530
Besides, he tells me that,if peradventure

612
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.200
He speak against me on theadverse side,

613
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.230
I should not think itstrange;

614
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.700
for 'tis a physic that'sbitter to sweet end.

615
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.800
I would Friar Thomas--

616
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.970
O, peace! the friar iscome.

617
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:13.600
Come, I have found you outa stand most fit,

618
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.170
Where you may have suchvantage on the duke,

619
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.870
He shall not pass you.

620
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.370
Twice have the trumpetssounded;

621
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.430
The generous and gravestcitizens have hent the gates,

622
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:21.430
and very near upon

623
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:23.900
The duke is entering:therefore, hence, away!

624
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.400
