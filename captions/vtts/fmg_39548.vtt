WEBVTT

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
THE FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN
 IS THE BEST TIME TO SET

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
MIST NETS.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
SCOTT EDWARDS IS A HARVARD
 PROFESSOR WHO STUDIES BIRD

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
EVOLUTION.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
HE'S COME WITH HIS
 STUDENTS TO AUSTRALIA TO

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
CATCH BIRDS IN THE FIELD.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
SCOTT EDWARDS: BIRDS
ARE A WONDERFUL TOOL FOR

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
STUDYING EVOLUTION ON
MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
AMAZING.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
BRIGHT IRIDESCENT BLUE
PLUMAGE ON THE HEAD THERE.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
HE TEACHES THE
 WAY HE WAS TAUGHT.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
SCOTT EDWARDS: I TRY
TO BROADEN THE STUDENTS

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
PERSPECTIVES AND FORCETHEM TTHINK A

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
DOES YOUR SPECIES FIT
INTO THE BROADER PICTURE?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
HOW DO THE TOOLS THAT
YOU USE ENABLE OTHER

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
BIOLOGISTS TO ANSWER
QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.000
SPECIES?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
SCOTT EDWARDS: THIS
IS A SPINY-CHEEKED

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
HONEYEATER, A
REPRESENTATIVE OF A HUGE

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
RADIATION OF NECTAR
FEEDING BIRDS IN

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
AUSTRALIA.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
SCOTT AND HIS STUDENTS
 ARE CHARACTERS IN A

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
REMARKABLE STORY, THE
 ONGOING LEGACY OF THE MAN

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
WHO GAVE SCIENCE NEW WAYS
 TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
DIVERSITY OF LIFE ON
 EARTH EVOLVED, BERKELEY

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
PROFESSOR ALLAN WILSON.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
SCOTT EDWARDS: ALLAN
HAD A WAY OF HAVING YOU

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
FOCUS ON THE BIG PICTURE,
HAVING YOU ASK OF THE BIG

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
QUESTIONS.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
EVEN IF YOU'RE STUDYING
A RELATIVELY OBSCURE

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
SPECIES, HE HAD A WAY
OF BRINGING OUT THE

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
IMPORTANCE OF THAT SPECIES
TO THE BROADER PICTURE OF

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
EVOLUTION.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
FROM HIS LAB AT
 BERKELEY, ALLAN CHANGED

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
HOW WE STUDY THE EVOLUTION
 OF ALL CREATURES.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
BUT HIS MOST CONTROVERSIAL
 CONTRIBUTIONS WERE TO THE

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
STORY OF OUR OWN SPECIES.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
SANDRA HOLLIMAN: WE'RE
GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
THE LEGACY OF A RESEARCHER
WHO WAS HERE AT BERKELEY

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
FOR PRETTY MUCH HIS
ENTIRE CAREER, WHO WAS

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
A NATIVE OF NEW ZEALAND
BUT A MEMBER OF THE

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
BERKELEY COMMUNITY BY
CHOICE, AND MADE A

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
TREMENDOUS IMPACT IN THE
FIELD THAT YOU'RE STUDYING

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
HERE, PHYSICAL
ANTHROPOLOGY.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
HERE AT THE BERKELEY
CAMPUS, THIS GENTLEMAN,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
PROFESSOR ALLAN WILSON,
BEGAN HIS DOCTORAL

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
STUDIES.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
AND HE LAID A FOUNDATION
IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY THAT

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
THEN WOULD INFILTRATE
ALL OF THE BIOLOGICAL

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
SCIENCES.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
HIS INNOVATION REALLY
SHOOK THE FOUNDATION OF

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD
ABOUT HUMAN EVOLUTION.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OR MORE TO THE POINT, WHAT
WE THOUGHT WE UNDERSTOOD

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
ABOUT HUMAN EVOLUTION.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
JIM PATTON: WHEN HE
TALKED TO YOU, YOU KNOW,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
HE BORED RIGHT INTO YOUR
BRAIN AND IT ALMOST HURT.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
SVANTE PAABO: SO HE
ASKED THE RIGHT QUESTIONS,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU
COULD ACTUALLY GET A

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
HANDLE ON.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
TOM WHITE: I THINK MOST
SCIENTISTS TODAY VIEW ALL

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
OF THEIR WORK IN ANY OF
THE BIOLOGIES AS RESTING

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
ON A SOLID FOUNDATION OF
EVOLUTION AND MOLECULAR

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
EVOLUTION.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
AND ALLAN, YOU KNOW, IS
ONE OF THE GIANTS OF THE

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
MOLECULAR EVOLUTION FIELD.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
THE ALLAN WILSON STORY
 STARTS IN THE SOUTH

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
PACIFIC, IN NEW ZEALAND.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
HERE FOLLOWING MILLIONS OF
 YEARS OF ISOLATION UNIQUE

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
SPECIES OF BIRDS
 HAD EVOLVED.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
ALLAN WAS BORN IN 1934.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
HE GREW UP ON A DAIRY
 FARM NEAR AUCKLAND.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
HIS FATHER CHARLIE WAS THE
 SON OF AN IRISH MIGRANT.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
HIS MOTHER EUNICE WAS A
 CARPENTER'S DAUGHTER.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
THEY ENCOURAGED
 INDEPENDENT THINKING AND

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
PARTICIPATION IN
 THE FARM CHORES.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
ALLAN'S BROTHER GARY STILL
 RUNS CATTLE ON THE FARM

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
WHERE THEY GREW UP.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
GARY WILSON: THE FARM
WAS VERY MUCH A NATURAL

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
AND COMFORTABLE
ENVIRONMENT FOR US.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
THOUGH YOU HAD JOBS --
FEEDING COWS, FEEDING

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
PIGS, CASTRATING THE
PIGS, DEHORNING THE YOUNG

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
CALVES.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
THAT WAS OUR WORLD.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
AND IT WAS A MIXTURE
OF RECREATION, WE

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
WERE GALLOPING AROUND
THESE PADDOCKS AND OFF

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
INTO THE DRAIN AND DOWN IN
THE CULVERT, GOING UNDER

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
THE RAILWAY LINE AND
OFF INTO THE BUSH.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
CATCHING CRAWLIES AND
TROUT AND TRYING TO

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
CATCH EELS.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I THINK PROBABLY THE
ASSUMPTION, BOTH OF US

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
CERTAINLY WOULD
GROW UP AS FARMERS.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
BUT ALREADY ALLAN'S
 CURIOSITY ABOUT EVOLUTION

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
SET HIM APART FROM
 OTHER RURAL YOUNGSTERS,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
INCLUDING THOSE WHO WENT
 WITH HIM TO THE LOCAL

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
SUNDAY SCHOOL.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
GARY WILSON: THERE WAS
A VICAR AND HIS WIFE.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
SHE WAS IMPRESSED BY
ALLAN'S QUESTIONING,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
PARTICULARLY OVER THE
STORY OF EVOLUTION OR THE

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
CREATION OF THE WORLD.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
AND SHE WAS PARTICULARLY
STRUCK BY THE KIND OF MIND

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
HE HAD THAT WAS SO
PERSISTENT AND SO

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
DETERMINED TO FIND
SATISFACTORY ANSWERS.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
THE VICAR AND HIS WIFE HAD
CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
KING'S COLLEGE, ABOUT
20 MILES NORTH OF US.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
A FAIRLY ELITE AND
PRIVILEGED SCHOOL AND ONE

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
THAT WE NORMALLY WOULDN'T
HAVE HAD ANY ASSOCIATION

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
WITH WHATSOEVER.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
THE VICAR'S WIFE
 PERSUADED ALLAN'S MOTHER

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
TO ENROLL HIM AT
 KING'S COLLEGE.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
THERE HE DISCOVERED HE
 COULD HOLD HIS OWN WITH

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
BOYS FROM AFFLUENT CITY
 FAMILIES IN THE CLASSROOM

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
AND ON THE SPORTS FIELD.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
IN THE LATE 1940'S SCIENCE
 HAD NO ANSWERS TO THE

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
EVOLUTIONARY QUESTIONS
 THAT PUZZLED YOUNG ALLAN.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
AND THE QUESTIONS WEREN'T
 EVEN RAISED BY THE MASTERS

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
WHO TAUGHT CHEMISTRY
 AND BIOLOGY.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
THE SUBJECT OF
EVOLUTION WASN'T BROACHED

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
BY BIOLOGY TEACHERS
AT THAT TIME.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I LEARNED ABOUT IT BY
MISSING THE TRAIN BACK

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
HOME ONE EVENING AND
FINDING THE LIBRARY WAS A

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
PLACE THAT WAS WARM AND
I COULD STAY WAITING FOR

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
SEVERAL HOURS.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
THERE WAS AN OLD BOOK
THERE ON EVOLUTION, WHICH

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
WAS A MIND OPENER FOR ME.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
HERE WE COULD BE LEARNING
ABOUT BIOLOGY WITHOUT

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
LEARNING ABOUT THE PROCESS
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
DIVERSITY AND DIVERSE
TYPES OF CREATURES

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
ONE SEES.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
STUDYING EVOLUTION WAS
 NOT SEEN BY ALLAN AS A

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
CAREER OPTION
 IN THE 1950'S.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
HE SAW HIS FUTURE
 COMBINING FARMING WITH

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
ALLAN WILSON: I COME
FROM A FAMILY THAT HAD

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
NEVER HAD ANY MEMBERS
WHO'D EVER GONE TO

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
UNIVERSITY.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
HE ENROLLED AT OTAGO
 IN SOUTHERN NEW ZEALAND.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
IT WAS THEARTHEST
 UNIVERSITY FROM HIS HOME

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
AND THE ONLY ONE THAT
 OFFERED AN ECATION IN

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
BIOCHEMISTRY.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
ALLAN WILSON: ONE OF
THE THINGS THAT I SUPPOSE

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
MOLDED MY CAREER WAS
HAVING AN INTEREST BOTH IN

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
ZOOLOGY AND IN
BIOCHEMISTRY.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
IT WAS UNUSUAL FOR
STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
MAJOR IN BOTH OF THOSE
SUBJECTS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
AROUND THE OTAGO
 PENINSULA ALLAN CONTINUED

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
TO PURSUE HIS
 INTEREST IN BIRDS.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
ALLAN WILSON: NATURAL
HISTORY AND BIOCHEMISTRY

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
WERE SEPARATE SUBJECTS AND
THE PROFESSORS WERE SO FAR

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
APART IN THEIR POINTS OF
VIEW THAT THEY COULDN'T

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
DISCUSS THE COMMON
INTERESTS IN EVOLUTION

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
TOGETHER.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
THE BIOCHEMISTS KNEW TOO
LITTLE ABOUT THE BIOLOGY

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
OF ORGANISMS AND THE
ZOOLOGISTS HAD TOO LITTLE

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
TRAINING IN CHEMISTRY
TO EVEN GET TOGETHER.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
AND SO IT SEEMED LOGICAL
THAT A STUDENT LIKE ME

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
SHOULD CONTINUE TRYING
TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BY

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
RECEIVING TRAINING
IN BOTH FIELDS.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
AND I INSISTED ON
STRADDLING THAT DUAL PATH

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
AS I WENT TO
HIGHER EDUCATION.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
TO FOLLOW THAT DUAL
 PATH ALLAN KNEW HE HAD TO

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
LEAVE NEW ZEALAND.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
A ZOOLOGY PROFESSOR,
 DONALD FARNER, WHO WAS

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
VISITING OTAGO INVITED
 HIM TO AMERICA.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
AT THE PULLMAN CAMPUS
 OF WASHINGTON STATE

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
UNIVERSITY HE STUDIED
 UNDER FARNER FOR HIS

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
MASTERS.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
SOON AFTER HE ARRIVED
 ALLAN WAS BEFRIENDED BY A

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
YOUNG FACULTY MEMBER,
 LEONARD KIRSCHNER.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
LEN KIRSHNER: I CAN'T
CONCEIVE OF TWO MORE

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
DISPARATE PERSONALITIES
THAN THIS FAIRLY RIGID

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
SENIOR PROFESSOR AND THAT
PRETTY LAID BACK YOUNG

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
NEW ZEALANDER.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE
PERSONALITIES WOULD CLASH.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
ONCE THEY WERE DISCUSSING
SOMETHING ABOUT THE

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
EVOLUTION OF BIRDS, ALLAN
MADE A STATEMENT LIKE

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
"I'M GOING SOMEDAY TO
SOLVE EVOLUTION."

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I HEARD ABOUT THIS FROM
FARNER, BECAUSE HE CAME

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
INTO MY OFFICE JUST
FURIOUS THAT ANYBODY COULD

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT, LET
ALONE A 20-YEAR-OLD WET

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
BEHIND THE EARS STUDENT.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
THE YOUNG WILSON
 MEANT BUSINESS.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
ALLAN KNEW THAT AMERICA
 OFFERED HIM THE BEST

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
CHANCE TO ACHIEVE
 HIS AMBITION.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
HE CAREFULLY CHOSE
 BERKELEY FOR HIS PH.D.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
IN BIOCHEMISTRY.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AND THERE HE MARRIED
 LEONA GREENBAUM.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
LEONA WILSON: I WAS
VERY ATTRACTED TO HIM.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO ME TO
BE AMAZINGLY IMAGINATIVE.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
AND HE WAS VERY
EXCITED BECAUSE HE HAD

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
THIS DREAM THAT HE WANTED
TO WORK ON EVOLUTION, AND

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
THERE WEREN'T VERY MANY
PEOPLE WHO WERE WORKING ON

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THAT AT THE TIME.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I MEAN, NOT THE WAY HE
WANTED TO LOOK AT IT,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
BIOCHEMICALLY.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
ANALYZE THE MOLECULES.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
THE THINGS HE WAS
THINKING OF WERE AMAZING.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
FOR HIS POST DOCTORAL
 STUDY HE WENT TO BRANDEIS

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
UNIVERSITY IN BOSTON.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
HE RETURNED TO BERKELEY
 AS A MEMBER OF THE

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
BIOCHEMISTRY FACULTY.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
BUT HE WAS STILL
 FOLLOWING A DUAL PATH.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HAUNTS
 WAS BERKELEY'S MUSEUM OF

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
DAVID WAKE: WELL WHAT
BROUGHT ALLAN TO THE

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
MUSEUM OF VERTEBRATE
 ZOOLOGY WAS OUR COLLECTION

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
OF BIRDS.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
AND WE HAVE LOTS OF BIRDS.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
AND ALLAN WAS A
STUDENT OF BIRDS.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
HE WAS INTERESTED IN THEIR
EVOLUTION AND HE WAS

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
INTERESTED IN THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
AND HE WANTED TO KNOW IN
SOME QUANTITATIVE WAY HOW

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THEY HAD EVOLVED.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
AND THAT'S WHERE THE
BIOCHEMISTRY CAME IN.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
ALLAN KNEW THAT
 OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
MUTATIONS IN THE GENES
 THAT CODE FOR PROTEINS

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
ACCUMULATE AT REMARKABLY
 STEADY RATES AS SPECIES

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
DIVERGE FROM A
 COMMON ANCESTOR.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
HE REALIZED HE COULD
 READ THE PROTEINS IN THE

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
TISSUES OF THE DIVERGING
 SPECIES AS HISTORICAL

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
DOCUMENTS.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
THE GREATER THE
 DIFFERENCES THAT HAD

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
ACCUMULATED IN THE SPECIES
 AS THEY DIVERGED, THE

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
LONGER THEY HAD
 BEEN SEPARATED.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
 TIME AND GENETIC CHANGE

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
CAST A WHOLE NEW
 LIGHT ON EVOLUTION.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
DAVID WAKE: NOW MANY
BIOLOGISTS REACTED VERY

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
NEGAVELY TO THAT.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
OTHERS SAW IT AS INSPIRED
AND SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
COULD BUILD ON.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
AND SO ALLAN BECAME
SOMETHING OF A

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
LIGHTNING ROD.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
SANDRA HOLLIMAN:
AN ALLAN WILSON'S

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
CONTRIBUTION WAS TO
DEVELOP WHAT HAS COME TO

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
BE REFERRED TO AS
A MOLECULAR CLOCK.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
HIS INNOVATION, FIRST
WORKING WITH MAMMALIAN

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
SPECIES GENERALLY AND THEN
SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
CONTEMPORARY HUMANS,
CHIMPS AND GORILLAS, WAS

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
TO DETERMINE WITH THE
LIVING SPECIES HOW MANY

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
GENETIC DIFFERENCES THERE
WERE FROM ONE TO ANOTHER.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO
EXTRAPOLATE FROM THAT A

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
TIME THAT WE PRESUME
THAT THEY DIVERGED.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
BUT WHEN HE STARTED
TALKING ABOUT THE

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
EVOLUTION OF HUMANS IN
THIS PERSPECTIVE IT

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
REALLY, REALLY BECAME
VERY, VERY NOTEWORTHY AND

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
VERY CONTROVERSIAL.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
HE COLLABORATED WITH
PROFESSOR VINCENT SARICH

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
FROM THE ANTHROPOLOGY
DEPARTMENT ON THIS CAMPUS.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
AND IN 1967 THEY
PUBLISHED THEIR WORK.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
VINCE SARICH: HE WAS A
PROFESSOR IN BIOCHEMISTRY.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I WAS IN MY LATER STAGES
AS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
ANTHROPOLOGY.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
AND WE GOT TOGETHER
WITH T IDEA OF

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
SORTING THINGS OUT WITH
THE MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
WHICH WERE THEN JUST
BECOMING AVAILABLE AND

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
WORKING OUT FROM THE
MOLECULAR DATA SOMETHING

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
ABOUT THE COURSE OF
EVOLUTION OF OURSELVES.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
SCIENTISTS HAD KNOWN
 SINCE DARWIN THAT CHIMPS

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
ARE OUR CLOSEST RELATIVES.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
THE QUESTION WAS, HOW LONG
 AGO DID WE DIVERGE FROM

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
THE COMMON ANCESTOR THAT
 WE ONCE SHARED WITH THEM?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
PALEONTOLOGISTS THOUGHT
 THEY HAD THE ANSWER IN THE

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
FOSSILIZED JAWBONES
 OF A SPEES KNOWN AS

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
RAMAPITHECUS.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
IT WAS 15 MILLION
 YEARS OLD.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
THE SHAPE OF ITS JAWS
 SUGGESTED THAT THIS

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
PRIMATE WAS A HOMINID ON
 THE DIRECT EVOLUTIONARY

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
LINE TO MODERN HUMANS.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
IF RAMAPITHECUS WAS
 ALREADY A HOMINID THE

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
HUMAN LINEAGE MUST HAVE
 DIVERGED FROM OTHER APES

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
BEFORE 15 MILLION
 YEARS AGO.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
VINCE SARICH: ALLAN AND
I DECIDED THAT WHAT WE

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
NEEDED WAS A DIFFERENT WAY
OF TACKLING THE PROBLEM.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
WE COULD TAKE, LET'S SAY
ALBUMIN FROM ME, INJECT IT

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
INTO A RABBIT.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
HARVEST THE ANTIBODIES
FROM THE RABBIT SOME WEEKS

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
DOWN THE LINE.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
AND THEN USE THOSE
ANTIBODIES TO REACT WITH

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
MY ALBUMIN, CHIMP ALBUMIN
AND SO FORTH AND SO ON

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
DOWN THE LINE.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
WE SAID, WELL LET'S LOOK
AT THE SITUATION WITH THE

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
MOLECULES.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
WHAT WILL THE MOLECULES
BE ABLE TO TELL US?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
WELL HOPEFULLY THEY'LL
BE ABLE TO TELL US IN AN

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
OBJECTIVE COUNTABLE
FASHION HOW DIFFERENT

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
FORMS ARE FROM ONE
ANOTHER, HOW LONG DID IT

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
TAKE THEM TO GET THAT
DIFFERENT FROM ONE

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
ANOTHER, AND WHAT SHOULD
THEY CHANGE INTO.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
THIS SET OF SIX TUBES
REPRESENTS HOW WE DID THE

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
WORK THAT WE DID EARLY ON.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
NOW WHAT ALLAN AND I WERE
DOING HERE WAS USING THE

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
PRESENT TO LOOK
AT THE PAST.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
THE PRESENT IS REPRESENTED
HERE BY VARIOUS BLOOD

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
SAMPLES FROM VARIOUS
PRIMATE SPECIES.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
THE RED COLOR
IS HEMOGLOBIN.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
AND THE AMOUNT OF
HEMOGLOBIN PRODUCED IS A

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
FUNCTION OF THE STRENGTH
OF THE ANTIGEN ANTIBODY

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
REACTION.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
MORE COLOR -- LESS
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
SPECIES.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
BUT HERE THE HUMAN AND
CHIMP ARE VIRTUALLY

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
IDENTICAL.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
AND THE OTHERS GO
DOWN THE LINE HERE.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.000
MINE.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
CHIMP'S.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
RHESUS MONKEY'S.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
SPIDER MONKEY'S.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
LEMUR.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
DOG.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
THESE COMPARISONS
 SHOWED THAT THE GENETIC

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
DISTANCE BETWEEN HUMANS
 AND CHIMPS WAS ONLY 1/6TH

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN
 HUMANS AND THE OLD WORLD

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.000
MONKEYS.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
APES AND THESE OLD WORLD
 MONKEYS WERE THOUGHT TO

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
HAVE DIVERGED 30
 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
SO SARICH AND WILSON
 CALCULATED THAT THE DATE

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
WHEN HUMANS AND CHIMPS
 DIVERGED MUST BE 1/6TH OF

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
30 MILLION, OR ONLY
 5 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
IF THEY WERE RIGHT, THE
 PALEONTOLOGISTS' THEORY

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
THAT RAMAPITHECUS WAS ON
 THE DIRECT LINE TO MODERN

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
HUMANS HAD TO BE WRONG.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
VINCE SARICH: AND THE
ISSUE THEN WAS, WELL WHAT

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
IS RAMAPITHECUS?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT
YOU CAN TELL US IT'S NOT A

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
HOMINID BECAUSE YOUR TEST
TUBES TELL YOU SOMETHING?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND THE ANSWER FROM US
WAS YES, ABSOLUTELY.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
AND THAT WAS
THE BIG PROBLEM.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
DAVID WAKE: IT WAS
HOT STUFF RIGHT FROM THE

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
BEGINNING.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
AND FAMOUS PAPERS BY
SARICH AND WILSON, WILSON

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
AND SARICH REALLY STARTED
OFF A WHOLE ROUND OF

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
FURIOUS DEBATE ABOUT
HOW WE SHOULD MEASURE

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG
CLOSE RELATIVES.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
HIS MOVEMENT INTO
PALEOANTHROPOLOGY IN THE

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000
LATE 60S TOTALLY, I MEAN,
REVERSED DECADES AND

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
DECADES AND DECADES
OF THINKING ABOUT THE

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
DIVERSIFICATION
OF PRIMATES.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
VINCE SARICH: WHAT WAS
RADICAL WAS THE IDEA THAT

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
YOU COULD GET DIVERGENCE
TIMES AMONG LINEAGES,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
AMONG ORGANISMS, WITHOUT
REFERENCE TO THE FOSSIL

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
RECORD.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
AND THAT WAS
REVOLUTIONARY.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
JIM PATTON: THE TIME
PERSPECTIVE THAT WE HAD

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
CAME SOLELY FROM
THE FOSSIL RECORD.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
AND AS BOTH VINCE SARICH
AND ALLAN WILSON USED TO

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000
SAY, WE KNOW OUR MOLECULES
HAD ANCESTORS, BUT YOU

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
DON'T KNOW THAT YOUR
FOSSILS HAD DESCENDENTS.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IT WORKED.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
IT MADE SENSE.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
BUT IT WAS A COMPLETE
SHIFT IN THINKING.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
SO ALLAN AND VINCE WERE
OUT IN THE WORLD AS TWO

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
LONELY VOICES IN THE
WILDERNESS ON THIS THEME.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
VIEWED BY THE PUBLIC AS

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
BEING IN CHARGE OF
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EVOLUTION

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
HUMAN EVOLUTION, THEY WERE

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
PEOPLE WHO HAD NO
TRAINING IN BIOCHEMISTRY.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
AND IT SEEMED SO
IMPOSSIBLE THAT WE COULD

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
BE TELLING THEM WHEN THE
COMMON ANCESTORS LIVED

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
WITHOUT EVER DIGGING
FOR A FOSSIL.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
DAVID WAKE: WHAT DO
THESE BIOCHEMISTS THINK

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
THEY CAN DO, COME IN AND
TELL US OUR BUSINESS?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
YOU KNOW, IT'S OUR
BUSINESS TO DO THIS.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
THIS IS WHAT
WE DO ALL DAY.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
AND THEY'RE JUST PLAYING
AT AND THEY'RE NOT TAKING

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
THIS SERIOUSLY.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
THAT WAS THE REACTION
OF THE PALEONTOLOGISTS.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
ALLAN CONTINUED TO
 STAND UP FOR THE DATE HE

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
AND SARICH HAD CALCULATED.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
AND HE WAS ALREADY
 THINKING A STEP AHEAD.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
IF THE MOLECULES OF HUMANS
 AND CHIMPS ARE SO SIMILAR,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
WHY DO WE LOOK
 SO DIFFERENT?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
HE ASKED MARY-CLAIRE
 KING TO FIND OUT.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
MARY-CLAIRE KING: ALLAN
SUGGESTED THAT I COMPARE

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
HUMANS AND CHIMPANZEES
ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
PROTEINS.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
AS I WAS DOING THIS I
BEGAN TO GET FRUSTRATED

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
AGAIN.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND
ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
HUMANS AND CHIMPANZEES
USING THIS APPROACH.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
AND THAT WAS TRUE, NOT FOR
EVERY SINGLE PROTEIN, BUT

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
FOR THE GREAT
MAJORITY OF THEM.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
WE AND CHIMPANZEES WERE
99% THE SAME IN OUR

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
STRUCTURAL GENES.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
YET HERE WE ARE REMARKABLY
DIFFERENT AT THE LEVEL,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
APPROPRIATELY AT THE LEVEL
OF FAMILIES IN OTHER WAYS.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
SO WE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT TOGETHER.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
ALLAN OF COURSE WAS
THE INSPIRATION.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
AND WHAT CAME OUT OF THAT
WAS OUR WORK THAT WAS

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE IN
1975 THAT POSTULATED THAT

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
THE CRITICAL DIFFERENCES
IN HUMAN AND CHIMPANZEE

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
EVOLUTION ARE NOT
DIFFERENCES IN THE PROTEIN

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
SEQUENCES OF GENES BUT ARE
DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
OF EXPRESSION OF THOSE
GENES AND IN THE WAYS IN

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
WHICH THEY ARE REGULATED.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
THE PAPER THAT
 MARY-CLAIRE AND ALLAN

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
WROTE MADE THE
 COVER OF SCIENCE.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
BUT SKEPTICS CONTINUED TO
 QUESTION HOW TWO SPECIES

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
THAT LOOKED SO DIFFERENT
 COULD BE SO SIMILAR IN

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
THEIR GENES.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
MARY-CLAIRE KING: THIS
LAST YEAR THE CHIMPANZEE

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
GENOME WAS SEQUENCED.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
THE HUMAN GENOME WAS
SEQUENCED SEVEN YEARS AGO.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
AND THE CHIMPANZEE AND
THE HUMAN GENOMES WHEN

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
COMPARED BASE PAIR FOR
BASE PAIR ARE 98.8%

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
THE SAME.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
SO, WE WERE RIGHT, ALLAN.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
SANDRA HOLLIMAN: NOT
BEING SATISFIED WITH SORT

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
OF SHAKING UP THAT ASPECT
OF ANTHROPOLOGY, PROFESSOR

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
WILSON AND SOME OF HIS
COLLABORATORS INCLUDING

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
GRADUATE STUDENTS BEGAN
WORKING ON THE EVOLUTION

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
OF MODERN HUMAN
POPULATIONS.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
AND THE WAY IN WHICH THAT
WAS APPROACHED WAS TO USE

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
IF YOU REMEMBER, THE
MITOCHONDRIA ARE THOSE

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
ORGANELLES THAT
HAVE THEIR OWN DNA.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
IT'S INHERITED SEPARATELY
FROM THE DNA THAT'S IN THE

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
NUCLEUS OF THE CELL.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
AND THAT'S ONLY INHERITED
FROM THE MOTHERS.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
HE SAID "I'VE BEEN
READING ABOUT THIS

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
MOLECULE CALLED
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
IT SEEMS THAT IT HAS
SOME UNIQUE PROPERTIES.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
IN OTHER WORDS, I THINK IF
WE CAN DO A COMPARATIVE

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
STUDY OF MITOCHONDRIAL
DNAS, WE'LL BE ABLE TO

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
REALLY SEE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN HUMANS,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
CHIMPANZEES AND GORILLAS."

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
THAT WAS ALWAYS
HIS FOCAL POINT.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
MARY-CLAIRE CAN DO IT
BY LOOKING AT PROTEINS.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
EVERYTHING HE HAD TRIED.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
THE ONLY OTHER PLACE HE
HAD TO GO LEFT WAS TO GO

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
LOOK AT DNA.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
MATTHEW GEORGE
 CAME FROM ALABAMA.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
HE WAS ONE OF DOZENS
 OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
ATTRACTED TO THE WILSON
 LAB IN THE 1980'S, HALF OF

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
THEM WERE WOMEN.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
MATTHEW DID THE STUDY THAT
 SHOWED MITOCHONDRIAL DNA

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
COULD DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN
 CLOSELY RELATED MONKEYS.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
ALLAN THEN ASKED ANOTHER
 STUDENT FROM THE

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
ANTHROPOLOGY DEPARTMENT TO
 SEE IF THIS SAME TECHNIQUE

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
COULD BE APPLIED
 TO MODERN HUMANS.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
THE TECHNOLOGY WAS THE
USE OF MITOCHONDRIAL DNA

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
TO TRACE GENEALOGIES.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
AND YOU COULD GET A PURE
SOURCE OF THIS DNA.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
IT WAS EASY TO STUDY
BECAUSE IT WAS SO SIMPLE

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
IN ITS TRANSMISSION,
MOTHER TO DAUGHTER,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
TO SON.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
AND BECAUSE IT APPEARED
NOT TO RECOMBINE; WHICH

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
WOULD MAKE IT MORE
INTERESTING TO A

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
GENETICIST BUT HARD FOR A
GENEALOGIST TO USE; IT WAS

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
REALLY THE IDEAL TOOL.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
ALLAN HAD THE INSIGHT
RIGHT AWAY THAT THIS WAS

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
GOING TO BE A KEY TO
UNLOCKING HUMAN HISTORY.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
IF YOU'RE GOING TO REALLY
DO A GOOD JOB DESCRIBING

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
HUMANS AS A SPECIES, YOU
HAD TO INCLUDE PEOPLE FROM

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
ALL CONTINENTS.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
YOU HAD TO INCLUDE A TYPE
OF SAMPLING THAT WOULD NOT

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
BE BIASED.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
WE HAD TO WORK
WITH WHOLE TISSUES.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
A BLOOD SAMPLE WASN'T
SUFFICIENT TO GIVE US THE

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
AMOUNT OF PURIFIED
DNA WE NEEDED.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
MATTHEW GEORGE: WELL
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
YOU CAN'T GO OUT AND CHOP
UP SOME LIVER, KIDNEY AND

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
SPLEEN. SO WE SAID "AH,
PLACENTA WOULD BE A

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
GOOD SOURCE FOR
THE MITOCHONDRIA."

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
REBECCA CANN: SO
BEGAN GOING TO LAMAZE

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
CLASSES, ASKING NEW MOMS
TO BE IF THEY WOULD

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
CONSIDER BEING PART OF A
STUDY THAT WANTED TO LOOK

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
AT DIVERSITY OF GENES
SPREAD BY WOMEN AROUND

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
THE WORLD.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
AND WHEN THEY WENT INTO
LABOR I'D GET CALLED.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
AND WE'D WAIT, AND AT THE
END THEY'D HAVE A HAPPY

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
SO WE WOULD RACE BACK
TO THE LAB AND START

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
ISOLATING DNA.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
IN ALLAN'S LAB
 BECKY CANN ANALYZED

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA FROM THE
 PLACENTAS OF NEARLY 150

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
WOMEN SAMPLED FROM
 EVERY CONTINENT.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
THEIR MITOCHONDRIAL
 LINEAGES INTERSECTED WITH

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
A COMMON ANCESTRAL
 MOTHER IN AFRICA.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
THEY ESTIMATED THAT SHE
 HAD LIVED LY 150,000

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
YEARS AGO.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
SANDRA HOLLIMAN: THIS
CONTINUES TO BE A VE,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
VERY POWERL EXPLANATORY
HYPOTHESIS, ONE THAT ALSO

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
STILL ENGENDERS ITE A
BIT OF CONTROVERSY IN SOME

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
QUARTERS.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
YOU KNOW, WE ALL ARE
AFRICAN BASICALLY.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
YOU KNOW, OUR SPECIES
IS AN AFRICAN SPECIES.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
AND ALL OF US WHO ARE
ALIVE TODAY DESCENDED FROM

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
THIS ONE WOMAN.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
MATTHEW GEORGE: IT
WAS AS THING OF PRIDE.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
YOU KNOW, IT WAS.... AS
A BLACK PERSON, YOU JUST

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
TAKE IT SO
PERSONALLY, YOU KNOW.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
AND YOU HATE TO BE LIKE
THAT, BUT YOU ARE.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THE IDEA
THAT ALL OF MANKIND COULD

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
HAVE ORIGINATED
FROM AFRICA.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
THE CONCEPT OF A
MITOCHONDRIAL EVE WAS, OR

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
A MITOCHONDRIAL ADAM FOR
THAT MATTER, WAS VERY

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
FOREIGN.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
AND IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS
AFTER BECKY'S PAPER WAS

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
PUBLISHED FOR EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGISTS TO COME TO

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
GRIPS WITH THE FACT THAT A
SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WAS IN

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
FACT THE ANCESTOR OF
ALL THE DIVERSITY OF

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
MITOCHONDRIAL DNA.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
REBECCA CANN: IN MANY
CASES, PEOPLE WERE SO

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
AGHAST THAT THEY SAID "ONE
GENE, IT'S ONLY ONE GENE

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
AND IT CAN'T BE IMPORTANT.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
BECAUSE YOU JUST TOLD ME
IT'S THERE, AND THOUSANDS

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
OF COPIES...

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
AND IT'S ONLY THE WOMAN.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
IT'S ONLY THE
MATERNAL LINE."

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
SO THESE KINDS OF
ARGUMENTS WERE CONSTANTLY

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
THROWN AT ME.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
AND I FELT LIKE WHAT I
MUST BE SAYING WAS SO

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
OUTRAGEOUS PEOPLE
WEREN'T EVEN LISTENING.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
AND IT WAS A CONTRAST.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
BECAUSE I HAD COLLEAGUES
IN THE LAB THAT WERE DOING

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
THE SAME THING WITH
BIRDS, WITH LIZARDS,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
WITH MONKEYS.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
AND PUBLISHING
SIMILAR PAPERS.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
FISH.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
AND NOBODY BATTED AN EYE.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
AND AT THAT POINT I
REALIZED WE WEREN'T

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
ARGUING ABOUT HUMAN
GENETIC DIVERSITY, WE WERE

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
ARGUING ABOUT WHO
OWNED HUMAN TURF.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
ALLAN WILSON: THE
CLOSER YOU GET TO THE

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
SOCIAL SCIENCES, THE
HARDER IT IS TO OVERTHROW

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
PREVIOUS POINTS OF VIEW.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
IT CAN TAKE A WHOLE
GENERATION SOMETIMES

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
BEFORE OUTMODED WAYS OF
APPROACHING THE SUBJECT

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
GET OVERTHROWN.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
DAVID WAKE: WITHIN THE
DISCIPLINE HE WAS BATTLING

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
AGAINST A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO WERE FRANKLY

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
THAT YOU COULD USE
BIOCHEMISTRY FOR

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
SYSTEMATIC OR EVOLUTIONARY
TAXONOMIC REASONS.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
JIM PATTON: HIS STEP
INTO THE ISSUE ABOUT HUMAN

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
EVOLUTION AND THE OUT OF
AFRICA HYPOTHESIS WAS A

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
TOTAL REVERSAL OF
PREVIOUS IDEAS.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000
AND HE WAS JUST SIMPLY
UNAFRAID TO STEP BOLDLY

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
WHERE IN MANY RESPECTS
PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE DIDN'T

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
BELONG BECAUSE HE WASN'T
TRAINED INHOSE AREAS.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
SANDRA HOLLIMAN: 
BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, IF

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
YOU'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH
DNA, YOU'RE GOING TO DL

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
WITH THE LEGACY OF
PROFESSOR WILSON'S WORK.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
REBECCA CANN:
ECOLOGISTS,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
ORNITHOLOGISTS, REPTILE
SPECIALISTS, ALL THESE

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
PEOPLE SUDDENLY REALIZING
THE WORLD HAD CHANGED OUT

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
FROM UNDER THEM.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
THEY WOULDN'T BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY, IN ADDITIONO

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
HAVING ALL THAT HUGE BODY
OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
ORGANISM, IF THEY DIDN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000
GENE GENEALOGIES.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
AXEL MEYER: ALLAN
ALWAYS HAD TWO KINDS OF

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
HE HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE
OLOGISTS, WHO LIKED THE

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.000
ORGANISM.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
ORNITHOLOGISTS WHO
LIKED THEIR BIRDS.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
OR THEY LIKED THEIR
FISH, THE ICHTHYOLOGIST.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
THE SPECIALIST IN
PARTICULAR GROUPS OF

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
ORGANISMS, MOSTLY ANIMALS.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
AND THEN HE HAD ANOTHER
SET OF PEOPLE WHO

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
WERE "GENE JOCKEYS",
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT KNOW

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A
ROBIN AND A FINCH BUT WHO

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
WOULD KNOW IN INTRICATE
DETAIL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
PARTICULAR MOLECULAR
TECHNIQUES.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
AND IT WAS A BIG CHANGE
FOR ME TO COME FROM THE

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
ZOOLOGY DEPARTMENT IN
BERKELEY TO A BIOCHEMISTRY

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
DEPARTMENT, IN
PARTICULAR ALLAN'S LAB.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
AND I CAME TO THE LAB
AT AN HISTORICALLY

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
UNIQUE TIME.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I CAME AT A TIME WHEN
PCR, THE POLYMERASE CHAIN

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
REACTION, WAS INVENTED.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
AND OUR LAB WAS AMONG
THE FIRST TO USE PCR FOR

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
EVOLUTIONARY QUESTION.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
STARTING WITH A TINY
 FRAGMENT, YOU COULD MAKE

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
 COPIES OF ANY PIECE OF DNA

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
VIRTUALLY AT WILL.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
WITH EACH HEATING AND
 COOLING CYCLE THE NUMBER

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
OF COPIES INCREASES
 EXPONENTIALLY.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
SOME OF ALLAN'S
PREVIOUS STUDENTS, SUCH AS

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
TOM WHITE, WERE AT THE
SEAT OF THE COMPANY WHERE

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
PCR WAS DEVELOPED.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
SO WE GOT ONE OF THE VERY
FIRST MACHINES OUTSIDE

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
THE COMPANY.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
WE HAD ALSO BUILT IN
ALLAN'S LAB OUR HOMEMADE

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
PCR MACHINE.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
IT WAS ACTUALLY DONE WITH
VALVES FROM A WASHING

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
MACHINE, SO IT WOULD TAKE
COLD AND HOT WATER AND MIX

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
IT, SCANNED BY A COMPUTER.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
AND IT WORKED, ALTHOUGH
IT FLOODED THE LAB QUITE

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
OFTEN IN THE NIGHT.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
ALLAN WAS THE FIRST
PERSON TO HEAR ABOUT IN

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
THE POLYMERASE CHAIN
REACTION METHOD BEFORE THE

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
PAPER WAS ACTUALLY
PUBLISHED INTO SCIENCE IN

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
DECEMBER OF 1985.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
THE METHOD MADE CERTAIN
QUESTIONS OR EXPERIMENTS

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000
POSSIBLE THAT HAD
PREVIOUSLY BEEN

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
BUT IT WAS ASKING THE
IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS WHERE

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
ALLEN'S CONCEPTUAL
ABILITY CAME IN.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
HE REALIZED, I THINK,
FASTER THAN ANYONE AND

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
STIMULATED SUCH A BROAD
GROUP OF PEOPLE IN HIS

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
LABORATORIES TO THINK
ABOUT APPLYING THE METHOD

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
TO DO EXPERIMENTS THAT
SIMPLY HAD BEEN IMPOSSIBLE

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
BEFORE.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
SCOTT EDWARDS: THE
POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
WAS A REVOLUTION FOR
NATURAL SCIENCE.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
IT ALLOWED RESEARCHERS TO
PLACE THE EVOLUTION OF

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
THEIR FAVORITE GROUP
ON A YARDSTICK.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
WE COULD COUNT THE NUMBER
OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DNA

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
SEQUENCES BETWEEN TWO
INDIVIDUALS, BETWEEN TWO

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
SPECIES, AND THEREBY
CREATE A CALIBRATION FOR

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
AVIAN EVOLUTION.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
AND IT WAS A
REMARKABLE TIME.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
REALLY THE HOLY GRAIL
OF LOOKING AT GENETIC

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
VARIATION WITHIN SPECIES
WAS LAID IN ALLAN'S LAP.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
TOM WHITE: ALLAN
IMMEDIATELY SAW THE

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
POTENTIAL OF THAT FOR
STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIP

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
OF EXTINCT ANIMALS, WHERE
SPECIMENS MIGHT ONLY STILL

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
EXIST IN A MUSEUM;
LIKE THE GUAGGA OR THE

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
MARSUPIAL WOLF OR OTHER
THINGS FROM THE AREA OF

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
THE WORLD IN WHICH HE'D
GROWN UP; BY USING THE PCR

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
METHOD TO STUDY WHAT'S
NOW CALLED ANCIENT DNA.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
ANCIENT DNA IS THE
 TARGET OF RESEARCHERS

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
EXCAVATING THE
 BONES OF THE MOA.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
UNTIL IT WAS HUNTED TO
 EXTINCTION THE MOA WAS THE

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
WORLD'S LARGEST BIRD.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
ALAN COOPER: AND ONE
OF MY KEY PROJECTS IS TO

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
STUDY THE DEMOGRAPHIC
HISTORY, THE POPULATION

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
HISTORY OF TWO SPECIES
OF MOA IN NEW ZEALAND.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
AND THE REASON THAT
THEY'RE SO IMPORTANT IS

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
BECAUSE NEW ZEALAND ONLY
RECENTLY GOT COLONIZED BY

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
HUMANS, ABOUT 800,
900 YEARS AGO.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
AND SO THEREFORE,
IF WE GET DNA

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF
INDIVIDUALS IN THIS

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
POPULATION AND FOLLOW
THROUGH TIME HOW THE

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
GENETIC DIVERSITY CHANGES,
WE KNOW THAT THOSE

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
RESPONSES ARE JUST DUE
TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY
DOING IS LOOKING HOW

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
CLIMATE CHANGE IS
AFFECTING ANIMALS IN THE

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
ABSENCE OF HUMANS.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
SO IF WE GO BACK IN TIME,
THIRTY, FORTY THOUSAND

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
YEARS, AND GET A LARGE
NUMBER OF MOA SPECIMENS,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
GET THE DNA OUT, CARBON
DATE ALL THE BONES, WE CAN

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
REALLY SEE WHAT CLIMATIC
CHANGE IS DOING TO LARGE

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
POPULATIONS OF ANIMALS.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
AND THAT'S WHERE IT REALLY
APPEALED ABOUT ANCIENT DNA

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
TO ALLAN, WAS ACTUALLY
SEEING THE PROCESSES THAT

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
EVOLUTION IS WORKING BY.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
YOU CAN EXTRAPOLATE FROM
MODERN DATA AND THE FOSSIL

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
RECORD, BUT YOU
ARE EXTRAPOLATING.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
WITH THE ANCIENT DNA
YOU'RE SEEING, YOU'RE

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
ACTUALLY MEASURING.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
YOU KNOW, 40,000 YEARS
AGO IT LOOKED LIKE THIS.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
38,000 YEARS AGO HERE'S
ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL, IT'S

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
CHANGED THIS MUCH.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
WE CAN SEE BOTH
INDIVIDUALS AND HOW IT'S

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
RELATED AND THIS IS SORT
OF SPEED AND THE SITES

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
THAT ARE ACTUALLY
CHANGING.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
YOU'RE REALLY WATCHING
EVOLUTION HAPPENING.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
WHEN ALAN COOPER JOINED
 THE WILSON LAB IN 1989 HE

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
BEGAN WORKING WITH A
 SENIOR GRADUATE STUDENT,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
SVANTE PAABO.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
TODAY SVANTE RUNS HIS OWN
 LAB AT LIEPZIG IN GERMANY.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
IT'S THE WORLD'S FOREMOST
 CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
SVANTE PAABO: WHAT
I WORKED ON REALLY

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
EXCLUSIVELY IN ALLAN'S
LAB, MORE OR LESS

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
EXCLUSIVELY, WAS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNIQUES

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
TO DO ANCIENT DNA.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
SO THAT WAS SOMETHING I
HAD STARTED AS A GRADUATE

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
STUDENT IN SWEDEN.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
AND THEN ALLAN HAD A LONG
INTEREST IN THAT AND HAD

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
WORKED ON THAT.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
SO THAT SORT OF FUSED
THESE TWO DIRECTIONS

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
OF WORK.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
AND THE PCR CAME ALONG AT
THAT TIME, AND THAT REALLY

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
OPENED UP THAT FIELD.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
SO THAT ALLOWED US TO GO
AND DO THE MARSUPIAL WOLF

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
AND THE, GROUND SLOTHS
AND SO ON, EXTINCT
CREATURES.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
THERE ARE FOUR LINES OF
WORK FROM THIS INSTITUTE

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
THAT WOULD
CONNECT TO ALLAN.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
ONE IS A WORK OF HUMAN
POPULATION HISTORY THAT

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
MARK STONEKING DOES.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
THAT SORT OF FOLLOWS THE
HISTORY OF HUMANS FROM

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
AFRICA OUT INTO THE WORLD,
INTO THE PACIFIC AND

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
EVENTUALLY TO NEW ZEALAND
BY GENETIC MARKERS.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
ANOTHER LINE IS A
COMPARISON OF THE GENES IN

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
HUMANS, CHIMPANZEES AND
GORILLAS, THE GREAT APES.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
WHERE LINDA VIGILANT DOES
MUCH OF THE SAME WORK THAT

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
SHE DID ON THE
POPULATION HISTORY OF

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
HUMANS IN ALLAN'S LAB,
NOW IN THE GREAT APES AND

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
COMPARING THEIR HISTORY
TO THE HISTORY OF US,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
OF HUMANS. THEN THERE'S
THE QUEST, NOW WHAT SETS

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
US APART FROM THE
GREAT APES?

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
WHY ARE WE SO DIFFERENT,
ALTHOUGH ALLAN SHOWED THAT

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
WE ARE SO CLOSELY
RELATED IN OUR GENES?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
AND THAT'S WORK THAT ONE
AT THAT TIME COULD NOT

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
REALLY TEST HIS IDEAS.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
AND NOW HOWEVER WE
HAVE THE EXPERIMENTAL

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
POSSIBILITIES TO DO THAT.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
AND THAT'S WORK THAT WE
ARE DOING HERE, COMPARING

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
THE GENE REGULATION
BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
GREAT APES.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
AND FINALLY THE FOURTH
STORY IS ANCIENT DNA.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
SO THE RETRIEVAL OF DNA
FROM FOSSILS THAT YOU FIND

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
OF EXTINCT CREATURES SUCH
AS MAMMALS OR CAVE BEARS

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
AND OF NEANDERTHALS WHERE
WE ARE ABOUT TO LAUNCH A

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
GENOME PROJECT.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
WE WOULD DETERMINE THE
ENTIRE GENOME OF A

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
NEANDERTHAL TO COMPARE
IT TO OUR GENOME AND THE

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
GENOME OF CHIMPANZEES.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
TO BE ABLE TO SAY FOR
EVERY CHANGE, GENETIC

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
CHANGE THAT YOU HAVE
BETWEEN HUMANS AND

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
CHIMPANZEES, DO WE
SHARE THAT WITH THE

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
NEANDERTHALS?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
IS IT AN OLD CHANGE BEFORE
WE DIVERGED FROM THE

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
NEANDERTHAL OR IS IT
A VERY RECENT ONE?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
SO IF THE NEANDERTHAL
LOOKS LIKE THE CHIMP AND

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
THIS IS A CHANGE THAT WILL
HAPPEN WHEN MODERN HUMANS

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
APPEARED IN THE LAST FEW
HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
ALLAN RETURNED TO NEW
 ZEALAND FOR THE LAST TIME

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
IN 1989 TO BE HONORED
 BY OTAGO UNIVERSITY.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
ALLAN WILSON: I WAS A
FARM BOY IN SOUTH AUCKLAND

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
AND I WAS OFF TO DEVOTE MY
LIFE TO BECOMING A BETTER

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
FARMER.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD MY
FATHER AS I LEFT THE FARM.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
THERE HAD BEEN
 MANY OTHER HONORS.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
ALLAN WAS ELECTED TO THE
 AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000
AND SCIENCES AND TO THE
 ROYAL SOCIETY IN LONDON.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
IN 1991 HE DIED
 FROM LEUKEMIA.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
A DISEASE THAT IS NOW
 EASIER TO DIAGNOSE AND TO

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
TREAT BECAUSE OF THE TOOLS
 HIS METHODS MADE POSSIBLE.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
NOT FAR FROM BERKELEY
 ANOTHER OF HIS FORMER

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
STUDENTS EXPLORES THE
 LINKS BETWEEN THE GENES WE

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
CARRY AND THE
 DISEASES WE GET.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
TOM WHITE: I THINK
ALLAN WOULD BE INTERESTED

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
IN ALL OF THE FINDINGS.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
BECAUSE THE GENES WE FOUND
THAT OUR ASSOCIATED WITH

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR
PARKINSON'S, STROKE, HEART

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
ATTACKS, THE AUTOIMMUNE
DISEASES; THEY'RE ALL

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
TELLING US THAT THE
BIOLOGY WE HAVE BEEN

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
LEARNING THROUGHOUT OUR
CAREERS IS SUCH A SMALL

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
PART OF THE BIOLOGY THAT
ACTUALLY MAKES US WHAT

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
WE ARE.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
THAT THERE WILL BE NOW
YEARS AND YEARS OF

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
FOLLOW-UP WORK TO TIE THE
ASSOCIATED GENES TO THE

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
FUNCTIONS THAT SHOW HOW
THEY ACTUALLCAUSE

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
THE DISEASE.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
JIM PATTON: WELL A
HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK
BACK AT THE HISTORY OF OUR

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
SCIENCE AND THEY'RE GOING
TO POINT TO A RELATIVELY

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.000
SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
REALLY MADE DIFFERENCES IN

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
THE PROJECTION
OF THAT SCIENCE.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
AND ALLAN WILSON IS
POSSIBLY; I WON'T SAY THAT

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
HE IS; BUT HE'S POSSIBLY
ONE OF THOSE RELATIVELY

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
FEW INDIVIDUALS
THAT'LL BE POINTED TO.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
REBECCA CANN: FOR ME,
ALLAN'S LEGACY IS A BASE

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000
OF A LOVE OF NATURE, A
FASCINATION WITH UTILIZING

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO
GET AT OLD QUESTIONS.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
AND THAT MODERN
TECHNOLOGY HAS TO BE

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
LABORATORY-BASED, IT HAS
TO BE UNIVERSAL, IT HAS TO

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
BE IN A LANGUAGE WHERE I
CAN SHARE IT WITH

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
ANOTHER PERSON.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
IT CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY
VERIFIED.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
AND IT HAS TO
BE INTERESTING.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING
THAT STIMULATES PEOPLE TO

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
ASK QUESTIONS AND IT HAS
TO GIVE YOU A STORY TO

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
TELL THAT MAKES
CONNECTIONS WITH THEM.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
SVANTE PAABO: HE ALWAYS
TRY TO BE QUANTITIVE AND

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
EXACT IN OTHER THINGS.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
AND THAT TO MY MIND
I THINK THE FIELD OF

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
EVOLUTIONARY
BIOLOGY STILL NEEDS.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
BUT ALLAN...

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE
ARE TODAY IF ALLAN HADN'T

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
BROUGHT IT TO US.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
LIFE IS NOT
A NARROW REALM.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
AND HE PROVIDED
PROBES TO LIFE.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
AND ONES WE DIDN'T
HAVE BEFORE.
