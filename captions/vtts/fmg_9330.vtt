WEBVTT

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.660
Man: WE ARE WIRING
AMERICA'S SCHOOLS.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.000
Boy: IT'S FUN, IT'S EXCITING.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.600
Man: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.130
Girl: SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TURN A COMPUTER ON.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.130
Boy: IT'S SOMETHING THAT
THE WHITE KIDS DO.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.230
Girl: THERE ARE ONLY BOYS
IN THAT CLASS.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.060
Man: 24 BOYS AND NO GIRLS.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.330
Child: THE FUTURE IS HERE,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.330
IT'S JUST NOT
EVENLY DISTRIBUTED.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Woman: YOU CAN'T GET A JOB
IF YOU CAN'T RUN A COMPUTER.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.000
Woman: A COMPUTER'S
LIKE A LUXURY TO US.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.530
Girl: IT'S A WONDERFUL THING,

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.260
BUT NOT EVERYBODY'S
GOING TO GET TO HAVE IT.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.860
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME
IN OUR HISTORY,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.360
IT IS NOW POSSIBLE

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.560
FOR A CHILD IN THE MOST ISOLATED

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.030
INNER CITY NEIGHBORHOOD
OR RURAL COMMUNITY

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.200
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME
WORLD OF KNOWLEDGE,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.600
AT THE SAME INSTANT AS THE CHILD
IN THE MOST AFFLUENT SUBURB.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.100
IF WE REALLY BELIEVE

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
THAT WE ALL BELONG
IN THE INFORMATION AGE,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.400
WE CAN'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND
IN THE DARK.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.300
EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA DESERVES
A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.360
IN THE INFORMATION REVOLUTION.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.030
COMPUTERS ARE THE WAVE
OF THE FUTURE,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.930
WITHOUT A COMPUTER,
YOU'RE NOWHERE.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.130
A COMPUTER IS, LIKE,
HOW YOU CONTROL EVERYTHING.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.360
IF YOU DIDN'T, IF YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO WORK THE COMPUTER,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.830
YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW TO WORK NOTHING.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.230
TECHNOLOGY IS
THE GREAT EQUALIZER.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.730
WHAT A JOKE,
THAT'S A TOTAL JOKE.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.430
NOW, YOU CAN'T BE EQUAL
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.960
TECHNOLOGY, UM, TECHNOLOGY
IS BUILDING UP EVERY DAY,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.200
SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN TO USE.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.960
I DON'T EVEN SEE US
ON THE SERVICE RAMP

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.160
OF THIS INFORMATION HIGHWAY.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.760
AND SO, IF YOU WERE TO ASK ME

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.100
WHETHER WE'RE LIVING
IN A VIRTUAL GHETTO,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.300
I WOULD HAVE TO CONCLUDE
BY SAYING YES.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.860
YEAH, EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW HOW
TO USE A COMPUTER,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.300
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:56.300
YOU ARE GOING TO BE LOST
OR LEFT BEHIND.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.330
Taylor: FOR MANY
OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.300
ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY
IS A GIVEN.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.360
BUT LIMITED ACCESS TO COMPUTERS

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.100
IN OUR INNER CITIES
IS KEEPING SOME CHILDREN

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.460
FROM PARTICIPATING
IN THE INFORMATION AGE.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.200
THESE ARE STORIES

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.400
ABOUT KIDS, COMPUTERS,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.530
AND WHO GETS TO DRIVE
ON THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:30.230
iPIRAGUA, PIRAGUA, PIRAGUA!

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.900
MY NAME IS GERALDO RIVERA.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.400
I LIVE IN EL BARRIO
AND I AM...

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.560
11 YEARS OLD.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.460
THE REASON I DON'T LIKE
MY NEIGHBORHOOD

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.800
IS BECAUSE THERE'S
A LOT OF VIOLENCE.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:53.000
THE REASON I LIKE IT?
BECAUSE I HAVE FRIENDS THERE.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.160
Girl: HEY, WHAT UP?
DAVID, COME HERE.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.230
Geraldo:
I LIVE WITH MY MOTHER,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.900
MY SISTERS, AND ME.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.730
MY PARENTS ARE FROM PUERTO RICO

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.160
AND I SPEAK A LOT OF SPANISH
IN MY HOUSE.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.530
I'M SORRY.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.260
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
MY SON.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.760
COME ON.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:31.430
ONE, TWO BITES.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.660
Geraldo: SOME OF MY FAVORITE
THINGS TO DO IS

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.400
TO GO ON THE COMPUTER,
PLAY VIDEO GAMES,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.360
UM, AND WATCH TV.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.200
WHEN THEY HIT THE WALL,
TRY TO GET THEM ON THE WALL.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.160
Boy: THERE'S A LEVEL
LIKE THIS.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.660
Man: MY FIRST SORT OF REAL VIVID
MEMORIES OF COMPUTERS

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.700
ARE PLAYING, LIKE,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.530
PONG, ON, YOU KNOW,
PLUGGED INTO THE TV SET,

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.700
BUT REALLY BECAME ADDICTED
TO VIDEO GAMES

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.300
AND WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SEE
WHAT WAS ON THE,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.600
SORT OF, OTHER SIDE
OF THE MONITOR,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.330
WHAT WAS GOING ON
BEHIND THE SCREEN.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.760
AND, UM, SNUCK MY WAY OUT
OF WOODSHOP IN JUNIOR HIGH

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.400
AND BEGGED MY WAY
INTO COMPUTER SHOP.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.360
MY PARENTS ALSO SAW THAT I WAS
REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS,

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.460
AND THEY WENT OUT AND THEY GOT
SOMETHING CALLED A VIC-20,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.630
WHICH WAS A $100
PLASTIC KEYBOARD

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.660
THAT YOU PLUG INTO A TV SET.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.860
I ALSO GOT A $12
MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.600
TO A MAGAZINE CALLED COMPUTE,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.460
AND THOSE COMBINATION
OF THINGS

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.800
SORT OF ALLOWED ME
TO LEARN A LITTLE IN CLASS

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.930
AND THEN TEACH MYSELF
A LOT MORE ON MY OWN.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:49.330
Girl: I THINK YOU'VE HAD
A LITTLE TOO MUCH EDUCATION.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.230
MY NAME IS KRYSTAL PEREZ
AND I'M 14 YEARS OLD.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.500
MY PARENTS ARE FROM PUERTO RICO.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.930
MY MOM AND I DO
MAINLY EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.000
SHE COMES WITH ME
TO MY SALSA AND MAMBO CLASSES,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.200
WE GO SHOPPING TOGETHER,
WE SPEND QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.960
♪ BELIEVE ♪

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.930
♪ I BELIEVE ♪♪

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.930
Man: 2, 4, GET OUT,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.430
8, 1, 2

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.760
AND 6, 1-2.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.660
LAST ONE, DO IT AGAIN.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.460
1, 2, 3, 4...

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.430
Krystal: AFTER SCHOOL
ON THURSDAYS AND FRIDAYS,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.600
I GO TO DANCE CLASS.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.230
AND, WELL, I TAKE SALSA
AND MAMBO CLASSES.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.230
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.060
1, GET OUT, 6, 7, 8, 1-2.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.930
6, 2, AGAIN.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.800
1, GET OUT.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.300
6.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.960
RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE PREPARING ME
FOR MY SWEET 16,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.730
WHICH, HOPEFULLY,
I'M GOING TO HAVE NEXT YEAR.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.430
AND I HOPE IT'S
GOING TO BE REAL FUN.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.660
I WANT IT TO BE
LIKE MY SISTER'S --

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:12.860
WE HAD A BLAST.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.800
WHEN I GROW UP, WOW, THERE'S
A LOT OF THINGS I WANT TO BE.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.760
I WANT TO BE
EITHER A VETERINARIAN,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.560
A DOCTOR, A LAWYER,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.160
A PROFESSIONAL DANCER,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.330
OR AN ACCOUNTANT.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.700
Woman: THE WORK ENVIRONMENT
WAS A RUDE AWAKENING FOR ME.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.460
NOBODY PREPARED ME,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.100
NOBODY IN MY FAMILY
WORKED IN CORPORATE AMERICA,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.960
SO I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT
WAS REALLY GOING TO BE LIKE.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.000
I'M ALL PUMPED UP, YOU KNOW,
I GOT THIS DEGREE,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.630
I'M READY TO GO,
AND I GET OUT THERE,

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.200
AND EVERY TIME I GO
TO INTERVIEW SOMEWHERE,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.260
I WOULD NEVER SEE
PEOPLE OF COLOR.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.760
THE FIRST COMPANY I LANDED AT,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.930
MY MANAGER ACTUALLY WAS
AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.460
BUT HE AND I WERE IT,
SO IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.660
I ENDED UP WORKING NEXT TO
A WOMAN, UM, CAUCASIAN WOMAN

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.930
WHO DID NOT HAVE
A COMPUTER SCIENCE DEGREE,

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.960
GOT OUT OF SCHOOL
THE SAME TIME I DID,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.360
AND SHE WAS MAKING ABOUT $10,000
MORE A YEAR THAN I WAS.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.730
AND I'M THINKING,
"WAIT A MINUTE,

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.730
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS PICTURE HERE."

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.800
BUT THAT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE
WITH CORPORATE AMERICA,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.700
AND IT STUCK WITH ME.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.360
Girl: I THIS
THE FIRST PAGE?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.060
YEAH, THERE'S TWO PAGES
COMING AROUND.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.100
THIS IS OUR LAST
SOCIAL ISSUES ARTICLE.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.600
HOW MANY POLICE BRUTALITY
ARTICLES DO WE HAVE?

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.760
Boy: LIKE, SEVEN.
Girl: WE HAVE, LIKE, NINE.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.160
Teacher: NINE?

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.630
OKAY, SO WHY DON'T WE READ
THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.430
OR AT LEAST PART OF IT,
AND GET THE MAIN POINT.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.930
YOU CAN START.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.400
AND THEN, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
TIME TO WORK ON YOUR OWN.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.300
AND I ALREADY HAVE KRYSTAL
ON A COMPUTER

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.760
AND JAVIER ON A COMPUTER,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.860
AND POSSIBLY, WE CAN SEE
IF THERE'S ANY COMPUTERS

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.200
AVAILABLE
IN THE LIBRARY, OKAY?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.300
Krystal: THE COMPUTERS
IN MY SCHOOL

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.460
ARE IN THE LIBRARY
AND IN THE CLASSES.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.030
I HAVE TWO
IN MY MATH SCIENCE CLASS,

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:06.600
ONE IN MY HUMANITIES CLASS,
AND ONE IN MY SPANISH CLASS.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.060
YES, I WISH MY SCHOOL
HAD MORE COMPUTERS.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.200
THAT WAY, IT WOULD BE EASIER
FOR ME AND OTHER KIDS

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:18.060
TO USE THE COMPUTERS WHEN WE
HAVE TO DO OUR REPORTS.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.430
Teacher:
JOSE, LET MARIA IN.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.930
I THINK
AFTER SOME POINT,

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.060
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
DO IT AFTER SOME POINT.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.030
Krystal: NO, I DON'T HAVE
A COMPUTER AT HOME,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.560
BUT I WANT ONE.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:33.800
HOPEFULLY, I'M GOING TO
TRY TO GET ONE.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.130
TO DO MY HOMEWORK
AND MY EXHIBITIONS

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.830
AND MY REPORTS,
I HAVE TO GO TO THE LIBRARY,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.330
AND WHEN I CAN'T HAVE
A COMPUTER TO USE,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.930
MY GRADE GOES DOWN.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.300
I CAN'T REALLY, UH, FINISH
THE PAPER AND HAND IT IN,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:53.500
SO MY GRADE GOES DOWN.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.500
WHEN I CAN'T HAVE TIME
ON THE COMPUTER,

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.960
IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.500
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.800
I DID A GOOD JOB
WRITING THE FIRST DRAFT

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.360
AND A COUPLE OF DRAFTS
OF THE EXHIBITIONS AND REPORTS,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.000
AND I FEEL SO BAD THAT I CAN'T
HAVE IT IN MY PORTFOLIO,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.200
TYPED UP RIGHT THERE AND THEN,
RIGHT WHEN I FINISH IT.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.130
UM, AS FAR AS THE GRADE GOES,
I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR,

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.360
BUT IT'S WHAT TEACHERS DO --
THEY HAVE TO.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.360
IT'S, LIKE, TO SHOW THE KIDS
THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:28.630
GET RIGHT ON IT,
TO DO THINGS, YOU KNOW.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.030
Man: THE ISSUE OF POVERTY
PREVENTS MANY PEOPLE,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.330
YOU KNOW, TO REALLY
HAVE ACCESS TO THE THINGS

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.760
THAT MIDDLE CLASS COMMUNITIES
TAKE FOR GRANTED.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.200
WHEN FAMILIES,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.530
PUERTO RICAN
AND LATINO FAMILIES

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.330
ARE TRYING TO SURVIVE
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.500
IN TERMS OF JUST BASIC
SUSTENANCE FOR A FAMILY,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.630
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT NECESSARILY
IN THE FOREFRONT

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.000
OF A FAMILY'S LIFE.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.030
FINANCIALLY, SOME PEOPLE
CAN'T AFFORD IT,

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:59.930
THEY HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS
LIKE PAYING YOUR RENT

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.860
OR GETTING FOOD
ON YOUR TABLE,

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:09.760
SO IT'S VERY HARD SOMETIMES.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.530
Taylor: DESPITE
SOME RECENT GAINS,

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.800
SCHOOLS IN URBAN COMMUNITIES
STILL HAVE FEWER COMPUTERS

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.500
THAN THEIR SUBURBAN
COUNTERPARTS.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.730
LIMITED COMPUTER ACCESS

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.700
OFTEN TRANSLATES INTO
LIMITED JOB SKILLS

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.930
FOR THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.530
SO IF YOU CAN'T USE
A COMPUTER AT SCHOOL,

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.300
WHERE DO YOU GO?

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.900
Woman: ON THE ONE HAND,
HOME ACCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.160
AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.730
AND PROGRAMS
THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.130
IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE
AND TO GUARANTEE ACCESS,

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.730
PARTICULARLY TO ALL STUDENTS
IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.300
BUT IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT
TO ENSURE COMMUNITY ACCESS,

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.800
BECAUSE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS
IN OUR SOCIETY,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.430
PARTICULARLY STUDENTS,
AND FOR POOR STUDENTS,

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.100
AND POOR MINORITY STUDENTS,
WHO ARE IN THE WORST SHAPE

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.700
WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS
AND USE IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.600
IT'LL BE VERY IMPORTANT TO
STIMULATE LOCAL ACCESS POINTS.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.700
FOR EXAMPLE,
THROUGH COMMUNITY CENTERS,

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.200
THROUGH LIBRARIES
WITH INTERNET ACCESS,

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.400
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.360
ARE THE EFFORTS THAT SCHOOLS
AND LIBRARIES ARE MAKING

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.430
TO DELIVER TECHNOLOGY
TO STUDENTS ENOUGH?

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.200
NO, I THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT --
AT THE CURRENT TIME,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.960
SPECIFICALLY IN LARGE
URBAN ENVIRONMENTS,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.060
YOU HAVE AN AVERAGE OF
A 45-MINUTE INSTRUCTIONAL PERIOD

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.500
THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS
TO A COMPUTER LAB.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.230
AND IN A LIBRARY, WE HAVE
HALF-HOUR TIME SLOTS

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.660
AND PERHAPS YOU CAN GET ONE
EVERY DAY, OR EVERY OTHER DAY.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.530
THAT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.460
TO REALLY BECOME ACCLIMATED
TO THE TECHNOLOGY,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:37.460
UNDERSTAND IT, AND BE ABLE
TO USE IT EFFECTIVELY.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.730
Lopez: UNIVERSAL ACCESS
IS GREAT IN THEORY.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.800
HOWEVER, WHEN RESOURCES
FOR UNIVERSAL ACCESS

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.000
ARE TARGETED TO SCHOOLS
AND PUBLIC LIBRARIES,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.800
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE
ACCESS TO THESE INSTITUTIONS.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.200
WHEN THEY GO TO SIGN UP
FOR USE OF A WORK STATION

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.430
AND THE WAIT LIST IS SO LONG,

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.960
IT REALLY TRANSLATES
TO NO ACCESS.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:03.660
THEREFORE, WE THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.100
IF UNIVERSAL ACCESS IS TRULY
GOING TO BE UNIVERSAL,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.760
IT MUST INCLUDE A ROLE
FOR NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS,

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.600
AS WELL AS LATINO
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.760
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS IS?

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.260
BACK TO OFFICE.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.760
Taylor: THE EAST HARLEM
TUTORIAL PROGRAM

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.030
IS A COMMUNITY TECHNOLOGY
CENTER, OR CTC.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.960
LIKE OTHER CTCs
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.430
IT PROVIDES COMPUTER ACCESS

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.760
AND TRAINING
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULTS,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.800
ALONG WITH JOB
AND LIFE SKILLS TRAINING.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.300
KRYSTAL AND HER MOTHER, IRIS,

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:41.660
BOTH ATTEND THE CENTER.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.860
NOW YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED,
WHERE THIS SORT OF WENT BACK,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.900
SO WHAT YOU WOULD DO IS,
IF YOU WANT IT THAT SIZE,

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.130
JUST GO BACK,
PUT THE CURSOR THERE,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.630
AND DELETE, BACKSPACE,
UNTIL IT LOOKS NORMAL.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.400
BACKSPACE?

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.900
Iris: AH, YES,
I FEEL VERY STRONGLY

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.200
ABOUT HAVING PROGRAMS
LIKE EAST HARLEM TUTORIAL

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.860
IN THE COMMUNITY,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.200
BECAUSE IT'S A WAY
OF MAKING SURE THAT

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.530
PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO COMPUTERS

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:12.260
ARE ABLE TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON THE COMPUTERS,

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.160
BECAUSE COMPUTERS ARE
THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE,

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.700
THEY'RE HERE TO STAY.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.230
AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T
HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS,

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.760
THEY'RE VERY HINDERED BECAUSE
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET AHEAD,

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.560
YOU KNOW, AND LEARN
ABOUT THE COMPUTER WORLD.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.260
OUR CHILDREN
WON'T BE MARKETABLE,

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.900
AND -- IF THEY DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO THE COMPUTERS.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.500
AND YOU WILL FIND THEM
TAKING ON THE JOBS

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.230
THAT NO ONE ELSE WANTS
TO TAKE ON,

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.260
WHICH IS WORKING
IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.800
UM, CLEANING
BEHIND SOMEONE ELSE.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.160
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE
TIME TO WASTE OR TIME TO LOSE.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.360
I THINK THAT IF WE WANT
OUR CHILDREN

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.960
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE JOBS,
WE GOT TO GET THEM READY,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.430
WE GOT TO DO IT NOW, WE HAVE TO
STOP MAKING THE EXCUSES

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.430
WE'VE GOT TO DO
OUR OWN REALITY CHECK,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.060
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE
A COMMITMENT.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.730
THIS IS A REVOLUTION
UNLIKE ANY THAT WE'VE HAD.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.730
WHEN YOU THINK OF, PERHAPS,
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.000
WELL, MINORITY GROUPS WERE,
BY AND LARGE,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
HELD OUT OF THAT
BECAUSE OF RACIAL PREJUDICE.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.460
WE'RE NOT HELD OUT

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.200
OF THE INFORMATION
TECHNOLOGY REVOLUTION.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.460
THE ONLY WAY --
IF WE ARE LEFT BEHIND,

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:13.130
IT WILL BE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.700
MADE THE EFFORT
TO BE PART OF IT,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.860
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT WE CAN PREVENT,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.630
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
WE SHOULD BE A PART OF,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.330
SO, IF IN 10 YEARS, IN 15 YEARS,
WE'RE LOOKING AROUND

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.960
AND AFRICAN AMERICANS OR LATINOS
OR ANYONE ELSE IS SAYING,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.530
"HEY, HOW DID WE GET LEFT OUT?"

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.300
IT WILL BE BECAUSE TODAY
WE DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO ENSURE

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.060
THAT WE AND OUR CHILDREN
AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.160
WERE MASTERS AND CREATORS

THIS FEVER THAT

OFF THE STREETS,

THEY'RE DEVELOPING
THE KIND OF MENTAL SKILLS

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:28.900
THAT HELP THEM TO GO OUT
AND BE LEADERS IN OUR SOCIETY.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.460
IN POORER COMMUNITIES,

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.960
THE KIDS ARE DOING PRIMARILY
DRILL AND PRACTICE --

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.100
COMPUTER ASKING QUESTION,

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.760
CHILD RESPONDING
"YES" OR "NO,"

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.000
"FOUR" OR "FIVE,"
RIGHT ANSWER, WRONG ANSWER.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.760
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:50.330
HERE, THE COMPUTER IS IN CONTROL
80%, 90% OF THE TIME.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.360
HERE, THE PERSON IS
IN CONTROL,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.960
THE COMPUTER IS JUST A TOOL.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.660
IT IS A TOOL TO HELP YOU
TO SOLVE A PROBLEM,

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.900
TO THINK, TO MOVE FORWARD,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.660
TO BE A PRODUCER,
TO BE AN OWNER.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:10.730
HERE, YOU'RE A CONSUMER.

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.330
IN MY CLASS, I HAVE ABOUT...

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:19.400
FOUR COMPUTERS.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.560
NO, THE COMPUTERS
DON'T ALWAYS WORK.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.300
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE HAVING
A PROBLEM WITH THE PRINTER,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.360
WE'RE MISSING A FEW CORDS.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.930
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL WE GET THE CORDS,

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:34.100
AND WE HOOK IT UP.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.460
WHEN THE COMPUTERS DON'T WORK,
IT MAKES ME MAD.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.900
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.630
OR YOU WANT
TO WRITE SOMETHING UP

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:46.900
AND YOU CAN'T,
BECAUSE THEY'RE BUSTED.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.860
THESE NEW COMPUTERS, OF COURSE,
THEY HAVE SOME NICHES,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.500
AND THEY'RE TRYING
TO GET FAMILIARIZED WITH THEM.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.560
I'VE TAKEN A COURSE,
A TRAINING COURSE,

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.700
UM, AT THE DISTRICT OFFICE
FOR THEM,

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.060
AND THEY DO COME IN
AND, ONCE A MONTH OR SO,

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.800
AND JUST TRY TO WORK WITH US

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.030
AND TEACH US HOW TO DO DIFFERENT
THINGS WITH THE COMPUTER.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.730
BUT, YEAH, INITIALLY, YOU KNOW,

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.330
IT'S BEEN TOUGH, YOU KNOW,
GETTING ONTO THE SERVER,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:15.600
AND THE PRINTING OF MATERIAL
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.000
BUT, UM, FOR THE MOST PART,
THEY CAN UTILIZE THEM

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.460
FOR THEIR GAMES
AND THEIR WRITING SAMPLES.

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.560
YOU ASKED ABOUT WHAT ARE
THE FRUSTRATIONS,

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.030
MAYBE, IN TEACHING
THE TECHNOLOGIES,

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.030
AND THAT IS THAT, UM, WE TRY,

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.560
BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE
FOUR COMPUTERS,

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.460
WE MAY HAVE JUST, LET'S SAY,
EIGHT CHILDREN AT THE COMPUTER.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.960
AND THEN, WE, AS A FACILITATOR,
HAVE TO COME TO THE FRONT

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.960
AND TEACH THE REST
OF THE CLASS A LESSON.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.460
SO, I MEAN, IDEALLY,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.900
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A CLASSROOM
FILLED WITH COMPUTERS,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.560
AND WE WOULD FACILITATE,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.200
I WOULD FACILITATE
FROM A COMPUTER

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.230
OR A HEAD SCREEN
AND THEY CAN FOLLOW ALONG,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:00.500
YOU KNOW, AND DO AN ACTIVITY

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.430
TO FOLLOW UP THAT LESSON
ON THE COMPUTER.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.630
ONE OF MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS
IN THE CURRENT DEBATE

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.100
ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND RACE,

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.830
TECHNOLOGY AND POVERTY,
TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATION,

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.530
IS THAT THERE'S
THIS RECURRING IDEA

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.430
THAT COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET
WILL BE A SILVER BULLET

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:20.400
AND THAT IF WE JUST SAY,
WIRE THE SCHOOLS,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.100
THEN ALL THE REST
OF THE PROBLEMS

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.600
WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.430
UM, AND YOU SEE THAT AT,
YOU KNOW,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:28.830
FROM BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT,

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.330
FROM VERY PROMINENT
ELECTED OFFICIALS

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.200
AND FROM COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.160
AND IT'S, I THINK,
A VERY TROUBLING NOTION,

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.330
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
IS THAT PEOPLE

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.330
ARE PUTTING COMPUTER LITERACY
BEFORE LITERACY,

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.360
AND THEY'RE CONFUSING
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.000
TO READ, WRITE,
AND THINK CRITICALLY

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.630
WITH THE ABILITY TO KIND OF
MANIPULATE A MACHINE.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.660
AND COMPUTERS ARE ONLY
AS USEFUL AS YOU ARE,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.600
AS YOUR ABILITY
TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.960
AND TO SORT OF USE THIS TOOL
AS AN EXTENSION OF YOUR MIND.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.830
SO, YOU KNOW, FOR ME,
THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.060
KIDS BEING TAUGHT
TO USE WORD PROCESSORS

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.230
BUT NOT BEING TAUGHT
HOW TO WRITE.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.160
AND THOSE ARE TWO
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT SKILLS,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.600
AND IF YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE,
YOU'LL BE SET FOR LIFE.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.060
AND IF YOU KNOW HOW
TO USE A WORD PROCESSOR,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.500
WELL, YOU KNOW,

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.460
THERE'S A REAL CEILING
ON HOW FAR YOU CAN GO.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.460
TO THE RIGHT.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.500
Taylor: FOR STUDENTS
WHO DON'T HAVE CTCs

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:25.830
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS,

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.530
SCHOOL MAY BE
THE ONLY OPPORTUNITY

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.260
FOR COMPUTER ACCESS.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.100
BUT COMPUTER PROGRAMS
IN INNER CITY SCHOOLS

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.860
ARE TOO OFTEN UNDERFUNDED,

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.500
UNDERSTAFFED,
AND UNDEREQUIPPED.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.060
THE RESULT?

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.460
MANY STUDENTS FINISH SCHOOL
AND FACE THE JOB MARKET

00:22:41.460 --> 00:23:25.260
HAVING HAD LITTLE
OR NO EXPOSURE TO COMPUTERS.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:28.930
MY NAME IS STEVEN RICE,
I'M 15 YEARS OLD,

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:34.500
AND I LIVE IN BUSHWICK,
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK CITY.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.760
COME ON, Y'ALL.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.030
WE'RE GOING THIS WAY,
COME ON.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.360
I LIVE WITH MY MOTHER
AND MY BROTHER

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.300
AND MY MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.800
AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.130
OTH BROEROVED OUT,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.430
SO IT'S JUST US NOW.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:58.230
YOU SHOOK 'EM OFF,
SHOOK 'EM OFF.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.230
I LIVE IN BUSHWICK,
SO IT AIN'T THAT BAD.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:04.130
YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
MESS WITH NOBODY,

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.760
NOBODY AIN'T GONNA
MESS WITH YOU,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.430
SO IT'S OKAY.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.300
WE DON'T MESS WITH NOBODY,
WE JUST HAVE FUN.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.230
MIKE.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.330
MY FAULT, Y'ALL.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.000
OH, WHOA, WATCH IT!

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.700
OH, YEAH! OH, YEAH!

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.330
TURNOVER, MAN!
TURNOVER, MAN!

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.600
SPORTS, PERIOD.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.830
I JUST LIKE SPORTS A LOT.

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.500
I LIKE SPORTS BECAUSE IT'S FUN
AND IT'S COMPETITIVE.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.600
AND I LIKE BASKETBALL THE MOST
BECAUSE IT'S COMPETITIVE

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:48.200
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO PLAY,
BUT YOU LEARN HOW TO PLAY FAST.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.730
I LIKE PLAYING

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.200
BECAUSE YOU GET TROPHIES

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.700
AND YOU GET REWARDED
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.760
AND YOU CAN GO TO COLLEGE
BY PLAYING BASKETBALL.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.260
Man: OKAY, QUICKLY,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.930
WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.400
WE WERE DOING THAT
CROSS-LAP JOINT, OKAY?

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.460
WHERE WE TOOK
TWO PIECES OF WOOD,

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.030
CROSSED THEM
TO MAKE THEM FLUSH.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.630
YOU WANT TO FIT A DRAWER,

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.860
TYPICALLY, YOU WANT
TO FIT A DRAWER INSIDE.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.330
Rice: I GO TO

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.800
GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE VOCATIONAL
TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.200
AND IT'S OKAY.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.000
SCHOOL IS OKAY,
IT'S KIND OF SAFE.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.560
PUT THAT IN YOUR NOTEBOOK.
ANYBODY HAVE THOSE HOMEWORKS?

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.260
"GOING BEYOND REALITY"?

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.530
THE ESSAYS THAT WERE DUE.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.230
OKAY, ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE THEIRS TO HAND IN?

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.160
THEY WERE DUE YESTERDAY.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.200
ANYBODY ELSE?
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.130
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT YOUR WOOD,
YOU'VE GOT YOUR TOOLS,

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.000
GO TO WORK.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.500
Rice: THE SCHOOL IS SAFE

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.360
BECAUSE NOBODY GETS,
LIKE, SERIOUSLY HURT

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.930
OR CUT OR STABBED OR ANYTHING.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.260
SO IT'S SAFE.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.930
AND YOU LEARN,
NOT LIKE OTHER SCHOOLS.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.130
WESTINGHOUSE SEEMS
VERY MOTIVATED

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.260
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
A LOT OF VOCATIONAL STUDIES

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.260
FOR THE CHILDREN
THAT KEEPS THEM OCCUPIED.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.600
AND STEVEN'S BEEN DOING
CARPENTRY AND COMPUTERS

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.800
AND ENGLISH AND MATH
AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.030
SO IT KEEPS THEM
PRETTY WELL COVERED.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.600
THEY GOT
DIFFERENT LEVELS.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.060
IF YOU GO DOWN
FURTHER ON ONE,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.500
THE OTHER ONE,
YOU GO LESS.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.300
EIGHTH GRADE WAS THE LAST TIME
I USED A COMPUTER,

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:32.460
SO I AIN'T USED IT SINCE THEN.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.930
YEAH, I WOULD LIKE

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.460
TO TAKE A COMPUTER CLASS,

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:42.360
BUT I TAKE WHATEVER
THE SCHOOL GIVES ME.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.530
Williams: WELL, I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE A COMPUTER

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.830
FOR STEVEN
AND HIS BROTHER ANTHONY,

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.900
BUT AS REALITY IS,
YOU HAVE TO DO

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.460
WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOUR HOUSEHOLD FIRST,

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.260
THAT MEANS FOOD,
CLOTHING, AND SHELTER.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.200
A COMPUTER'S LIKE
A LUXURY TO US.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.860
ONCE I TAKE CARE OF THE BILLS
AND BUY THE FOOD

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.860
AND PURCHASE THE CLOTHING,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.900
THERE'S NO MONEY LEFT
TO BUY A COMPUTER,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:06.700
SO THE REALITY IS, I DON'T HAVE
THE MONEY TO BUY ONE.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:08.160
I CAN NEVER GET INTO THIS.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.060
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT BUTTONS TO PUSH.

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.700
WELL, I JUST PLAY

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.800
BECAUSE I KNOW
THE BUTTONS.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.730
WHICH BUTTON
DO YOU USE TO SHOOT?

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.060
"C" BUTTON.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.000
SO THEY HAVE SET PLAYS
ALREADY IN HERE?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.030
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN PUT
PLAYS YOU WANT.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.900
IT'S LIKE USING YOUR
COMPUTER, RIGHT, AT SCHOOL?

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.400
YEAH, BUT I DON'T USE
NO COMPUTER AT SCHOOL.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.400
BECAUSE THEY STOPPED
YOUR COMPUTER LAB?

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.860
THEY NEVER
PUT ME IN IT.

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:38.400
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT
WAS ONE OF THE THINGS

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.330
YOU PICKED TO GO
TO WESTINGHOUSE FOR.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:45.160
I DID -- THEY'LL PROBABLY
GIVE IT TO ME NEXT YEAR.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.030
OH, OKAY, NEXT YEAR IS
YOUR PROGRAM YEAR,

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.730
ONCE YOU PICK WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE STUDYING THERE?

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.130
THEY GIVE YOU DIFFERENT
SHOPS EVERY YEAR.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.900
SO WHAT ABOUT
YOUR CURRICULUM?

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.030
I TAKE WHATEVER
THEY GIVE ME.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.560
BOY, YOU CAN'T
GO THROUGH LIFE

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:02.100
TAKING WHATEVER
PEOPLE GIVE YOU,

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.100
YOU HAVE TO DO
WHAT YOU WANT.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.560
YOU WANT TO TAKE COMPUTERS,
YOU SHOULD ASK THEM.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:11.430
I KNOW I SHOULD,
BUT I DIDN'T.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:13.260
Williams: WHY YOU AIN'T
TELL ME THIS BEFORE?

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.700
WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
ALL THIS,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.700
AND I'M THINKING YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR COMPUTER IN SCHOOL,

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.660
AND YOU SAY, WELL, YOU TAKE
WHAT THEY GIVE YOU.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:20.700
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
I HAD WOODSHOP.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.200
I KNOW YOU HAD WOODSHOP --

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.400
I THOUGHT
YOU HAD COMPUTER, TOO.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.500
I DON'T HAVE COMPUTER.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:34.560
I'M THINKING OF ONE THING
AND IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.560
THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME --
IF I HADN'T ASKED YOU,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.760
I WOULD'VE BEEN HERE ASSUMING
YOU WERE GETTING COMPUTER,

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.730
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN GETTING IT.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.260
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU WENT THERE FOR.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.560
I AIN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.360
WHAT YOU MEAN,
I WANTED TO KNOW?

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.260
HUH?

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.630
I AIN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.230
WHAT YOU MEAN?

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.930
DON'T I ASK YOU
ALL ABOUT YOUR SCHOOL?

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.960
YOU TELL ME,
"IT'S OKAY, IT'S FINE."

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.460
YOU AIN'T ASK ME ABOUT
NO COMPUTER, THOUGH.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.660
BECAUSE I'M ASSUMING
YOU GOT IT

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:07.130
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
YOU WENT THERE FOR.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:08.530
I KNOW ABOUT SHOP CLASS,

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:14.830
BUT I FIGURED YOU
WAS GETTING COMPUTER, TOO.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.730
Dziko: I THINK CHILDREN OF COLOR
IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.660
DO NOT GET A GOOD
GENERAL EDUCATION.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.260
I THINK THERE ARE
SOME SURVIVAL INSTINCTS

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.700
THAT WOULD GO WELL
IN CORPORATE AMERICA,

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.930
BUT FIRST, YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE SKILLS TO GET THERE,

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.900
AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE
THE DISCONNECT IS.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.660
THE SCHOOLS AREN'T
PREPARING THE KIDS,

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.700
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY,

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.300
THE WORLD IS CHANGING,
THE ECONOMICS IS CHANGING,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.160
THE TYPE OF JOBS THAT ARE
AVAILABLE ARE CHANGING,

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.630
AND WE'RE STILL BACK
WHERE, YOU KNOW,

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.560
MANUAL LABOR WAS AN OPTION,
AND IT'S NOT ANYMORE,

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.800
WHERE A VOCATIONAL SCHOOL
WAS AN OPTION.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.030
IT'S NOT ANYMORE.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.530
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.700
OUR STUDY ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE
MAKES CLEAR

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.400
IS THAT EDUCATION
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.200
ONE OF THE KEY RESULTS
IS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.260
WE HAVE EQUAL ACCESS
TO EDUCATION

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.430
AND THAT WE HAVE
HIGH LEVELS OF EDUCATION

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:03.160
FOR ALL MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.660
BECAUSE WITH EDUCATION
WILL COME ACCESS TO COMPUTERS

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.260
AND WITH ACCESS TO COMPUTERS
WILL COME USAGE.

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.160
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE FOUND
IS THAT ACCESS BEGETS USAGE.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.960
SO IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF WHETHER
YOU WANT TO USE IT OR NOT,

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.960
BUT RATHER, WHETHER
YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT,

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.100
BECAUSE OUR DATA SHOW
VERY CLEARLY THAT,

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.460
AS SOON AS YOU
HAVE ACCESS, YOU USE IT.

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.430
WHAT'S REALLY CRITICAL
ABOUT HAVING ACCESS

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.500
IS NOT JUST THE ACCESS
IN AND OF ITSELF,

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.900
IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT,
WHAT OUTCOMES.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.360
CAN KIDS READ BETTER?
CAN THEY DO BETTER IN SCHOOL?

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.460
ARE ADULTS GETTING
LIVING WAGE JOBS?

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.930
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
ARE THE RESULTS

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:37.600
THAT WE ARE HOPING FOR

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.800
AS PEOPLE ACCESS
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES --

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.130
OWNING A COMPUTER, ACCESSING
THE WEB AT A COMMUNITY CENTER,

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.660
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.560
THAT WILL LEND THEMSELVES TO
BUILDING INFORMATION LITERACY.

00:30:47.560 --> 00:31:31.930
THERE'S A NEW BASIC, AND IT'S
CALLED INFORMATION LITERACY.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:34.660
WELL, MY NAME IS
VINCENT ROBERT BELL

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:39.260
AND I'M 11 GOING ON 12.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.700
I LIVE WITH MY MOTHER,

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.600
MY FATHER, MY BROTHER,

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:51.160
MY AUNT, MY GRANDMOTHER,
MY COUSIN...

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:57.100
MY -- AND MY LITTLE
TWO COUSINS.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.260
YES, I'M VERY DIFFERENT
FROM MY FRIENDS.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.930
WELL, LIKE, SOME OF MY FRIENDS,
THEY LIKE TO PLAY BASKETBALL,

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.330
I LIKE TO PLAY BASEBALL.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.430
LIKE, ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS,

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:14.200
I LIKE COMPUTERS,
THEY LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.460
THEY MAY LIKE LOOKING AT FISH.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.530
Woman: FOR HOMEWORK TONIGHT,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.860
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A LIST
OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:27.130
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BLOCK OFF
THE PAGES IN THREE COLUMNS.

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.160
Vincent: HOW I WOULD CHANGE
COMPUTERS IN MY SCHOOL

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.830
IS, I WOULD FIRST FIND OUT

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.960
HO KS ARE
IN EACH CLASSROOM

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:38.460
AND SEND THAT AMOUNT
OF COMPUTERS TO THAT CLASS.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.860
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE,

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.630
YOU HAVE TO BE
INDEPENDENT TO LEARN,

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.730
YOU CAN'T BE, LIKE,
ALL BUNCHED UP TO LEARN,

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.230
BECAUSE THAT'S HARDER TO LEARN.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:50.130
IT'S HARDER BECAUSE ONE PERSON
WANTS TO DO THIS,

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.360
ONE PERSON WANTS TO DO THAT.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.300
ONE PERSON WANTS TO DO THIS,
ONE PERSON WANTS TO DO THAT.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.900
IT'S HARDER FOR THE MAIN PERSON
TO UNDERSTAND

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:09.200
WHAT THE BASIC CONCEPT
OF THE COMPUTER IS.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.460
WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS
I WANT TO BE WHEN I GROW UP

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.400
IS A CHEF.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.530
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO BE
WHEN I GROW UP IS A TEACHER,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:35.200
AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO
BE WHEN I GROW UP IS A LAWYER.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.130
MY NAME IS SHAQUANA DAVIS,
I'M 16 YEARS OLD,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:46.700
AND I LIVE
IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.130
I LIVE WITH MY FOSTER MOTHER,

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.160
HER DAUGHTER,

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.500
AND SHE GOT
ANOTHER FOSTER DAUGHTER.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.600
NO, I ALREADY CALLED IT.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.500
MY OLDEST BROTHER LIVES
WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.500
MY OLDEST SISTER LIVES
WITH HER FRIEND IN MANHATTAN,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.400
AND MY YOUNGER BROTHERS
AND SISTERS IS, UM,

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.900
IN A FOSTER HOME, TOO,
WITH ANOTHER FOSTER LADY.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:17.660
I HAVE SEVEN BROTHERS
AND THREE SISTERS,

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.960
AND ONLY ONE OF MY BROTHERS
USE A COMPUTER.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.460
HE RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.460
AND THE REST OF THEM IS YOUNG

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:32.530
AND THEY DON'T KNOW
ABOUT A COMPUTER.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:39.360
YEAH, THIS IS IT,
PRINT THIS OUT.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.860
Davis: MY FAVORITE THING
I LIKE TO DO IS

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.430
LOOK AT VIDEOS ON B.E.T.

00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:52.600
AND LISTEN TO MUSIC
ON THE RADIOS.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.530
AND COME TO CONCORD
AND PLAY ON THE COMPUTERS.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.330
LITTLE KIM, HOLD UP.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.300
THOUGHT YOU
WERE STOPPING.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.700
♪ STOPPIN' ♪♪

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.200
OH, IT'S THE OLD THING.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.430
Woman: CONCORD FAMILY SERVICES

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.330
IS A FOSTER CARE AGENCY
THAT IS COMMUNITY BASED,

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:16.460
AND WE PARTNER WITH DIFFERENT
PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY,

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:19.300
AND ONE OF OUR PARTNERS
IS URBAN TECHNOLOGY.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.230
URBAN TECHNOLOGY WANTED
TO BE IN BROOKLYN

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.360
AND THEY DECIDED TO MAKE
CONCORD FAMILY SERVICES

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.860
THEIR TEST SITE,

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.260
AND THAT'S HOW
THIS PROGRAM CAME ABOUT.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.330
YOU COULD SELECT
ON ANY ONE OF THESE.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:36.530
I ALWAYS GO
TO LEONI'S LYRIC PAGE.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.460
SHE HAS THE BEST?

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.600
IT GOT ALL THE SONGS
UP HERE

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.900
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.000
Woman: WE STARTED
THREE YEARS AGO.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.530
AT THAT TIME, WE WERE 14%
IN TERMS OF USE,

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:57.360
AND THE WHITE POPULATION
WAS CLOSE TO 30.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.360
WE WERE VERY TROUBLED
BY THAT GAP

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.900
AND WE FELT THAT

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.460
IF THAT CONTINUED,

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.330
THAT IT WOULD FURTHER CAUSE
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS,

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.200
SOCIAL PROBLEMS,
IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.500
AND SO WE PUT

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.060
THE URBAN TECHNOLOGY
CENTER TOGETHER.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.700
ITS MISSION IS TO PROVIDE
ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.600
TO THOSE PEOPLE
IN INNER CITY COMMUNITIES

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:25.800
WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN
OVERLOOKED OR UNDERSERVED.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.130
Davis: I COME
TO CONCORD EVERY DAY,

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:33.130
BECAUSE I LIKE WORKING
ON THE COMPUTERS.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:37.300
I LIKE LOOKING UP MUSIC PAGES

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.460
AND PRINTING SONGS OUT
THAT I DON'T KNOW

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.130
SO I CAN LEARN THEM,

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:45.730
AND I LIKE COMING TO CONCORD
TO HANG WITH MY FRIENDS

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:50.200
AND TO PLAY GAMES
ON THE COMPUTER.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.160
NO, I DON'T HAVE
COMPUTERS AT MY SCHOOL,

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.200
BUT I WISH I HAD COMPUTERS
AT MY SCHOOL,

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.860
BECAUSE THE KIDS AT MY SCHOOL
ASK ME ABOUT COMPUTERS

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:06.430
AND I TELL ABOUT THE COMPUTERS
AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ON THERE.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.500
AND THEY BE TELLING ME THAT --
AND THEY BE ASKING ME

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.030
CAN I GET THEM THINGS
OFF THE COMPUTER,

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:24.730
AND I'LL GET IT
OFF THE COMPUTER FOR THEM.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.860
Taylor: WORKING ONE-ON-ONE
WITH AN URBAN TECH STAFF MEMBER,

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.530
SHAQUANA BEGINS DEVELOPING
HANDS-ON TECHNOLOGY SKILLS,

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.030
AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:38.800
TOWARD JOB OPPORTUNITIES
IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.060
Davis: I LEARNED HOW
TO REPAIR COMPUTERS

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.400
THROUGH THE LEADERSHIP
ACADEMY PROGRAM.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.400
AND, UM, I WORKED ON
THAT COMPUTER TODAY

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.700
AND SOME OF THE THINGS --
I INSTALLED MEMORY IN THERE,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.660
I INSTALLED A HARD DRIVE,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.930
A CD-ROM,

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.730
AND I INSTALLED
A SOUND CARD

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.630
AND A MODEM.

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:17.230
AND I INSTALLED WINDOWS 95
ON A COMPUTER TODAY.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.300
Floyd: WHEN SHAQUANA
FIRST CAME HERE,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.460
SHE WAS VERY QUIET,

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:24.830
SHE WASN'T MOTIVATED
TO GO TO SCHOOL,

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.500
SHE GOT INTO A LOT OF FIGHTS
WITH HER PEERS,

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:32.060
AND SHE WAS REALLY MOVING
FROM FOSTER HOME TO FOSTER HOME.

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.060
SO WE DECIDED, WITH HER,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.700
THAT SHE WANTED TO BE
IN THIS PROGRAM.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.030
WE TOLD HER THE RULES
AND REGULATIONS

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.000
THAT SHE HAD TO COMMIT TO.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.660
SHE AGREED.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.830
AND AS SHE BEGAN GOING
INTO THIS PROGRAM

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.860
AND AS THE WEEKS WENT BY,

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.300
YOU SAW A CHANGE
IN HER BEHAVIOR.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.500
THE FIGHTING CEASED,

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.430
I FOUND THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.200
BETWEEN HER AND THE FOSTER
PARENTS WERE IMPROVING.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.060
AND I ALSO FOUND THAT

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.960
SHE REALLY WAS THINKING
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT SCHOOL.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.000
I THINK SHE FELT THAT SCHOOL,
IN THE BEGINNING,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.300
WAS NOT FOR HER,
THAT SHE COULDN'T LEARN,

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.200
THAT SHE WASN'T MOTIVATED,

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:23.630
AND I THINK
THIS GAVE HER SOME HOPE.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:25.760
Dziko: I THINK TECHNOLOGY,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.500
PEOPLE INTELLECTUALLY KNOW THAT
IT'S SOMETHING THEY NEED.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.900
BUT THEN, ON THE OTHER SIDE,

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.300
IT'S STILL SOMETHING
THAT WHITE PEOPLE DO.

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.930
WHEN YOU TALK TO KIDS,
IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.560
THE WHITE KIDS DO,
BECAUSE THAT IS ALL THEY SEE.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:39.860
YOU GO INTO THE SCHOOL
AND THERE MAY BE A COMPUTER LAB,

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.700
AND OUR PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE.

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.000
AND THEY THINK IF IT
DOESN'T SAY, YOU KNOW,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.760
AFRICAN AMERICAN KIDS THIS,
KIDS OF COLOR THAT,

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.260
THAT IT'S NOT FOR THEM.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.460
AND THEY HAVE BEEN CONDITIONED
TO THINK THAT.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:55.530
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY, WHO IS --
WHAT DOES A SCIENTIST LOOK LIKE?

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.860
WHAT DOES A COMPUTER REPAIR
PERSON LOOK LIKE?

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.800
YOU KNOW, THEY'LL ALMOST ALWAYS
DRAW A WHITE PERSON,

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.400
AND IT'S ALWAYS A MAN.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.700
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE SAME
THING WITH GIRLS, YOU KNOW.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.430
WHAT DO THEY SEE?

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:08.630
IT'S THE SAME STUFF
THEY SEE IN ADVERTISEMENTS.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.000
IT'S THE SAME THINGS
THEY SEE ON TV,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.230
IN THEIR COMMUNITY, MAYBE.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.000
THEY NEED TO HAVE
A LITTLE VARIETY,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.100
A LITTLE VARIETY IN ROLE MODELS

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.660
WHO ARE WILLING
TO SPEND TIME WITH THEM,

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.600
NOT JUST, YOU KNOW,
STAND IN FRONT OF THEM

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.330
AND SAY, "WELL,
I BUILD COMPUTERS,"

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.230
AND THEN,
THAT'S THE END OF THAT.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:29.030
YOU SEE?

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.660
16 MEGABYTES?

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.930
YEAH, 16.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:36.030
Davis: I LIKE
REPAIRING COMPUTERS

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.530
BECAUSE I LEARN,

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:43.300
I COULD LEARN THE STUFF
ON THE INSIDE.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.760
MOST OF THE COMPUTER
TECHNICIANS ARE MEN,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.230
AND THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY COULD BE

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:55.900
IN THEIR LATE 40s, EARLY 50s.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.100
COMPUTER TECHNICIANS
LOOK INTELLIGENT.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.960
THEY LOOK SMART,
LIKE THEY GOT BRAINS.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.730
NOW, WE WANT TO CHOOSE
THE COMPONENT.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:11.300
SMART, LOOK LIKE TO ME,

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:13.700
PEOPLE THAT WALK AROUND
WITH GLASSES ON

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:21.560
AND PEN POCKETS IN THEIR SHIRT.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.760
AND SUSPENDERS ON
AND HIGHWATER PANTS.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:33.160
THAT'S SMART, TO ME.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.300
THIS, THIS LITTLE ARROW
OVER HERE MEANS ITS UP,

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.800
SO YOU HAVE TO PLUG IT
IN LIKE THIS.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:43.900
OKAY, SAME WITH THIS ONE.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.830
Taylor: IF CHILDREN OF COLOR
IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.060
ARE ABLE TO GAIN
THE NECESSARY SKILLS

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:51.360
TO COMPETE IN
THE HIGH-TECH JOB MARKET,

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.960
WHAT KIND OF RECEPTION
AWAITS THEM?

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.700
THEY ARE APPROACHING AN INDUSTRY

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.730
THAT SOME OBSERVERS FEEL
HAS A POOR TRACK RECORD

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:06.360
IN HIRING AND PROMOTING LATINOS
AND AFRICAN AMERICANS.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.830
Dziko: WELL, THERE ARE SEVERAL
REASONS WHY I LEFT THE INDUSTRY.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.760
ONE OF THEM IS THAT I WATCHED
A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.500
GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING
THAT I WENT THROUGH IN THE '70s.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.030
SO I KEPT SEEING THIS GO ON.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:20.330
I WATCHED CORPORATIONS RECRUIT
AT A COLLEGE LEVEL.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.830
WELL, WHO GOES TO COLLEGE?

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:23.660
SO THIS IS THEIR POOL
THEY'RE CHOOSING FROM,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.430
AND THEY'RE NOT
INVESTING IN K-12.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:31.330
I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T DO IT
FROM THE INSIDE.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.300
AND IT JUST SEEMED TO ME
THAT BEING IN THE COMMUNITY

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.960
WAS THE BEST PLACE
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN,

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.230
AND WE HAVE A GOAL

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.430
OF FLOODING THE PIPELINE
WITH SO MANY TALENTED KIDS

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.730
THAT CORPORATIONS DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE BUT TO HIRE THEM.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:52.000
A RéSUMé IS NOT THAT HARD TO DO,
ONCE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.960
SO SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU DO IT,

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.600
YOU SHOULD REALLY
BE MORE EXPERIENCED

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.330
BEFORE YOU REALLY GO
IN TOO DEEP,

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:05.160
BEFORE YOU GO DEEP INTO
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.330
BECAUSE SOMETIMES, LIKE,
YOU COULD MESS UP,

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:13.430
SOMETIMES I EVEN MESS UP --
EVERYBODY'S NOT PERFECT.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:22.030
AND SOMETIMES, LIKE, EVEN
OUR TEACHERS MESS UP SOMETIMES.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.960
Man: WELL, VINCENT, SINCE HE'S
BEEN GOING TO URBAN TECH,

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:27.930
HE WANTS TO LEARN MORE,

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.360
ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO COMPUTER.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.230
HE GETS EXCITED WHEN HE GETS
AROUND A COMPUTER,

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.300
OR EVEN MENTION
THE WORD "COMPUTERS."

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.730
HE GETS, HE JUST JUMPS AT IT
AND HE'S SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.300
BEFORE, HE HAD NO,
HE HAD INTEREST,

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.700
BUT IT WASN'T TECHNICAL.

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.000
AND THIS IS --
OH, HE IS LOVING IT.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.500
AND SO IT'S A BIG CHANGE IN HIM,
A VERY BIG CHANGE.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.360
AND LIKE I SAY, URBAN TECH,

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:53.900
HE CAME IN AND HE WENT THROUGH
THAT PROGRAM THE FIRST YEAR,

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.860
AND FROM THEN, HE JUST
SHOT OFF LIKE A ROCKET.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.730
NOW, YOU CAN'T SLOW HIM DOWN.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.430
Floyd: YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
COME AND SHOW ME SOME THINGS.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.660
BUT WHAT HAPPENED?

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.600
OKAY.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.960
Taylor: THE SUCCESS
OF COMMUNITY TECHNOLOGY CENTERS

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.660
IN LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.200
CLEARLY SHOWS THE DEMAND
FOR DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.430
IN THESE COMMUNITIES,

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:18.200
AND YET, YOU STILL
CAN'T BUY A COMPUTER

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.660
IN BEDFORD-STUYVESANT.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.430
WHY DO SOME CORPORATIONS

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:26.160
CONTINUE TO IGNORE
THIS POTENTIAL MARKET?

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.960
Bransford:
MOST SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.500
DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:37.230
A LOT OF BUSINESS
IN OUR INNER CITY COMMUNITIES.

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.530
I'VE BEEN TOLD
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.730
"WELL, PAT, THERE'S NO MONEY
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES,"

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:48.030
AND I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM
WITH THE LACK OF ACCESS.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.930
IF YOU LOOK AROUND, THERE
REALLY ISN'T A RETAIL STORE

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.060
WHERE YOU CAN BUY A COMPUTER.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:57.560
YOU SEE THE STOREFRONTS
BEGINNING TO OPEN UP,

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.000
BUT THERE ARE NO CompUSAs
ANYWHERE NEAR

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.930
THE BEDFORD-STUYVESANT AREA
THAT WE'RE WORKING IN.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.260
SO I THINK IN TERMS
OF GOODS AND SERVICES

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:11.460
THAT THERE IS JUST A VERY --
THERE'S A DELAY

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.200
IN PROVIDING THOSE
TO INNER CITY COMMUNITIES

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.560
BECAUSE NO ONE
REALLY SEES THE MARKET.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.230
I SEE PEOPLE IN MY JOB EVERY DAY
WHO WANT TO GO INVEST

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.530
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN COUNTRIES WHERE

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.330
THE PER CAPITA INCOME
IN THAT COUNTRY

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.000
IS ONE-TENTH
THE PER CAPITA INCOME

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.560
AT THE LOW END OF AMERICA'S
BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.060
IT'S RACISM,

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.060
IT'S A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
OF THE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES,

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:35.830
AND IT'S A FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.900
WELL, I BELIEVE THAT IF EVERYONE
WAS TO BE ON THE SAME LEVEL,

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.560
IT WOULD BE KIND OF HARD
FOR PEOPLE

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.530
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.960
IF ALL OF US WERE INVOLVED
IN THE COMPUTER AGE,

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.330
THEN WE WOULD KNOW
JUST AS MUCH AS EVERYBODY ELSE,

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.500
AND THAT WOULD BE KIND OF HARD
FOR PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.100
IF OUR CHILDREN CAN HAVE ACCESS
TO DIFFERENT THINGS

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.960
OTHER CHILDREN
CAN HAVE ACCESS TO,

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.230
THEY'D LEARN DIFFERENT CULTURES,

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.930
HOW TO GET ALONG WITH
PEOPLE BETTER,

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:00.200
HOW TO RELATE
TO OTHER COMMUNITIES

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.500
AND OTHER NATIONALITIES --
THAT WOULD BRING PEACE.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.100
WELL, IN THIS AREA, THERE'S NO,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.600
THERE'S NO PLACE
YOU CAN GO FOR TRAINING.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:10.460
OF COURSE, THERE'S
NO COMPUTER STORES,

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.900
YOU HAVE TO GO TO A BIG COMPUTER
STORE TO BUY A COMPUTER.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.730
MOST PEOPLE
CAN'T AFFORD A COMPUTER.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.330
YOU NEED SOMEPLACE WHERE YOU CAN
TAKE A KID TO AFTER SCHOOL.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:24.460
AND URBAN TECH PROVIDED THAT,
JUST MADE US A GREAT PROGRAM.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.860
AND A LOT OF KIDS THAT CAME OUT
OF IT, LIKE MY SON, VINCENT,

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.860
THEY ENJOYED IT.

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:30.330
NOW HE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT COMPUTERS --

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.830
I HAVE TO GO TO HIM.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.730
HE IS MUCH BETTER THAN I AM,

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.830
BUT HE LEARNED IT HERE,
NOT AT SCHOOL,

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.260
WHICH IS A SHAME.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.900
OKAY.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.500
"VINCENT BELL."

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.060
WHO IS THAT?

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:47.800
YOUR SON, WHO ELSE?

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.500
AND HERE'S MY HOMEPAGE

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.560
AND MOST OF THIS STUFF
WAS DONE IN ADOBE PHOTOSHOP.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.060
WELL, WHAT WE DID WAS,

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.800
HE TOOK A PICTURE
WITH A DIGITAL CAMERA

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.560
AND SCANNED IT IN.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:07.430
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:09.830
Hoffman: I THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.560
TO HOLD CORPORATE AMERICA'S
FEET TO THE FIRE

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:16.200
AND SAY, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE REWARDS,

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.830
THEN YOU ALSO NEED TO ENSURE,

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:20.600
OR TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ENSURING

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.830
THAT EVERYONE
IN THIS COUNTRY HAS ACCESS.

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:25.800
AND THE IMPLICATIONS
ARE PROFOUND,

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.860
BECAUSE WITHOUT ACCESS
FOR ALL AMERICANS,

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.900
WE ARE GOING TO SEE
INCREASING PROBLEMS

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.760
IN THE INNER CITY, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.730
WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE
A WELL-TRAINED CADRE

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.230
OF HIGH-TECH WORKERS
IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:41.760
AND WE WILL CONTINUE
TO SEE INCOME GAPS.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.360
AND SO, I THINK, IT IS
IN THE BEST INTERESTS

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.530
OF CORPORATE AMERICA
TO BEGIN TO THINK

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:50.600
ABOUT THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS
THAT THEY CAN INSTITUTE

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.200
TO ENSURE ACCESS
TO BOTH POOR PEOPLE

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.800
AND MINORITIES
AND POOR MINORITIES.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.500
CORPORATE AMERICA
CREATED THIS MESS

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.330
AND THEY HAVE TO
LIVE WITH IT, ESSENTIALLY.

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.730
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IS,
IT'S BACKFIRING ON THEM

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.430
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FILL THE JOBS
TO KEEP THEM GOING,

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.260
SO THEY CREATED
THIS WHOLE INDUSTRY,

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.130
BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP IT THRIVING.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.200
AND SO, NOW, WHAT THEY'RE
DOING IS STARTING TO LOOK

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.730
IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT
THEY NEVER LOOKED AT BEFORE

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.900
AND THINKING THAT
THEY KNOW THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.660
AND THINKING THAT IF THEY PLOP
A FEW CHEAP PCs IN THERE,

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.600
IT'S THE GREAT EQUALIZER.

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.700
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.460
IN THE INFORMATION AGE,
IN THE NEW AGE,

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.560
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER,

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:34.300
IT'S NOT "HAVE AND HAVE NOT,"
IT'S CAN AND CANNOT,

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.630
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:38.100
YOU CANNOT --

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:41.360
YOU CANNOT EDUCATE YOURSELF,
YOU CANNOT COMMUNICATE,

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:43.800
YOU CANNOT
ENTERTAIN YOURSELF,

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800
YOU CANNOT CONDUCT COMMERCE.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.660
THIS ISN'T ABOUT HAVING
A REFRIGERATOR OR A TELEVISION

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.200
OR A CAR IN YOUR GARAGE
OR A CHICKEN IN EVERY POT,

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.730
THIS IS ABOUT HAVING

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:56.060
THE FUNDAMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.900
THE FUNDAMENTAL KEYS
TO BEING SUCCESSFUL

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.530
IN THE 21st CENTURY,

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.600
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED LOWER-COST,
EASIER-TO-USE TECHNOLOGY.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.060
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
IT'S GOING TO TAKE

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.660
TO GET IT TO EVERYONE,

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:10.360
NOT JUST SOME PEOPLE,
BUT EVERYONE.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.700
IT'S NICE.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:17.830
AND THEN, I HAVE
SOME OF MY LINKS.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.400
THE FIRST ONE'S
MY FAVORITE.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.200
"THE SIMPSONS"?

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.200
AND IF YOU CLICK THAT,
WHAT WILL COME UP?

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.500
IF YOU CLICK HERE,
IT WILL SEND YOU

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.630
TO "THE SIMPSONS"
HOMEPAGE.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.560
WILL I GET A PICTURE?

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.130
Vincent: URBAN TECH
HAS GIVEN A COMPUTER

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.230
TO EVERY KID
WHO COMPLETES THE PROGRAM.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.860
AND IT'S VERY HELPFUL,

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.360
BECAUSE, LIKE, A LOT OF TIMES,

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.560
MY PARENTS DON'T REALLY KNOW --
I TEACH THEM.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.600
KIDS TEACH THEIR PARENTS.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.060
LIKE, I PICKED THE COMPUTER UP
IN TWO DAYS

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.200
FROM THE FIRST WEEK I JOINED,

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:58.260
BECAUSE IT WAS EASY AS LONG AS
YOU HAD THE EFFORT INTO IT.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.860
Victor: I THINK WE HAVE,
IN OUR DISTRICT,

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.100
I THINK WE GET
THE SHORT END TOO MUCH.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.260
IF YOU GO SOMEPLACE ELSE,
LIKE I SAID,

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.130
THEY HAVE COMPUTER CLASSES,

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:10.560
THEY HAVE, THEY JUST HAVE
BETTER SCHOOLS FOR SOME REASON,

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.860
BUT IT'S STILL
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.060
I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF, WHY,
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.860
BETWEEN THIS COMMUNITY
AND THAT COMMUNITY?

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.700
I MEAN, YOU HAVE JUST AS MANY
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.100
IN BEDFORD-STUYVESANT

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:23.300
AS YOU DO IN BOROUGH PARK
OR BENSONHURST OR BAY RIDGE.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.130
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
WHAT IS THE DIFF --

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.360
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SCHOOL,
YOU'RE NOT TALKING

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.900
ABOUT WHOSE HOUSE COST MORE
OR WHO DONATES MORE MONEY

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.900
TO THIS ELECTION FUND
OR THAT ELECTION FUND.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.360
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.930
THEY SHOULD ALL BE TREATED,
THEY SHOULD ALL BE GIVEN

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:38.660
THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN,
JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.960
SO WHAT IF BAY RIDGE DONATES

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.200
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS
TO SOMEBODY'S CAMPAIGN?

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.760
DOES THAT MEAN YOU PAY
MORE ATTENTION TO BAY RIDGE

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.400
AND YOU IGNORE
BEDFORD-STUYVESANT, YOU KNOW?

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:51.960
THAT'S FRUSTRATING,
ESPECIALLY AS A PARENT.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.930
AS A KID WHO SPENT A LOT
OF YEARS IN BEDFORD-STUYVESANT,

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:57.100
YOU SEE THESE THINGS
AND YOU JUST SHAKE YOUR HEAD,

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.930
YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S
WRONG WITH US?"

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:00.830
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH US, YOU KNOW,

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:10.730
WE'RE FINE,
WE JUST NEED OPPORTUNITY.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.500
Taylor: IF ALL AMERICANS
HAD EQUAL ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY,

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.030
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.830
WOULD IT DIMINISH CURRENT SOCIAL
AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES?

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.230
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE
WHO ARE DENIED ACCESS

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.130
TO THE INFORMATION AGE?

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:24.660
AND WHAT WILL IT MEAN TO BE

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:30.460
ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE?

00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.100
Lopez: THE QUESTION OF WHETHER
AMERICA WOULD BE DIFFERENT

00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:36.300
IF WE ALL HAD ACCESS
TO TECHNOLOGY

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.230
IS A GOOD QUESTION.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.900
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
AN ANSWERABLE QUESTION, THOUGH.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.230
IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER WAYS

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:48.900
THAT AMERICA HAD TRIED TO
INTEGRATE ACCESS AND EQUALITY,

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.960
AND THE TRACK RECORD IT'S HAD,

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.360
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK
FROM THAT POINT AND DETERMINE

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.430
WHETHER TECHNOLOGY, ONCE AGAIN,

00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:00.330
IS BEING USED AS A PANACEA
TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.860
THAT AMERICA HAS BEEN TRYING
TO DO FOR SO LONG,

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.100
AND HAS YET BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.330
I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.860
TO BE INVOLVED
IN THIS TECHNOLOGY,

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.630
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES
TO BE PLUGGED IN,

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.660
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:16.330
WHAT WE DO IN THE NEXT
5 TO 10 YEARS

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:20.360
WILL SHAPE THEIR LIVES
FOR THE NEXT 60 TO 70 YEARS,

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.060
AND SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.430
TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT
IN OUR PEOPLE NOW.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.530
INFORMATION IS POWER,

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.830
AND EQUAL ACCESS TO COMPUTERS
WILL GET YOU THAT INFORMATION.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:32.860
AND I THINK, NO LONGER
WILL PEOPLE BE IN THE DARK.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.160
PEOPLE WILL LEARN
ABOUT INVESTING,

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.200
THEY WILL LEARN WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.360
THEY BECOME MORE INTERESTED,

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.700
SO THEN, THEY SEEK
MORE INFORMATION,

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:45.760
SO THEN, THEY VOTE MORE
AND THEY RUN FOR OFFICE MORE.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.300
I MEAN, IT IS JUST LIKE THIS
LITTLE PEBBLE EFFECT, RIGHT?

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:51.760
IT GETS YOU, THE MORE YOU LEARN,
THE MORE YOU WANT TO KNOW.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.830
IT'S NATURAL, IT'S HUMAN NATURE,

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.300
AND I THINK THAT TECHNOLOGY
ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.500
♪ CHITTY CHITTY BANG-BANG,
I CAN DO KARATE ♪

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.730

I CAN SHAKE MY BODY ♪♪

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.060
Geraldo: I THINK I'LL GET
A COMPUTER IN THE FUTURE

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:11.900
BY PROBABLY BUYING ONE

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:16.900
OR SOMEBODY DONATING IT TO ME.

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.960
Interpreter: IF THEY HAVE
A COMPUTER AT HOME,

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.930
THEY CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH OTHER CHILDREN,

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:23.530
THEY CAN DO
THEIR HOMEWORK BETTER,

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.430
AND THEY WILL HAVE
A BETTER EDUCATION.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.960
NO, NO, YOU CAN'T PUT
A DRAW 2 ON A DRAW 4.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.600
SHE TRIES TO CHEAT
IN EVERY GAME.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.530
EVERY GAME WE PLAY,
SHE CHEATS.

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.300
Iris: IT'S OKAY.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.800
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO PLAY.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:40.030
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE,
I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE ONE,

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:43.830
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN
AND READ ABOUT THE COMPUTERS

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.730
AND TRY TO KNOW
WHICH IS THE BEST ONE

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:56.900
THAT I CAN PURCHASE LATER ON.

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.860
HOPEFULLY, I WANT TO HAVE
A COMPUTER WHEN I GROW UP,

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:06.600
SO THAT WAY, IT'LL BE
MUCH EASIER FOR ME TO DO THINGS.

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.260
ONE OF THESE DAYS, HOPEFULLY,

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.330
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET THEM
A COMPUTER, SO.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.400
WELL, YEAH, I'M GOING TO
BUY A COMPUTER,

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.460
BECAUSE THERE'S GOING TO BE
PLENTY OF THINGS

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.030
THAT I NEED TO LEARN.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:21.930
AND I'M GOING TO NEED A COMPUTER
SOONER OR LATER,

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:27.800
SO I'M GOING TO BUY ONE.

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:31.930
YES, I THINK I'LL HAVE
A COMPUTER WHEN I GROW UP

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:35.430
BECAUSE THE ONE I HAVE
AT MY FOSTER MOTHER HOUSE,

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:42.100
I'M TAKING IT WITHE
WHEN I GO BACK TO MY MOTHER.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.500
Vincent: YES, I DO THINK I'LL
HAVE A COMPUTER WHEN I GROW UP.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.600
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE,

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.230
I COULD SAVE UP FOR THE MONEY

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.060
OR I CAN KEEP THE COMPUTER
I HAVE NOW.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:57.830
Victor: WELL, VINCENT
TEACHES EVERYBODY, UH,

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:01.030
LIKE, THE SOFTWARE ASPECT
OF THE COMPUTER.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:04.230
HIS BROTHER,
HIS BROTHER GOES TO VICTOR,

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.200
GOES TO BOYS AND GIRLS
HIGH SCHOOL

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.800
AND HE IS DOING PROGRAMMING,

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.900
HE IS LEARNING HOW TO DO,
HOW TO WRITE PROGRAMS,

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.030
SO I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEY
BOTH GET TOGETHER.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:14.800
IT COULD BE BILL GATES
ALL OVER AGAIN, WHO KNOWS?

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.260
I HOPE.

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:19.800
TOOUT

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.430
