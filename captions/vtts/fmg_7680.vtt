WEBVTT

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.430
I HAD MY APPENDIX OUT
WHEN I WAS TEN

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.830
AND I REMEMBER THAT
THEY GAVE YOU ETHER THEN

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.730
AND I REMEMBER THE FEELING
OF FLOATING OFF UNDER THE ETHER

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.070
AND I LOVED THAT FEELING.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.430
IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING
LIFTED OUT OF MY MIND

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.270
IN A VERY NICE WAY
BECAUSE MY MIND

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.530
WASN'T A VERY GOOD
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR ME TO BE IN.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.200
I WASN'T VERY SAFE THERE.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.530
YOU KNOW, THE SCENARIO

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.830
IS THAT YOU START SMOKING POT,
DRINKING BEER

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.470
THEN YOU GO TO THE HARD DRUGS.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.430
I WENT STRAIGHT
TO A SPIKE IN MY ARM.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.870
I AM THE KIND OF PERSON

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.700
WHO WANTS TO JUST DO IT
AND DO IT AND DO IT AND DO IT.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.900
YOU KNOW... "HIS EYES ARE BIGGER
THAN HIS STOMACH" SORT OF THING.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.630
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T
POSSIBLY BE ADDICTED TO DRUGS.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.600
I WAS A POLICE OFFICER
DOING MY JOB.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.670
I WAS USING TWO,
THREE TIMES A WEEK

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.470
THEN EVERY EVENING,
AND THEN ALL WEEKEND LONG.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.000
IN FACT, OF A GROUP OF
ABOUT 40 OF US LIVELY, ROBUST

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.500
HEALTHY, INTELLIGENT,
BEAUTIFUL YOUNGSTERS

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.570
I THINK I'M PROBABLY
THE LAST ONE ALIVE.

I'M BILL MOYERS.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.770
HARDLY A FAMILY HAS BEEN SPARED

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.030
DIRECT OR INDIRECT EXPERIENCE
WITH ADDICTION

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.070
INCLUDING MY OWN.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.800
MY WIFE JUDITH AND I THOUGHT
WE KNEW ABOUT ADDICTION

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.670
UNTIL IT CAME CLOSE TO HOME.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.130
THEN WE DISCOVERED
JUST HOW NAIVE WE HAD BEEN.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.600
TEN YEARS AGO,
OUR OLDEST SON PLUNGED INTO

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.670
A LONG AND PAINFUL STRUGGLE
WITH DRUGS AND ALCOHOL.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.800
OUR ENTIRE FAMILY WAS
SWEPT INTO THE ORDEAL.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.500
IT'S COME TO A HAPPY PLACE
FOR US, FORTUNATELY

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.230
AND OUR SON IS DOING WELL.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.570
MANY OTHERS ARE NOT SO LUCKY.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.830
WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.530
AND ARE STILL LEARNING
PROMPTED THIS SERIES.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.070
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE USE

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.200
OR EVEN THE OCCASIONAL ABUSE
OF A SUBSTANCE.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.770
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THAT OBSESSIVE DESIRE

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.600
WHERE A CHEMICAL
YOU TAKE, DRINK OR SMOKE

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.800
BECOMES THE MASTER OF YOUR MIND
AND THE TYRANT OF YOUR LIFE.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.570
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE REPORTING:

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.970
THE EXPERIENCE OF ADDICTION,
HOW IT HAPPENS

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.700
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.130
Woman:
OKAY, DENISE, NOW YOU'RE
GOING TO HEAR THE BEEP

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.730
FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.130
Moyers:
SCIENTISTS WILL SHOW US
HOW DRUGS HIJACK THE BRAIN.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.630
Man:
LITERALLY,
WHAT THIS ALLOWS US TO DO

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.370
IS GET AN IMAGE OF DESIRE
IN THE BRAIN.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.670
Man:
NICE-LOOKING BRAIN.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.170
Woman:
I TELL THE GIRLS ALL THE TIME

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.300
THAT IF YOU FORGET
YOUR LAST HIGH

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.130
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO USE AGAIN.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.230
HI, I'M LASHANNA,
I'M AN ADDICT.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.270
Moyers:
WE'LL GO TO PLACES

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.830
WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING
TO BREAK FREE FROM ADDICTION.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.000
AND THE NEW FRIENDS I MET--
THE BEST FRIENDS I EVER HAD.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.630
THEY CLEAN.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.900
(<i> laughter</i> )

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.170
Moyers:
WE'LL TALK TO KIDS

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.300
IN DANGER OF BECOMING
THE NEXT GENERATION OF ADDICTS.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.170
I MEAN,
THEY JUST KIND OF TOLD ME

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.270
"JOE, YOU'RE AN ADDICT,
LOOK AT YOU."

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.770
I SAID, "WHY? HOW?
BECAUSE WHAT?

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.200
BECAUSE I HANG OUT
WITH MY FRIENDS AND DO DRUGS?"

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.270
Woman:
THIS WHOLE JAIL IS MAINLY FILLED
WITH PEOPLE WITH DRUG PROBLEMS.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.930
THEY STEAL FOR DRUGS,
THEY HAVE SEX FOR DRUGS.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.670
IT'S ALL FOR THE DOPE.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.770
Moyers:
AND WE'LL REPORT ON THE FIGHT TO
CHANGE OUR NATIONAL DRUG POLICY.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.200
Woman:
THE BOTTOM LINE IS

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.730
THAT WE WOULD RATHER HAVE
THAT BED SPACE USED

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.730
BY A RAPIST,
A ROBBER OR A MURDERER

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.030
THAN SOMEONE WHO HAS
AN ABUSIVE SUBSTANCE PROBLEM.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.770
LET'S BEGIN
WITH SOME REAL VETERANS--

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.270
PEOPLE WHO SPEAK
FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.600
THEY'VE AGREED
TO TELL US THEIR STORIES

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.170
SO WE COULD BRING YOU
THIS "PORTRAIT OF ADDICTION."

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.700
Man:
I REMEMBER IT ALMOST
AS IF IT WAS TODAY.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.700
A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO HAD ALREADY BEEN USING

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.530
TOOK ME UP TO THE ROOF,
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR POT--

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.600
UH, MARIJUANA--
AND WE WENT UP THERE

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.870
AND HE HAD ALREADY USED HEROIN.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.230
HE WAS USING IT INTRAMUSCULAR

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.800
AND SKIN-POPPED IT
AND THEN OFFERED ME SOME.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.530
AND THERE WAS THIS...

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.770
AS SOON AS I INJECTED IT--
OR HE INJECTED IT FOR ME;

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.230
IN THOSE EARLY DAYS
I HAD A NEEDLE PHOBIA--

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.300
I REMEMBER THIS WARMTH,
THIS SERENITY.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.130
MY FATHER DEALT WITH
THE FAMILY BY DRINKING.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.600
HE... I REMEMBER VERY WELL,
HE'D GET A BIG BOTTLE OF ALMADEN

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.130
AND KICK BACK IN FRONT OF THE TV
AND DRINK... DRINK HIS WINE.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.770
AND AROUND THE TIME I WAS 19

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.670
I TOOK A SEMESTER OFF
FROM SCHOOL

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.500
AND I WAS WORKING
AND COMING HOME WITH THE FAMILY

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.070
AND I DISCOVERED ALCOHOL

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.470
WAS A VERY, VERY EFFICIENT WAY
OF DEALING WITH THE FAMILY.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.170
AND IT WORKED FOR A WHILE, IT...
YOU KNOW, JUST GET A BUZZ ON

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.630
AND EVERYTHING'S FINE,
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.830
IT WAS ON MY FIRST DATE.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.330
I WENT OUT TO A PLACE CALLED
THE AUDUBON BALLROOM.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.130
THERE WAS A BIG DANCE THERE

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.170
AND I REMEMBER IT WAS A BOTTLE
OF SEAGRAM'S 7 OR SOMETHING.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.230
SO, UM, I GOT VERY SICK.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.700
AND EVEN THAT NIGHT,
MY FIRST TIME DRINKING

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.430
I WAS ABLE TO HOLD
A LOT OF ALCOHOL.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.100
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T DRINK
IN HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.630
I HAD NO UPROARIOUS
STORIES THERE.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.530
I GOT... I STARTED
AFTER I GOT MARRIED

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.870
AND I MOVED TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY
AND I DIDN'T KNOW PEOPLE

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.270
AND WHEN I WENT OUT SOCIALLY,
I WAS VERY SHY.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.170
BUT I LEARNED IF I HAD A FEW
DRINKS, IT WOULD LOOSEN ME UP.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:53.630
I FELT... I FELT AS GOOD
AS EVERYBODY ELSE THERE.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.800
I CAME HOME FROM TWO YEARS
IN THE ARMED FORCES AND...

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.600
Moyers:
VIETNAM?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.070
YEAH...

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.000
AND, UM, I HAD AVOIDED
ANY SERIOUS DRUG USE THERE

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.770
BUT WHEN I CAME HOME,
I WAS LIVING IN HARLEM.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.930
ALMOST EVERYONE I KNEW
WAS INVOLVED

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.870
WITH SOME KIND OF DRUGS,
BUT PRINCIPALLY HEROIN

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.870
WHICH WAS SOMETHING
THAT HAD BEEN A TABOO FOR US

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.630
SINCE THE TIME THAT I WAS SMALL.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.470
WE... WE SORT
OF GREW UP WITH THAT

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.670
BEING A THING THAT WAS FULL OF
MYSTERY, BUT CERTAINLY BAD.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.700
I'D BEEN VERY TERRIFIED OF
THE NOTION OF ANY KIND OF DRUG.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.570
I KIND OF THOUGHT I MIGHT HAVE
TO DO THEM AT SOME POINT

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.900
BECAUSE I REMEMBER
DRUG EDUCATION TELLING ME

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.830
THAT PEER PRESSURE IS GOING
TO PUSH YOU INTO DOING DRUGS

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.570
AND I KNEW THAT IF THIS WAS SO

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.370
THEN ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T DO
DRUGS MUST BE A TOTAL GEEK

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.770
AND SINCE I'M A TOTAL GEEK

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.000
AND I WANT TO GET OUT
OF BEING A TOTAL GEEK

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I'D BETTER DO
WHAT PEER PRESSURE SAYS.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.830
SO THAT DRUG EDUCATION
WAS NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.330
BUT I DO REMEMBER
ONE SORT OF PRINCIPLE

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.930
THAT CAME OUT
OF THAT DRUG EDUCATION WAS

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.830
I REMEMBER THEY TAUGHT ME ABOUT
TOBACCO, AND IT CAUSED CANCER

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.200
AND IT WAS REALLY,
REALLY BAD FOR YOU

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.100
AND IT DIDN'T EVEN SEEM
TO GET YOU PARTICULARLY HIGH

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.330
AND I THOUGHT,
"NAH, I WON'T DO THAT ONE."

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.630
BUT I REMEMBER "ALCOHOL MAKES
YOU PHYSICALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.930
"I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.000
MARIJUANA--
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.470
I STARTED USING AS A RESULT
OF WORKING UNDERCOVER NARCOTICS

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.470
ON THE STREET LEVEL.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.970
I WOULD GO INTO A TOWN
WITH AN ASSUMED IDENTITY

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.670
RENT AN APARTMENT AND BUY DRUGS

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.530
FOR A PERIOD OF 60 DAYS
OR 90 DAYS.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.830
IT SOMETIMES STRETCHED
INTO SEVERAL MONTHS.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.500
Moyers:
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME YOU USED?

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.800
I WAS... I HAD A NEIGHBOR
WHO WAS SELLING

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.270
AND I HAD DISCOVERED THIS

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.830
OVER THE COURSE
OF BECOMING FRIENDLY WITH HIM

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.630
AND WENT IN WITH A STATE AGENT.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.670
HE SAID, "JUST DO LIKE I DO,
DO... DO EXACTLY AS I DO."

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.070
AND THE COCAINE WAS LAID OUT
ON THE MIRROR

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.530
AND... AND HE SNORTED IT

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.430
AND HANDED ME, I THINK IT WAS
A ROLLED-UP $100 BILL

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.700
AND I SNORTED IT, AND I LIKED IT
THE FIRST TIME I DID IT.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.330
WE WERE ALL OUT IN SUBURBIA,
IN VERY FINE HOMES

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.970
AND HAVING VERY GOOD DINNERS
AND VERY GOOD WINE

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.130
AND THEN IT WAS KIND OF CHIC
TO BRING OUT THE COKE AFTER

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.900
AND THEY'D PUT IT ON A MIRROR
OR A PIECE OF GLASS

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.130
AND BREAK IT UP
AND BREAK UP THE LINES.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.730
AND WE'D BE TALKING
ABOUT ONE THING OR ANOTHER--

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.330
NEVER ABOUT DRUGS, OF COURSE

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.200
ALWAYS MAYBE ABOUT POLITICS
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT--

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200
AND IN THE MIDST
OF OUR CONVERSATION

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.530
WE WOULD BE DOING THIS.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.970
AND EVERYBODY FELT VERY IN
AND VERY WITH IT

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.630
AND VERY, YOU KNOW, TOGETHER.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.370
I STARTED CUTTING CLASSES--

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.630
WHICH WAS SOMETHING
THAT I NEVER DID

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.600
BECAUSE I ENJOYED MY CLASSES--

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.870
AND HANGING OUT
IN THE BATHROOMS

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.930
AND DRINKING
WILD IRISH ROSE, YOU KNOW.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.730
AND AT FIRST,
IT WAS ON A RARE BASIS

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.670
AND THEN IT BECAME
ALMOST A DAILY THING

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.230
THAT YOU START
LOOKING FORWARD TO.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.200
I HAD TRIED COCAINE FOR THE
FIRST TIME, WHEN I WAS ABOUT 17

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.600
AND I REALLY LIKED

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.600
THE FEELING OF POWER AND GLAMOUR
AND SEXINESS IT GAVE ME.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.030
AND MY BOYFRIEND SUGGESTED

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.630
"WELL, GEE, YOU'RE GOING
TO THIS IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.100
"THAT'LL BE A GREAT MARKET.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.930
THERE'S LOTS OF PEOPLE
WITH LOTS OF MONEY THERE."

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.530
AND WHEN I GOT THERE,
I WAS SO INTIMIDATED

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.070
BY ALL THOSE PEOPLE
WITH ALL THAT MONEY.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:06.200
I FELT SO LEFT OUT AND
SO SCARED OF THEM AND SO POOR.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.770
I JUST FELT LIKE, "WELL, GEE

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.130
"HERE'S THIS GREAT SOURCE
OF LOTS OF MONEY.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.500
"IT'LL GIVE ME FRIENDS,
IT'LL GIVE ME DRUGS

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.370
IT'LL IMPROVE MY SOCIAL LIFE,
PEOPLE WILL WANT ME."

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.800
FRIENDS THAT I GREW UP WITH

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.330
PEOPLE THAT I WAS YOUNG WITH
WERE ALL USING DRUGS

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.170
AND I EITHER FOUND IT OUT
RIGHT AWAY

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:22.630
OR OVER TIME IT BECAME CLEAR.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.330
THEY WERE USING HEROIN,
AND, IN FACT, THE...

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.830
IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS-- WE WERE
VERY SOCIAL IN THE '60s--

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.300
AND IN SOCIAL SITUATIONS

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.500
IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAD A KIND
OF CONNECTION AND CAMARADERIE

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.000
THAT I COULDN'T BREAK INTO.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.430
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE
ON ANOTHER PLANET AND I...

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:41.030
SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE, AND I
REALLY COULDN'T BREAK INTO THAT.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.000
I WAS SOMEWHAT ALIENATED,
AND I...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.730
I THRASHED AROUND FOR A WHILE

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.200
BUT EVENTUALLY IT WAS OFFERED
TO ME AND I TRIED IT, AND...

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.600
AND WE WERE SNORTING THEN,
AND THEN I WAS...

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.930
I WENT FOR THE IDEA

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.530
THAT IF YOU INHALE IT
RATHER THAN INJECT IT

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.800
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO GET HOOKED ON IT.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.530
I WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.870
I STARTED USING WHEN I WAS 19.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.470
I MAINLINED, UH... COCAINE...
UH, SPEED ACTUALLY

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.900
THEN IT WAS COCAINE

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.630
THEN IT DIDN'T EVEN MATTER,
YOU KNOW, THEN HEROIN.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.930
AND I FOUND A WAY
OF GETTING OUTSIDE MYSELF.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.270
Woman:
I WOULD WAKE UP IN THE MORNING

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.100
AND ROLL OVER AND OPEN
MY TOP DRESSER DRAWER

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.070
AND GET THE COCAINE MIRROR OUT

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.530
AND SNORT SOME COCAINE
TO GET STARTED.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.730
AND THROUGHOUT
THE COURSE OF A DAY...

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.730
TAKE ANOTHER HIT
WHENEVER I FELT I NEEDED IT--

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.400
WHENEVER I WAS...
COMING DOWN TOO FAR.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.670
YOU DON'T KNOW
YOU'RE FALLING IN LOVE WITH IT.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.630
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S
BEGINNING TO TAKE A PRIORITY

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:51.400
EXCEPT FOR ONE DAY YOU WAKE UP
AND YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO HAVE IT.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.100
YOU GOT TO HAVE IT.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.170
I LOVE HOW I FEEL
AFTER THREE OR FOUR BEERS.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.300
I MEAN, IT'S
AN ECSTATIC FEELING.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.970
AND I THINK... AND THAT...
I SORT OF GREW INTO THAT.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.230
I MEAN, IT WAS...

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.030
I THINK IF THERE IS
A GENETIC DIFFERENCE

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.770
BETWEEN AN ALCOHOLIC
AND A NONALCOHOLIC

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.900
I THINK A NONALCOHOLIC
WHO'S HAD THREE BEERS

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.400
WILL FEEL PLEASANT AND RELAXED.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.600
WHEREAS I FELT ECSTATIC,
I JUST FELT TRULY ECSTATIC.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.830
IT'S A EUPHORIC, YOU KNOW,
IT... ALL PROBLEMS DISAPPEAR

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.200
AND YOU JUST...
YOU FEEL VERY PHYSICALLY GOOD.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.230
YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOUR...

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.630
YOUR THINKING ABILITY
IS HEIGHTENED SOMEWHAT

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.770
THOUGH OFTENTIMES IT'S NOT.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.630
IT WAS JUST
A GENERAL FEELING OF WELL-BEING.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.130
I SOON WAS, YOU KNOW,
IN A VERY GLAMOROUS WORLD.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.670
I WAS SELLING TO CELEBRITIES.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.600
I WAS GETTING
BEHIND THE VELVET ROPES

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.830
AT THE EXCLUSIVE
NIGHTCLUBS OF THE '80s.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.930
I WAS SELLING ON WALL STREET,
ON FIFTH AVENUE, AT COLUMBIA.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.000
YOU WEREN'T
SELLING

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
TO THE DOWN-AND-OUT
ON THE STREET.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.370
YOU WERE
SELLING TO...

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.230
IT WAS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL
"NICE MIDDLE-CLASS PEOPLE."

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.000
ONCE YOU DECIDE YOU'D LIKE
TO HAVE SOME OR DO SOME

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.330
THEN YOU HAVE TO GET IT.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.630
AND WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE TO GET IT

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.370
THEN YOU MAKE WHATEVER CONTACT
YOU HAVE TO MAKE TO GET IT

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.030
BUT OFTENTIMES IN THESE
RECREATIONAL DRUG THINGS

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.630
YOU DON'T GET IT RIGHT AWAY.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.570
THE PERSON
YOU CAN GET IT FROM SAYS

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.330
"WELL, I HAVE TO CALL SO-AND-SO

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.870
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW,"
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.630
YOU'RE WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.470
AND YOU BECOME MORE
DESIRING OF IT, YOU CAN'T WAIT.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.870
IT TAKES OVER YOUR MIND.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.470
YOU'RE NOT EVEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.470
WHEN YOU GET IT
AND HOW YOU'LL FEEL.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.630
YOU'RE JUST THINKING
ABOUT GETTING IT:

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.700
"I GOT TO HAVE IT,
I GOT TO HAVE IT!"

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.230
DURING A DRINKING SESSION...

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.630
ALL RIGHT, IF YOU WERE TO BRING
IN A TRAY OF ECLAIRS RIGHT NOW--

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.600
I'M QUITE FOND
OF CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS--

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.500
AND SAID, "WE'VE GOT LOTS
OF THEM, DAN, HELP YOURSELF.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.900
HAVE AS MANY AS YOU WANT."

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.030
I'D CERTAINLY HAVE
AT LEAST TWO ECLAIRS.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.770
I MIGHT EVEN HAVE THREE OR FOUR.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.030
I LIKE ECLAIRS,
BUT I WOULD GET TO A POINT

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.370
WHERE I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER CHOCOLATE ECLAIR.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.830
I'VE HAD ENOUGH, THANK YOU.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.470
WHEREAS THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN
WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.800
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.970
I COULD BE BOMBED OUT OF
MY SKULL AND I HAVE TO CONTINUE.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.300
AND THEN, OF COURSE, YOU WAKE UP
WITH A HANGOVER THE NEXT DAY

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:10.630
AND THE ONLY CURE FOR A HANGOVER
THAT REALLY WORKS IS ALCOHOL

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.270
AND SO THAT, YOU KNOW,
THE CYCLE CONTINUES.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.430
EVEN THOUGH IN THE MORNING YOU
SAY, "I'M NOT GOING TO DRINK"

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.270
THEN YOU SEEM TO HIT IT
LIKE A BLIND SPOT IN YOUR BRAIN

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:25.730
WHERE YOU GO ON AUTOMATIC AND
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT DRINK.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.230
EVERYTHING ELSE SORT OF...
SORT OF FAILS.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.370
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT DRINK.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.030
YOU HIT... YOU HIT
A BLANK SPOT OR SOMETHING

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.970
AND YOU'RE
NOT THINKING ANYMORE:

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.770
"WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS, WHAT ABOUT
THE MARRIAGE, WHAT ABOUT...?"

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.900
YOU KNOW, "I HAVE TO BE UP
IN THE MORNING AT 6:30."

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.000
YOU JUST HIT THIS BLANK SPOT
AND YOU GO TO THE REFRIGERATOR

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.630
YOU OPEN IT AND YOU PULL OUT
THAT BOTTLE OF WINE.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.330
I WOULD DO A LOT OF COCAINE

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.570
AND I WOULD BE TOO HIGH,
TOO AGITATED, TOO EXCITED.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.030
I'D DRINK A LOT

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.800
AND IT WOULD BRING ME
BACK DOWN A LITTLE BIT

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.570
TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.670
I'D WANT TO GO
BACK UP THERE AGAIN

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.030
AND THOSE ARE THE CYCLES
THAT YOU SEE MINUTE BY MINUTE

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.330
IN PEOPLE WHO USE COCAINE
AND ALCOHOL

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.900
AND THEY ARE VERY
COMMONLY USED TOGETHER.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.930
IF, FOR SOME VERY STRANGE REASON

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.300
YOU WANTED ME
TO HAVE A BEER RIGHT NOW

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.230
IT WOULD TAKE AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PERSUASION.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.070
I DOUBT YOU COULD GET ME
TO HAVE A BEER RIGHT NOW.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.600
BUT IF I WERE TO GIVE IN

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.900
I WOULD HAVE THE SECOND BEER
VERY, VERY QUICKLY.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.470
THE CRAVING FOR THE SECOND BEER

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:28.900
IS A LOT DIFFERENT THAN
THE CRAVING FOR THE FIRST.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.530
AND ONCE YOU'VE HAD A SECOND

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.230
A THIRD SEEMS LIKE
THE BEST IDEA IN THE WORLD

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.600
AND SO ON AND SO ON.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.170
AND THE IDEA OF STOPPING
AT THAT POINT SEEMS ABSURD.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.400
COCAINE IS A VERY TRICKY DRUG

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.930
BECAUSE COCAINE
IS NOT SATIATING.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.930
ONE HIT OF COKE MAKES YOU WANT
A HUNDRED HITS OF COKE.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:52.270
YOU KNOW, ONE HIT OF HEROIN
WILL DO YOU QUITE FINE

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.970
FOR FOUR OR SIX HOURS

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.800
BUT ONE HIT OF COKE AND
ALL YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IS MORE.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:04.000
INJECTING DRUGS IS
A VERY, VERY STRONG SENSATION.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.670
IT'S SOMETHING...

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:09.330
IT'S SO STRONG THAT MONTHS
AFTER I HAD STOPPED

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:13.670
I FOUND MYSELF ON OCCASION
WITNESSING SOMEONE INJECT DRUGS

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.900
AND I ACTUALLY GOT
THE PHYSICAL TASTE OF THE DRUG

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.600
IN THE BACK OF MY THROAT.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.670
JUST THE VISUAL STIMULUS
OF SEEING SOMEONE INJECT DRUGS

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.130
WAS ENOUGH TO TRIGGER
THAT KIND OF RESPONSE.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.270
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS
THROWING DOWN MARTINIS EITHER.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:32.430
I MEAN, I DRANK WHITE WINE,
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW...

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.100
THAT'S WHERE...

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.600
I DRANK AN APERITIF WINE FIRST

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.600
AND THEN I SWITCHED TO...
CHARDONNAY OR WHATEVER.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.270
AND THE NEXT DAY, I WOULD BE
APPALLED AT HOW MUCH WAS GONE.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.770
THERE WAS LIKE A HALF...
A HALF, UH...

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.500
THOSE... THEY HAD
HANDLES ON THEM

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.630
LIKE A HALF GALLON
OR WHATEVER THEY ARE.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.100
AND I WOULD BE AMAZED
THE NEXT MORNING

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.130
AT HOW MUCH I HAD... CONSUMED.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:58.430
I WASN'T SO ADDICTED THAT
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.170
BY THE AIR FORCE, OBVIOUSLY.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:04.000
AND THEN I BECAME A FULL-BLOWN
ADDICT IN THE AIR FORCE.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.230
HEROIN?

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.930
MORPHINE, MORPHINE.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.500
YEAH, IT WAS AVAILABLE
AT THE BASE IN THOSE DAYS.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.570
THEY'RE IN EVERY FACILITY--

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.500
ON ANY BASE,
THERE'S AN EMERGENCY PACK

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.670
IN CASE WAR BREAKS OUT.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.100
AND THESE ARE BOUND UP
BY METAL BANDS

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.100
SO THAT YOU CAN'T GET IN
UNLESS THERE'S A WAR

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.600
AND YOU NEED ALL OF
THAT EMERGENCY MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.370
SO I HELPED MYSELF TO EVERY
PACKAGE IN EVERY FACILITY

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.030
FOR FOUR YEARS.

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:36.470
IN ORDER FOR ME TO SIT HERE AND
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.800
I WOULD NEED TO HAVE HAD
A DRINK FIRST

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.230
JUST TO CALM ME DOWN,
BECAUSE AFTER A WHILE

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.800
PHYSICALLY YOU BEGIN
TO DEPEND ON IT.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.930
SO IF MY MIND...
MY MIND MAY BE TELLING ME

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.400
"WENDY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO DRINK."

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.870
BUT IF MY HANDS ARE SHAKING
AND IF I'M SWEATING

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.600
AND I'VE LEARNED THAT YOU TAKE
A DRINK AND THE SYMPTOMS GO AWAY

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.600
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.300
SO THAT GRADUALLY...
YOU LEARN THIS STUFF

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.200
THAT THIS IS HOW YOU MEDICATE
THE SYMPTOMS OF THIS DISEASE.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.170
I USE "DISEASE" NOW.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.600
BACK THEN, I HAD NO CLUE,
YOU KNOW.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.700
I JUST KNEW THAT IF I TOOK
A DRINK, I WAS ABLE TO MOVE ON.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.370
BUT THEN IT FOOLS YOU

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.930
BECAUSE YOU ONLY MEAN TO TAKE
THE ONE, BILL, YOU KNOW.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.530
YOU DON'T...

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.970
BUT THEN YOU TAKE THAT ONE,
AND-- BOOM!-- YOU WANT MORE.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.130
HEROIN IS AN INCREDIBLY
GOOD FEELING.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.670
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE
THAT PEOPLE USE IT, MISUSE IT

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.130
AND ABUSE IT
AND BECOME ADDICTED.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.600
IT'S AN ANALGESIC;
IT'S A PAINKILLER.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.800
AND SO IT ALSO KILLS EMOTIONAL
PAIN AS WELL AS PHYSICAL PAIN.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.300
I REMEMBER IT WAS
NEW YEAR'S DAY 1990

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.000
AND IT WAS A HORRIBLE
NEW YEAR'S, HORRIBLE CHRISTMAS

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.170
AND I HAD SOME CHEAP CHAMPAGNE
AND SOME FOOTBALL GAME WAS ON.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.300
I DON'T EVEN WATCH FOOTBALL,
BUT I WAS...

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.100
I'M ABOUT THREE GLASSES
OF CHAMPAGNE INTO IT--

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.370
AND, YOU KNOW, MY LIFE WAS
JUST AWFUL AT THAT POINT.

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.570
'89 AND '90, WHICH WAS TOWARD
THE END OF MY DRINKING

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.700
WERE BOTH REALLY,
REALLY BAD YEARS.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.900
AND I WAS ON MY THIRD GLASS
OF CHAMPAGNE OR SO

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.130
AND I TURNED TO MY FRIEND KEVIN

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.430
AND I SAID,
"THIS IS WHY I DRINK.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.030
MY LIFE IS JUST AWFUL RIGHT NOW,
BUT I FEEL GREAT."

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.830
AND I DID.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.230
AND I KNEW IT WAS DELUSIONAL,
BUT I WAS JUST HIGH.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.930
IT TOOK ME TO A PLACE WHERE
EVERYTHING FELT JUST FINE.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.300
I CAN STILL FEEL
THE WARM FEELING GOING DOWN

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.330
AND EVEN INTO YOUR FINGERS
AND JUST FEELING RELAXED--

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.830
YOU KNOW, THAT TERRIBLE INTENSE
TENSENESS WOULD DISSIPATE

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.830
AND YOU HAD ONE
OF THOSE EXPERIENCES.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.200
I LIKED THE EFFECTS.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.530
I LIKED IT.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.570
I LIKED IT, WHAT IT DID FOR ME

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:48.670
BECAUSE IT TOOK ME
FROM REALITY

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.170
AND PUT ME
WHEREVER I WANTED TO BE.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.170
I BECAME VERY CYNICAL

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.230
AND HAD A VERY DEPRESSIVE WAY
OF THINKING

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.900
LIKE I SORT OF... YOU KNOW,
THE VULGAR TERM WOULD BE

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.500
"LIFE SUCKS AND THEN YOU DIE."

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.370
I JUST HAD THIS WAY
OF VIEWING THE WORLD

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.170
THAT REALLY MADE ME
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.170
AND I KIND OF FELT THAT
IF LIFE WAS HORRIBLE AND SHORT

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.130
AND THEN YOU WERE GOING
TO DIE ANYWAY

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.670
WHY NOT HAVE ANESTHESIA?

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:24.500
I CAN CLEARLY REMEMBER MY USING
BECAUSE OF PAIN

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:29.070
AND MY USING BECAUSE I DIDN'T
KNOW WHERE TO GO WITH THE PAIN

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.330
OR WHAT TO DO WITH IT

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.270
AND MY LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO ESCAPE THE PAIN.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.670
AND IT WASN'T THAT I STARTED OUT
SEEKING PLEASURE.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.500
AND I CAN'T REALLY RECALL IT
BEING PLEASURABLE.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.700
SEE, I THINK THAT A LOT
OF PEOPLE DO DRUGS

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.330
BECAUSE IT ADDS DRAMA
TO THEIR LIVES.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.170
IT'S LIKE A SELF-DRAMATIZING
SITUATION

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.000
WHERE YOUR LIFE BECOMES MORE
INTERESTING IN YOUR OWN MIND

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.430
BECAUSE "I'VE GOT THIS PROBLEM

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.700
"AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT IT

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.500
"BUT I'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.530
"BECAUSE IF I DON'T DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.770
I'M GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE."

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.200
AND THERE'S A DRAMA.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.730
I NEVER DRANK IN THE MORNING,
I NEVER DRANK AT LUNCH.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.900
MY KIDS NEVER CAME HOME
AND FOUND ME DRUNK.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.500
I DIDN'T DRINK ALL DAY LONG.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.830
I DIDN'T DRINK TILL 6:00
OR 7:00 AT NIGHT.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.330
AND I WOULD SAY...

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.130
YOU'D READ ALL THOSE TESTS
IN MAGAZINES, YOU KNOW:

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.030
"IF YOU PASS OR FLUNK
SIX OF THESE

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.530
THEN YOU'RE AN ALCOHOLIC."

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.330
I WOULD TAKE THEM ALL THE TIME.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.330
AND MOST OF THEM SAID,
"DO YOU DRINK IN THE MORNING?"

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.900
OR "DO YOU DRINK AT LUNCH?"

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.370
AND I DIDN'T

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.170
SO I USED THAT FOR A LONG TIME

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.730
BUT THE NEXT DAY--
AS MY DRINKING PROGRESSED

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.800
THE NEXT DAY,
I WOULD FEEL HORRENDOUS

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.330
SO YOU WIND UP...
IT CONTROLLED MY LIFE ANYWAY

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.570
BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING AT THE
CLOCK FOR HALF THE AFTERNOON.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.370
I FELT I HAD LOST CONTROL
OVER IT

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.200
THAT I COULDN'T MAKE IT
THROUGH THE DAY

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.530
WITHOUT SOME COCAINE.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.630
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS
WHAT MY DAY WAS ABOUT

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.200
WAS ACQUIRING AND USING COCAINE.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.600
WHEN I CAME BACK
FROM THE AIR FORCE

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.970
AND REMEMBER
THAT THE AIR FORCE--

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.100
THE MILITARY STRUCTURE
THAT'S OPERANT THERE--

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:10.270
CONTAINED ME FROM ACTING OUT,
FROM BEING OUT OF CONTROL.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.400
IT PROVIDED
EXTERNAL CONTROLS FOR ME

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.270
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE INTERNALLY.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.200
LEAVING THAT AND COMING BACK
TO SOCIETY WAS CULTURE SHOCK

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.230
AND I DIDN'T NEGOTIATE THAT
CULTURE, THAT SHOCK, VERY WELL.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:30.700
UH... I BEGAN SELLING DRUGS
ON A WIDE SCALE

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.530
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN MY HABIT.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.800
AND THAT DIDN'T...

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.930
I WASN'T SUCCESSFUL FOR LONG

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.530
BECAUSE THE DRUG CULTURE, UNLIKE
THE LARGER SOCIETY'S CULTURE

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.700
IS A CULTURE WHERE
YOU START OFF AT THE TOP

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.330
AND YOU QUICKLY GO
TO THE BOTTOM

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.630
WHERE, IN SOCIETY,
YOU START OFF AT THE BOTTOM

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.030
AND YOU WORK YOUR WAY UP.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.970
SO I WORKED MY WAY DOWN QUICKLY,
IN LESS THAN A YEAR.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.530
EVERYBODY AROUND ME DRANK,
AND NOBODY ELSE WAS WORKING.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.770
IT WAS THE LIFESTYLE FOR ME.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.930
BUT I GUESS WHEN I STARTED
HAVING BLACKOUTS

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.770
WHEN I STARTED HAVING
THOSE EXPERIENCES

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:13.430
WHERE I COULDN'T REMEMBER
HOW I GOT HOME OR WHERE I WAS

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.100
OR THINGS LIKE THAT

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.830
SOMETHING STARTED GOING OFF
IN ME THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.170
I GOT PRETTY DRUNK

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.270
AND RAN OUT IN THE RAIN
IN MY UNDERWEAR--

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.730
UNDERWEAR HAPPENED TO BE RED;

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:26.700
THAT FIGURES
INTO THE STORY LATER--

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.930
AND WAS JUST SHOUTING,
HOOTING AND HOLLERING

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.570
NOTHING BIG,
NOT THAT BIG A DEAL

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.930
BUT MY DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.600
DIDN'T PARTICULARLY
APPRECIATE IT

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.070
AND SHE CALLED THE COPS,
AND THE COPS SHOWED UP

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.070
AND I HAD TO SHOW UP
IN COURT THE FOLLOWING WEEK.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.800
AND THE JUDGE IS READING
THE LITTLE DOCUMENT

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.230
AND SAYS, "YOU WERE OUTSIDE
IN THE RAIN

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.870
IN YOUR...<i> RED</i> UNDERWEAR!"

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.670
HE WAS APPARENTLY JUST APPALLED
THAT MY UNDERWEAR WAS RED.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.970
BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A SIGN.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.230
IF THE COPS ARE SHOWING UP,
THAT'S PROBABLY A SIGN.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.630
I THINK THE TIME
IT REALLY HIT HOME WAS

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.300
WHEN I HAD BEGUN INJECTING IT

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:06.630
AND I FOUND MYSELF
CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:11.300
SEARCHING THE CARPET FOR
ONE MORE LITTLE ROCK OF COCAINE.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.300
I MEAN, THIS LED ME
THROUGH SOME BOUTS WITH PRISON.

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.800
I MEAN, I BECAME A THIEF

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:24.400
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A HABIT
THAT WAS REALLY EXPENSIVE.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.070
THERE WAS NO JOB YOU CAN HAVE

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.170
THAT COULD SUPPORT
A SPEEDBALL HABIT.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.570
I MEAN, YOU EITHER HAVE TO HAVE
OLD WEALTH

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.900
OR YOU HAVE TO TAKE MONEY
WHERE IT LIES.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.570
AND SO THIS LED ME TO...

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:38.970
I MEAN, THERE WERE PERIODS
THAT I SPENT ALONE

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.630
WHERE I WAS JUST LIVING
ON THE FRINGES OF SOCIETY

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.130
IF I WAS LIVING AT ALL.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.730
I LIVED IN A NICE HOUSE,
I HAD A BUNCH OF CARS

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.230
MY KIDS WERE IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS,
YOU KNOW, I LOOKED ALL RIGHT.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.400
WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.400
THE PROBLEM WAS I WAS DYING.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.300
YOU KNOW, I WAS DYING.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.570
18 YEARS LATER AND A MARRIAGE
AND AN ABANDONMENT

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.470
AND ESTRANGEMENT FROM MY SON
AND A ZILLION OTHER THINGS

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.300
ALSO THREE CAREERS--

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.800
I'D HAD PERIODS
OF INTERMITTENT ABSTINENCE--

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.330
UM... THREE CAREERS

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:17.670
WHERE I JUST WAS ABOUT TO MOVE
OVER THE HUMP, SO TO SPEAK

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.730
INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY
OF SUCCESS

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.870
I WOULD ALWAYS FALL
INTO ADDICTION AGAIN.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.900
THEN THERE WAS A POINT--

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.770
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY
WHEN IT HAPPENED

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.900
I JUST REMEMBER
THAT IT HAPPENED--

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.070
THERE WAS A POINT
WHEN I WOULD DO IT EVERY DAY.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:38.100
I WOULD HAVE IT AND I WOULD
COMPULSIVELY DO IT EVERY DAY

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.600
EVEN THOUGH
I DIDN'T REALLY ENJOY IT

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.270
WHICH SOUNDS VERY STRANGE

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.930
BUT NEVERTHELESS,
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.700
I USED COCAINE
FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.600
NEVER MISSED A WEEKEND
IN TEN YEARS

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.770
NEVER MISSED FRIDAY,
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.170
BINGES OF COCAINE USE
FOR TEN YEARS.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:02.500
WHAT WERE YOU LIKE
IN THOSE BINGES?

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.670
VIOLENT.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.330
I MEAN, YOU BEGIN...

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.200
THIS BEGINS OVER TIME.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.000
YOU BEGIN GREGARIOUS,
INTERESTING, VERY SOCIAL

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.330
AND YOU END UP...

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:19.270
YOU END UP PARANOID,
ANGRY, UH...

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.200
ASSAULTIVE, OUT OF CONTROL.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.470
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THE MOMENT
I GOT ARRESTED

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.130
FOR A VERY BRIEF MOMENT,
I FELT THIS SENSE OF RELIEF

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:30.630
BECAUSE I WAS LIKE

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.600
"OH, THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN
HAS HAPPENED, IT'S OVER."

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.400
AND, YOU KNOW, THEN, YOU KNOW,
BEING IN JAIL WAS TERRIFYING

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.470
BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
THE MOMENT I GOT OUT

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.570
I WENT BACK TO MY APARTMENT
AND I FOUND SOME DRUGS

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:46.600
THAT I KNEW THE COPS
HADN'T FOUND

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.430
AND I KNEW WHERE THEY WERE,
AND I WENT AND I GOT THEM

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.600
AND I INJECTED THEM AND...

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.100
I MEAN, NOW,
HOW IRRATIONAL CAN YOU GET?

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.100
YOU'VE JUST BEEN ARRESTED
FOR THIS STUFF

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.700
AND THEN WHAT DO YOU DO,
BUT AS SOON AS YOU GO HOME

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.030
YOU DO THIS?

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:07.000
I DIDN'T GO DANCE
ON TOP OF A BAR SOMEWHERE.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.430
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T GRAB
OTHER PEOPLE'S HUSBANDS.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:10.830
I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.070
WHICH SUPPOSEDLY I THOUGHT
WERE THE "HALLMARKS."

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.700
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT YOU DID.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.070
I DIDN'T DO ANY OF THAT.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.930
I WAS SO BORING, JUST DAY
AFTER DAY OF FEELING...

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.030
LIKE A PIECE OF JUNK.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.600
IT'S A HELL.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.370
IT'S REALLY...

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:30.270
YOUR LIFE BECOMES ABOUT WHERE
AM I GOING TO GET THE NEXT DOSE?

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:33.270
YOU'RE DISCONNECTED
FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.000
YOUR EMOTIONS ARE DULLED

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.970
TO THE POINT OF
ALMOST BEING NONEXISTENT.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.670
THERE'S NO LIFE,
THERE'S NO LIFE.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.570
THERE'S NO SOUL,
THERE'S NO SPIRIT LEFT IN YOU.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:51.300
I COULDN'T IMAGINE A LIFE
THAT I WOULD BE HAPPY IN.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.630
I COULDN'T IMAGINE LIFE
WORKING OUT IN ANY KIND OF WAY

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.370
TO ACCOMMODATE ME.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:02.030
UM...

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.200
YOU KNOW, WHAT I WOULD
LIKE TO DO...

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.530
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO DO IF
I COULD IS GET A PLACE TO LIVE

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.700
AND GET AN UNLIMITED SUPPLY
OF ALCOHOL

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.500
AND JUST CONTINUE
TO DRINK AND DRINK.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.270
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE
IF THAT HAD BEEN OFFERED TO ME

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.930
IF SOME ECCENTRIC
MILLIONAIRE SAID

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.030
"ALL RIGHT, IF YOU'D LIKE,
I'LL PROVIDE YOU

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.870
"WITH AN APARTMENT AND ENOUGH
FOOD TO KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.370
AND ALL THE ALCOHOL YOU WANT."

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.130
"THANK YOU," YOU KNOW,
"THAT'S FINE.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.800
THAT'S FINE, I'LL JUST DO THAT."

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.170
I WAS IN
A RELATIONSHIP THEN, UH...

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.470
WITH A LOVELY WOMAN
WHO I PUT THROUGH MUCH SUFFERING

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.630
BECAUSE OF MY ESCALATING
ADDICTION OVER THE YEARS

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.130
AND BINGEING

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.530
AND SHE WAS BECOMING

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.330
BOTH PSYCHOLOGICALLY
AND PHYSICALLY SICK

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.570
AND, UH, SHE LEFT ME.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:51.430
SHE WAS SMART ENOUGH
AND WISE ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:56.230
AND, UH, A WOMAN WHO I CARED FOR
AND LOVED VERY MUCH

00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.270
AND YET SHE PLAYED A...
SHE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.600
SHE...

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.970
SHE... SHE WOULD...

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.370
KEEP ME IN SOME WAYS

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.900
ONLY... ONLY ADDICTED

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.030
THOSE THURSDAYS, FRIDAYS,
SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS.

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:17.470
I WOULDN'T GO BEYOND THAT

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.730
BECAUSE SHE WOULD
COMPLAIN AND HARASS ME

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.330
AND SO THAT WAS
THE EXTERNAL CONTROL

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.830
THAT KEPT ME
FROM USING EVEN MORE.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.570
SHE FINALLY ENDED UP LEAVING.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:34.270
UH, AND EVEN WHEN I LOVED HER
VERY PASSIONATELY

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.670
AND WOULD MISS HER

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.700
I REMEMBER MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS,
"WHEW, GLAD SHE'S GONE.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.100
"YOU KNOW, NOW I CAN
REALLY STRETCH OUT HERE

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:43.530
AND ENJOY MYSELF."

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.070
IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING
TO DISCOVER

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.230
THAT I ACTUALLY HAD
AN ADDICTION

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.870
AND STARTED
IMMEDIATELY TRYING TO, UH...

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.570
TO WITHDRAW FROM IT
AND GET AWAY FROM IT.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.800
WHAT DID
YOU DO?

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.070
I TRIED...
WELL, A COUPLE OF TIMES

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.670
I TRIED JUST COLD WITHDRAWAL
WITH SOMEBODY HELPING ME

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.830
AND I FOUND BEFORE TOO LONG I
WAS ENTIRELY TOO WEAK FOR THAT.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.130
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:12.630
THE STAMINA AND
THE MORAL CONVICTION FOR THAT.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.370
EVERY SINGLE DAY I WOULD WAKE UP

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:18.430
AND I'D SAY,
"TODAY'S THE DAY I STOP"

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.470
AND BY 3:00 OR 4:00
EVERY SINGLE DAY

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.100
I KNEW THAT I WOULD, UH...

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.670
I KNEW THAT I'D HAVE
TO DRINK THAT NIGHT.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.730
AND THEN I'D SAY, "WELL,
I'M GOING TO STOP AT TWO

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:29.830
OR STOP AT THREE."

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.930
AND I WENT TO MASS EVERY MORNING

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.930
AND I WOULD PRAY THAT
I COULD STOP AT THREE DRINKS

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.670
WHICH IN FACT I DID,
BUT THEY WERE IN VATS.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.200
(<i> Moyers laughs</i> )

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.930
I MEAN, MY SITUATION WAS UNUSUAL
IN THAT I WAS A POLICE OFFICER.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.430
I WASN'T, UM, SOMEONE

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.030
WHO WAS JUST STRUGGLING
AGAINST AN ADDICTION.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.230
I WAS IN THIS... THIS WORLD

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.030
WHERE I WOULD LOSE
MY JOB IMMEDIATELY

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:56.230
AND MIGHT GO TO PRISON IF
I ADMITTED WHAT I WAS DOING.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.300
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT,
I REALIZED...

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.330
IN THE LAST INVESTIGATION
I WAS DOING

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.100
THAT... THAT I WAS STRUNG OUT

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.000
AND I FEARED THAT MY PARTNER
WAS KILLING HIMSELF.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.070
USING?

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.130
YES.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:09.830
YOU KNEW HE WAS
ADDICTED, TOO?

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.000
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.330
AND YOU
WERE ADDICTED?

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.400
YES, AND I WENT TO THE SERGEANT

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.700
AND SAID,
"WE'VE GOT DRUG PROBLEMS"

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.800
AND THEY PUT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL
FOR A FEW DAYS

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.400
AND HE GOT BACK OUT AND
THEY SAID, "GO BUY MORE DRUGS."

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.630
THEY WANTED CASES,
THEY WANTED NUMBERS.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.130
THEY DIDN'T CARE

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:30.330
THAT THEIR NARCOTICS OPERATIVES
WERE STRUNG OUT ON DRUGS.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:31.370
IT DIDN'T MATTER.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.300
I WAS IN A BATTLE FOR MY LIFE

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:37.530
WITH THIS THING
CALLED ALCOHOLISM.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.600
AND...

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.630
MY ALCOHOL TOLD ME,
"CUT YOUR FACE."

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.330
I WENT TO A MIRROR,
I WAS LIVING IN BROOKLYN

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:52.070
AND I TOOK A RAZOR BLADE
AND I CUT ONE SIDE OF MY FACE.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.300
I CUT THIS SIDE,
AND I STOOD THERE

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.200
AND I REMEMBER THIS VIVIDLY.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.170
I WASN'T IN A BLACKOUT.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.030
UM, AND THEN IT TOLD ME,
"CUT THE OTHER SIDE"

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.670
SO I DID THAT AS WELL.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:06.270
I HAD A GUN IN MY POCKET

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.130
AND OBVIOUSLY I WAS LOOKING
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAD DRUGS

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:12.070
AND THERE'S NO ONE OUT
AT THAT KIND OF... KIND OF TIME

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.030
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING,
IN THE SOUTH BRONX AGAIN

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.970
AND, UH... AND I'M 25.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:22.000
AND JUST REALIZING,
"I'M GOING TO BE LIKE THIS

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.700
"FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE--

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.000
THIS IS WHAT I'M
GOING TO BE LIKE."

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.570
I'M TALKING ABOUT 1968,
PROBABLY... '67, '68

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:37.270
WHERE THE AXIOM, CLICHE, "ONCE
AN ADDICT, ALWAYS AN ADDICT"

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.800
WAS VERY MUCH AN ACCEPTED ONE.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.870
AND THAT'S FRIGHTENING TO THINK
I'M ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.230
I'M GOING TO LOSE ALL MY TEETH,
I'M GOING TO LOSE AN EYE.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.100
I'M GOING TO SUFFER
AND I'M GOING TO BE MISERABLE

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.900
WALKING AROUND THE STREETS LIKE
THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.230
ZERO DEGREES, WALKING AROUND
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO ROB.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:02.570
I THINK... THE THOUGHTS WERE,
"I SHOULD KILL MYSELF.

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:07.030
WHY WOULD I WANT TO LIVE
LIKE THIS 20, 30 MORE YEARS?"

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.500
I KEPT BUYING DRUGS.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.970
EVENTUALLY, MY PARTNER
AND I WOUND UP GETTING SHOT

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.830
AND I LEFT THE DEPARTMENT.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.370
GETTING SHOT WAS, UM...

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.930
WAS A FORM OF DEATH

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.370
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:26.100
AND I RELIED ON PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS VERY HEAVILY

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.230
FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.030
INSTEAD OF DEALING
WITH THE TERROR.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.230
I WANTED TO DIE.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.900
I REMEMBER THINKING AT POINTS

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.200
"I'M JUST GOING TO RAISE THESE
CHILDREN AND THEN I'LL DIE."

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.500
AND I THINK, REALLY,
INITIALLY I GOT SOBER

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.530
JUST BECAUSE-- I SMOKED
MY HEAD OFF AT THAT POINT--

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:43.930
I WOULD SMOKE IN BED

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.700
AND I WAS AFRAID THE HOUSE
WAS GOING TO BURN DOWN

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.030
AND I WOULD...

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.500
YOU KNOW, THE KIDS
WOULD BE BURNED TO DEATH.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.930
SO I KNEW THAT, UM...

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.830
THAT I WANTED... I WANTED...
I LOVE THESE CHILDREN

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.630
AND THAT'S WHAT DID IT.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.830
ONE DAY I WAS SITTING
IN MY APARTMENT

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.400
AND I RECOGNIZED THAT, UH...

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.330
A) I WAS LIVING
IN A FILTHY MESS

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.030
THAT, UH, WAS ALMOST
INDESCRIBABLE IN THE STENCH.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.270
IT HAD BLOOD ON THE CEILING,
THERE WERE DIRTY WINE BOTTLES

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:13.070
THERE WERE DIRTY NEEDLES,
THERE WAS DIRTY LAUNDRY.

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:14.270
IT WAS JUST HORRIBLE.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.070
AND I WAS SITTING IN THIS PLACE

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:17.930
AND I WAS BEGGING
A MAN I DESPISED

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.070
AND THOUGHT WAS
REALLY STUPID AND UGLY

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.530
AND WOULD NEVER IMAGINE
MYSELF SLEEPING WITH

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.370
BUT I WAS BEGGING HIM
FOR HEROIN.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:25.900
AND I JUST...

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.200
I JUST KNEW THAT I WAS ABOUT
TO VIOLATE ALL OF MY PRINCIPLES

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:30.770
IN ORDER TO GET DRUGS

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.900
AND I KNEW THAT THAT WAS THE
HALLMARK OF AN ADDICT FOR ME.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.400
IT'S THE INSANITY THAT HAPPENS

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.830
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE THROES
OF THIS DISEASE.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.300
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE ASK YOU

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.230
"WHY DO YOU DRINK, WENDY?"

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.900
YOU GET ANGRY
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:54.030
I, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
KNOW MYSELF WHY, UM...

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.370
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.830
GOD, I DIDN'T WANT
THOSE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.970
I DIDN'T WANT TO CUT MYSELF UP.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.170
I DIDN'T WANT
TO JUMP OUT WINDOWS.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.300
I DIDN'T WANT
TO END UP IN PLACES

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.570
WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW I GOT THERE

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:10.330
WITH PEOPLE WHO
I DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:11.600
I DIDN'T WANT THAT.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.730
I WANTED A LIFE LIKE,
YOU KNOW...

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.800
WHEN I CAME OUT OF MY MAMA'S
WOMB, I DIDN'T SAY

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.770
"WHEN I GROW UP I WANT TO BE
A DRUNK, I WANT TO BE A TRAMP."

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.770
I DIDN'T SAY THAT

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:28.000
AND I DIDN'T WANT THAT, BUT...
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.130
I WOULD SOMETIMES LOOK AT ALL
THE TIGHT SPOTS I'D BEEN INTO

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.730
AND EVERY TIME I WALKED

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.800
INTO A HALLWAY OR INTO A BAR
OR WHEREVER TO... TO BUY DRUGS

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.270
I COULD'VE DIED RIGHT THERE.

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.500
EVERY TIME I MIXED UP
SOME POTION SOMEWHERE

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.500
AND INJECTED IT INTO MYSELF,
I COULD'VE DIED RIGHT THERE.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.070
CERTAINLY I'VE BEEN PRESENT

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.430
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE, UH,
JUST UNEXPLAINABLY...

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:51.600
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE INJECTING
AN UNKNOWN SUBSTANCE

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.830
THAT'S PRODUCED
WITHOUT CONTROLS.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.400
AND OF COURSE THE THINGS
THAT I DID TO GET MONEY--

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.900
SOME OF THEM WERE JUST
INCREDIBLE, UNBELIEVABLE.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.200
SOMETIMES IT WOULD MAKE ME
SWEAT AND CRINGE

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.900
JUST TO THINK OF SOME OF
THE THINGS THAT I HAD DONE.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.630
I DEFINITELY LOST POWER

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:09.000
OVER MY OWN FACULTIES
AT SOME POINT, YOU KNOW

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.530
IN TERMS OF THINGS
THAT I WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:16.670
SOMEBODY SAID THAT
DREAMS IS... FOR AN ADDICT

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.900
IS DRUGS ENDS ALL DREAMS.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.100
YOU KNOW, DEAD ACTUALLY.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.600
AND I FELT A LOT OF MY DREAMS
HAD DIED, YOU KNOW.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.370
WHEN I TESTED IN 1986 FOR H.I.V.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:32.300
AND PRIMARILY POSSIBLY DUE TO
MY ADDICTION, DUE TO MY USE...

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.770
NEEDLES?

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.130
UH, I WAS AN INTRAVENOUS
DRUG USER PRIMARILY

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.330
AND THEN I BEGAN TO USE
DIFFERENT DRUGS--

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:41.570
EXPERIMENTING WITH DIFFERENT
DRUGS, MIXING DIFFERENT DRUGS.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.970
UM... AND I HAD GOTTEN SICK

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:48.330
AND I WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT
OF HEALTH FOR TESTING

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.100
AND I TESTED POSITIVE.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.030
AT THE TIME, I WAS ON HEROIN

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.670
AND SO I DIDN'T REALLY
FEEL THE RESULT.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.870
I PROBABLY GOT MYSELF ARRESTED.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.730
I GOT MYSELF ARRESTED.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:04.230
I'M SAYING ON SOME LEVEL
I THINK THAT IT WAS A CHOICE

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.670
AND, UH... AND SOME
WISE JUDGE GAVE ME...

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:11.600
GAVE ME OPTIONS:
GO TO JAIL OR GO TO TREATMENT.

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.870
AND YOU CHOSE?

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.470
AND I CHOSE TREATMENT.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.700
MY ROOMMATES HAD A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE IN THE FRIDGE

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.600
AND I RAN OUT OF MY ALCOHOL
SUPPLY AND I'M, LIKE

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.900
"I GOT TO BUY
THAT CHAMPAGNE OFF YOU.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.430
YOU GUYS GOT TO SELL
THAT CHAMPAGNE OFF YOU."

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.800
AND MY ROOMMATE SAID, "YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO STOP SOMETIME."

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.330
AND HE WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:34.000
YOU DON'T THINK IN THOSE TERMS

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.100
BUT EVENTUALLY THIS BINGE
WOULD HAVE TO COME TO AN END.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.570
AND, UH... I DECIDED
TO END IT FOR GOOD THEN.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.300
THAT WAS... ENDED UP BEING
THE LAST DRINK I HAD.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.430
ON YOUR OWN?

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:46.070
YOU JUST
STOPPED?

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:50.030
OH, I CHECKED INTO A MENTAL
HEALTH FACILITY THE NEXT DAY.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.430
Wendy:
HER NAME IS GENEVA S.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.630
I USED TO DRINK WITH HER

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.800
AND, UH, RUN UP AND DOWN
THE STREET WITH HER.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.430
AND I NOTICED FOR TWO YEARS I
NEVER SAW HER ANYMORE TOO MUCH.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.130
YOU KNOW, SHE JUST KIND OF...

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:10.800
I MEAN, I USED TO WATCH
THIS WOMAN HALLUCINATE

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.170
UP AND DOWN THE STREET.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:17.670
BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
SHE WAS GONE, AND...

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.700
COME TO FIND OUT, SHE HAD WENT
INTO ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.800
HAD BEEN IN ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.030
A.A.?

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.130
YEAH.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.830
I REMEMBER HER COMING TO...

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.200
I WAS WORKING IN
A GROCERY STORE THEN.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.070
AND I REMEMBER HER
COMING IN THE GROCERY STORE

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.800
AND BY NOW I HAD HEARD THAT,
YOU KNOW, SHE'S AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.130
WELL, I WAS 26 YEARS OLD
AT THE TIME

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.370
SO OF COURSE, I DIDN'T
SEE MYSELF AS AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.370
I WAS MUCH TOO YOUNG FOR THAT.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.930
I MEAN, TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC, YOU
HAD TO DRINK A LONG, LONG TIME.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.330
THAT WAS WHAT I THOUGHT.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.770
SO I REMEMBER WHEN SHE
CAME UP TO THE COUNTER.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.830
I WAS BEING FACETIOUS
IN MY OWN NASTY WAY

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:59.700
AND I SAID, "GENEVA, DO
YOU THINK I'M AN ALCOHOLIC?"

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.830
YOU KNOW,
NOT REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.600
AND SHE LOOKED AT ME, AND SHE
WAS VERY SERIOUS AND SHE SAID

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:09.230
"WENDY, I CAN'T CALL
YOU AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.830
ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT."

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.000
I SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M 26, SO..."

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.030
AND I DIDN'T GIVE IT
ANOTHER THOUGHT, UM...

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:19.100
UNTIL ONE DAY

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.230
GOD...

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.970
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY, OKAY

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.730
AND I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
IF I GO DOWN TO GENEVA'S HOUSE

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.400
AND TELL GENEVA I NEED TWO
DOLLARS TO GET ME A BOTTLE

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.630
BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO TELL HER I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:37.330
SO I GET DOWN THERE AND
OF COURSE GENEVA'S ON HER...

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.770
SHE WAS VERY ACTIVE
IN THE PROGRAM

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.230
SO SHE WAS ON HER WAY
TO AN INSTITUTIONS MEETING.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.400
AND I NEVER FORGET IT.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.330
I HAD A BANDANNA AROUND MY HEAD,
BECAUSE, SEE, IN MY ADDICTION

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.230
ME AND SOAP AND WATER
WEREN'T FRIENDS AT ALL.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.770
I HAD NO TIME FOR THAT.

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.470
I REALLY HAD NO TIME FOR IT.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.970
UM, SO I HAD ON
A BANDANNA ON MY HEAD

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.570
AND I HAD ON A PAIR OF
ORANGE SHORTS THAT WAS...

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.470
I DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN USE THIS WORD

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.770
BUT THEY WERE VERY FUNKY,
OKAY, BECAUSE...

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.400
FUNKY?

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.100
VERY FUNKY.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:13.770
SO SHE ASKED ME IF I
WANTED TO GO WITH HER

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:15.630
TO THIS INSTITUTION MEETING

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.830
AND I'M STILL GOT
IN THE BACK OF MY MIND

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.600
I WANT TO GET THESE TWO DOLLARS

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.930
SO YEAH, I'M GOING
TO FOLLOW HER WHEREVER.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.900
SO... YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT SHE
WAS GOING IN A CAR OR SOMETHING

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.570
BUT SHE TOOK...
SHE WENT ON A PUBLIC BUS.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.070
A PUBLIC BUS.

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.600
AND I SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.330
"SHE'S PROBABLY GOING TO
SIT WAY AT THE OTHER END

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.200
AND LET ME BE WAY UP HERE,"
BECAUSE I WAS HORRIBLE.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.670
BUT SHE DIDN'T, BILL.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.870
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE DID?

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.200
SHE SAT DOWN NEXT TO ME.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.930
YOU KNOW, SHE REALLY SAT DOWN.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.530
AND I WAS LOOKING LIKE THAT.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.100
AND SHE TALKED TO ME.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.570
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY ON THE BUS
KNEW THAT SHE WAS TALKING TO ME.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.230
WHAT WAS
SHE SAYING?

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.670
ABOUT THE PROGRAM, AND...

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.900
ABOUT A.A.?

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.300
UH-HUH.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.900
I MEAN, ALL
THESE YEARS LATER

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.230
YOU STILL
REMEMBER THAT.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:04.700
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN SOMETHING.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.370
BILL, IT WAS THE FIRST TIME...
YOU KNOW, YOU...

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:10.300
I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO
HAVE SEEN ME AND SMELLED ME

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.770
TO UNDERSTOOD--

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:16.330
TO HAVE SOMEBODY ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THEY KNOW YOU

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:21.370
ON A PUBLIC BUS,
WITH PEOPLE AROUND, LOOKING.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:22.800
NOBODY...

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.270
HAD DONE THAT
IN A LONG TIME FOR ME.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:32.430
WHEN PEOPLE START TREATMENT,
THEY LOOK LIKE HELL.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.700
THEY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF DICK
TRACY VILLAINS OR SOMETHING.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.530
I MEAN, EVERYBODY LOOKS GHASTLY.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.700
AND JUST A FEW WEEKS LATER,
THEY START LOOKING PRETTY GOOD.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.900
AND THAT'S... THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU SEE RIGHT ON THE SURFACE.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.870
PEOPLE... YOU SEE
A VERY DRAMATIC...

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.100
THAT'S ONE THING
THAT I DO LIKE ABOUT A.A.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.870
YOU SEE SOME POOR BASTARD
COME IN, YOU KNOW, SHAKING

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.470
AND "IT'S MY FIRST MEETING"
AND THEY LOOK<i> AWFUL.</i>

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:57.200
AND YOU MAY SEE THEM TWO MONTHS
LATER AND... LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.330
I WAS IN THE DETOX
FOR SEVEN DAYS.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.300
UM... IT WAS NOT FUN.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.370
YOU FEEL LIKE... SO VULNERABLE
AND SO UNCOMFORTABLE

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.330
AND YOU HAVE THIS DREADFUL FEAR

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:11.200
THAT YOUR SOURCE OF COMFORT IS
GOING TO BE FOREVER TAKEN AWAY.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.400
SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE VOMITING
AND THE SHAKING AND THE PUKING

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.470
AND THE DIARRHEA THAT GETS YOU

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.530
BUT JUST THE MENTAL ANGUISH
AND THE INSOMNIA

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:21.970
AND THE SENSE THAT...

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:25.200
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
COMFORTABLE IN THE WORLD.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.470
IT TOOK SOME TIME BEFORE
IT SUNK IN THAT, YOU KNOW

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.670
I HAVE THIS RESULT,
THIS DIAGNOSIS

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.000
AND WHAT AM I GOING
TO DO WITH THAT?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.170
UM...

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:36.930
THAT WAS AN AWAKENING.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:41.030
I THINK THERE WAS A NUMBER
OF AWAKENINGS THAT, UH...

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:44.500
JOLTED ME TO, LIKE,
SOME TYPE OF PERSONAL ACTION

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.030
SOME TYPE OF HOPE, PERHAPS

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:51.100
SOME TYPE OF... MAKE THIS NEXT
DETOX, GO TO THIS NEXT PROGRAM

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.630
THAT JUST DIDN'T
HAVE ME JUST LAY DOWN.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.630
I THINK THAT HAPPENED
FOR ME IN, UM... IN 1989

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.770
WHEN I CAME OUT OF MY LAST DETOX

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.970
AND I WENT TO A SOUP LINE,
BECAUSE I CAME OUT OF THE DETOX

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.500
I WAS LIVING IN AN ABANDONED
BUILDING IN HARLEM

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.700
AND I WONDERED,
"WELL, I'M NOT GOING BACK

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.200
"TO THE ABANDONED BUILDING.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.530
"WHERE AM I GOING?

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:12.300
WELL, I'M HUNGRY--
LET'S GO TO A SOUP LINE."

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.470
SO I WENT TO
AN EAST HARLEM SHELTER

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.470
AND FOUND MORE THAN JUST SOUP.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:21.430
I WENT IN AND GOT A CHANGE
OF UNDERWEAR AND A CLEAN SHIRT

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:25.630
AND... A PLACE TO BE STILL
AND SAFE FOR A WHILE

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.200
UH, TO DEVELOP
SOME REGULAR REGIMEN

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.170
OF GETTING UP AND DOING WORK
AND EATING REGULAR MEALS

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:36.030
AND SPENDING TIME PAYING
ATTENTION TO OTHER PEOPLE.

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.230
I WALKED INTO
THIS THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.170
AND PEOPLE OPENED
THEIR ARMS TO ME.

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.000
WHEN I SIT DOWN WITH A GROUP
OF MEN AND WOMEN

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.630
WHO BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT
"I'VE BEEN AFRAID ALL MY LIFE";

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.200
UH, "I'VE BEEN ANGRY WITH
MY MOTHER FOR A LOT OF YEARS";

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.500
UH, "I WAS RAPED
BY MY STEPFATHER"--

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.570
YOU KNOW, THESE... THESE
HURTFUL, PAINFUL THINGS

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.830
THAT PEOPLE HIDE--
WHEN YOU BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT IT

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.400
AND EVERYBODY IN THE GROUP SAYS,
"HAPPENED TO ME," YOU KNOW

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.730
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOU'RE NOT IN THIS ALONE

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.900
AND THAT'S VERY POWERFUL TO FEEL
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN THIS ALONE.

00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:12.130
I CAN'T EXPECT YOU
TO KNOW HOW I FELT.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.230
BUT HAD YOU BEEN AN ADDICT

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:18.830
OR, UH, YOU WOULD INSTANTLY KNOW
WHAT I TALK... WHAT I MEANT

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.770
WHEN I SAID I WAS TRASH.

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.300
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:25.300
MAYBE I BEHAVED LIKE IT,
BUT I WASN'T.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.770
BUT SOMEONE ELSE
THAT HAD BEEN... BEEN THERE

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:33.170
WOULD SAY INSTANTLY,
"I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING."

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.430
IT'S LIKE A.A., OR N.A.,
OR GAMBLERS ANONYMOUS

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.670
OR ANYTHING WHERE PEOPLE
ARE COMING TOGETHER.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.370
I THINK IT ALSO HAPPENS
LIKE WITH...

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.700
WHEN THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE
OR A NATIONAL DISASTER

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.370
AND PEOPLE JUST FORGET ABOUT
THEIR STATUS IN LIFE

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.000
STRATA IN LIFE, AND THEY JUST
BEGIN DIGGING PEOPLE OUT.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.370
FOR FOREVER, I'D BEEN FEELING
THAT I HAVE NO CHARACTER

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:59.130
I HAVE NO WILLPOWER,
UH, THAT I'M A BAD PERSON--

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:03.400
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT SOCIETY
AND ONE PLACES ON THEMSELVES

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.900
WHEN YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND ADDICTION.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.370
AND THEN TO REALIZE

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.770
THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:13.630
IT HAS TO DO WITH
A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.770
THAT IF I DON'T PICK UP
THAT DRINK, I'M OKAY.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:20.730
IT HELPED ME ENORMOUSLY
TO THINK THAT I HAD A DISEASE

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.530
THAT IT WASN'T JUST
A MORAL... FAILURE ON MY PART.

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:26.400
MY MIND NEEDED TRAINING.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.170
IT REALLY DID.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.700
IT WAS A WEAK MUSCLE
OR WHATEVER.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.170
AN ADDICTED
MUSCLE.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:35.230
YES, IT WAS AN ADDICTED MUSCLE.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.830
EXACTLY.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:42.730
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO...
TO, UM... MAKE IT A STRONG ONE.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:46.270
WHAT MADE IT
SO HARD TO STAY OFF?

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.430
OH, WELL, ONE REASON IS THAT
BY THE TIME YOU WANT TO QUIT

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.300
YOU'VE REALLY MESSED UP
YOUR LIFE.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.770
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.200
IT'S, YOU KNOW...
IT ALWAYS WORKS OUT THAT WAY.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.730
VERY FEW PEOPLE GO
INTO AN A.A. MEETING SAYING

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.270
"THINGS ARE GREAT, BUT I FIGURE,
YOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT GET BAD."

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:03.700
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE REALLY
MESSED UP YOUR LIFE.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.300
IT TOOK ME... IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO DEVELOP THE WILLPOWER

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.870
DEVELOP THE WILLPOWER OR...
OR... RECOGNIZE THAT THIS...

00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:12.930
IF I SNORTED THIS COCAINE

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:15.000
IT WAS NOT GOING
TO MAKE ME HAPPY

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.330
IT WAS NOT GOING
TO MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.400
IT WAS GOING
TO MAKE ME MISERABLE

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.900
AND IT WAS MOST LIKELY GOING
TO START ME ON... ON A RUN

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.000
OF JUST DOING MORE COCAINE.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.330
IT WAS... I REMEMBER ONCE

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.570
I WAS TALKING TO A THERAPIST
ABOUT A PROBLEM I WAS HAVING

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.730
AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
DRUGS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:36.700
IT WAS A... IT WAS
A PERSONAL PROBLEM

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.170
PROBABLY A RELATIONSHIP
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:42.100
AND I WAS BEING VERY COMPULSIVE
AND OBSESSIVE ABOUT IT

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.800
AND I FELT LIKE I COULDN'T STOP

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.570
AND SHE SAID TO ME,
"WELL, YOU CAN AND YOU MUST."

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.330
AND I SAID, "HOW?"

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:52.700
AND SHE SAID, "THE SAME WAY YOU
TAKE YOUR HAND OFF A HOT STOVE."

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:54.300
AND ACTUALLY THAT'S IT.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.970
IT... YOU JUST STOP.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.700
I WAS SAYING EARLIER HOW EARLY
RECOVERY IS REAL, REAL TOUGH.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.400
THAT'S, UH... IT'S SOMETHING
I REALIZED IS

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.600
WHY... WHY DO PEOPLE
ALWAYS RELAPSE?

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:06.670
BECAUSE IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:10.030
AND I THINK THE REASON IS,
AS DIFFICULT AS DRINKING IS

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.630
EARLY RECOVERY IN SOME WAYS
IS EVEN WORSE.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.670
BUT EVENTUALLY
YOU TURN A CORNER.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.300
AND IN MY CASE,
IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.470
ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS
INTO MY RECOVERY

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.070
I STARTED FEELING BETTER.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.030
I WOUND UP ENLISTING
IN THE AIR FORCE

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.470
WHICH I SUPPOSE WAS A...
A FORM OF TREATMENT.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.370
YOU KNOW, GETTING... GETTING UP
AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.970
AND RUNNING AND DOING PUSHUPS

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:32.400
AND THAT KIND OF THING
DURING BASIC TRAINING.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.900
I... THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.700
AND, UM... AND I THINK THAT GAVE
ME A BIT OF A... A GRIP.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.370
IT GOT ME BACK INTO
MY OLD PHYSICAL SELF

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:44.530
WHERE... YOU KNOW, I COULD... I
COULD START TO FEEL GOOD AGAIN

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.070
FEEL PHYSICALLY GOOD,
BECAUSE THE DRUGS RUN YOU DOWN

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.670
YOU KNOW, THEY RUN... RUN
YOUR BODY DOWN TERRIBLY.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:54.400
I USED TO SMOKE THREE PACKS
OF CIGARETTES A DAY

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.270
AND I JUST SMOKED ALL THE TIME.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.770
I SMOKED UNTIL...

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.470
I HAD RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS
WHEN I WAS SMOKING

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.030
AND I'D COUGH AND HAVE
A HARD TIME BREATHING

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:04.430
AND SO I STOPPED.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:06.870
AND I ONLY STOPPED
BECAUSE IT WAS... TO ME...

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:09.470
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW,
IT WAS EITHER STOP OR DIE.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.900
AND SO I PREFERRED
THE ALTERNATIVE OF LIVING

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.530
AND SO I STOPPED.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:18.600
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE ME WAKE
UP ONE DAY AND SAY, "THIS IS IT.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.630
I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER
MINUTE OF THIS."

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.300
BUT ONCE I GOT GOING
IN RECOVERY

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.430
I KNEW THAT I HAD TO PRAY.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:31.600
I KNEW THAT I HAD TO FIND, UM,
A GOD THAT I COULD BELIEVE IN.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.770
I KNEW THAT I... THAT
I COULDN'T DO IT ON MY OWN.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:42.400
AND, UM, I... BELIEVE THAT
THERE IS SOME SPIRIT WITHIN ME

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.800
THAT IS MY STRENGTH.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.730
THE POWER CAN BE...
WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.370
SO LONG AS IT AIN'T YOU.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.700
FOR ME, IT WAS GENEVA.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.230
SHE WAS MY POWER
GREATER THAN ME.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:00.730
SHE WAS MY GUIDING LIGHT.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:04.900
THEN IT BECAME MY A.A. MEETING
AND MY PEERS

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:07.270
AND MY SUPPORT IN THERE.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:08.830
AND EVENTUALLY

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:14.530
WHEN I GOT SOME OF THE SHAME
AND THE GUILT OUT OF MY LIFE

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:18.630
I WAS ABLE TO SAY
MY HIGHER POWER IS GOD.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:20.830
I MEAN, HOWEVER
A PERSON GETS THIS...

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.600
GETS IN TOUCH WITH,
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CHOICE

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.570
AND AN OPTION AND AN ALTERNATIVE

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:27.430
TO ME, THAT SPEAKS TO FREEDOM.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.000
AND THAT, TO ME, IS
WHAT RECOVERY IS ABOUT.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.070
RECOVERY'S ABOUT CHANGE
AND CHANGE IS ABOUT FREEDOM

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.630
YOU KNOW, HAVING FREEDOM.

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:36.270
YOU CAN PLAN YOUR DAY.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:40.270
WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING, YOU
CAN'T... YOUR DAY IS LIMITED.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.500
BANG, AT 6:00, I USED TO THINK

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:45.800
DON'T GET ON THE PHONE
AND DON'T DO WHATEVER.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.000
YOU'RE FREE, I MEAN,
IT'S ENORMOUS FREEDOM.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.130
AND, UM, THERE'S, THERE'S...
YOU ARE SO USED TO HIDING

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.030
HIDING HOW MUCH YOU DRINK

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.270
THAT BEING HONEST,
FIRST OF ALL WITH MYSELF--

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.430
I WAS TRYING TO KID MYSELF
ALL OF THE TIME.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:03.330
AND I DON'T HAVE SECRETS.

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:06.100
I DON'T EVER HAVE
TO BE A PHONY AGAIN.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.170
I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR MASKS.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.430
I, YOU KNOW... THIS IS WHO I AM.

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:14.100
I REMEMBER SITTING
IN THE BATHTUB IN THE REHAB

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.070
AND WHEN I STEPPED OUT
OF THE BATHTUB

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:19.170
I... MY BODY FELT COMFORTABLE

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.870
AND I JUST FELT WARM
AND NICE AND SAFE

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.030
AND I THOUGHT, "I CAN DO THIS."

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.500
I THOUGHT,
"THERE IS PLEASURE HERE."

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.530
I ALSO REMEMBER SWIMMING IN
THE SWIMMING POOL IN THE REHAB

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.530
AND AGAIN FEELING LIKE, "AH!

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:35.430
THERE IS SOME OTHER JOY
OTHER THAN DRUGS."

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.200
I PLAN TO LIVE
A RIDICULOUSLY LONG TIME.

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.630
I PLAN TO LIVE
ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS--

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:47.230
LET'S SEE IF I SUCCEED--

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:50.430
BUT I PLAN TO BE ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE WHO LIVES JUST FOREVER.

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.670
AND I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS
NOT DRINKING DURING THAT TIME.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:56.570
I MEAN, I... IT'S RIDICULOUS
FOR ME TO IMAGINE QUITTING

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:58.130
YOU KNOW, TEN YEARS FROM NOW.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO A WEEK FROM NOW.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:02.870
BUT TODAY, NOT DRINK?
PIECE OF CAKE.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:07.100
AS YOU AND I ARE SITTING HERE
DOING THIS INTERVIEW

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.430
I'M SOBER, SEE.

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.730
I WANT TO BE SOBER
RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.970
BUT I HAVE A DISEASE
THAT CAN TRICK ME

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.200
WHEN I GET UP FROM THIS CHAIR

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:20.330
AND TELL ME THAT
I DON'T WANT TO BE SOBER.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.430
BUT I CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT
TO YOU, BILL, OR TO ANYONE

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.070
THAT I... I CAN'T
MAKE A COMMITMENT

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.230
THAT I CAN STAY SOBER
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:32.370
THAT'S JUST TOO LONG FOR ME.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:35.530
EVEN AFTER WORKING
ON 14 YEARS OF RECOVERY

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.000
THE REST OF MY LIFE IS TOO LONG.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.430
I CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT
I WANT TO STAY SOBER THIS DAY.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:43.730
I HAVE TO SAY TO MYSELF

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.830
I AM THE ONLY PERSON
I CAN DEPEND ON--

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:48.630
NOT THAT I CAN'T DEPEND
ON OTHERS, BECAUSE I CAN--

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:51.300
BUT I AM REALLY THE ONLY
PERSON I CAN DEPEND ON

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.470
AND I AM REALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR MYSELF

00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:56.430
AND I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL
HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:03.070
AND SO I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
TAKE MYSELF IN... IN... IN REIN

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:04.530
BECAUSE I DON'T, UM...

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:08.230
I'M... I AM LED INTO
TEMPTATION ALL THE TIME

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.870
AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS.

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:13.730
WHAT'S BEEN
THE HARDEST THING

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.730
ABOUT STAYING
CLEAN?

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:20.470
IT'S NOT... IT'S NOT
SO HARD ANYMORE.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:24.800
IT'S... UM... MAYBE
I'VE JUST GROWN UP, YOU KNOW.

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.930
MAYBE IT'S HAVING CHILDREN
AND A FAMILY THAT'S PART OF THAT

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:32.100
PART OF UNDERSTANDING THAT,
UM... THAT'S NO...

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.770
THAT THAT'S NO WAY TO LIVE,
IT'S... THERE'S TOO MUCH...

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.630
THERE ARE TOO MANY
WONDERFUL THINGS IN LIFE

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.330

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.570

OF CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.570
