00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730


2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.730
Now madam. Summon up your dearest spirits.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.370
Consider who the king your father sends,

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.430
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.670
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.500
To parley with the sole inheritor

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.330
Of all perfections that a man may owe,

8
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.200
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.130
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.

10
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.730
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace

11
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.900
As Nature was in making graces dear

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.200
When she did starve the general world beside

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.600
And prodigally gave them all to you.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.130
Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,

15
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.700
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.970
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,

17
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.270
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:

18
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.070
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth

19
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.070
Than you much willing to be counted wise

20
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.400
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.

21
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.130
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,

22
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.930
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.200
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.170
Till painful study shall outwear three years,

25
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.300
No woman may approach his silent court:

26
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.230
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,

27
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.670
Before we enter his forbidden gates,

28
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.870
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,

29
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.330
Bold of your worthiness, we single you

30
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.830
As our best-moving fair solicitor.

31
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.570
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,

32
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.170
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,

33
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.300
Importunes personal conference with his grace:

34
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.270
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,

35
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.300
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.

36
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.370
Proud of employment, willingly I go.

37
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.630
All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.

38
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.530
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,

39
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.730
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

40
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:55.900
Lord Longaville is one.

41
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
Know you the man?

42
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.230
I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,

43
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.330
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir

44
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.930
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized

45
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.900
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:

46
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.470
Well, a man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;

47
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.730
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:

48
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.600
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.

49
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.470
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,

50
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.900
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,

51
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.930
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;

52
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.730
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills

53
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.470
It should none spare that come within his power.

54
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.070
Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

55
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.370
They say so most that most his humours know.

56
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.800
Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.

57
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.900
Who are the rest?

58
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.670
The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,

59
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.630
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:

60
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.200
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;

61
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.530
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,

62
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.870
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.

63
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.700
Another of these students at that time

64
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.900
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.

65
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.730
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,

66
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.870
Within the limit of becoming mirth,

67
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.900
I never spent an hour's talk withal:

68
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.870
His eye begets occasion for his wit;

69
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.730
For every object that the one doth catch

70
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.830
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,

71
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.100
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,

72
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.170
Delivers in such apt and gracious words

73
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.200
That aged ears play truant at his tales

74
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.530
And younger hearings are quite ravished;

75
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.300
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

76
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.500
God bless my ladies! are they all in love,

77
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.470
That every one her own hath garnished

78
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.430
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

79
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.570
Here comes Boyet.

80
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.770
Now, what admittance, lord?

81
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.700
Navarre had notice of your fair approach;

82
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.100
And he and his competitors in oath

83
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.700
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,

84
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.330
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:

85
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.500
He rather means to lodge you in the field,

86
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.170
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,

87
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.630
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,

88
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.930
To let you enter his unpeopled house.

89
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.730
Here comes Navarre.

90
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300
Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

91
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.100
'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome'

92
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.530
I have not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be yours;

93
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.900
and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

94
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.730
You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

95
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.430
I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.

96
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.130
Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.

97
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.430
Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

98
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.630
Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

99
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.370
Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.

100
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.230
Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

101
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.130
Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,

102
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.070
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.

103
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.230
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:

104
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.700
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,

105
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.200
And sin to break it.

106
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.730
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:

107
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.030
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.

108
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.300
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,

109
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.570
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

110
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.530
Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

111
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.230
You will the sooner, that I were away;

112
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.700
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

113
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.770
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

114
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.400
Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

115
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.370
I know you did.

116
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.130
How needless was it then to ask the question!

117
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.600
You must not be so quick.

118
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.270
'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.

119
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.830
Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

120
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.870
Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

121
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.200
What time o' day?

122
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.330
The hour that fools should ask.

123
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.170
Now fair befall your mask!

124
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.730
Fair fall the face it covers!

125
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.970
And send you many lovers!

126
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.570
Amen, so you be none.

127
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.400
Nay, then will I be gone.

128
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.170
Madam, your father here doth intimate

129
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.330
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;

130
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.470
Being but the one half of an entire sum

131
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.030
Disbursed by my father in his wars.

132
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.770
But say that he or we, as neither have,

133
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.230
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid

134
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.030
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,

135
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.570
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,

136
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.800
Although not valued to the money's worth.

137
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.600
If then the king your father will restore

138
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.900
But that one half which is unsatisfied,

139
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.200
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,

140
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.

141
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.200
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,

142
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.930
For here he doth demand to have repaid

143
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.370
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,

144
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.230
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,

145
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.830
To have his title live in Aquitaine;

146
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.230
Which we much rather had depart withal

147
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.230
And have the money by our father lent

148
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.200
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.

149
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.870
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far

150
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.670
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make

151
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.100
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast

152
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.700
And go well satisfied to France again.

153
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.600
You do the king my father too much wrong

154
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.430
And wrong the reputation of your name,

155
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.030
In so unseeming to confess receipt

156
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.630
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

157
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.400
I do protest I never heard of it;

158
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.800
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back

159
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.570
Or yield up Aquitaine.

160
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.500
We arrest your word.

161
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.170
Boyet, you can produce acquittances

162
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.570
For such a sum from special officers

163
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.830
Of Charles his father.

164
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.630
Satisfy me so.

165
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.830
So please your grace, the packet is not come

166
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.000
Where that and other specialties are bound:

167
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.400
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

168
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.630
It shall suffice me: at which interview

169
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.800
All liberal reason I will yield unto.

170
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.770
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand

171
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.770
As honour without breach of honour may

172
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.030
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:

173
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.170
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;

174
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.830
But here without you shall be so received

175
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.470
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,

176
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.930
Although so denied fair harbour in my house.

177
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.770
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:

178
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.400
To-morrow shall we visit you again.

179
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.870
Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!

180
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.570
Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!

181
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.930
Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

182
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.230
The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

183
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:55.870
A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.

184
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.130
I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

185
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.500
A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

186
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.800
Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

187
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.600
She is an heir of Falconbridge.

188
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.000
What's her name in the cap?

189
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.600
Rosaline, by good hap.

190
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.730
Is she wedded or no?

191
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.400
To her will, sir, or so.

192
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.200
You are welcome, sir: adieu.

193
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.030
Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

194
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.600
That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:

195
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.230
Not a word with him but a jest.

196
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.970
And every jest but a word.

197
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.100
It was well done of you to take him at his word.

198
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.170
I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

199
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:38.570
Two hot sheeps, marry.

200
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.930
And wherefore not ships?

201
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.600
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

202
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.070
You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?

203
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.070
So you grant pasture for me.

204
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.670
Not so, gentle beast:

205
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.200
My lips are no common, though several they be.

206
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.470
Belonging to whom?

207
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.670
To my fortunes and me.

208
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.370
Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:

209
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.700
This civil war of wits were much better used

210
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.730
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

211
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.100
If my observation, which very seldom lies,

212
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.930
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,

213
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.230
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

214
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.430
With what?

215
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.000
With that which we lovers entitle affected.

216
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Your reason?

217
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.600
Why, all his behaviors did make their retire

218
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.230
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:

219
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.000
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,

220
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.670
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:

221
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.930
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,

222
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.570
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;

223
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.400
All senses to that sense did make their repair,

224
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.030
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:

225
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.800
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,

226
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.370
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;

227
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.530
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,

228
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.430
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:

229
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.370
His face's own margent did quote such amazes

230
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.000
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.

231
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.470
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,

232
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:17.200
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

233
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.370
Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

234
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.700
He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.

235
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.000
Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

236
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:36.870
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?

237
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:42.730
Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!

238
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:47.200
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:

239
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:53.770
Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd.

240
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.270
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,

241
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:04.800
Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend:

242
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.800
