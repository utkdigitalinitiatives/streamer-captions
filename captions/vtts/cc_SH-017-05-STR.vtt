00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000


2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.270
As I took note of the place,

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.770
it cannot be far where he abides.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.530
What's to be thought of him?

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.030
Does the rumour hold for true that he's so full of gold?

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.230
Certain.

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.300
Alcibiades reports it;

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.130
Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.500
He likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.700
with great quantity.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.700
Then this breaking of his

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.130
has been but a try for his friends.

13
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.270
Nothing else.

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.700
You shall see him a palm in Athens again

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.170
and flourish with the highest.

16
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender our love to him

17
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.270
in this supposed distress of his.

18
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.900
It will show honestly in us

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
and is very likely to load our purposes

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.470
with what they travail for,

21
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.970
if it be a just and true report that goes of his having.

22
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.030
What have you now to present unto him?

23
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.570
Nothing at this time but my visitation.

24
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.630
Only I will promise him a most excellent piece.

25
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.400
I must serve him so too,

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.300
tell him of an intent that's coming towards him.

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.500
Good as the best.

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.570
Promising is the very air of the time.

29
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.270
It opens the eyes of expectation.

30
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.270
Performance is ever the duller for his act;

31
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.470
and, but in the plainer and simpler kind of people,

32
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.230
the deed of saying is quite out of use.

33
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.600
To promise is most courtly and fashionable.

34
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.030
Performance is a kind of will or testament

35
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
that argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it.

36
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.600
I am thinking what I shall say that I have provided for him,

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
it must be a personating of himself,

38
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.330
a satire against the softness of prosperity,

39
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.430
with a discovery of the infinite flatteries

40
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.170
that follow youth and opulency.

41
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.870
Nay, let's seek him.

42
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.500
Then do we sin against our own estate,

43
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
when we may profit meet and come too late.

44
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.830
True;

45
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.430
when the day serves, before black-cornered night,

46
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.170
find what thou wantest by free and offered light.

47
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.370
Come.

48
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.500
Hail, worthy Timon!

49
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.530
Our late noble master.

50
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.030
Have I once lived to see two honest men?

51
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.000
Sir, having often of your open bounty tasted,

52
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.730
hearing you were retired,

53
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.400
your friends fallen off, whose thankless natures

54
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.900
O abhorred spirits

55
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.970
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough.

56
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.970
What!

57
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.530
to you, whose star-like nobleness

58
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.570
gave life and influence to their whole being.

59
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.830
I am rapt and cannot cover the monstrous bulk

60
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.730
of this ingratitude with any size of words.

61
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.500
Let it go naked; men may see it the better.

62
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.300
You that are honest, by being what you are,

63
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.600
make it best seen and known.

64
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.200
He and myself have travailed in the great

65
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
and sweetly felt it.

66
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.170
Ay, you are honest men.

67
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.670
We are hither come to offer you our service.

68
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
Most honest men.

69
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.830
How shall I requite you?

70
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.530
Can you eat root and drink cold water?

71
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.630
No?

72
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.730
What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.

73
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.430
You're honest men.

74
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.200
You've heard that I have gold?

75
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.470
I am sure you have.

76
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.470
Speak truth;

77
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.170
you're honest men.

78
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.930
So it is said, my noble lord;

79
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.630
but therefore came not my friend nor I.

80
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.630
Ay, good honest men.

81
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.100
Thou drawest the best counterfeit in all Athens.

82
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.770
Indeed, thou art the best;

83
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.970
Thou counterfeitest most lively.

84
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.200
So, so, my lord.

85
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.170
Even so, sir, as I say.

86
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.200
And, for thy fiction, why,

87
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.770
thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth,

88
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.000
thou art even natural in thine own art.

89
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,

90
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.500
I must needs say you have a little fault.

91
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.670
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you,

92
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.470
neither wish I you take much pains to mend.

93
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.170
Beseech Your Honor; make it known to us.

94
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.130
You'll take it ill.

95
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.370
Most thankfully, my lord.

96
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.570
Will you, indeed?

97
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.800
Doubt it not, worthy lord.

98
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.570
There's never a one of you that trusts a knave,

99
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.900
but mightily deceives you.

100
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.170
Do we, my lord?

101
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.300
Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,

102
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.130
know his gross patchery,

103
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.500
love him, feed him, keep in your bosom.

104
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.730
Yet remain assured, he's a made-up villain.

105
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.800
I know none such, my lord.

106
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.900
Nor I.

107
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.770
Look you, I love you well;

108
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.570
I'll give you gold;

109
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.670
rid me these villains from your companies.

110
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.570
Hang them, stab them, drown them in a draught,

111
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.800
confound them by some course,

112
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.100
come to me; I'll give you gold enough.

113
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.330
Name them, my lord; let's know them.

114
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.100
You that way and you this,

115
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.100
each man apart, but two in company,

116
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.830
all single and alone,

117
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.830
yet an arch-villain keeps him company.

118
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.070
If where thou art two villains shall not be,

119
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.270
come not near him.

120
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.400
If thou would not reside but where one villain is,

121
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.300
then him abandon.

122
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.170
Hence, pack!

123
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.900
You came for gold, you slaves.

124
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.600
There's gold.

125
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.670
You've worked for me;

126
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.070
there's payment!

127
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.330
You're an alchemist;

128
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.130
make gold of that.

129
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.800
Out, rascal dogs!

130
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.430
It is vain that you would speak with Timon;

131
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.530
for he is set so only to himself

132
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.400
that nothing but himself which looks like man

133
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.430
is friendly with him.

134
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.700
Bring us to him.

135
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.130
It is our part and promise to the Athenians

136
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.530
to speak with Timon.

137
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.600
At all times, alike men are not still the same.

138
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.630
'Twas time and griefs that framed him thus.

139
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.270
Time, with his fairer hand, offering the fortunes

140
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.430
of his former days,

141
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.170
the former man may make him.

142
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.070
Bring us to him, and chance it as it may.

143
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.300
Lord Timon.

144
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.430
Timon.

145
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.900
Look out, and speak to friends.

146
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.300
The Athenians, by two of their most reverend senate,

147
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.030
greet thee.

148
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.430
Speak to them, noble Timon.

149
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.930
Thou sun, that comforts, burn.

150
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.330
Speak, and be hanged.

151
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.370
For each true word, a blister,

152
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.730
and each false be as a cauterizing

153
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.300
to the root o' the tongue,

154
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.370
consuming it with speaking.

155
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.900
Worthy Timon

156
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.830
Of none but such as you and you of Timon.

157
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.900
The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.

158
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.370
I thank them

159
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.170
and would send them back the plague,

160
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.400
could I but catch it for them.

161
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.000
Oh, forget what we are sorry for ourselves in thee.

162
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.330
The senators with one consent of love

163
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.470
entreat thee back to Athens;

164
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.430
who have thought on special dignities,

165
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.530
which vacant lie for thy best use and wearing.

166
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.770
They confess towards thee

167
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.400
forgetfulness too general, gross.

168
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.200
You witch me in it;

169
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.300
surprise me to the very brink of tears.

170
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.530
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,

171
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.730
and I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

172
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.870
Therefore, so please thee to return with us

173
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.800
and of our Athens, thine and ours,

174
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.900
to take the captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,

175
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.230
allowed with absolute power

176
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.930
and thy good name live with authority.

177
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.070
So soon we shall drive back of Alcibiades the approaches wild,

178
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.400
who, like a boar too savage,

179
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.400
doth root up his country's peace.

180
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.370
And shakes his threatening sword against the walls of Athens.

181
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.430
Therefore, Timon

182
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.100
Therefore, I will, sir;

183
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.130
therefore, I will, sir; thus.

184
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.500
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,

185
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.200
let Alcibiades know this of Timon:

186
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.670
that Timon cares not.

187
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.070
But if he sack fair Athens

188
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.070
and take our goodly aged men by the beards,

189
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.500
giving our holy virgins to the stain

190
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.900
of contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war,

191
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.170
then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it.

192
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.170
In pity of our aged and our youth,

193
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.530
I cannot choose but tell him

194
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:36.400
that I care not and let him take it at worst;

195
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.600
for their knives care not,

196
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.070
while you have throats to answer.

197
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.470
For myself, there's not a whittle in the unruly camp

198
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.000
but I do prize it at my love

199
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.100
before the reverendest throat in Athens.

200
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.870
So I leave you to the protection of the gods,

201
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.870
as thieves to keepers.

202
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.700
Stay not; all's in vain.

203
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.670
Why, I was writing of my epitaph.

204
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.970
It will be seen tomorrow.

205
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:18.330
My long sickness of health and living now begins to mend,

206
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.800
and nothing brings me all things.

207
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.000
Go; live still;

208
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.230
be Alcibiades your plague, you his,

209
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.470
and live so long enough.

210
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.900
We speak in vain.

211
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:41.330
But yet I love my country and am not one

212
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.970
that rejoices in the common wreck,

213
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.570
as common bruit doth put it.

214
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.270
That's well spoke.

215
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.570
Commend me to my loving countrymen

216
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.870
These words become your lips as they pass through them.

217
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.970
And enter in our ears like great triumphers

218
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.170
in their applauding gates.

219
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.400
Commend me to them,

220
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.800
and tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,

221
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.400
their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,

222
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.830
their pangs of love, with other incident throes

223
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.000
that nature's fragile vessel doth sustain

224
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.400
in life's uncertain voyage,

225
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.970
I will some kindness do them.

226
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.870
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

227
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.970
I like this well;

228
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.970
he will return again.

229
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.830
I have a tree which grows here in my close

230
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.970
that mine own use invites me to cut down.

231
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.530
Shortly must I fell it.

232
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.330
Tell my friends, tell Athens, in sequence of degree

233
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.630
from high to low throughout,

234
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.200
that whoso please to stop affliction,

235
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.470
let him take his haste, come hither,

236
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.270
ere my tree hath felt the axe,

237
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.870
and hang himself.

238
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.670
I pray you, do my greeting.

239
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.930
Trouble him no further;

240
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.300
thus you still shall find him.

241
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.370
Come not to me again,

242
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.470
but say to Athens,

243
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.600
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion

244
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.100
upon the beached verge of the salt flood;

245
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.030
who, once a day, with his embossed froth,

246
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.700
the turbulent surge shall cover.

247
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.300
Thither come; let my gravestone be your oracle.

248
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:48.300
Lips, let four words go by and language end.

249
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:55.270
What is amiss plague and infection mend.

250
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.770
Graves only be men's works, death their gain.

251
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.930
Sun, hide thy beams.

252
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.900
Timon hath done his reign.

253
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.270
His discontents are unremovably coupled to nature.

254
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.430
Our hope in him is dead.

255
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.730
Let us return and strain

256
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.400
what other means are left to us in our dear peril.

257
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.300
It requires swift foot.

258
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.970
The enemy's drum is heard,

259
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.830
and fearful scouring doth choke the air with dust.

260
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.470
On and prepare.

261
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.830
Ours is the fall, I fear,

262
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.470
our foes the snare.

263
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.600
Till now you have gone on

264
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.700
and filled the time with all licentious measure,

265
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.500
making your wills the scope of justice;

266
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.030
till now, myself and such

267
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.370
as slept within the shadow of your power,

268
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.900
have wandered with our traversed arms,

269
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.270
and breathed our sufferance vainly.

270
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:46.530
Now the time is flush,

271
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.670
when crouching marrow in the bearer

272
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.970
strong cries of itself, "No more."

273
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.830
Now breathless wrong shall sit and pant

274
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.630
in your great chairs of ease,

275
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.000
and pursy insolence shall break his wind

276
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.900
with fear and horrid flight.

277
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.030
Noble and young, when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,

278
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.670
ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,

279
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.300
we sent to thee to give thy rages balm,

280
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.430
to wipe out our ingratitude with loves above their quantity.

281
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.430
So did we woo transformed Timon to our city's love

282
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.400
by humble message and by promised means.

283
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.800
We were not all unkind,

284
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.330
nor all deserve the common stroke of war.

285
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.870
These walls of ours were not erected by their hands

286
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.430
from whom you have received your griefs;

287
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.900
nor are they such that these great towers,

288
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.370
trophies, and schools should fall for private faults in them.

289
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.430
Nor are they living that were the motives that you first went out;

290
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.400
shame that they wanted cunning,

291
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.600
in excess hath broke their hearts.

292
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.770
March, noble lord, into our city with thy banners spread.

293
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.800
By decimation, and a tithed death

294
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.670
if thy revenges hunger for that food which nature loathes

295
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.430
take thou the destined tenth,

296
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.770
and by the hazard of the spotted die, let die the spotted.

297
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.100
All have not offended;

298
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.470
for those that were,

299
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.600
it is not square to take on those that are revenge.

300
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.370
Crimes, like lands, are not inherited.

301
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.730
Then, dear countryman, bring in thy ranks,

302
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.830
but leave without thy rage.

303
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.000
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin

304
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.530
which in the bluster of thy wrath

305
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.700
must fall with those that have offended.

306
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.170
Like a shepherd, approach the fold,

307
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.070
and cull the infected forth, but kill not all together.

308
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.830
What thou wilt, thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile

309
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.830
than hew to it with thy sword.

310
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.770
Set but thy foot against our rampired gates,

311
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.070
and they shall ope;

312
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.170
so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,

313
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.000
to say thou'lt enter friendly.

314
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.870
Throw thy glove, or any token of thine honor else,

315
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.300
that thou wilt use these wars as thy redress

316
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.370
and not as our confusion,

317
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.870
all thy powers shall make their harbor in our town,

318
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.200
till we have sealed thy full desires.

319
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.170
Then there's my glove.

320
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.500
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own

321
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.470
whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof fall

322
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.330
and no more.

323
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.600
And to atone your fears with my more noble meaning,

324
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.170
not a man shall pass his quarter

325
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:41.000
or offend the stream of regular justice in your city's bounds,

326
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.970
but shall be rendered to your public laws at heaviest answer.

327
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.900
'Tis most nobly spoken.

328
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.770
My noble general, Timon is dead;

329
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.800
entombed upon the very hem of the sea;

330
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.630
and on his grave-stone this insculpture,

331
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.830
which with wax I brought away,

332
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:04.730
whose soft impression interprets for my poor ignorance.

333
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:11.170
"Here lies a wretched corse, wretched soul bereft.

334
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.030
"Seek not my name.

335
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.930
"A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left.

336
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.630
"Here lie I, Timon,

337
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.370
"who, alive, all living men did hate.

338
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.800
"Pass by and curse thy fill,

339
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.070
but pass and stay not here thy gait."

340
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.630
These well express in thee thy latter spirits.

341
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.930
Though thou abhorredst in us our human griefs,

342
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.300
scornedst our brain's flow and those our droplets

343
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.470
which from niggard nature fall,

344
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.330
yet rich conceit taught thee to make vast Neptune weep

345
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:01.470
for aye on thy low grave, on faults forgiven.

346
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.000
Dead is noble Timon

347
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.670
of whose memory hereafter more.

348
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.070
Bring me into your city,

349
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.570
and I will use the olive with my sword,

350
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:31.330
make war breed peace, make peace stint war,

351
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:38.400
make each prescribe to other as each other's leech.
