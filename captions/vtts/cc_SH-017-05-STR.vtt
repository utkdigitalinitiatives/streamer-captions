00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000


2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.270
As I took note of theplace,

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.770
it cannot be far where heabides.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.530
What's to be thought ofhim?

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.030
Does the rumour hold for truethat he's so full of gold?

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.230
Certain.

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.300
Alcibiades reports it;

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.130
Phrynia and Timandra hadgold of him.

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.500
He likewise enriched poorstraggling soldiers

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.700
with great quantity.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.700
Then this breaking of his

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.130
has been but a try for hisfriends.

13
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.270
Nothing else.

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.700
You shall see him a palmin Athens again

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.170
and flourish with thehighest.

16
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.870
Therefore 'tis not amisswe tender our love to him

17
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.270
in this supposed distressof his.

18
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.900
It will show honestly inus

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
and is very likely to loadour purposes

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.470
with what they travailfor,

21
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.970
if it be a just and true reportthat goes of his having.

22
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.030
What have you now topresent unto him?

23
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.570
Nothing at this time butmy visitation.

24
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.630
Only I will promise him amost excellent piece.

25
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.400
I must serve him so too,

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.300
tell him of an intentthat's coming towards him.

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.500
Good as the best.

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.570
Promising is the very airof the time.

29
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.270
It opens the eyes ofexpectation.

30
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.270
Performance is ever theduller for his act;

31
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.470
and, but in the plainer andsimpler kind of people,

32
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.230
the deed of saying isquite out of use.

33
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.600
To promise is most courtlyand fashionable.

34
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.030
Performance is a kind ofwill or testament

35
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
that argues a great sickness inhis judgment that makes it.

36
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.600
I am thinking what I shall saythat I have provided for him,

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
it must be a personatingof himself,

38
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.330
a satire against thesoftness of prosperity,

39
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.430
with a discovery of theinfinite flatteries

40
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.170
that follow youth andopulency.

41
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.870
Nay, let's seek him.

42
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.500
Then do we sin against ourown estate,

43
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
when we may profit meetand come too late.

44
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.830
True;

45
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.430
when the day serves, beforeblack-cornered night,

46
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.170
find what thou wantest byfree and offered light.

47
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.370
Come.

48
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.500
Hail, worthy Timon!

49
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.530
Our late noble master.

50
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.030
Have I once lived to seetwo honest men?

51
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.000
Sir, having often of youropen bounty tasted,

52
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.730
hearing you were retired,

53
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.400
your friends fallen off,whose thankless natures

54
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.900
O abhorred spirits

55
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.970
Not all the whips ofheaven are large enough.

56
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.970
What!

57
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.530
to you, whose star-likenobleness

58
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.570
gave life and influence totheir whole being.

59
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.830
I am rapt and cannot coverthe monstrous bulk

60
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.730
of this ingratitude withany size of words.

61
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.500
Let it go naked; men maysee it the better.

62
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.300
You that are honest, bybeing what you are,

63
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.600
make it best seen andknown.

64
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.200
He and myself havetravailed in the great

65
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200
and sweetly felt it.

66
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.170
Ay, you are honest men.

67
00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.670
We are hither come tooffer you our service.

68
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
Most honest men.

69
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.830
How shall I requite you?

70
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.530
Can you eat root and drinkcold water?

71
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.630
No?

72
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.730
What we can do, we'll do,to do you service.

73
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.430
You're honest men.

74
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.200
You've heard that I havegold?

75
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.470
I am sure you have.

76
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.470
Speak truth;

77
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.170
you're honest men.

78
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.930
So it is said, my noblelord;

79
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.630
but therefore came not myfriend nor I.

80
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.630
Ay, good honest men.

81
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.100
Thou drawest the bestcounterfeit in all Athens.

82
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.770
Indeed, thou art the best;

83
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.970
Thou counterfeitest mostlively.

84
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.200
So, so, my lord.

85
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.170
Even so, sir, as I say.

86
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.200
And, for thy fiction, why,

87
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.770
thy verse swells withstuff so fine and smooth,

88
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.000
thou art even natural inthine own art.

89
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
But, for all this, myhonest-natured friends,

90
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.500
I must needs say you havea little fault.

91
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.670
Marry, 'tis not monstrousin you,

92
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.470
neither wish I you takemuch pains to mend.

93
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.170
Beseech Your Honor; makeit known to us.

94
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.130
You'll take it ill.

95
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.370
Most thankfully, my lord.

96
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.570
Will you, indeed?

97
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.800
Doubt it not, worthy lord.

98
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.570
There's never a one of youthat trusts a knave,

99
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.900
but mightily deceives you.

100
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.170
Do we, my lord?

101
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.300
Ay, and you hear him cog,see him dissemble,

102
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.130
know his gross patchery,

103
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.500
love him, feed him, keepin your bosom.

104
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.730
Yet remain assured, he's amade-up villain.

105
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.800
I know none such, my lord.

106
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.900
Nor I.

107
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.770
Look you, I love you well;

108
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.570
I'll give you gold;

109
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.670
rid me these villains fromyour companies.

110
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.570
Hang them, stab them,drown them in a draught,

111
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.800
confound them by somecourse,

112
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.100
come to me; I'll give yougold enough.

113
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.330
Name them, my lord; let'sknow them.

114
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.100
You that way and you this,

115
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.100
each man apart, but two incompany,

116
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.830
all single and alone,

117
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.830
yet an arch-villain keepshim company.

118
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.070
If where thou art twovillains shall not be,

119
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.270
come not near him.

120
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.400
If thou would not residebut where one villain is,

121
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.300
then him abandon.

122
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.170
Hence, pack!

123
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.900
You came for gold, youslaves.

124
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.600
There's gold.

125
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.670
You've worked for me;

126
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.070
there's payment!

127
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.330
You're an alchemist;

128
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.130
make gold of that.

129
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.800
Out, rascal dogs!

130
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.430
It is vain that you wouldspeak with Timon;

131
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.530
for he is set so only tohimself

132
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.400
that nothing but himselfwhich looks like man

133
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.430
is friendly with him.

134
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.700
Bring us to him.

135
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.130
It is our part and promiseto the Athenians

136
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.530
to speak with Timon.

137
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.600
At all times, alike menare not still the same.

138
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.630
'Twas time and griefs thatframed him thus.

139
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.270
Time, with his fairer hand,offering the fortunes

140
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.430
of his former days,

141
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.170
the former man may makehim.

142
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.070
Bring us to him, andchance it as it may.

143
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.300
Lord Timon.

144
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.430
Timon.

145
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.900
Look out, and speak tofriends.

146
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.300
The Athenians, by two oftheir most reverend senate,

147
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.030
greet thee.

148
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.430
Speak to them, nobleTimon.

149
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.930
Thou sun, that comforts,burn.

150
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.330
Speak, and be hanged.

151
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.370
For each true word, ablister,

152
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.730
and each false be as acauterizing

153
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.300
to the root o' the tongue,

154
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.370
consuming it withspeaking.

155
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.900
Worthy Timon

156
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.830
Of none but such as youand you of Timon.

157
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.900
The senators of Athensgreet thee, Timon.

158
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.370
I thank them

159
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.170
and would send them backthe plague,

160
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:39.400
could I but catch it forthem.

161
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.000
Oh, forget what we are sorryfor ourselves in thee.

162
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.330
The senators with oneconsent of love

163
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.470
entreat thee back toAthens;

164
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.430
who have thought onspecial dignities,

165
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.530
which vacant lie for thybest use and wearing.

166
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.770
They confess towards thee

167
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.400
forgetfulness too general,gross.

168
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.200
You witch me in it;

169
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.300
surprise me to the verybrink of tears.

170
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.530
Lend me a fool's heart anda woman's eyes,

171
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:13.730
and I'll beweep thesecomforts, worthy senators.

172
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.870
Therefore, so please theeto return with us

173
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.800
and of our Athens, thineand ours,

174
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.900
to take the captainship, thoushalt be met with thanks,

175
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.230
allowed with absolutepower

176
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.930
and thy good name livewith authority.

177
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.070
So soon we shall drive back ofAlcibiades the approaches wild,

178
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.400
who, like a boar toosavage,

179
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.400
doth root up his country'speace.

180
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.370
And shakes his threatening swordagainst the walls of Athens.

181
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.430
Therefore, Timon

182
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.100
Therefore, I will, sir;

183
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.130
therefore, I will, sir;thus.

184
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.500
If Alcibiades kill mycountrymen,

185
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:01.200
let Alcibiades know thisof Timon:

186
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.670
that Timon cares not.

187
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.070
But if he sack fair Athens

188
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.070
and take our goodly agedmen by the beards,

189
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.500
giving our holy virgins tothe stain

190
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.900
of contumelious, beastly,mad-brained war,

191
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.170
then let him know, andtell him Timon speaks it.

192
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.170
In pity of our aged andour youth,

193
00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.530
I cannot choose but tellhim

194
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:36.400
that I care not and lethim take it at worst;

195
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.600
for their knives care not,

196
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.070
while you have throats toanswer.

197
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.470
For myself, there's not awhittle in the unruly camp

198
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.000
but I do prize it at mylove

199
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.100
before the reverendestthroat in Athens.

200
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.870
So I leave you to theprotection of the gods,

201
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.870
as thieves to keepers.

202
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.700
Stay not; all's in vain.

203
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.670
Why, I was writing of myepitaph.

204
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.970
It will be seen tomorrow.

205
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:18.330
My long sickness of health andliving now begins to mend,

206
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.800
and nothing brings me allthings.

207
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.000
Go; live still;

208
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.230
be Alcibiades your plague,you his,

209
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.470
and live so long enough.

210
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.900
We speak in vain.

211
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:41.330
But yet I love my countryand am not one

212
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.970
that rejoices in thecommon wreck,

213
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.570
as common bruit dothput it.

214
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.270
That's well spoke.

215
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.570
Commend me to my lovingcountrymen

216
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.870
These words become your lipsas they pass through them.

217
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.970
And enter in our ears likegreat triumphers

218
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.170
in their applauding gates.

219
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.400
Commend me to them,

220
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.800
and tell them that, toease them of their griefs,

221
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.400
their fears of hostilestrokes, their aches, losses,

222
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.830
their pangs of love, withother incident throes

223
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.000
that nature's fragilevessel doth sustain

224
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.400
in life's uncertainvoyage,

225
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.970
I will some kindness dothem.

226
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.870
I'll teach them to preventwild Alcibiades' wrath.

227
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.970
I like this well;

228
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.970
he will return again.

229
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:33.830
I have a tree which growshere in my close

230
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:37.970
that mine own use invitesme to cut down.

231
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:41.530
Shortly must I fell it.

232
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:47.330
Tell my friends, tell Athens,in sequence of degree

233
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.630
from high to lowthroughout,

234
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.200
that whoso please to stopaffliction,

235
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.470
let him take his haste,come hither,

236
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.270
ere my tree hath felt theaxe,

237
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.870
and hang himself.

238
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.670
I pray you, do mygreeting.

239
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:07.930
Trouble him no further;

240
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.300
thus you still shall findhim.

241
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.370
Come not to me again,

242
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.470
but say to Athens,

243
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.600
Timon hath made hiseverlasting mansion

244
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.100
upon the beached verge ofthe salt flood;

245
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.030
who, once a day, with hisembossed froth,

246
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.700
the turbulent surge shallcover.

247
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.300
Thither come; let mygravestone be your oracle.

248
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:48.300
Lips, let four words go byand language end.

249
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:55.270
What is amiss plague andinfection mend.

250
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.770
Graves only be men'sworks, death their gain.

251
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.930
Sun, hide thy beams.

252
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.900
Timon hath done his reign.

253
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:23.270
His discontents are unremovablycoupled to nature.

254
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.430
Our hope in him is dead.

255
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:26.730
Let us return and strain

256
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.400
what other means are leftto us in our dear peril.

257
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.300
It requires swift foot.

258
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.970
The enemy's drum is heard,

259
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.830
and fearful scouring dothchoke the air with dust.

260
00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.470
On and prepare.

261
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.830
Ours is the fall, I fear,

262
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.470
our foes the snare.

263
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.600
Till now you have gone on

264
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.700
and filled the time withall licentious measure,

265
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:25.500
making your wills thescope of justice;

266
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.030
till now, myself and such

267
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.370
as slept within the shadowof your power,

268
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.900
have wandered with ourtraversed arms,

269
00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.270
and breathed oursufferance vainly.

270
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:46.530
Now the time is flush,

271
00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.670
when crouching marrow inthe bearer

272
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:52.970
strong cries of itself,"No more."

273
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.830
Now breathless wrong shallsit and pant

274
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:59.630
in your great chairs ofease,

275
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.000
and pursy insolence shallbreak his wind

276
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.900
with fear and horridflight.

277
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:14.030
Noble and young, when thy firstgriefs were but a mere conceit,

278
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.670
ere thou hadst power or wehad cause of fear,

279
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.300
we sent to thee to givethy rages balm,

280
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.430
to wipe out our ingratitude withloves above their quantity.

281
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.430
So did we woo transformedTimon to our city's love

282
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.400
by humble message and bypromised means.

283
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.800
We were not all unkind,

284
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.330
nor all deserve the commonstroke of war.

285
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.870
These walls of ours werenot erected by their hands

286
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.430
from whom you havereceived your griefs;

287
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.900
nor are they such thatthese great towers,

288
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.370
trophies, and schools shouldfall for private faults inthem.

289
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.430
Nor are they living thatwere the motives thatyou first went out;

290
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.400
shame that they wantedcunning,

291
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.600
in excess hath broke theirhearts.

292
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.770
March, noble lord, into ourcity with thy banners spread.

293
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.800
By decimation, and atithed death

294
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.670
if thy revenges hunger for thatfood which nature loathes

295
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.430
take thou the destinedtenth,

296
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.770
and by the hazard of the spotteddie, let die the spotted.

297
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.100
All have not offended;

298
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.470
for those that were,

299
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.600
it is not square to takeon those that are revenge.

300
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.370
Crimes, like lands, arenot inherited.

301
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.730
Then, dear countryman,bring in thy ranks,

302
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.830
but leave without thyrage.

303
00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.000
Spare thy Athenian cradleand those kin

304
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.530
which in the bluster ofthy wrath

305
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.700
must fall with those thathave offended.

306
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.170
Like a shepherd, approachthe fold,

307
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.070
and cull the infected forth,but kill not all together.

308
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.830
What thou wilt, thou rathershalt enforce it with thy smile

309
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.830
than hew to it with thysword.

310
00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.770
Set but thy foot againstour rampired gates,

311
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.070
and they shall ope;

312
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.170
so thou wilt send thygentle heart before,

313
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.000
to say thou'lt enterfriendly.

314
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.870
Throw thy glove, or anytoken of thine honor else,

315
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.300
that thou wilt use thesewars as thy redress

316
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.370
and not as our confusion,

317
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.870
all thy powers shall maketheir harbor in our town,

318
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.200
till we have sealed thyfull desires.

319
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.170
Then there's my glove.

320
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.500
Those enemies of Timon'sand mine own

321
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.470
whom you yourselves shallset out for reproof fall

322
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.330
and no more.

323
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.600
And to atone your fears withmy more noble meaning,

324
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.170
not a man shall pass hisquarter

325
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:41.000
or offend the stream of regularjustice in your city's bounds,

326
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.970
but shall be rendered to yourpublic laws at heaviest answer.

327
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.900
'Tis most nobly spoken.

328
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.770
My noble general, Timon isdead;

329
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.800
entombed upon the very hemof the sea;

330
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.630
and on his grave-stonethis insculpture,

331
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.830
which with wax I broughtaway,

332
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:04.730
whose soft impression interpretsfor my poor ignorance.

333
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:11.170
"Here lies a wretched corse,wretched soul bereft.

334
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.030
"Seek not my name.

335
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.930
"A plague consume youwicked caitiffs left.

336
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.630
"Here lie I, Timon,

337
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.370
"who, alive, all livingmen did hate.

338
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.800
"Pass by and curse thyfill,

339
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.070
but pass and stay not herethy gait."

340
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:41.630
These well express in theethy latter spirits.

341
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.930
Though thou abhorredst inus our human griefs,

342
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:48.300
scornedst our brain's flowand those our droplets

343
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.470
which from niggard naturefall,

344
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.330
yet rich conceit taught theeto make vast Neptune weep

345
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:01.470
for aye on thy low grave,on faults forgiven.

346
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.000
Dead is noble Timon

347
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.670
of whose memory hereaftermore.

348
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.070
Bring me into your city,

349
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.570
and I will use the olivewith my sword,

350
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:31.330
make war breed peace, makepeace stint war,

351
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:38.400
make each prescribe to otheras each other's leech.
