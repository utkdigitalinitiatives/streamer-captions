00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:19.970


2
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.130
Open your ears,

3
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.470
for which of you will stop thevent of hearing

4
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.400
when loud rumor speaks?

5
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.800
I, from the orient to thedrooping west,

6
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.770
making the wind my post-horse,

7
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.400
still unfold the acts commencedon this ball of earth.

8
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.530
I run before King Harry'svictory,

9
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.870
who, in a bloody field byShrewsbury,

10
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.500
hath beaten down young Hotspurand his troops,

11
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.100
quenching the flame of boldrebellion

12
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.370
even with the rebel's blood.

13
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.430
But what mean I to speak so trueat first?

14
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.170
My office is to noise abroadthat Harry Monmouth fell

15
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.830
under the wrath of nobleHotspur's sword,

16
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.170
and that the king, before theDouglas' rage,

17
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.370
stooped his anointed head as lowas death.

18
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.530
This have I rumored through thepeasant towns

19
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.570
between that royal field ofShrewsbury

20
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.170
and this worm-eaten hold ofragged stone,

21
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.400
where Hotspur's father, oldNorthumberland,

22
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800
lies crafty-sick.

23
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.530
The posts come tiring on...

24
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.230
and not a man of them bringsother news

25
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.630
than they have learnt of me.

26
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.930
From rumor's tongues,

27
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.030
they bring smooth comfortsfalse,

28
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.730
worse than true wrongs.

29
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.300
What news, Lord Bardolph?

30
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.670
Every minute now should be thefather of some stratagem.

31
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.330
The times are wild.

32
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.630
Contention, like a horse full ofhigh feeding,

33
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.070
madly hath broke loose and bearsdown all before him.

34
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.970
Noble earl, I bring you certainnews from Shrewsbury.

35
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.400
Good, an God will.

36
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.900
As good as heart can wish.

37
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.630
The king is almost wounded tothe death,

38
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.230
and, in the fortune of my lordyour son,

39
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.830
Prince Harry slain.

40
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.400
But how was this derived?

41
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.730
Saw you the field?

42
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.000
Came you from Shrewsbury?

43
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.070
I spake with one, my lord, thatcame from thence,

44
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.030
a gentleman well bred and ofgood name,

45
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.400
who freely rendered me thesenews for true.

46
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.870
My lord, a gentleman almostforspent with speed,

47
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.700
stopped hard by me to breathehis bloodied horse.

48
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.930
He asked the way to Chester,

49
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.030
and of him I did demand whatnews from Shrewsbury.

50
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.100
He told me that rebellion hadbad luck,

51
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.830
and that young Harry Percy'sspur was cold.

52
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.700
My lord, I'll tell you what.

53
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.730
If my young lord your son havenot the day,

54
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.000
upon mine honor,

55
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.430
for a silken point I'll give mybarony.

56
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.500
Never talk of it.

57
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.600
My Lord, I spakeó

58
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.400
Speak not of that you do notknow.

59
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.870
Yea, this man's brow, like to atitle piece,

60
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.870
foretells the nature of a tragicvolume.

61
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.970
Say, Morton, didst thou comefrom Shrewsbury?

62
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.630
I ran from Shrewsbury, my noblelord,

63
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.430
where hateful death put on hisugliest mask

64
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.330
to fright our party.

65
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.470
And how doth my son and brother?

66
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.330
Thou tremblest.

67
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.130
The whiteness in thy cheek

68
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.230
is apter than thy tongue to tellthy errand.

69
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.030
Douglas is living,

70
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.030
and your brother, yet.

71
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.800
But, for my lord your sonó

72
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.870
Why, he is dead.

73
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.570
See what a ready tonguesuspicion hath.

74
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.500
I cannot think, my lord, yourson is dead.

75
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.600
I am sorry I should force you tobelieve

76
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.300
that which I would to God I hadnot seen.

77
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.930
But these mine eyes saw him inbloody state,

78
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.530
rendering faint quittance,

79
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.970
wearied and out-breathed toHarry Monmouth,

80
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.030
whose swift wrath beat down

81
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.930
the never daunted Percy to theearth,

82
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.130
from whence with life he nevermore sprung up.

83
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.530
For this I shall have timeenough to mourn.

84
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.430
In poison there is physic.

85
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.700
and these news, having beenwell,

86
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.900
that would have made me sick,

87
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.570
being sick, have in some measuremade me well.

88
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:35.800
Now bind my brows with iron

89
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.530
and approach the ragged'st hourthat time and spite dare bring

90
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.000
to frown upon the enragedNorthumberland.

91
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.970
Let heaven kiss earth.

92
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.270
Let not nature's hand keep thewild flood confined.

93
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.230
Let order die.

94
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.370
And let this world no longer bea stage

95
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.000
to feed contention in alingering act.

96
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.900
But let one spirit of thefirstborn Cain

97
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.500
reign in all bosoms,

98
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.200
that each heart, being set onbloody courses,

99
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.300
the rude scene may end,

100
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.500
and darkness be the burier ofthe dead.

101
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.970
This strained passion doth youwrong, my lord.

102
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.270
We all that are engaged to thisloss

103
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.330
knew that we ventured on suchdangerous seas

104
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.800
that if we wrought our life'twas ten to one.

105
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.200
And yet we ventured,

106
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.430
for the gain proposed choked therespect of likely peril feared.

107
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.770
And since we are o'erset,venture again.

108
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.930
Come.

109
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.330
We will all put forth body andgoods.

110
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.470
'Tis more than time.

111
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.330
And, my most noble lord, I hearfor certain

112
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.000
and dare speak the truth,

113
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.100
the gentle archbishop of York isup with well-appointed powers.

114
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.000
He turns insurrection toreligion.

115
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.600
Supposed sincere and holy in histhoughts,

116
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.670
he's followed both with body andwith mind

117
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.900
and doth enlarge his rising withthe blood of fair King Richard,

118
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.030
scraped from Pomfret stones;

119
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.830
derives from heaven his quarreland his cause;

120
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.400
tells them he doth bestride ableeding land

121
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.130
gasping for life under greatBolingbroke.

122
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.700
And more and less do flock tofollow him.

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.070
I knew of this before, but, tospeak truth,

124
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.870
this present grief had wiped itfrom my mind.

125
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.400
Go in with me and counsel everyman

126
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.830
the aptest way for safety andrevenge.

127
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.200
Sirrah, you giant,

128
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.430
what says the doctor to mywater?

129
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.870
He said, sir, the water itself

130
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.830
was a good, clean, healthywater.

131
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.800
But for the party that owed it,

132
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.770
he might have more diseases thanhe knew for.

133
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.870
Men of all sorts take a pride togird at me.

134
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.100
The brain of this foolishcompounded clay, man,

135
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.130
is not able to invent anythingthat tends to laughter,

136
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.230
more than I invent or isinvented on me.

137
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:18.300
I'm not only witty in myself,

138
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.130
but the cause that wit is inother men.

139
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.170
I do here walk before thee likea sow

140
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:28.270
that has overwhelmed all herlitter but one.

141
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.700
If the prince put thee into myservice

142
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.570
for any other reason than to setme off,

143
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.900
why, then I have no judgment.

144
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.270
Thou whoreson mandrake.

145
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.970
Thou art fitter to be worn in mycap

146
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.100
than to wait at my heels.

147
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.630
What said Master Dombledon

148
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.100
about the satin for my shortcloak and my slops?

149
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:47.330
He said, sir, you should procurehim

150
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.230
better assurance than Bardolph.

151
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.170
He would not take his band noryours.

152
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.500
He liked not the security.

153
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.100
A whoreson Achitophel.

154
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.600
A rascally yea-forsooth knave

155
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.500
to bear a gentleman in hand andthen stand upon security.

156
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.370
I had as lief they'd putratsbane in my mouth

157
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.300
as offer to stop it withsecurity.

158
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.900
Where is Bardolph?

159
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.370
He's gone into Smithfield to buyyour worship a horse.

160
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.530
I bought him in Paul's.

161
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.530
He'll buy me a horse inSmithfield.

162
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.230
An I could get me but a wife inthe stews,

163
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.800
I were manned, horsed, andwived.

164
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.570
Sir, here comes that nobleman

165
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.500
that committed the prince forstriking him about Bardolph.

166
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.670
Wait, close.

167
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.770
I will not see him.

168
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.470
What's he that goes there?

169
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.270
Falstaff, an't please yourlordship.

170
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.030
He that was in question for therobbery?

171
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.330
He, my lord.

172
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.900
But he hath since done goodservice at Shrewsbury,

173
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.400
and, as I hear,

174
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.970
is now going with some charge tothe Lord John of Lancaster.

175
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.000
What, to York?

176
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.300
Call him back again.

177
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.300
Sir John Falstaff.

178
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.230
Boy, tell him I'm deaf.

179
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.630
You will have to speak louder.

180
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.700
My master is deaf.

181
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.700
I'm sure he isó

182
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.070
to the hearing of anything good.

183
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.270
Go pluck him by the elbow.

184
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.300
I must speak with him.

185
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.470
Sir John.

186
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.470
What?

187
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.470
A young knave, and begging?

188
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.000
Is there not wars?

189
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.230
Is there not employment?

190
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.430
Sir, my lord would speak withyou.

191
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.670
Sir John Falstaff, a word withyou.

192
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.830
Oh, my lord.

193
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.930
God give your lordship good timeof day.

194
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.900
I am glad to see Your Lordshipabroad.

195
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.970
I heard say your lordship wassick.

196
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.400
I hope your lordship goes abroadby advice.

197
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.730
Your lordship, though not cleanpast your youth,

198
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.870
hath yet some smack of age inyou,

199
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.370
some relish of the saltness oftime,

200
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.570
and I must humbly beseech yourlordship

201
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.000
to have a reverent care of yourhealth.

202
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.330
Sir John, I sent for you

203
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.200
before your expedition toShrewsbury.

204
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.930
An't please your lordship,

205
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.100
I hear that His Majesty isreturned

206
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.100
with some discomfort from Wales.

207
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.100
I talk not of His Majesty.

208
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.830
You would not come when I sentfor you.

209
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.130
And I hear, moreover, that HisHighness is fallen

210
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.570
into this same whoresonapoplexy.

211
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.700
Well, God mend him.

212
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.170
I pray you, let me speak withyou.

213
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.570
This apoplexy, as I take it,

214
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.230
is a kind of lethargy, an'tplease your lordship,

215
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.230
a kind of sleeping in the blood,

216
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.300
a whoreson tingling.

217
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.300
What tell you me of it?

218
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.400
Be it as it is.

219
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.730
It hath its original from muchgrief,

220
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:03.400
from study and perturbation ofthe brain.

221
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.500
I have read the cause of hiseffects in Galen.

222
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.130
It's a kind of deafness.

223
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.330
I think you are fallen into thedisease.

224
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.670
You hear not what I say to you.

225
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.430
Oh, very well, my lord; verywell.

226
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.770
Rather, an't please you, it'sthe disease of not listening,

227
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.770
the malady of not marking, thatI am troubled withal.

228
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.700
To punish you by the heels

229
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.300
would amend the attention ofyour ears.

230
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.230
And I care not if I do becomeyour physician.

231
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.470
I sent for you

232
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.470
when there were matters againstyou for your life.

233
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.500
As I was then advised by mylearned counsel,

234
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.600
I did not come.

235
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.470
Well, the truth is, Sir John,you live in great infamy.

236
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.300
He that buckles him in my beltcannot live in less.

237
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.870
Your means are very slender, andyour waste is great.

238
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.170
I would it were otherwise.

239
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.200
I would my means were greaterand my waist slenderer.

240
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.770
You have misled the youthfulprince.

241
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.700
The young prince hath misled me.

242
00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.930
I am the fellow with the greatbelly,

243
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.170
and he my dog.

244
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.230
Well, I am loath to gall a newhealed wound.

245
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.170
Your day's service at Shrewsburyhath a little gilded over

246
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.330
your night's exploit atGadshill.

247
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.730
But since all is well, keep itso.

248
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.700
You follow the young prince upand down like his ill angel.

249
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.700
Not so, my lord.

250
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.300
You that are old consider not

251
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.870
the capacities of us that areyoung.

252
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.700
Will you set your name down inthe scroll of youth

253
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.570
that are written down old withall the characters of age?

254
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.230
Have you not a moist eye,

255
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.300
a dry hand,

256
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.300
a yellow cheek,

257
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.830
a white beard,

258
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.000
a decreasing leg,

259
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.600
an increasing belly?

260
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.500
Is not your voice broken,

261
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.500
your wind short,

262
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.370
your chin double,

263
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.500
your wit single,

264
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.700
and every part about you blastedwith antiquity?

265
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.630
And yet will you call yourselfyoung?

266
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.100
Fie, fie, fie, Sir John.

267
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.130
My lord, I was born at about3:00 in the afternoon

268
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.000
with a white head and somethingof a round belly.

269
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.330
For my voice,

270
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.430
I have lost it with halloing andsinging of anthems.

271
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.470
The truth is, I'm only old injudgment and understanding.

272
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.500
And he that will caper with mefor 1,000 marks,

273
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.570
would him lend me the money andhave at him.

274
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.400
For the box of the ear that theprince gave you,

275
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.230
he gave it like a rude prince,

276
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.230
and you took it like a sensiblelord.

277
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.770
I have chequed him for it, andthe young lion repents.

278
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.670
Marry, not in ashes andsackcloth,

279
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.900
but in new silk and old sack.

280
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.900
Well, God send the prince abetter companion.

281
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.100
God send the companion a betterprince.

282
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.530
I cannot rid my hands of him.

283
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.370
Well, the king hath severed you.

284
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.800
I hear you are going with LordJohn of Lancaster

285
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.000
against the archbishop and theearl of Northumberland.

286
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.770
Yea, I thank your pretty sweetwit for it.

287
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:44.700
But look you pray, all you thatkiss my lady peace at home,

288
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.870
that our armies meet not in ahot day,

289
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.870
for, by the Lord, I take but twoshirts out with me,

290
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.900
and I mean not to sweatextraordinarily.

291
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.030
There is not a dangerous actioncan peep out his head

292
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.330
but I am thrust upon it.

293
00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.200
Well, I cannot last ever.

294
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.170
but it was alway yet the trickof our English nation,

295
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.430
if they have a good thing, tomake it too common.

296
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.770
If ye will needs say I'm an oldman,

297
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.730
you should give me rest.

298
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.100
I would to God my name were not

299
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.600
so terrible to the enemy as itis.

300
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.000
I were better to be eaten todeath with a rust

301
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.300
than to be scoured to nothingwith perpetual motion.

302
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.000
Well, be honest, be honest,

303
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.870
and God bless your expedition.

304
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.100
Will your lordship lend me£1,000 to furnish me forth?

305
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.700
Not a penny; not a penny.

306
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.830
Fare you well.

307
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.130
Commend me to my cousinWestmoreland.

308
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.930
If I do, fillip me with athree-man beetle.

309
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.230
Boy, what money's in my purse?

310
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.630
Seven groats and two pence.

311
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.230
I can get no remedy against thisconsumption of the purse.

312
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.270
Borrowing only lingers andlingers it out,

313
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.700
but the disease is incurable.

314
00:14:55.700 --> 00:15:01.430
Go bear this letter to my lordof Lancaster,

315
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.070
this to the prince,

316
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.370
this to the earl ofWestmoreland,

317
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.100
and this to old mistress Ursula,

318
00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.270
whom I have weekly sworn tomarry

319
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.000
since I perceived the firstwhite hair on my chin.

320
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
About it.

321
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.100
You know where to find me.

322
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:22.870
A pox of this gout or a gout ofthis pox,

323
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.400
for the one or the other playsthe rogue with my great toe.

324
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.730
Well, 'tis no matter if I dohalt.

325
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.570
I have the wars for my color,

326
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.170
and my pension shall seem themore reasonable.

327
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.800
A good wit will make use ofanything.

328
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.170
I will turn diseases tocommodity.

329
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.230
Thus have you heard our causeand known our means.

330
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.630
My most noble friends, I prayyou all,

331
00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.470
speak plainly your opinions ofour hopes.

332
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.600
Our present musters grow uponthe file

333
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.930
to 25,000 men of choice,

334
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.830
and our supplies live largely

335
00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.570
in the hopes of greatNorthumberland,

336
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.370
whose bosom burns with anincensed fire of injuries.

337
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.100
The question then, LordHastings, standeth thus:

338
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.870
whether our present 25,000

339
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.130
may hold up head withoutNorthumberland?

340
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.630
With him, we may.

341
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.630
Aye, marry, there's the point.

342
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.030
But if without him we be thoughttoo feeble,

343
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.270
my judgment is, we should notstep too far

344
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.730
till we had his assistance bythe hand.

345
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.100
For in a theme so bloody facedas this,

346
00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.130
conjecture, expectation, andsurmise of aids incertain

347
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.100
should not be admitted.

348
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.500
Very true, Lord Bardolph,

349
00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.800
for indeed it was youngHotspur's case at Shrewsbury.

350
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.270
It was, my lord, who linedhimself with hopes,

351
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.770
eating the air on promise ofsupply,

352
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.730
flattering himself in project ofa power

353
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.570
much smaller than the smallestof his thoughts.

354
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.300
And so with great imaginationproper to madmen,

355
00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.800
led his powers to death andwinking leaped into destruction.

356
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.570
But, by your leave, it never yetdid hurt

357
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:07.600
to lay down likelihoods andforms of hope.

358
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.800
I think we are a body strongenough,

359
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.030
even as we are, to equal withthe king.

360
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.070
What, is the king but 25,000?

361
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.330
To us no more.

362
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.370
Nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.

363
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.600
For his divisions, as the timesdo brawl,

364
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.370
Are in three heads:

365
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.930
one power against the French andone against Glendower,

366
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.000
perforce the third must take upus.

367
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.630
So is the unfirm king in threedivided,

368
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.170
and his coffers sound withhollow poverty and emptiness.

369
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.300
That he should draw his severalstrengths together

370
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.730
and come against us in fullpuissance,

371
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.100
need not be dreaded.

372
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.530
Let us on and publish theoccasion of our arms.

373
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.430
The commonwealth is sick oftheir own choice.

374
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.070
Their overgreedy love hathsurfeited.

375
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.400
They that when Richard livedwould have him die

376
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.970
are now become enamored on hisgrave.

377
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.730
Thou that threw'st dust upon hisgoodly head

378
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.630
when through proud London hecame sighing on

379
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.400
after the admired heels ofBolingbroke.

380
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.230
Shall we go draw our numbers andset on?

381
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:18.070
We are time's subjects, and timebids be gone.

382
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:26.370
