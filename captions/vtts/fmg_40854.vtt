        SmithBarney presents Explorer.


00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.680



00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.310

        December 26, 2004, Banda Aceh,
        Sumatra, a massive earthquake
      

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.560

        hammers the city.


00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.130



00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.370

        An amateur photographer sets out
        to record the destruction.
      

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:33.910

        But an even worse catastrophe
        speeds his way.
      

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.900

        A wall of devastation hurdling
        across the ocean at up for 500
      

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.150

        miles per house.


00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.790



00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.160

        The cameraman races
        for his life.
      

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.960

        But in Banda Aceh, it's
        too late to run.
      

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.880



00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:13.970

        Tsunamis, hurricanes,
        earthquakes, volcanoes, is our
      

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.070

        planet getting more violent?


00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590

        What can we do about it?


00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.930



00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.780

        2004 will go down as one of the
        deadliest years ever for
      

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.670

        natural disasters, the worst
        hurricane season in memory,
      

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.550

        massive earthquakes, and, of
        course, the devastating
      

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.030

        tsunami that struck
        12 countries.
      

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.920

        They all raise an urgent
        question, are we entering a
      

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.860

        dangerous cycle that could
        cause catastrophes on an
      

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.370

        unprecedented scale.


00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.420



00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.250

        And if so, what can we do to
        survive our violent earth?
      

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.650



00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.730

        Banda Aceh at ground zero.


00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.130



00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.420

        A cameraman films
        an earthquake.
      

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.170

        But the Tsunami that follows
        it catches it by surprise.
      

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.690



00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.100

        He can't outrun the
        killer waves.
      

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.130

        And now he's fighting
        for his life.
      

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.730



00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.070

        Even underwater, he never
        lets go of his camera,
      

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.510

        and climbs to safety.


00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.590



00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.120

        Over 270,000 wouldn't
        be so lucky.
      

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.830

        Because the world was in the
        grip of the worst natural
      

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.660

        disaster in decades.


00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.110



00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.440

        Walls of water up to 100 feet
        high sweeping across the
      

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.060

        Indian Ocean in all
        directions and
      

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.000

        slamming into 12 countries.


00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.950

        A tsunami that sends families,
        villages, entire towns to
      

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.200

        their graves.


00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.080



00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.960

        The massive quake that spawned
        it is so powerful, it lifts
      

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.830

        the earth's crust and moves the
        island of Sumatra over 60
      

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:45.380

        feet, so powerful, it actually
        causes the earth to wobble on
      

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.540

        its axis, slowing its
        revolution, and shortening
      

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.880

        that fateful day by almost
        three microseconds.
      

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.840



00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.560

        The 2004 tsunami is
        a mega disaster
      

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.000

        that came out of nowhere.


00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.550

        Or did it?


00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.290

        The earth appears to
        be getting more
      

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.230

        deadly than ever before.


00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.940

        We know that there are many
        cases where the worse has not
      

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.810

        yet been seen.


00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.770

        Are natural disasters
        becoming more
      

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.580

        frequently and more deadly?


00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.830

        To find out, we'll explore one
        of the the century's most
      

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.750

        destructive event and examined
        three critical cities where
      

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.330

        earthquakes, volcanoes, and
        hurricanes are poised to
      

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.010

        strike death blows against
        helpless populations.
      

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:54.990



00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.480

        Can we avoid the outbursts
        of out violent planet?
      

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.980



00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:08.280

        Or are we like this man on a
        beach in Thailand, helpless in
      

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.600

        the path of mother
        nature's fury.
      

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:22.670



00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.000

        This suburb of Banda Aceh in
        Northern Sumatra just before
      

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.540

        the tsunami, and after.


00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.110



00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.620

        One bridge survived the ocean's
        onslaught barely.
      

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.450



00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.900

        Yesterday 30,000 Sumatrans lived
        in sight of this bridge.
      

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.980

        But the oceans upheaval killed
        nine out of ten people here.
      

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.500



00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.730

        Yulianto and his son Rito
        miraculously beat the odds.
      

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:09.720



00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.090

        We don't have anything anymore
        now except what
      

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.340

        we have on our bodies.


00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.280



00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.640

        2004's disaster robbed Yulianto
        and Rito of more than
      

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.890

        their possessions.


00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:32.980



00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.070

        Father and son scour refugee
        camps in search of Rito's two
      

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.900

        sisters and his mother.


00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.820



00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.430

        I feel that since I was saved,
        than maybe my mother's out
      

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.340

        there somewhere.


00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.590

        We're looking for everyone.


00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:59.470



00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.020

        It's been a century since
        the major tsunami had
      

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.060

        hit northern Sumatra.


00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.310

        But the islanders fear they
        haven't seen the worst. The
      

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.240

        monster that terrifies
        them came from a
      

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.880

        commonplace force of nature.


00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.380



00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.060

        About a dozen tectonic plates
        make up the earth's crust.
      

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.210

        Floating on a sea of magma,
        these massive slabs constantly
      

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.280

        jostle each other.


00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.120

        Just off the coast of Sumatra,
        a fault line where the India
      

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.050

        plate and the Burma
        plate meet.
      

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.080

        As one subducted the other,
        it released a
      

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.060

        tremendous amount of energy.


00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.980

        This is a thrust fault.


00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.830

        And it created the
        killer quake.
      

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.880



00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.470

        And because it happened under
        water, it displaced a massive
      

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:01.560

        volume of ocean, breeding the
        quake's deadly twin, tsunami.
      

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:19.230



00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.440

        The quake was among the most
        devastating in history
      

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.120

        measuring up to 9.3 on
        the Richter scale.
      

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.270

        It exploded with the force
        of more than 36,000
      

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.520

        Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs.


00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.450



00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.530

        Its staggering size makes
        scientists worry about the
      

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.780

        future of our planet.


00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.390



00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.920

        Geologist John Ebel desperately
        scours seismic
      

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.710

        records to find out.


00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.990

        Could more be coming?


00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.680



00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.820

        This is really one of the most
        profound earthquakes we've
      

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.380

        seen so far on planet earth.


00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.410

        From 1946 to 1964 we had several
        earthquakes of this
      

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.790

        size take place over a
        very short time span.
      

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:11.730

        Then we go 40 years after 1964,
        nothing this large on
      

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.820

        the earth until 2004.


00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.550

        Risking aftershocks and disease,
        scientists take stock
      

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.480

        of just how large it was.


00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.270



00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.990

        Every time I turn the corner,
        it's just something else just
      

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.170

        blows my mind.


00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.490

        Here's a boat on
        top of a pickup
      

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.470

        truck wedged in a building.


00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.760

        Think of the force it must
        take to bend a truck bed.
      

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:47.020



00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.470

        Tsunami scientist, Jose Borrero,
        using surveying tools
      

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.880

        and GPS mapping to quantify
        the tsunami's
      

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.610

        power at maximum impact.


00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.540



00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.040

        An analysis of the wave's
        construction could offer ways
      

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.260

        to protect people from
        the next one.
      

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.650



00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.600

        And on a planet that seems every
        more violent, the next
      

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.080

        one is almost guaranteed.


00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.860



00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.300

        Already Borrero reaches a
        conclusion that should send
      

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.340

        chills to coastal city
        dwellers everywhere.
      

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.770

        Living in a city actually makes
        people more vulnerable
      

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.590

        to this disaster
        than elsewhere.
      

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.030



00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.580

        If you're say, in a coconut
        grove or something, and
      

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.120

        there's a tsunami coming, the
        water is going to spread out.
      

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.290

        But here, you don't have much
        chance of escaping.
      

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.570



00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.340

        Escape, almost impossible.


00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.620



00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.260

        The surging water tore through
        town gathering cars, truck,
      

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.650

        and building debris into a
        raging wall of destruction.
      

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.150



00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.640

        As people scrambled for safety,
        the town's buildings
      

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.290

        channelled the unstoppable
        juggernaut into narrow streets
      

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:12.050

        where it bulldozed everything
        in its path.
      

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.950

        Its speed increased and
        the reach of death
      

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.200

        climbed ever higher.


00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:25.070



00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.270

        The difference between life
        and death was literally
      

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.520

        measured in inches.


00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.060



00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.460

        If you were here, you
        would have lived.
      

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.750

        I you were here, you
        would have died.
      

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:47.530



00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:52.480

        Death may be planning another
        visit to Sumatra.
      

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.320

        One geologist estimates that
        only a fraction of this fault,
      

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.190

        just 6% of its total length
        caused the killer quake.
      

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:06.860

        That leaves 94%, some 2,400
        miles of the fault line
      

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.160

        apparently dormant.


00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.320



00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.570

        There's more.


00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.490



00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.810

        This quake may spawn a
        future killer quake
      

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.210

        somewhere else in the world.


00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.930



00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.920

        A new theory suggests
        earthquakes are caused by a
      

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.170

        global chain reaction.


00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.140



00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.030

        And Sumatra's hammer blow may,
        itself, have been triggered by
      

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.810

        and earthquake a year earlier
        and half a world away.
      

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:50.620



00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:57.020

        December 26, 2003, exactly one
        year before Banda Aceh's
      

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.970

        killer wave, a massive
        earthquake flattened the city
      

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:11.800

        of Bam, Iran, taking
        some 26,000 lives.
      

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.820

        Bam is about 3,000 miles
        from Sumatra.
      

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.170

        The two disasters may be part
        of a deadly chain reaction.
      

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.630



00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.950

        Our planets fault lines may
        act like a spider's web.
      

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.960

        Moving one thread could affect
        others with deadly results.
      

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.820



00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.030

        If these plates are all part
        of one vast interconnected
      

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:41.090

        system, then a movement in a
        plate on one side of the world
      

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.620

        will cause jostling on the other
        side of the world so why
      

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:51.750

        shouldn't the collision of two
        plates in Iran produce a
      

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.180

        series of shock waves and
        judders which eventually, a
      

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.080

        year later, caused the Indian
        plate to subduct below the
      

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.820

        Burma plate, which is what
        happened off Banda Aceh.
      

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:05.660



00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.290

        If the theory was true, the
        Banda Aceh plate could set off
      

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.730

        another somewhere else
        in the world.
      

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:16.830



00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:23.020

        Many major cities are near fault
        lines, San Francisco,
      

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:29.500

        Mexico City, Taipei,
        Tokyo, Los Angeles.
      

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.960



00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.670

        But if one city is poised to
        suffer one of history's worst
      

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:40.480

        natural disasters, it
        is Istanbul, Turkey.
      

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:47.340



00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:52.290

        A North Anatolian fault line,
        the junction two tectonic
      

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.870

        plates has been coughing up
        major quakes with stunning
      

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.010

        frequency in the last
        half-century.
      

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.860



00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.300

        Like cascading dominoes,
        the quakes are
      

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.640

        bearing down on Istanbul.


00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.840



00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.710

        The death toll caused by
        a quake here would be
      

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.190

        staggering.


00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.840

        This home to ten million is the
        front line for examining
      

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.090

        our violent earth.


00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.460



00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.370

        Hundreds of thousands
        could die.
      

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.000



00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.980

        Why so many?


00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.640

        Each year, 250,000 new people
        crowd into Istanbul and its
      

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.890

        surrounding suburbs.


00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.560



00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.930

        For years apartment buildings
        sprang up to house the influx.
      

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.880

        Most were made of shoddy
        materials and thrown together
      

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.460

        at a reckless pace.


00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.800

        They're unable to fend off the
        slightest tremor, like the
      

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.260

        village that was hit when the
        last domino fell, just 65
      

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.510

        miles from Istanbul.


00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:06.740



00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.610

        August, 1999, a quake measuring
        7.4 on the Richter
      

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:18.040

        scale strikes the neighborhood
        Arzu Demir calls home.
      

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.790

        It's 3:02 in the morning when
        her world explodes.
      

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:25.940



00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.670

        At first I could not understand
        what happened.
      

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.020

        I heard my mom and
        dad's voices.
      

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.390

        I said don't come
        into the room.
      

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.040

        Get out.


00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.630

        Save yourself.


00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:42.850

        They didn't listen.


00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:47.720

        The quake thunders
        for 45 seconds.
      

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.980

        Demir's poorly constructed
        apartment building doesn't
      

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:52.230

        stand a chance.


00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.350



00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.920

        Within seconds, the top
        three floors collapse.
      

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.840



00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.360

        She and her siblings
        should be dead.
      

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.340

        But somehow they fall into a
        pocket in the rubble just big
      

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.590

        enough to hold them.


00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.420



00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.030

        Demir is severely injured.


00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.380

        Her time is running out.


00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.670



00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.040

        For hours rescue workers grapple
        with debris and slabs
      

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.810

        of concrete looking for any
        signs of survivors.
      

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.660



00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.570

        I was in immense pain,
        endless pain.
      

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.150

        I started to hear voices.


00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:45.020



00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.090

        Her parents are among the
        more 17,000 killed.
      

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.810

        But Demir and her siblings
        survive.
      

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.960



00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:02.070

        Had this quake struck Istanbul,
        an estimated 35,000
      

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.120

        buildings would have
        been destroyed.
      

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.680



00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.660

        For Demir, an unspeakable
        ordeal.
      

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.570



00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.920

        But the truth is, violent
        eruptions actually stabilize
      

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.170

        our planet.


00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.540



00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.880

        Earthquakes act as release
        valves for pressure building
      

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.280

        deep in t he planets core.


00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.410

        Without them, the pressure would
        build until the earth's
      

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:38.860

        crust could no longer contain
        it, resulting in an apocalypse
      

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.250

        obliterating life on earth.


00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:53.090



00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.210

        How can we learn to live with
        these terrifying events?
      

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:03.770



00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:07.360

        One idea is to diffuse the
        power of big quakes by
      

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.510

        creating small, man-made ones.


00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:15.220

        A machine already exists
        to do just that.
      

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.560



00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.030

        It born at the height
        of the Cold War.
      

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.860

        A Soviet-made earth
        quake machine.
      

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.460



00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.930

        Designed as a new energy source,
        it yielded as much
      

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.900

        power as a small nuclear
        reactor.
      

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:38.140



00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.210

        Seismologists harnessed that
        power to measure the earth's
      

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.670

        crust. A rocket engine shot a
        burst of energy through an
      

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:52.730

        electromagnetic field 30
        miles straight down.
      

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.860

        In affect, Soviet scientists
        were shooting lightning bolts
      

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.430

        into the earth, yet they
        were surprised by
      

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.190

        what happened next.


00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.080

        The earth shot back
        with earth quakes.
      

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:11.470



00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.240

        By creating small quakes, the
        machine could relieve pressure
      

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.420

        building under the earth's
        crust. This might avert the
      

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.010

        kind of mega quake bearing
        down on Istanbul.
      

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:27.540



00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.000

        But if the quake maker were
        positioned over a fault, no
      

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.500

        one knows what it would do,
        the fear, a catastrophic
      

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.820

        seismic event, an unstoppable
        chain reaction of earthquakes
      

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.880

        and tsunamis around the globe.


00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.830



00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.100

        Experimentation with mother
        nature is a very, very
      

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.420

        difficult thing that we
        have to be careful of.
      

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.880

        We might actually trigger a
        bigger earthquake then the one
      

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.130

        we were trying to prevent.


00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.870



00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:07.650

        The US military bought the quake
        machines Cold War ended.
      

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.120

        Where is it today?


00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.370

        Unknown.


00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:15.500



00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.900

        But the quake machine
        isn't our only hope.
      

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.440



00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.730

        For decades, hydrologists have
        observed that when wells are
      

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.000

        dug deep into the earth, they
        can generate small tremors.
      

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.850



00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.530

        This happens because water can
        push minor faults apart
      

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.820

        causing the plates to slide.


00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:41.740

        The theory is the same as with
        the quake machines, more small
      

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.550

        quakes instead of a big one.


00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.200

        But like the quake machine,
        the issue is control.
      

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.870



00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.200

        Inducing quakes is an
        inexact science.
      

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.090

        Once you begin using water to
        create tremors, you might
      

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:05.130

        instead release a killer
        quake, like the one
      

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.380

        threatening Istanbul.


00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:12.890



00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.770

        Seismic engineer, Mustafa
        Erdik isn't counting on
      

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.490

        dubious intervention
        to save his city.
      

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.750

        He's seeking real
        solutions today.
      

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.980

        Because it's not a question
        of if, but when.
      

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:31.250

        The chances of having a large
        earthquake in this city in the
      

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.420

        next 30 years are about 65%.


00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:39.390

        So my feelings tell me that
        it's pretty much due.
      

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:43.190

        His secret weapon in quake
        prediction is a former church
      

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.230

        turned mosque called
        Hagia Sophia.
      

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:49.280



00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.160

        It's a sacred site by day, A
        high tech early warning system
      

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.410

        around the clock.


00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.490



00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.530

        Erdik has crammed the mosque
        with monitors that transmit
      

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.590

        data to sensors on his
        hilltop laboratory.
      

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.910

        The mosque and more than 50
        other locations across the
      

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.680

        city act as ears on the
        ground alerting him to
      

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.570

        any signs of tremors.


00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.000

        At the first hint of a quake,
        the system automatically shuts
      

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.950

        down major industrial plants
        to avoid leaks
      

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.200

        of dangerous materials.


00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.300



00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:30.310

        At the same time, it sends
        emergency response teams a map
      

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.370

        that identifies hardest
        hit areas.
      

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:42.130



00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.350

        At most, the system will
        diminish the damage, not
      

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.090

        eliminate it.


00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.550

        But these efforts could save
        thousands of lives.
      

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:55.510



00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.790

        However, there's a bigger
        problem affecting not just
      

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.850

        Istanbul, but everything city
        on a major fault line.
      

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.660

        The earth is prone to periods of
        increased seismic activity.
      

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.250

        And we might be entering
        one such phase.
      

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:15.280

        The most recent quakes could
        be just the beginning.
      

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.000



00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.340

        Meanwhile, we're compounding
        the danger.
      

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:27.470

        Like Istanbul citizens, people
        all of the world aren't moving
      

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.090

        out of danger zones, they're
        moving into them.
      

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:37.000



00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.750

        And earthquakes aren't the most
        explosive disasters our
      

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.440

        violent earth can throw at us.


00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.350



00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.430

        Natural disaster dominate
        our headlines.
      

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.000

        As body counts soar, we feel
        like unwelcome guests on an
      

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.590

        increasingly hostile planet.


00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:04.310



00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.960

        And nowhere is the peril
        more apparent than in
      

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.580

        the shadow of a volcano.


00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.950



00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:18.480

        The earth is home to some
        600 active volcanoes.
      

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.090

        Half a billion live within
        their blast range.
      

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.120



00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:30.700

        Some are known killers,
        Montserrat in the Caribbean.
      

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.950

        The 1997 eruption buried the
        nation's capital in ash.
      

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.110



00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.860

        Mount Pinatubo in
        the Philippines.
      

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.550

        Its 1991 blast was ten times the
        size of Mount St. Helens.
      

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.840



00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.020

        Active volcanoes can
        appear dormant.
      

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.560

        But many are, in fact,
        ticking time bombs.
      

00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:04.970



00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.740

        Naples, Italy, the uneasy
        neighbor of a seismic serial
      

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:13.750

        killer, making it one
        city most likely to
      

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:15.000

        suffer a fiery death.


00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.290



00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:24.160

        Here 600,000 people live
        within the red zone.
      

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.260

        That's the blast range of what's
        undoubtedly the world'd
      

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:28.920

        most treacherous volcano.


00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.680



00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:40.830

        Vesuvius, a killer with a rap
        sheet of a mile long.
      

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.830

        Its historic eruption in 79 AD
        entombed two entire cities,
      

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:51.600

        Pompeii and Herculaneum, each
        about as close to Vesuvius as
      

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.850

        downtown Naples.


00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:56.410



00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.590

        Their victims are haunting
        reminders of an ancient
      

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:04.680

        disaster, and a warning
        to Neapolitans today.
      

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.090



00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.730

        While most of the world knows
        the story of Pompeii, few
      

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.470

        realized just how often
        Vesuvius erupts.
      

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.830



00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.390

        The last time was a little
        more than a half a
      

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:29.180

        century ago in 1944.


00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:34.880

        The Allied forces had invaded
        Italy and were driving north.
      

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:39.440

        A few tremors from a quiet
        volcano was the last on
      

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.760

        Neapolitans mind.


00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:47.620



00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.570

        For more than a week, pumice,
        volcanic gases, and searing
      

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.210

        hot ash shot out.


00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.940

        Rivers of lava poured down
        the mountainside.
      

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:01.060



00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:05.490

        We had the sensation that our
        life could come to an end in
      

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.380

        the most horrible way.


00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.270



00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:16.420

        The 1944 eruption killed
        26 Neapolitans.
      

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:21.200

        The city got off easy, which is
        perhaps why its lesson was
      

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.450

        seemingly ignored.


00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.180



00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.150

        Because from 1944 to 2004,
        those living in Vesuvius'
      

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:38.280

        shadow grew to 600,000.


00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.620

        And all the while, the mass
        murderer has been building
      

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:42.870

        toward disaster.


00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:50.430



00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.850

        The city is so concerned,
        they're actually paying people
      

00:28:53.850 --> 00:29:04.220

        to leave. City official Marco Di
        Lello pleads with families
      

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:08.730

        to move out of the red zone,
        the area most likely to be
      

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.290

        devastated by the
        next eruption.
      

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:15.770



00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.920

        The Morano family is considering
        Di Lello's plea.
      

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.960

        In exchange for a payment of
        around $35,000, they would
      

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.840

        abandon their home
        of many years.
      

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.140



00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.460

        If they do, that's one down
        and thousands to go.
      

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.260



00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.390

        But why haven't the Moranos and
        others like them left the
      

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:40.640

        red zone already?


00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.550



00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.850

        Vesuvius, like other volcanoes
        that go long periods between
      

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:49.960

        eruptions, holds a deadly
        attraction.
      

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.760



00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.190

        Mineral rich volcanic soil
        creates an inviting paradise
      

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.000

        on the outside.


00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.200

        Beneath, murder brews
        in its molten heart.
      

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.560



00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.090

        Like earthquakes, most active
        volcanoes are born from the
      

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.880

        rubbing of tectonic plates,
        which brings up magma from
      

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.280

        deep in the earth.


00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.590



00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.730

        Some volcanoes in the middle of
        plates aren't at volatile.
      

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.540

        They continuously spew
        lava relieving
      

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:26.790

        the underground pressure.


00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:32.760



00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.700

        Volcanoes on faults, like
        Vesuvius, build magma and
      

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:46.500

        pressure for years until they
        erupt with explosive force, a
      

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.420

        force of nature that's
        impossible to stop.
      

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.840



00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:59.070

        It would happened like this,
        first excessive gas leaks,
      

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.320

        bulges, and swelling.


00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.340



00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.190

        Then things get shaky.


00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.920

        It's times to run.


00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:16.820

        Because after those tremors,
        ghostly silence followed by
      

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.070

        detonation.


00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:32.450



00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:36.200

        By studying these signs,
        scientists can predict when
      

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.450

        volcanoes will erupt.


00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:42.000



00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.270

        And few volcanoes are as closely
        monitored as Vesuvius.
      

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:50.610



00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.310

        I think it's the most dangerous
        volcano in the world
      

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:59.830

        Because there is no way to save
        the people without the
      

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.810

        complete evacuation
        of the area.
      

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:04.520



00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.920

        Volcanologist Giuseppe
        Mastrolorenzo keeps a close
      

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.220

        watch on Vesuvius' gases
        and temperature.
      

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.530



00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.350

        Today the monster
        sleeps quietly.
      

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.300



00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.620

        When Mastrolorenzo detects
        tell-tale signs, he can give
      

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.140

        Naples a full month's warning.


00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:29.050



00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.840

        What he can't do is force
        Neopolitan's to flea.
      

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:45.330



00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:48.730

        One family already has.


00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.140

        Back at the Morano household,
        they've decided to get out
      

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.390

        while the getting is good.


00:32:53.390 --> 00:33:02.520



00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:07.600

        At least with volcanoes, you
        can leave ground zero.
      

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.600

        But what about when the
        disaster comes to you.
      

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.780

        Another of our planet's furies
        literally arises from thin air
      

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.040

        and delivers savage destruction


00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.380

        with lightning speed.


00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.240



00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.730

        But even if hurricanes are the
        most elusive natural disaster,
      

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:32.070

        they may offer the best chance
        we have of actual
      

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.510

        intervention.


00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:40.590

        Small changes can really have
        a big effect on the weather.
      

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.940

        Can we stop one of these
        killers in its tracks?
      

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:52.020



00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:58.470

        1992's Hurricane Andrew, with
        gusts up to 165 miles per
      

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.490

        hour, this category 5 terror,
        was the most destructive
      

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.330

        United States hurricane
        on record.
      

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:09.000



00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.340

        One like it might be
        headed your way.
      

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.290



00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.040

        Because if you live anywhere
        along to the hurricane belt
      

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:22.290

        that straddles our planet, your
        ocean view might change
      

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.200

        into a monster like this.


00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.580



00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.120

        Hurricanes are incredibly
        powerful.
      

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.190

        A single major hurricane is
        expending more power, more
      

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:36.160

        energy, than all the electric
        utilities on
      

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.560

        earth combined together.


00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.040



00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:46.140

        2004 was the most active
        hurricane season in
      

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.840

        more than 50 years.


00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.800

        It's part of a spike in
        hurricane activity that began
      

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.470

        in the 1990s and could
        last for decades.
      

00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:00.020



00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:03.790

        And few cities in the world
        stand to suffer more from just
      

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.170

        one major blow than
        New Orleans.
      

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.870



00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:12.760

        This party town dodges
        storms every year.
      

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.450



00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:19.680

        But its Achilles' heal is a
        densely populated region that
      

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.720

        lies below sea level.


00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.220

        Locals call it The Bowl.


00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.860



00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:31.040

        When a big storm does strike
        the Big Easy, it'll likely
      

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:38.130

        fill The Bowl, taking
        some 50,000 lives.
      

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.290

        What we're talking about,
        in this case, is tens of
      

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.490

        thousands of casualties, deaths,
        and affecting an area
      

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:50.240

        that would be 30 or
        40 square miles.
      

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.100

        Every hurricane season a
        nightmare reappears.
      

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:56.500



00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:02.510

        September, 2004, Hurricane Ivan
        churns through the Gulf
      

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:04.760

        of Mexico gathering strength.


00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.620



00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:12.400

        Near landfall it's a category 5
        storm with winds topping out
      

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:18.650

        at 160 miles per hour.


00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.630

        As Ivan's track swerves works
        unpredictably, the visions
      

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:28.750

        begin, visions of a storm surge
        blowing through Bourbon
      

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:40.850

        Street, of houses, buildings,
        bursting apart in the wind,
      

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:44.990

        and most frightening of all,
        visions of a city drowning.
      

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:53.400



00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:57.710

        As Ivan approaches, 600,000
        people heed the warnings and
      

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.960

        evacuate New Orleans.


00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.260



00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.550

        But Hurricane Ivan ends up
        veering east and striking the
      

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.240

        Florida panhandle.


00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.220

        It kills dozens and causes
        billions in damages.
      

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.350



00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:16.700

        It's a terrible tragedy
        for Florida.
      

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.550



00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.170

        But New Orleans survived
        its annual
      

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:23.420

        game of Russian roulette.


00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.870



00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:29.690

        The city knows its
        time will come.
      

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.510

        But scientists are desperate
        to find out when.
      

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:38.010



00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.140

        The records only go
        back 150 years.
      

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.020

        And not a single major storm
        has hit New Orleans.
      

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.380

        So accurately predicting how
        often they strike has been
      

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:55.370

        impossible, until today.


00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:57.870



00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.920

        Louisiana State University
        scientist Kam-Biu Liu believes
      

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.190

        the answer lies buried
        in the mud.
      

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:07.530



00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:10.050

        Liu is the founding father
        of a field called
      

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:13.640

        paleotempestology, the study of
        historic weather patterns.
      

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.840



00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.860

        When a major hurricane strikes,
        the storm surge
      

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.570

        creates the layer of sediment.


00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.950

        Analyzing samples of mud should
        show how often New
      

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:27.290

        Orleans has been hit.


00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.690



00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.210

        Today Liu is pulling core
        samples from some nine feet
      

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.460

        down near New Orleans.


00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.000



00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.340

        That nine feet gives Liu a
        picture 5,000 years into the
      

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.080

        past.


00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.770

        We must know the past before
        we can predict
      

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.940

        or forecast a future.


00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.040

        You may say the $30 billion
        question is how often does a
      

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.770

        city like New Orleans get hit
        by a category 5 hurricane.
      

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.660



00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.290

        Back in the lab, Liu splits
        the core in half.
      

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.820

        The tell-tale sediment of a
        major hurricane turns up about
      

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.950

        every 30 inches or 300 years.


00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:23.020

        Until we got to this part, and
        the most distinct layers are
      

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:24.050

        this and that.


00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:26.270

        And this is a thicker one.


00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.210

        You see how sharp
        the counter is?
      

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.510

        And this is definitely
        an event.
      

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:34.090



00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:38.400

        The spacing of events tells Dr.
        Liu New Orleans is living
      

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.900

        on borrowed time.


00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.730

        A major hurricane
        is way overdue.
      

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.530



00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.520

        New Orleans, so far, has
        been very lucky.
      

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.240

        Because it kind of dodged
        a bullet during
      

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.910

        the last 100 years.


00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.980

        So even though New
        Orleans has been
      

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.760

        lucky, we must be prepared.


00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:03.970



00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.280

        They city is not entirely
        defenseless.
      

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.920



00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.760

        Over the last century, the Army
        Corps of Engineers has
      

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:18.170

        built a system of levees
        15 to 20 feet time.
      

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.200

        That might stop a flood
        caused by a
      

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.400

        category 2 or 3 hurricane.


00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.090

        But a big one would send waters
        over the barrier.
      

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:33.020



00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:37.600

        Coastal engineer, Joe Suhayda
        knows New Orleans' nightmare
      

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.420

        is measured in feet.


00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.770

        This is to protect
        from a category 3
      

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.750

        or category 2 storm.


00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:47.360

        But in the worst case scenario,
        the actual water
      

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.050

        level would be up around
        the top of my head.
      

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.430

        So it would be about six
        feet or so above
      

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:55.800

        the top of this levee.


00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.730

        Residents here call the
        nightmare scenario "filling
      

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:04.250

        The Bowl." A storm surge bursts
        over the levees and has
      

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.500

        no where to go.


00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.710



00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.070

        The city becomes a lake.


00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.330



00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.710

        It's flood waters are rendered
        toxic by sewage and chemical
      

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.960

        waste and infested
        with disease.
      

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.020



00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:26.110

        Cleanup all buy impossible.


00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:32.390



00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.480

        Joe Suhayda wants to go to
        extremes to prevent that
      

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.730

        apocalypse.


00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.460



00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.490

        He proposes building a massive
        new wall to shield The Bowl.
      

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:47.430



00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:52.240

        But there may be another way,
        by tackling the storm before
      

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.890

        it gets here.


00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.940

        One of the most destructive
        disasters, hurricanes alone
      

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.430

        may be tamed.


00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.830

        We have ways to change the
        atmosphere in a way that other
      

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.490

        earth scientists just wouldn't
        be able to do.
      

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.290

        Atmospheric scientists, Ross
        Hoffman, has done the
      

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:14.610

        impossible.


00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.420

        He's changed a hurricane's path,
        and even slowed them
      

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.400

        down, at least on a computer.


00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.880



00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.930

        He's shown that even minor
        changes in the conditions
      

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.550

        surrounding a hurricane can
        dramatically change the
      

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.230

        storm's behavior.


00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.670

        In an attempt to reduce the
        winds by seeding the clouds
      

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:40.930

        near the center of the storm
        with silver iodide crystals.
      

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:42.990

        But he's not the first
        in a frantic
      

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.550

        quest to tame the monster.


00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:50.300



00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.560

        In the 1960s, the US embarked
        on an ambitious experiment
      

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:59.180

        called Project Stormfury.


00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:02.380

        The team tried dropping
        chemicals into the wind
      

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.560

        currents just outside the
        hurricane's fast-moving eye
      

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:10.870

        wall, hoping to slow down
        its strongest winds.
      

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.450

        But results?


00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:15.540

        Disappointing.


00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.300

        The bold initiative never
        succeeded in weakening
      

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.350

        hurricanes.


00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.760

        Project Stormfury was canned.


00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:27.370



00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:32.210

        Today other scientists want to
        try a different approach, one
      

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.820

        that attacks a hurricane's
        moisture supply.
      

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.940

        We know that hurricanes get
        their main source of energies
      

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:43.000

        at the ocean's surface.


00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.820

        Hurricanes live on two things,
        water and heat.
      

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.880

        Dry up the water in hurricanes'
        clouds, and
      

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.560

        theoretically, it evaporates.


00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.060



00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:02.880

        A team out of Florida is
        experimenting with a gel that
      

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.660

        absorbs more than 3,000 times
        its mass in moisture.
      

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:11.520

        The trouble is to deploy enough
        gel, you'd have to fly
      

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.530

        almost 400 supertanker aircrafts
        into the hurricane
      

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:22.950

        about every 90 minutes,
        a costly
      

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.140

        solution years from reality.


00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:29.400



00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.280

        Yet even if we had a proven
        strategy to eliminate
      

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.800

        hurricanes, we might
        have second
      

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.180

        thoughts about using it.


00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.700



00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.630

        Hurricanes provide enormous
        environmental benefits by
      

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:47.340

        redistributing heat
        in the atmosphere.
      

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.380

        If we like the earth the way
        it is now, then we have two
      

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.390

        accept some of the
        side effects.
      

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.410

        And hurricanes are one
        of those things.
      

00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.640



00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:03.820

        Accepting the mortal danger of
        hurricanes and other natural
      

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.860

        disasters may be a bitter
        pill to swallow.
      

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.610



00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:14.560

        As we've seen, human plans to
        avert mega disasters are
      

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.850

        futuristic, even foolhardy.


00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.490



00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.520

        How vulnerable are we on a
        planet that seems to be
      

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:27.160

        getting more violent,
        more deadly, more
      

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.550

        hostile every year?


00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:37.500



00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.730

        Sometimes it's hard to escape
        the fear that we're living on
      

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.360

        an ever more violent planet.


00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:49.760



00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.040

        Just three months after 2004's
        mega disaster, Banda Aceh's
      

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:59.450

        worst nightmare comes true.


00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:05.050

        Another major quake explodes off
        the coast. Shock waves are
      

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:06.300

        felt around the world.


00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.960



00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:15.110

        Hardened by 2004's catastrophe,
        victims in Banda
      

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:21.090

        Aceh await a new killer tsunami
        that never comes.
      

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.780



00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.030

        Why?


00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.530



00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.820

        One theory, this quake occurred
        in shallower waters.
      

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.540



00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:40.000

        Less water displaced means
        a tragedy averted.
      

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.910

        But did this new quake confirm
        fears of an endless chain
      

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.300

        reaction of quakes?


00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:59.190



00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:05.800

        Banda Aceh still reels from
        December's punishing wave. And
      

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.810

        with the latest quake, new proof
        of a planet seemingly
      

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.060

        out of control.


00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:24.230



00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:29.000

        This woman last saw her family
        shopping on this street.
      

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.350

        One of these buildings
        holds their bodies.
      

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:44.380



00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.310

        She cannot rest until they do.


00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:51.580

        And we cannot escape the
        fear that we could
      

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.970

        share a similar fate.


00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:57.840



00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.860

        Some scientists predict another
        mega tsunami could
      

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:08.050

        come from an entirely different
        source, not a quake,
      

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.300

        but a volcano.


00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.220



00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.330

        This huge volcano is part of
        the Canary Islands in the
      

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:18.270

        Eastern Atlantic.


00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:20.590

        It's known as Cumbre Vieja.


00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:25.010

        And geologists fear that if it
        erupts, some of its wake could
      

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:30.990

        crash into the sea, generating
        a tsunami so big it could
      

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:35.480

        strike Northern Africa, Western
        Europe, and even the
      

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.450

        Eastern seaboard of
        the United States.
      

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:45.500



00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.780

        Scenarios like this make
        us feel the earth is
      

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.030

        getting more violent.


00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.890



00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.140

        Here are the facts.


00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:58.420



00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:03.200

        Volcanoes, up to 60
        erupt every year.
      

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.810

        And with more people moving into
        red zones, the death toll
      

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.060

        is sure to rise.


00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.260



00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.900

        Earthquakes, the planet
        does suffer periods of
      

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.790

        more intense activity.


00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:17.520

        Are we in one now?


00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.510

        Too soon to know.


00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.770

        But the signs are disturbing.


00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.460



00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:28.230

        Hurricanes, they've been on the
        rise since the mid-1990s.
      

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.460

        And they could be getting
        more powerful.
      

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.670



00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:37.850

        Some believe global warming
        provides more fuel for
      

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.100

        hurricanes.


00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.470



00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:45.130

        That's bad news for cities
        like New Orleans.
      

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:49.340



00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.080

        But the increase in storms may
        just be part of a normal
      

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:54.330

        atmospheric cycle.


00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:07.390



00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:10.090

        This is the earth simply showing
        that it's a living
      

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:15.830

        entity and it's flexing its
        muscles, it's breathing, it's
      

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:18.930

        creating and recreating.


00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:22.250

        It would have to destroy some of
        itself in order to recreate
      

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:23.500

        more of itself.


00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:32.740



00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:36.990

        There are six times more fatal
        disasters reported today than
      

00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:40.320

        in the 1960s.


00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.200

        But the violent earth
        is not to blame.
      

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.100

        The real cause, around half
        the world's people live in
      

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.220

        danger zones prone to inevitable
        earth catastrophes.
      

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:56.300



00:50:56.300 --> 00:51:00.390

        Most of these places are in
        poorer countries, soaring
      

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:03.530

        populations, poor building
        quality.
      

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:07.220

        And the absence of warning
        systems mean rising death
      

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:08.560

        tolls are a certainty.


00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:19.020



00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:23.480

        For rich and poor, our best
        options are improving
      

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.260

        prediction and getting
        out of harm's way.
      

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:37.560

        Near volcanoes, in earthquake
        zones, on coastlines
      

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.660

        vulnerable to hurricanes
        and tsunamis.
      

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:46.100



00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:48.490

        We live on the edge.


00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.410

        And we occasionally pay the
        price for doing so.
      

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:54.540

        Because what makes places
        beautiful are the forces that,
      

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.370

        from time to time,
        destroy them.
      

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:59.220



00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.260

        Destruction will always
        be a part of earth's
      

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.510

        rejuvenating processes.


00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.340



00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.350

        But for many of us, it's our
        choice whether we'll stand in
      

00:52:09.350 --> 00:52:10.640

        the path of disaster.


00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:37.060
