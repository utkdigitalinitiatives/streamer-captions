00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.970


2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.200


3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.330
What, are Ancient Pistol and youfriends yet?

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.530
For my part, I care not.

5
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.530
I say little,

6
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.070
but when time shall serve,

7
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.500
there shall be smiles.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.670
But that shall be as it may.

9
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.230
I dare not fight,

10
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.570
but I will wink and hold outmine iron.

11
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.400
It is a simple one, but what,though?

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130
It will toast cheese,

13
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.700
and it will endure cold asanother man's sword will,

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.400
and there's an end.

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.530
I will bestow a breakfast tomake you two friends,

16
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.930
and we'll be, all three, swornbrothers to France.

17
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.630
Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.

18
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.430
Faith, I will live so long as Imay,

19
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.870
that's the certain of it,

20
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.670
and when I cannot live anylonger,

21
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400
I will do as I may.

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.730
That is my rest.

23
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.000
That is the rendezvous of it.

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.130
It is certain he is married toNell Quickly,

25
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.630
and certainly, she did youwrong,

26
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.170
for you was trothplight to her.

27
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.570
I cannot tell.

28
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.330
Things must be as they may.

29
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.800
Men may sleep,

30
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.600
and they may have their throatsabout them

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
at that time,

32
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.270
and some say knives have edges.

33
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.830
It must be as it may.

34
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.100
Though patience be a tired mare,yet she will plod.

35
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.630
There must be conclusions.

36
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.600
Well, I cannot tell.

37
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.830
How now, mine host, Pistol.

38
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.930
Base tike, call'st thou me host?

39
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.170
Now, by this hand, I scorn theterm.

40
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.000
Nor will my Nell keep lodgers.

41
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.130
No, by my troth,

42
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.200
for we cannot lodge or board

43
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.070
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen

44
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.170
that live honestly by the prickof their needles,

45
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.000
but it will be thought we keep abawdy house straight.

46
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.170
Ha!

47
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.870
Oh, well a day, Lady, if he benot drawn.

48
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.870
Now we shall see wilful adulteryand murder committed.

49
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.870
Good Lieutenant!

50
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.870
Good Corporal!

51
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.000
Offer nothing here.

52
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.230
Pish!

53
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.300
Pish for thee, Iceland dog,

54
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.000
thou prick-eared cur of Iceland.

55
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.970
Good Corporal Nym, show thyvalor.

56
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.970
Put up your sword!

57
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.970
Hear me!

58
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.470
Hear me what I say!

59
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.530
He that strikes the firststroke,

60
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.570
I'll run him up to the hilts, asI am a soldier.

61
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.700
An oath of mickle might,

62
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.970
and fury will abate.

63
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.800
Mine host Pistol, you must cometo my master,

64
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.470
and you, hostess.

65
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800
He is very sick and would tobed.

66
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.730
Good Bardolph, put thy facebetween his sheets,

67
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.300
and do the office of a warmingpan.

68
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.370
Away, you rogue.

69
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.430
Faith, he's very ill.

70
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.030
By my troth,

71
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.270
he'll yield the crow a puddingone of these days.

72
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.270
The king has killed his heart.

73
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.370
Come, shall I make you friends?

74
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.570
We must to France together.

75
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.130
Why the devil should we keepknives

76
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.770
to cut one another's throats?

77
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.170
Let floods o'erswell and fiendsfor food howl on.

78
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.170
You'll pay me the 8 shillings Iwon of you at betting.

79
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.670
Base is a slave that pays.

80
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.970
That now I will have.

81
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.000
That's the humor of it.

82
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.900
As manhood shall compound.

83
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.130
Push home!

84
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.370
By this sword,

85
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.470
he that makes the first thrust,I'll kill him.

86
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.730
By this sword, I will.

87
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.530
A sword is an oath,

88
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.130
and oaths must have theircourse.

89
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.470
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt befriends,

90
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.130
be friends!

91
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.030
An thou wilt not, why, then, beenemies with me too.

92
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.800
Prithee, put up.

93
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.430
I shall have my 8 shillings Iwon of you at betting?

94
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.930
A noble shalt thou have andpresent pay,

95
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.000
and liquor likewise will I giveto thee,

96
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.570
and friendship shall combine andbrotherhood.

97
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.700
I shall live by Nym,

98
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.930
and Nym shall live by me.

99
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.670
Is not that just?

100
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.870
For I shall sutler be unto thecamp,

101
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.900
and profits will accrue.

102
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.270
Give me thy hand.

103
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.700
I shall have my noble.

104
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.830
In cash most justly paid.

105
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.400
Well, then, that's the humorof't.

106
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.600
As ever you come of women, comein quickly to Sir John.

107
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.800
Ah, poor heart.

108
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.430
He is so shaked of a burningquotidian tertian

109
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.630
'tis most lamentable to behold.

110
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.730
Sweet men, come to him.

111
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.230
The king hath run bad humors onthe knight.

112
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.230
That's the even of it.

113
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.500
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.

114
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.670
His heart is fracted andcorroborate.

115
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.830
The king is a good king,

116
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.330
but it must be as it may.

117
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.470
He passes some humors andcareers.

118
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.330
Let us condole the knight,

119
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.230
for, lambkins, we will live.

120
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.730
'Fore God, His Grace is bold totrust such traitors.

121
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.130
They shall be apprehended by andby.

122
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.630
How smooth and even they do bearthemselves,

123
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.430
as if allegiance in their bosoms

124
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.600
sat crowned with faith andconstant loyalty!

125
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.970
Shh.

126
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.100
The king hath note of all thatthey intend

127
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.300
by interception which they dreamnot of.

128
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.400
Nay, but the man that was hisbedfellow,

129
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.870
whom he hath dulled and cloyedwith gracious favors--

130
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.600
that he should, for a foreignpurse,

131
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.370
so sell his sovereign's life todeath and treachery.

132
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.830
Now sits the wind fair, and wewill aboard.

133
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.830
My Lord of Cambridge and my kindLord of Masham

134
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.670
and you, my gentle knight,

135
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.830
give me your thoughts.

136
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.770
Think you not that the powers webear with us

137
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.170
will cut their passage throughthe force of France,

138
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.530
doing the execution and the act

139
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.530
for which we have in headassembled them?

140
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.730
No doubt, my liege, if each mando his best.

141
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.070
I doubt not that, since we arewell persuaded

142
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.730
we carry not a heart with usfrom hence

143
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.400
that grows not in a fair consentwith ours

144
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.500
nor leave not one behind

145
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.270
that doth not wish success andconquest

146
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.270
to attend on us.

147
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.430
Never was monarch

148
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.470
better feared and loved than isYour Majesty.

149
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:52.830
There's not, I think, a subject

150
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.700
that sits in heart grief anduneasiness

151
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.570
under the sweet shade of yourgovernment.

152
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.670
True.

153
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.400
Those that were your father'senemies

154
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.030
have steeped their galls inhoney

155
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.130
and do serve you

156
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.130
with hearts create of duty andof zeal.

157
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.230
We therefore have great cause ofthankfulness

158
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.970
and shall forget the office ofour hand

159
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.830
sooner than quittance of desertand merit

160
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.830
according to the weight andworthiness.

161
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.230
So service shall with steeledsinews toil,

162
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.100
and labor shall refresh itselfwith hope

163
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.730
to do Your Grace incessantservices.

164
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.230
We judge no less.

165
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:22.230
Uncle of Exeter,

166
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.900
enlarge the man committedyesterday

167
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.300
that railed against our person.

168
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.770
We consider it was excess ofwine

169
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:27.800
that set him on,

170
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.500
and on his more advice, wepardon him.

171
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.170
That's mercy, but too muchsecurity.

172
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.300
Let him be punished, sovereign,

173
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.270
lest example breed, by hissufferance,

174
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.670
more of such a kind.

175
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.970
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

176
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.330
So may Your Highness, and yetpunish too.

177
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.700
Sir, you show great mercy if yougive him life

178
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.670
after the taste of muchcorrection.

179
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.500
Alas, your too much love andcare of me

180
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.000
are heavy orisons 'gainst thispoor wretch.

181
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.130
If little faults, proceeding ondistemper,

182
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.470
shall not be winked at,

183
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.970
how shall we stretch our eyewhen capital crimes,

184
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.630
chewed, swallowed, and digested,

185
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.530
appear before us?

186
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.700
We'll yet enlarge that man,

187
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.500
though Cambridge, Scroop, andGrey,

188
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.530
in their dear care

189
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.270
and tender preservation of ourperson,

190
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.400
would have him punished.

191
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.200
And now to our French causes.

192
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.600
Who are the late commissioners?

193
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.630
I one, my lord.

194
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.370
Your Highness bade me ask for ittoday.

195
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.370
So did you me, my liege.

196
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.930
And I, my royal sovereign.

197
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.500
Then, Richard, Earl ofCambridge,

198
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.300
there is yours;

199
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.130
there yours, Lord Scroop ofMasham;

200
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.430
and, Sir Knight Grey ofNorthumberland,

201
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.930
this same is yours.

202
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.600
Read them,

203
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.430
and know I know your worthiness.

204
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.670
My Lord of Westmoreland, UncleExeter,

205
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.670
we will aboard tonight.

206
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.470
Why, how now, gentlemen?

207
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:46.670
What see you in those papers

208
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.800
that you lose so muchcomplexion?

209
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.200
Look, ye, how they change.

210
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.230
Their cheeks are paper.

211
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.800
Why, what read you there thathave so cowarded

212
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.870
and chased your blood out ofappearance?

213
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.000
I do confess my fault

214
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.170
and do submit me to YourHighness' mercy.

215
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.900
To which we all appeal.

216
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.570
The mercy that was quick in usbut late

217
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.070
by your own counsel issuppressed and killed.

218
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.800
You must not dare, for shame, totalk of mercy,

219
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.730
for your own reasons turn intoyour bosoms,

220
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.330
as dogs upon their masters,worrying you.

221
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.100
See you, my princes and my noblepeers,

222
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.300
these English monsters.

223
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.600
My Lord of Cambridge here,

224
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.130
you know how apt our love was toaccord to furnish him

225
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.330
with all appurtenants belongingto his honor;

226
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.300
and this man hath for a fewlight crowns,

227
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.930
lightly conspired and sworn untothe practices of France

228
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.370
to kill us here in Hampton;

229
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.670
to the which this knight,

230
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.330
no less for bounty bound to usthan Cambridge is,

231
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.330
hath likewise sworn.

232
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:08.570
But, oh, what shall I say tothee, Lord Scroop?

233
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.730
Thou cruel,

234
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.300
ingrateful,

235
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.430
savage,

236
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.730
and inhuman creature?

237
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.470
Thou that didst bear the key ofall my counsels,

238
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.900
that knew'st the very bottom ofmy soul,

239
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.700
that almost mightst have coin'dme into gold,

240
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.570
wouldst thou have practised onme for thy use?

241
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.600
May it be possible that foreignhire

242
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.700
could out of thee extract onespark of evil

243
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.930
that might annoy my finger?

244
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.500
'Tis so strange that, though thetruth of it

245
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.470
stand off as gross as black andwhite,

246
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.370
my eye will scarcely see it.

247
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.070
Oh, how hast thou with jealousy

248
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.800
infected the sweetness ofaffiance.

249
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.130
Show men dutiful?

250
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.670
Why...

251
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.170
so didst thou.

252
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:17.700
Seem they grave and learned?

253
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.800
Why...

254
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.300
so didst thou.

255
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.270
Come they of noble family?

256
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.100
Why...

257
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.600
so didst thou.

258
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.730
Seem they religious?

259
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.530
Why...

260
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.030
so didst thou.

261
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.830
And thus, thy fall hath left akind of blot

262
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.600
to mark the full-fraught man andbest indued

263
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.030
with some suspicion.

264
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.770
I will weep for thee,

265
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.630
for this revolt of thine,methinks,

266
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.670
is like another fall of man.

267
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.900
Their faults are open.

268
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.600
Arrest them to the answer of thelaw,

269
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.530
and God acquit them of theirpractices.

270
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.600
Our purposes God justly hathdiscovered,

271
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.200
and I repent my fault more thanmy death,

272
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.870
which I beseech Your Highness toforgive

273
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.470
although my body pay the priceof it.

274
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.700
For me, the gold of France didnot seduce,

275
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.270
although I did admit it as amotive

276
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.400
the sooner to effect what Iintended.

277
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.470
But God be thanked forprevention,

278
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.200
which I in sufferance heartilywill rejoice,

279
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.330
beseeching God and you to pardonme.

280
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.100
Never did faithful subject

281
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.970
more rejoice at the discovery ofmost dangerous treason

282
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.400
than I do at this hour joy o'ermyself,

283
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.530
prevented from a damnedenterprise.

284
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.630
My fault, but not my body,pardon, sovereign.

285
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.700
God quit you in His mercy.

286
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.200
Hear your sentence.

287
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.930
You have conspired against ourroyal person,

288
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.470
joined with an enemy proclaimed,

289
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.830
and from his coffers receivedthe golden earnest of our death,

290
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.670
wherein you would have sold yourking to slaughter,

291
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.700
his princes and his peers toservitude,

292
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.670
his subjects to oppression andcontempt,

293
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.930
and his whole kingdom intodesolation.

294
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.370
Touching our person, seek we norevenge,

295
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.070
but we our kingdom's safety mustso tender,

296
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.100
whose ruin you have sought,

297
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.130
that to her laws we do deliveryou.

298
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.900
Get you therefore hence, poor,miserable wretches,

299
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.130
to your death,

300
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.270
the taste whereof

301
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.200
God of His mercy give youpatience to endure

302
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.300
and true repentance of all yourdear offences.

303
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.900
Bear them hence.

304
00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.670
Now, lords, for France,

305
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.700
the enterprise whereof

306
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.770
shall be to you, as us, likeglorious.

307
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.600
We doubt not of a fair and luckywar,

308
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.630
since God so graciously hathbrought to light

309
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.870
this dangerous treason lurkingin our way

310
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.870
to hinder our beginnings.

311
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.470
We doubt not now but every rubis smoothed on our way.

312
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.200
Then forth, dear countrymen.

313
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.470
Let us deliver our puissanceinto the hand of God,

314
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.100
putting it straight inexpedition.

315
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.500
Cheerly to sea.

316
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.430
The signs of war advance.

317
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:34.630
No king of England if not kingof France.

318
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.270
God save the king!

319
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.370
God save the king!

320
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.100
Honey, sweet husband,

321
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.530
let me bring thee to Staines.

322
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.530
No, for my manly heart dothyearn.

323
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:00.370
Bardolph, be blithe.

324
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.000
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.

325
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.500
Boy, bristle thy courage up,

326
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.200
for Falstaff,

327
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.930
he is dead,

328
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.900
and we must yearn therefore.

329
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.970
Would I were with him,wheresome'er he is,

330
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.870
either in heaven or in hell.

331
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.870
Nay, sure, he's not in hell.

332
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.830
He's in Arthur's bosom,

333
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.570
if ever man went to Arthur'sbosom.

334
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.400
A' made a finer end

335
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.570
and went away

336
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.100
an it had been any christomchild.

337
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.830
A' parted even just between12:00 and 1:00,

338
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.270
even at the turning of the tide,

339
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.000
for after I saw him

340
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.770
fumble with the sheets

341
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.270
and play with flowers

342
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.630
and smile upon his fingers'ends,

343
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.430
I knew there was but one way.

344
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.470
For his nose was as sharp as apen,

345
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.100
and a' babbled o' green fields.

346
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.900
"How now, Sir John?" quoth I.

347
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.000
"Come, man.

348
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.870
Be of good cheer."

349
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.370
So a' cried out,

350
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.970
"God,

351
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.330
God, God,"

352
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.670
three or four times.

353
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.970
Now I, to comfort him,

354
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.570
bid him a' should not think ofGod.

355
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.200
I hoped there was no need totrouble himself

356
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.770
with any such thoughts yet.

357
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.800
So a' bade me put more clotheson his feet.

358
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.530
And I put my hand in the bed,and I felt them,

359
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.630
and they were as cold as anystone.

360
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.370
And then I felt up to his knees,

361
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.800
and so upward and upward,

362
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.630
and all was as cold as anystone.

363
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.630
They say he cried out of sack.

364
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.100
Aye, that a' did.

365
00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.100
And of women.

366
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.570
Nay, that a' did not.

367
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.900
That a' did, and said they weredevils incarnate.

368
00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.200
A' could never abide carnation.

369
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.570
'Twas a color he never liked.

370
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.770
A' said once the devil wouldhave him about women.

371
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.630
A' did in some sorts handlewomen,

372
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.730
but then he was rheumatic

373
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.170
and talked of the whore ofBabylon.

374
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.430
Do you not remember?

375
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.330
A' saw a flea stick uponBardolph's nose

376
00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.370
and said it was a black soulburning in hell?

377
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.530
Well, the fuel is gone thatmaintained that fire.

378
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.170
That's all the riches I got inhis service.

379
00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:32.400
Shall we shog?

380
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.430
Yeah, the king will be gone fromSouthampton.

381
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.170
Come, let's away.

382
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.530
My love,

383
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.500
give me thy lips.

384
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.630
Look to my chattels and mymovables.

385
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.000
Go, clear thy crystals.

386
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.730
Yokefellows in arms, let us toFrance,

387
00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.300
like horseleeches, my boys,

388
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.800
to suck,

389
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.300
to suck,

390
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.400
the very blood to suck!

391
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.600
And that's but unwholesome food,they say.

392
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.700
Touch her soft mouth, and march.

393
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.700
Farewell, hostess.

394
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:19.430
I cannot kiss.

395
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.530
That's the humor of it.

396
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.530
But, adieu.

397
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:27.430
Let housewifery appear.

398
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.600
Keep close, I thee command!

399
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.270
Farewell.

400
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.570
Farewell!

401
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.570
Farewell!

402
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.470
Adieu.

403
00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.600
Thus comes the English with fullpower upon us,

404
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.630
and more than carefully it usconcerns

405
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.170
to answer royally in ourdefenses.

406
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.570
Therefore, the Dukes of Berriand of Bretagne,

407
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.700
of Brabant and Orleans

408
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.870
shall make forth,

409
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.130
and you, Prince Dauphin,

410
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.900
with all swift dispatch

411
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.270
to line and new repair our townsof war

412
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.000
with men of courage and withmeans defendant.

413
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.230
My most redoubted father,

414
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.430
it is most meet we arm us'gainst the foe.

415
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.330
For peace itself should not sodull a kingdom,

416
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.570
though war nor no known quarrelwere in question

417
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.400
but that defenses, musters,preparations

418
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.130
should be maintained, assembled,and collected,

419
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.930
as were a war in expectation.

420
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.700
Therefore, I say, 'tis meet weall go forth

421
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.170
to view the sick and feebleparts of France.

422
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.870
And let us do it with no show offear.

423
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.200
No, with no more than if weheard that England

424
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.430
were busied with a Whitsunmorris dance,

425
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.370
for, my good liege, she is soidly kinged,

426
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.070
her sceptre so fantasticallyborne

427
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.500
by a vain, giddy, shallow,humorous youth,

428
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.630
that fear attends her not.

429
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.900
Oh, peace, Prince Dauphin.

430
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.070
You are too much mistaken inthis king.

431
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.400
Question Your Grace the lateambassadors

432
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.430
with what great state he heardtheir embassy,

433
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.370
how well supplied with noblecounselors,

434
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.730
how modest in exception,

435
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:20.770
and withal how terrible inconstant resolution,

436
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.100
and you shall find his vanitiesforspent

437
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.800
were but the outside of theRoman Brutus,

438
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.370
covering discretion with a coatof folly.

439
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.430
Well, 'tis not so, my Lord HighConstable,

440
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.670
but though we think it so, it isno matter.

441
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.670
Ah!

442
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.130
In cases of defense,

443
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.300
'tis best to weigh the enemymore mighty than he seems

444
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.670
so the proportions of defenseare filled,

445
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.730
which, of a weak and niggardlyprojection,

446
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.230
doth, like a miser, spoil hiscoat

447
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:48.700
with scanting a little cloth.

448
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.430
Think we King Harry strong,

449
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.470
and, princes, look you stronglyarm to meet him.

450
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.800
The kindred of him hath beenfleshed upon us,

451
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.330
and he is bred out of thatbloody strain

452
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.630
that haunted us in our familiarpaths.

453
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.770
Witness our too much memorableshame

454
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.100
when CrÈcy battle fatally wasstruck

455
00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.800
and all our princes captived

456
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.270
by the hand of that black name,Edward, Black Prince of Wales.

457
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.330
This is a stem of thatvictorious stock,

458
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.630
and let us fear the nativemightiness

459
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.470
and fate of him.

460
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.700
Ambassadors from Harry, King ofEngland,

461
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.900
do crave admittance to YourMajesty.

462
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.970
We'll give them presentaudience.

463
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.970
Your Majesty!

464
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.200
Go, and bring them.

465
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.400
You see, this chase is hotlyfollowed, friends.

466
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.530
Turn head, and stop pursuit,

467
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.900
for coward dogs most spend theirmouths

468
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.270
when what they seem to threatenruns far before them.

469
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.230
Good my sovereign,

470
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.630
take up the English short,

471
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.700
and let them know

472
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.430
of what a monarchy you are thehead.

473
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:58.900
Self-love, my liege,

474
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.430
is not so vile a sin asself-neglecting.

475
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.730
From our brother of England?

476
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.970
From him,

477
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.400
and thus he greets Your Majesty.

478
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.370
He wills you, in the name of GodAlmighty,

479
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.770
that you divest yourself

480
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.630
and lay apart the borrowedglories

481
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.700
that by gift of heaven,

482
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.600
by law of nature and of nations

483
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.470
'longs to him and to his heirs,

484
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.630
namely the crown--

485
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.000
and all wide-stretched honors

486
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.200
that pertain by custom and theordinance of times

487
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.070
unto the crown of France.

488
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.100
Or else what follows?

489
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.800
Bloody constraint,

490
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.100
for if you hide the crown evenin your hearts,

491
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.730
there will he rake for it.

492
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.770
Therefore in fierce tempest ishe coming,

493
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.430
in thunder and in earthquake--

494
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.970
like a Jove that, if requiringfail,

495
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.300
he will compel--

496
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.170
and bids you, in the bowels ofthe Lord,

497
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.930
deliver up the crown

498
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.900
and to take mercy on the poorsouls

499
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.770
for whom this hungry war openshis vasty jaws--

500
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.200
and on your head turning thewidows' tears,

501
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.830
the orphans' cries, the deadmen's blood,

502
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.400
the privy maidens' groans

503
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.930
for husbands, fathers, andbetrothed lovers

504
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.170
that shall be swallowed in thiscontroversy.

505
00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.730
This is his claim,

506
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.570
his threatening,

507
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.770
and my message.

508
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.670
Unless the dauphin be inpresence here,

509
00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:48.070
to whom expressly I bringgreeting to.

510
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.070
For us, we will consider of thisfurther.

511
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.200
Your Majesty!

512
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.970
Tomorrow shall you bear our fullintent

513
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.800
back to our brother of England.

514
00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.170
For the dauphin,

515
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.670
I stand here for him.

516
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.830
What to him from England?

517
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.170
Scorn and defiance,

518
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.500
slight regard, contempt,

519
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:15.630
and anything

520
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.670
that may not misbecome themighty sender

521
00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:23.530
doth he prize you at.

522
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:24.670
Say...

523
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.430
if my father render fair return,

524
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.630
it is against my will,

525
00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.870
for I desire nothing but oddswith England.

526
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:40.230
To that end, as matching to hisyouth and vanity,

527
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.700
I did present him with the Parisballs.

528
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.830
He'll make your Paris Louvreshake for it,

529
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:51.000
were it the mistress court ofmighty Europe.

530
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.870
And be assured, you'll find adifference,

531
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.400
as we his subjects have inwonder found,

532
00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.500
between the promise of hisgreener days

533
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.200
and these he masters now.

534
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.330
Now he weighs time even to theutmost grain.

535
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.700
That you shall read in your ownlosses

536
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.330
if he stay in France.

537
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.000
Tomorrow shall you know our mindat full.

538
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.700
Dispatch us with all speed,

539
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.500
lest that our king come herehimself

540
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.500
to question our delay,

541
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.230
for he is footed in this landalready.

542
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.470
You shall be soon dispatchedwith fair conditions.

543
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.430
A night is but small breath andlittle pause

544
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.630
to answer matters of thisconsequence!

545
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.470
