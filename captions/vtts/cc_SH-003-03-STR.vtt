00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.670


2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.330
I prey thee, good Mercutio,let's retire:

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.230
The day is hot, theCapulets abroad,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.770
And, if we meet, we shallnot 'scape a brawl;

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.400
For now, these hot days,is the mad blood stirring.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.130
Thou art like one of thesefellows

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.830
that when he enters theconfines of a tavern

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.700
claps me his sword on thetable

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.500
and says 'God send me noneed of thee!'

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
and by the operation ofthe second cup

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.370
draws it on the drawer,when indeed there is noneed.

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.600
Am I like such a fellow?

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.900
Come, come,

14
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.070
thou art as hot a Jack inthy mood as any in Italy,

15
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.370
and as soon moved to bemoody,

16
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.770
and as soon moody to bemoved.

17
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.470
And what to?

18
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.530
Nay, an there were twosuch, we should have noneshortly,

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.730
for one would kill theother.

20
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.000
Thou! why, thou wouldstquarrel

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.370
with a man that hath ahair more, or a hair less,

22
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.330
in his beard, than thouhast:

23
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.730
thou would quarrel with aman for cracking nuts,

24
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.830
having no other reason butbecause thou hast hazeleyes:

25
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.330
what eye but such an eyewould spy out such aquarrel?

26
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.570
Thy head is as fun ofquarrels as an egg is fullof meat,

27
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.470
and yet thy head has beenbeaten

28
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130
as addle as an egg forquarrelling:

29
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.730
thou hast quarrelled witha man for coughing in thestreet,

30
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.570
because he hath wakenedyou dog

31
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.600
that hath lain asleep inthe sun:

32
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.070
didst thou not fall outwith a tailor

33
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.830
for wearing his newdoublet before Easter?

34
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.200
with another, for tyinghis new shoe with oldriband?

35
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.600
Ah, ah, yet thou wilttutor me from quarrelling!

36
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.300
By my head, here comes theCapulet.

37
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.200
By my heel, I care not.

38
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.630
Follow close, for I willspeak to them.

39
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.100
Gentlemen, good den: aword with one of you.

40
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.330
And but one word with oneof us?

41
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.370
couple it with something;make it a word and a blow.

42
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.370
You shall find me aptenough to that, sir,

43
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.670
an you will give meoccasion.

44
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.430
Could you not take someoccasion without thegiving?

45
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.700
Mercutio, thou consort'stwith Romeo,--

46
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.170
Consort!

47
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.800
God, dost thou make usminstrels?

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.230
An thou make minstrels ofus,

49
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.170
look to hear nothing butdiscords:

50
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.370
here's my fiddlestick;

51
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.700
here's that shall make youdance.

52
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.030
'Zounds, consort!

53
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.630
We talk here in the publichaunt of men:

54
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.330
Either withdraw unto someprivate place,

55
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.900
And reason coldly of yourgrievances,

56
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.200
Or else depart; here alleyes gaze on us.

57
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.470
Men's eyes were made tolook, and let them gaze;

58
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.970
I will not budge for noman's pleasure, I.

59
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.330
Well, peace be with you,sir: here comes my man.

60
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.570
But I'll be hanged, sir,if he wear your livery:

61
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.500
Marry, go before to field,he'll be your follower;

62
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.600
Your worship in that sensemay call him 'man.'

63
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.200
Romeo, the love I bearthee can afford

64
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000
No better term thanthis,-- thou art avillain.

65
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.700
Tybalt, the reason that Ihave to love thee

66
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.430
Doth much excuse theappertaining rage

67
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.170
To such a greeting:villain am I none;

68
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.930
Therefore farewell; I seethou know'st me not.

69
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.730
Boy, this shall not excusethe injuries

70
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.230
That thou hast done me;therefore turn and draw.

71
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.870
I do protest, I neverinjured thee,

72
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.970
But love thee better thanthou canst devise,

73
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.000
Till thou shalt know thereason of my love:

74
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.430
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender

75
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.030
As dearly as mine own,--be satisfied.

76
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.400
O calm, dishonourable,vile submission!

77
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.670
Alla stoccata carries itaway.

78
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.300
Tybalt, you rat-catcher,will you walk?

79
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.700
What wouldst thou havewith me?

80
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.530
Good king of cats, nothingbut one of your ninelives;

81
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.870
which I mean to make boldwithal,

82
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.900
and as you shall use mehereafter,

83
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.970
drybeat the rest of theeight.

84
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.600
Will you pluck your swordout of his pitcher by theears?

85
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.370
Make haste, lest mine beabout your ears ere it beout.

86
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.930
Gentle Mercutio, put thyrapier up!

87
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.300
Come, sir, your passado.

88
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.630
Draw, Benvolio; beat downtheir weapons!

89
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.530
Tybalt, Mercutio, theprince expressly hath

90
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.070
Forbidden bandying inVerona streets.

91
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.270
Hold, Tybalt! goodMercutio!

92
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.200
I am hurt.

93
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.970
A plague o' both yourhouses!

94
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.670
I'm sped.

95
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.200
What, is he gone, and hathnothing?

96
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.570
What, art thou hurt?

97
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:04.930
Ay, ay, a scratch, ascratch; marry, 'tisenough.

98
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.470
Where is my page?

99
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.530
Go, villain, fetch asurgeon.

100
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:12.870
Courage, man; the hurtcannot be much.

101
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.400
No, 'tis not so deep as awell,

102
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:25.430
nor so wide as achurch-door; but 'tisenough,'twill serve:

103
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.770
ask for me to-morrow,

104
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.200
and you shall find me agrave man.

105
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.830
I am peppered, I warrant,for this world.

106
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.730
A plague o' both yourhouses!

107
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.270
'Zounds, a dog, a rat, amouse, a cat,

108
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.500
to scratch a man to death!

109
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.200
a braggart, a rogue, avillain,

110
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.230
that fights by the book ofarithmetic!

111
00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:00.330
Why the devil came youbetween us?

112
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.900
I was hurt under your arm.

113
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.430
I thought all for thebest.

114
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.030
Help me into some house,Benvolio,

115
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.430
Or I shall faint.

116
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.870
A plague o' both yourhouses!

117
00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.430
They have made worms' meatof me:

118
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:32.270
I have it, And soundlytoo:

119
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:41.470
your houses!

120
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.400
O sweet Juliet,

121
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.470
Thy beauty hath made meeffeminate

122
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.270
And in my temper soften'dvalour's steel!

123
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:14.700
O Romeo, Romeo, braveMercutio is dead.

124
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.970
That gallant spirit hathaspired the clouds,

125
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.730
Which too untimely heredid scorn the earth.

126
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:32.030
This day's black fate onmore days doth depend;

127
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:37.470
This but begins the woethat others must end.

128
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.970
Here comes the furiousTybalt back again.

129
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.430
Alive, in triumph! andMercutio slain!

130
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.970
Away to heaven, respectivelenity,

131
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:51.330
And fire-eyed fury be myconduct now!

132
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.770
Tybalt, take the villainback again,

133
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.970
That late thou gavest me;for Mercutio's soul

134
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.000
Is but a little way aboveour heads,

135
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.900
Staying for thine to keephim company:

136
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.130
Either thou, or I, orboth, must go with him.

137
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.670
Thou, wretched boy, thatdidst consort him here,

138
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.830
Shalt with him hence.

139
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.500
This shall determine that.

140
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.770
Romeo, away, be gone!

141
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.530
The citizens are up, andTybalt slain.

142
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.070
Stand not amazed: theprince will doom theedeath,

143
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.470
If thou art taken: hence,be gone, away!

144
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.800
O, I am fortune's fool!

145
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.970
Why dost thou stay?

146
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.300
Which way ran he thatkill'd Mercutio?

147
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.730
Tybalt, that murderer,which way ran he?

148
00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.200
There lies that Tybalt.

149
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.470
Up, sir, go with me;

150
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:08.930
I charge thee in theprince's name, obey.

151
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.200
Where are the vilebeginners of this fray?

152
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.900
O noble prince, I candiscover all

153
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.830
The unlucky manage of thisfatal brawl:

154
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.400
There lies the man, slainby young Romeo,

155
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.300
That slew thy kinsman,brave Mercutio.

156
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.570
Tybalt, my cousin!

157
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:31.100
O, the blood is spilt o'my dear kinsman!

158
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.030
Prince, as thou art true,

159
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.130
For blood of ours, shedblood of Montague.

160
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.100
Benvolio, who began thisbloody fray?

161
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.370
Tybalt, now slain, whomRomeo's hand did slay.

162
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.600
He is a kinsman to theMontague;

163
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.170
Affection makes him false;he speaks not true:

164
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.270
Some twenty of them foughtin this black strife,

165
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.430
And all those twenty couldbut kill one life.

166
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:08.300
I beg for justice, whichthou, prince, must give;

167
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:13.730
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeomust not live.

168
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:18.800
Romeo slew him, he slewMercutio;

169
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.070
Who now the price of hisdear blood doth owe?

170
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.200
Not Romeo, prince, he wasMercutio's friend;

171
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.270
His fault concludes butwhat the law should end,

172
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.370
The life of Tybalt.

173
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.700
And for that offence

174
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.900
Immediately we do exilehim hence.

175
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.630
I have an interest in yourhate's proceeding,

176
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:47.170
My blood for your rudebrawls doth lie a-bleeding;

177
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.930
But I'll amerce you withso strong a fine

178
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.600
That you shall all repentthe loss of mine:

179
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.370
I will be deaf to pleadingand excuses;

180
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.700
Nor tears nor prayersshall purchase out abuses:

181
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.630
Therefore use none: letRomeo hence in haste,

182
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:11.870
Else, when he's found,that hour is his last.

183
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.530
Attend our will:

184
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:20.900
Mercy but murders,pardoning those that kill.

185
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.670
Gallop apace, youfiery-footed steeds,

186
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.200
Towards Phoebus' lodging:such a wagoner

187
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.830
As Phaethon would whip youto the west,

188
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.100
And bring in cloudy nightimmediately.

189
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:39.170
Spread thy close curtain,love-performing night,

190
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.500
That runaway's eyes maywink and Romeo

191
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.870
Leap to these arms,untalk'd of and unseen.

192
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.670
Lovers can see to do theiramorous rites

193
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.100
By their own beauties; or,if love be blind,

194
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.630
It best agrees with night.

195
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.500
Come, civil night,

196
00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.930
Thou sober-suited matron,all in black,

197
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.530
And learn me how to lose awinning match,

198
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.000
Play'd for a pair ofstainless maidenhoods:

199
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.930
Hood my unmann'd blood,bating in my cheeks,

200
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.500
With thy black mantle; tillstrange love, grown bold,

201
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.600
Think true love actedsimple modesty.

202
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:19.230
Come, night; come, Romeo;come, thou day in night;

203
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.170
For thou wilt lie upon thewings of night

204
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.530
Whiter than new snow on araven's back.

205
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:30.730
Come, gentle night, come,loving, black-brow'd night,

206
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:36.400
Give me my Romeo; and,when he shall die,

207
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.770
Take him and cut him outin little stars,

208
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.130
And he shall make the faceof heaven so fine

209
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.670
That all the world will bein love with night

210
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.500
And pay no worship to thegarish sun.

211
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.130
O, I have bought themansion of a love,

212
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.470
But not possess'd it, and,though I am sold,

213
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.600
Not yet enjoy'd: sotedious is this day

214
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.200
As is the night beforesome festival

215
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.170
To an impatient child whohath new robes

216
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.500
And may not wear them.

217
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.000
Now, nurse, what news?

218
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.400
What hast thou there? thecords

219
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.530
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

220
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.330
Ay, ay, the cords.

221
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.470
Ay me! What news? why dostthou wring thy hands?

222
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:28.770
We are undone, lady, weare undone!

223
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.470
Alack the day!

224
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.700
He's gone, he's kill'd,he's dead!

225
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.030
Can heaven be so envious?

226
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.130
Romeo can, Though heavencannot:

227
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.930
O Romeo, Romeo!

228
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.030
Who ever would havethought it?

229
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:44.270
Romeo!

230
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.500
What devil art thou, thatdost torment me thus?

231
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.170
This torture should beroar'd in dismal hell.

232
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.170
Hath Romeo slain himself?say thou but "I,"

233
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.770
And that bare vowel "I"shall poison more

234
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.170
Than the death-darting eyeof cockatrice.

235
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:05.300
If he be slain, say "I";or if not, no:

236
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.230
Brief sounds determine ofmy weal or woe.

237
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.670
I saw the wound, I saw itwith mine eyes--

238
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.530
God save the mark!-- hereon his manly breast:

239
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.700
A piteous corse, a bloodypiteous corse;

240
00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.300
Pale, pale as ashes, allbedaub'd in blood,

241
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.670
All in gore-blood; Iswounded at the sight.

242
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.930
O, break, my heart! poorbankrupt, break at once!

243
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.170
To prison, eyes, ne'erlook on liberty!

244
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.800
Vile earth, to earthresign; end motion here;

245
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.070
And thou and Romeo pressone heavy bier!

246
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.570
Tybalt, Tybalt, the bestfriend I had!

247
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.370
O courteous Tybalt! honestgentleman!

248
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.270
That ever I should live tosee thee dead!

249
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:03.500
What storm is this thatblows so contrary?

250
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.070
Is Romeo slaughter'd, andis Tybalt dead?

251
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.770
My dearest cousin, and mydearer lord?

252
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.770
Then, dreadful trumpet,sound the general doom!

253
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.730
For who is living, ifthose two are gone?

254
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:21.470
Tybalt is gone, and Romeobanished;

255
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.970
Romeo that slew him, he isbanished.

256
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.600
O God! did Romeo's handshed Tybalt's blood?

257
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.200
It did, it did; alas theday, it did!

258
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.870
O serpent heart, hid witha flowering face!

259
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.530
Did ever dragon keep sofair a cave?

260
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.830
Beautiful tyrant! fiendangelical!

261
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.170
Dove-feather'd raven!wolvish-ravening lamb!

262
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.230
Despised substance ofdivinest show!

263
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.470
Just opposite to what thoujustly seem'st,

264
00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.830
A damned saint, anhonourable villain!

265
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.300
O nature, what hadst thouto do in hell,

266
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.700
When thou didst bower thespirit of a fiend

267
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.170
In moral paradise of suchsweet flesh?

268
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.730
Was ever book containingsuch vile matter

269
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.800
So fairly bound?

270
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.470
O that deceit should dwellIn such a gorgeous palace!

271
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.300
There's no trust,

272
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.870
No faith, no honesty inmen; all perjured,

273
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:29.630
All forsworn, all naught,all dissemblers.

274
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.100
Ah, where's my man? giveme some aqua vitae:

275
00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.200
These woes, these griefs,these sorrows make me old.

276
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.870
Shame come to Romeo!

277
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.800
Blister'd be thy tongueFor such a wish!

278
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.600
He was not born to shame:

279
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.130
Upon his brow shame isashamed to sit;

280
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.470
For 'tis a throne wherehonour may be crown'd

281
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.370
Sole monarch of theuniversal earth.

282
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.100
O, what a beast was I tochide at him!

283
00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.930
Will you speak well of himthat kill'd your cousin?

284
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.200
Shall I speak ill of himthat is my husband?

285
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.030
Ah, poor my lord, what tongueshall smooth thy name,

286
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.400
When I, thy three-hourswife, have mangled it?

287
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.600
But, wherefore, villain,didst thou kill my cousin?

288
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:19.300
That villain cousin wouldhave kill'd my husband:

289
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:24.170
Back, foolish tears, backto your native spring;

290
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.570
Your tributary dropsbelong to woe,

291
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.470
Which you, mistaking,offer up to joy.

292
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.730
My husband lives, thatTybalt would have slain;

293
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.230
And Tybalt's dead, thatwould have slain my husband:

294
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:42.730
All this is comfort;wherefore weep I then?

295
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.770
Some word there was, worserthan Tybalt's death,

296
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.800
That murder'd me: I wouldforget it fain;

297
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.700
But, O, it presses to mymemory,

298
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.170
Like damned guilty deedsto sinners' minds:

299
00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:05.230
"Tybalt is dead, andRomeo...banished;"

300
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.100
That "banished," that oneword "banished,"

301
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.630
Hath slain ten thousandTybalts.

302
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:13.330
Tybalt's death

303
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.170
Was woe enough, if it hadended there.

304
00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:18.770
Why follow'd not, when shesaid "Tybalt's dead,"

305
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:24.970
Thy father, or thy mother,nay, or both?

306
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:31.300
"Romeo is banished," tospeak that word,

307
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.470
Is father, mother, Tybalt,Romeo, Juliet,

308
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.470
All slain, all dead.

309
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.500
"Romeo is banished!"

310
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.630
There is no end, no limit,measure, bound,

311
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:50.370
In that word's death; nowords can that woe sound.

312
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.430
Where is my father, and mymother, nurse?

313
00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.370
Weeping and wailing overTybalt's corse:

314
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.500
Will you go to them?

315
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.230
I will bring you thither.

316
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.570
Wash they his wounds withtears: mine shall be spent,

317
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.300
When theirs are dry, forRomeo's banishment.

318
00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:19.070
Take up those cords: poorropes, you are beguiled,

319
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.900
Both you and I; for Romeois exiled:

320
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.570
He made you for a highwayto my bed;

321
00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:31.630
But I, a maid, diemaiden-widowed.

322
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:38.800
Come, cords, come, nurse;I'll to my wedding-bed;

323
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.830
And death, not Romeo, takemy maidenhead!

324
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.130
Romeo.

325
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.500
Romeo, come forth; comeforth, thou fearful man:

326
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.570
Affliction is enamour'd ofthy parts,

327
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.870
And thou art wedded tocalamity.

328
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:03.400
Father, what news?

329
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.030
what is the prince's doom?

330
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.100
What sorrow cravesacquaintance at my hand,

331
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.230
That I yet know not?

332
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:11.370
Too familiar

333
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.270
Is my dear son with suchsour company:

334
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.170
I bring thee tidings ofthe prince's doom.

335
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.130
What less than dooms-dayis the prince's doom?

336
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.400
A gentler judgmentvanish'd from his lips,

337
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.370
Not body's death, butbody's banishment.

338
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.600
Banishment?

339
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.870
be merciful, say "death."

340
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.530
Here from Verona art thoubanished:

341
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.930
Be patient, for the worldis broad and wide.

342
00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:40.870
There is no world withoutVerona walls,

343
00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:52.600
But purgatory, torture,hell itself.

344
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.570
Hence-banished is banish'dfrom the world,

345
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.030
And world's exile isdeath: then banished,

346
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.600
Is death mis-term'd:calling death banishment,

347
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.570
Thou cutt'st my head offwith a golden axe,

348
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.130
And smilest upon thestroke that murders me.

349
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.700
O deadly sin! O rudeunthankfulness!

350
00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.330
Thy fault our law callsdeath; but the kind prince,

351
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.500
Taking thy part, hathrush'd aside the law,

352
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.730
And turn'd that black worddeath to banishment:

353
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:19.170
This is dear mercy, andthou seest it not.

354
00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.800
'Tis torture, and notmercy: heaven is here,

355
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.400
Where Juliet lives; andevery cat and dog

356
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.900
And little mouse, everyunworthy thing,

357
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.300
Live here in heaven andmay look on her;

358
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.470
But Romeo may not: morevalidity,

359
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.370
More honourable state,more courtship lives

360
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:37.830
In carrion-flies thanRomeo: they may seize

361
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.030
On the white wonder ofdear Juliet's flesh

362
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.100
And steal immortalblessing from her lips,

363
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.000
But Romeo may not; he isbanished:

364
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.530
This may flies do, when Ifrom this must fly:

365
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.000
They are free men, but Iam banished.

366
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.700
And say'st thou yet thatexile is not death?

367
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.870
Hadst thou no poison mix'd,no sharp-ground knife,

368
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.170
No sudden mean of death,though ne'er so mean,

369
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:04.370
But "banished" to killme?-- "banished"?

370
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.830
O friar, the damned usethat word in hell;

371
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.800
Howling attends it: howhast thou the heart,

372
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.570
Being a divine, a ghostlyconfessor,

373
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.770
A sin-absolver, and myfriend profess'd,

374
00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.570
To mangle me with thatword "banished"?

375
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.970
Thou fond mad man, hear mea little speak.

376
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.200
O, thou wilt speak againof banishment.

377
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.170
I'll give thee armour tokeep off that word:

378
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.000
Adversity's sweet milk,philosophy,

379
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.470
To comfort thee, thoughthou art banished.

380
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.330
Yet "banished"? Hang upphilosophy!

381
00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:31.970
Unless philosophy can makea Juliet,

382
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.130
Displant a town, reverse aprince's doom,

383
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.470
It helps not, it prevailsnot: talk no more.

384
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.100
O, then I see that madmenhave no ears.

385
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.730
How can they, when thatwise men have no eyes?

386
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:41.900
Let me dispute with theeof thine estate.

387
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.930
Thou canst not speak ofthat thou dost not feel:

388
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.200
Wert thou as young as I,Juliet thy love,

389
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.700
An hour but married,Tybalt murdered,

390
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.570
Doting like me and like mebanished,

391
00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:56.170
Then mightst thou speak, thenmightst thou tear thy hair,

392
00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:58.530
And fall upon the ground,as I do now,

393
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.500
Taking the measure of anunmade grave!

394
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.100
Romeo, hide thyself.

395
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.300
Not I; unless the breathof heartsick groans,

396
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.270
Mist-like, infold me fromthe search of eyes.

397
00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.400
Hark, how they knock!

398
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.230
Romeo, arise; Thou wilt betaken.

399
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:14.930
Stay awhile!

400
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.600
Stand up; Run to my study.

401
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.870
By and by!

402
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.630
God's will, Whatsimpleness is this!

403
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.300
I come, I come!

404
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.730
Who knocks so hard? whencecome you?

405
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.430
what's your will?

406
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.330
Let me come in, and youshall know my errand;

407
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.430
I come from Lady Juliet.

408
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:36.000
Welcome, then.

409
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.030
O holy friar, O, tell me,holy friar,

410
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.800
Where is my lady's lord,where's Romeo?

411
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.000
There on the ground, withhis own tears made drunk.

412
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.500
O, he is even in mymistress' case,

413
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.870
Just in her case!

414
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.370
O woeful sympathy!

415
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.670
Piteous predicament!

416
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.070
Even so lies she,

417
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.900
Blubbering and weeping,weeping and blubbering.

418
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.400
Stand up, stand up; stand,and you be a man:

419
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.500
For Juliet's sake, for hersake, rise and stand;

420
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.830
Why should you fall intoso deep an O?

421
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.530
Nurse!

422
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.200
O sir! o sir!

423
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.800
Well, death's the end ofall.

424
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.700
Spakest thou of Juliet?how is it with her?

425
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.130
Doth she not think me anold murderer,

426
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.000
Now that I have stain'dthe childhood of our joy

427
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.770
With blood removed butlittle from her own?

428
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.200
Where is she? and how dothshe? and what says

429
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.470
My conceal'd lady to ourcancell'd love?

430
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.430
O, she says nothing, sir,but weeps and weeps;

431
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.000
And now falls on her bed;and then starts up,

432
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.500
And Tybalt calls; and thenon Romeo cries,

433
00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:47.000
And then down falls again.

434
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.500
As if that name, murder her;as that name's cursed hand

435
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.900
Murder'd her kinsman.

436
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.700
O, tell me, friar, tellme,

437
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.270
In what vile part of thisanatomy

438
00:29:56.270 --> 00:30:00.200
Doth my name lodge? tellme, that I may sack

439
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.170
The hateful mansion.

440
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.870
Hold thy desperate hand:

441
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.900
Art thou a man? thy formcries out thou art:

442
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.270
Thy tears are womanish;thy wild acts denote

443
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:13.430
The unreasonable fury of abeast.

444
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.770
Thou hast amazed me: by myholy order,

445
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.830
I thought thy dispositionbetter temper'd.

446
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.070
Hast thou slain Tybalt?wilt thou slay thyself?

447
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.200
And slay thy lady that inthy life lives,

448
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.430
By doing damned hate uponthyself?

449
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:32.030
What, rouse thee. thyJuliet is alive,

450
00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.530
For whose dear sake thouwast but lately dead;

451
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.130
There art thou happy:Tybalt would kill thee,

452
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.400
But thou slew'st Tybalt;there are thou happy too:

453
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.870
The law that threaten'ddeath becomes thy friend

454
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.330
And turns it to exile;there art thou happy:

455
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.570
A pack of blessings lightsup on thy back;

456
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.770
Happiness courts thee inher best array;

457
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.170
But, like a misbehaved andsullen wench,

458
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.500
Thou pout'st upon thyfortune and thy love:

459
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.770
Take heed, take heed, forsuch die miserable.

460
00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.400
Go, get thee to thy love,as was decreed,

461
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.030
Ascend her chamber, henceand comfort her:

462
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.130
But look thou stay nottill the watch be set,

463
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.870
For then thou canst notpass to Mantua;

464
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.970
Where thou shalt live,till we can find a time

465
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.300
To blaze your marriage,reconcile your friends,

466
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.100
Beg pardon of the prince,and call thee back

467
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.770
With twenty hundredthousand times more joy

468
00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:31.670
Than thou went'st forth inlamentation.

469
00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:34.830
Go before, nurse: commendme to thy lady;

470
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.430
bid her hasten all thehouse to bed,

471
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.400
Which heavy sorrow makesthem apt unto:

472
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.000
Romeo is coming.

473
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.500
O Lord, I could havestay'd here all the night

474
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.770
To hear good counsel: O,what learning is!

475
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.900
My lord, I'll tell my ladyyou will come.

476
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.200
Do so, and bid my sweetprepare to chide.

477
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.100
Here, here, sir, a ringshe bid me give you, sir:

478
00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.600
Hie you, make haste, forit grows very late.

479
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.670
How well my comfort isrevived by this!

480
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:06.330
Go hence; good night; andhere stands all your state:

481
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.730
Either be gone before thewatch be set,

482
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.770
Or by the break of daydisguised from hence:

483
00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.200
Sojourn in Mantua; I'llfind out your man,

484
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.570
And he shall signify fromtime to time

485
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.230
Every good hap to you thatchances here:

486
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:27.130
Give me thy hand; 'tislate: farewell; good night.

487
00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.570
But that a joy past joycalls out on me,

488
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.770
It were a grief, so briefto part with thee:

489
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.100
Farewell.

490
00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.770
Things have fall'n out,sir, so unluckily,

491
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:55.930
That we have had no timeto move our daughter:

492
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.070
Look you, she loved herkinsman Tybalt dearly,

493
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:04.800
And so did I-- Well, weare born to die.

494
00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:16.300
'Tis very late, she'll notcome down to-night:

495
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.130
I promise you, but foryour company,

496
00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:21.030
I would have been a-bed anhour ago.

497
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.630
These times of woe affordno time to woo.

498
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Madam, good night: commendme to your daughter.

499
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.670
I will, and know her mindearly to-morrow;

500
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.200
To-night she is mew'd upto her heaviness.

501
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.100
Sir Paris, I will make adesperate tender

502
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.070
Of my child's love: Ithink she will be ruled

503
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.530
In all respects by me;nay, more, I doubt it not.

504
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:50.700
Wife, go you to her ereyou go to bed;

505
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.270
Acquaint her here of myson Paris' love;

506
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.830
And bid her, mark you me,on Wednesday next--

507
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.900
But, soft! what day isthis?

508
00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.100
Monday, my lord.

509
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.870
Monday! Well, Wednesday istoo soon,

510
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.800
O' Thursday be it then: o'Thursday, tell her,

511
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.400
She shall be married tothis noble earl.

512
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.330
Will you be ready? do youlike this haste?

513
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.870
We'll keep no great ado--a friend or two;

514
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.370
For, hark you, Tybaltbeing slain so late,

515
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:20.330
It may be thought we heldhim carelessly,

516
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.500
Being our kinsman, if werevel much:

517
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.970
Therefore we'll have somehalf a dozen friends,

518
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.070
And there an end.

519
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.230
But what say you toThursday?

520
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.970
My lord, I would thatThursday were to-morrow.

521
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:35.100
Well, get you gone: o'Thursday be it, then.

522
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.030
Wife, go you to Juliet ereyou go to bed,

523
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.130
Prepare her, wife, againstthis wedding-day.

524
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.470
Farewell, my lord.

525
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.400
Light to my chamber, ho!

526
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.170
Afore me!

527
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.070
It is so very very late,

528
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:56.470
That we may call it earlyby and by.

529
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:58.600
Good night.

530
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:28.900
Wilt thou be gone?

531
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.730
it is not yet near day:

532
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.170
It was the nightingale,and not the lark,

533
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.870
That pierced the fearfulhollow of thine ear;

534
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.700
Nightly she sings on yonpomegranate-tree:

535
00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:51.130
Believe me, love, it wasthe nightingale.

536
00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.670
It was the lark, theherald of the morn,

537
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.000
No nightingale: look,love, what envious streaks

538
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.970
Do lace the severingclouds in yonder east:

539
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.500
Night's candles are burntout, and jocund day

540
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.330
Stands tiptoe on the mistymountain tops.

541
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.970
I must be gone and live,or stay and die.

542
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.300
Yon light is notday-light, I know it, I:

543
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.000
It is some meteor that thesun exhales,

544
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.370
To be to thee this night atorch-bearer,

545
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.570
And to light thee on thyway to Mantua:

546
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.670
Therefore stay yet; thouneed'st not to be gone.

547
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:31.600
Let me be ta'en, let me beput to death;

548
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.170
I am content, so thou wilthave it so.

549
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.570
I'll say yon grey is notthe morning's eye,

550
00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.370
'Tis but the pale reflexof Cynthia's brow;

551
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.470
Nor that is not the lark,whose notes do beat

552
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:46.530
The vaulty heaven so highabove our heads:

553
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:51.930
I have more care to staythan will to go:

554
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:58.400
Come, death, and welcome!Juliet wills it so.

555
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.800
How is't, my soul? let'stalk; it is not day.

556
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.800
It is, it is: hie hence,be gone, away!

557
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.800
It is the lark that singsso out of tune,

558
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:12.930
Straining harsh discordsand unpleasing sharps.

559
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.370
Some say the lark makessweet division;

560
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:19.300
This doth not so, for shedivideth us:

561
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.370
Some say the lark andloathed toad change eyes,

562
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.700
O, now I would they hadchanged voices too!

563
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.370
Since arm from arm thatvoice doth us affray,

564
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.670
Hunting thee hence withhunt's-up to the day,

565
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.200
O, now be gone; more lightand light it grows.

566
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.430
More light and light; moredark and dark our woes!

567
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.570
Nurse?

568
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.170
Madam, your lady mother iscoming to your chamber:

569
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.900
The day is broke; be wary,look about.

570
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:54.070
Then, window, let day in,and let life out.

571
00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:57.700
Farewell! one kiss, andI'll descend.

572
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:09.500
Art thou gone so? love,lord, ay, husband, friend!

573
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.370
I must hear from theeevery day in the hour,

574
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.670
For in a minute there aremany days:

575
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.670
O, by this count I shallbe much in years

576
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.170
Ere I again behold myRomeo!

577
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.270
Farewell!

578
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.130
I will omit no opportunity

579
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.300
That may convey mygreetings, love, to thee.

580
00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.800
O think'st thou we shallever meet again?

581
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.900
I doubt it not; and allthese woes shall serve

582
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.100
As sweet discourses in ourtime to come.

583
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:35.730
O God, I have anill-divining soul!

584
00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.330
Methinks I see thee, nowthou art below,

585
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.900
As one dead in the bottomof a tomb:

586
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.000
Either my eyesight fails,or thou look'st pale.

587
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.230
And trust me, love, in myeye so do you:

588
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.500
Dry sorrow drinks ourblood.

589
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.600
Adieu!

590
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.470
adieu!

591
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:04.830
O fortune, fortune! allmen call thee fickle:

592
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.770
If thou art fickle, whatdost thou with him

593
00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.900
That is renown'd forfaith?

594
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.200
Be fickle, fortune;

595
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.400
For then, I hope, thouwilt not keep him long,

596
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:17.930
But send him back.

597
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.600
Ho, daughter! are you up?

598
00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.030
Why, how now, Juliet!

599
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.970
Madam, I am not well.

600
00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.800
Evermore weeping for yourcousin's death?

601
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.830
What, wilt you wash himfrom his grave with tears?

602
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.630
An if thou couldst, thoucouldst not make him live;

603
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.630
Therefore, have done: somegrief shows much of love;

604
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:51.130
But much of grief showsstill some want of wit.

605
00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.800
Yet let me weep for such afeeling loss.

606
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.730
So shall you feel theloss, but not the friend

607
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.470
Which you weep for.

608
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:59.570
Feeling so the loss,

609
00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.700
I cannot choose but everweep the friend.

610
00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.500
Well, girl, thou weep'stnot so much for his death,

611
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.730
As that the villain liveswhich slaughter'd him.

612
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:09.730
What villain, madam?

613
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.700
That same villain, Romeo.

614
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.600
Villain and he be manymiles asunder.

615
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.870
God Pardon him!

616
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.670
I do, with all my heart;

617
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.630
And yet no man like hedoth grieve my heart.

618
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:26.100
That is, because thetraitor murderer lives.

619
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.430
Ay, madam, from the reachof these my hands:

620
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:32.100
Would none but I mightvenge my cousin's death!

621
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:35.930
We will have vengeance forit, fear thou not:

622
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.700
weep no more.

623
00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.300
I'll send to one inMantua,

624
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.070
Where that same banish'drunagate doth live,

625
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.230
Shall give him such anunaccustom'd dram,

626
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:49.000
That he shall soon keepTybalt company:

627
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
And then, I hope, thouwilt be satisfied.

628
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.900
Indeed, I never shall besatisfied

629
00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.630
With Romeo, till I beholdhim--dead.

630
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.800
Madam, if you could findout but a man

631
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.170
To bear a poison, I wouldtemper it;

632
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.230
That Romeo should, uponreceipt thereof,

633
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.400
Soon sleep in quiet.

634
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.270
O, how my heart abhors

635
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:11.770
To hear him named, andcannot come to him.

636
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.430
Find thou the means, andI'll find such a man.

637
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:20.070
But now I'll tell theejoyful tidings, girl.

638
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:21.930
And joy comes well in sucha needy time:

639
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.930
What are they, I beseechyour ladyship?

640
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:29.600
Well, well, thou hast acareful father, child;

641
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.330
One who, to put thee fromthy heaviness,

642
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.770
Hath sorted out a suddenday of joy,

643
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.570
That thou expect'st notnor I look'd not for.

644
00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:39.570
Madam, in happy time, whatday is that?

645
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:43.570
Marry, my child, earlynext Thursday morn,

646
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.030
The gallant, young, andnoble gentleman,

647
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:48.230
The County Paris, at SaintPeter's Church,

648
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.070
Shall happily make theethere a joyful bride.

649
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:53.070
Now, by Saint Peter'sChurch and Peter too,

650
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.400
He shall not make me therea joyful bride.

651
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.930
I wonder at this haste;that I must wed

652
00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.830
Ere he, that should behusband, comes to woo.

653
00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.230
I pray you, tell my lordand father, madam,

654
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.330
I will not marry yet; and,when I do, I swear,

655
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.930
It shall be Romeo, whomyou know I hate,

656
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.730
Rather than Paris.

657
00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.000
These are news indeed!

658
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.730
Here comes your father;tell him so yourself,

659
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.170
And see how he will takeit at your hands.

660
00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.870
When the sun sets, the airdoth drizzle dew;

661
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:24.330
But for the sunset of mybrother's son

662
00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.870
It rains downright.

663
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:32.000
How now! a conduit, girl?what, still in tears?

664
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.200
Evermore showering?

665
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.300
In one little body

666
00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:38.600
Thou counterfeit'st abark, a sea, a wind;

667
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.400
For still thy eyes, whichI may call the sea,

668
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.830
Do ebb and flow with tears;the bark thy body is,

669
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:49.370
Sailing in this salt flood;the winds, thy sighs;

670
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.530
Who, raging with thytears, and they with them,

671
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.400
Without a sudden calm,will overset

672
00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.600
Thy tempest-tossed body.

673
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.370
How now, wife!

674
00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.730
Have you deliver'd to herour decree?

675
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:03.130
Ay, sir; but she will none,she gives you thanks.

676
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.170
I would the fool weremarried to her grave!

677
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.270
Soft! take me with you,take me with you, wife.

678
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.770
How! will she none? dothshe not give us thanks?

679
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.970
Is she not proud? doth shenot count her blest,

680
00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.500
Unworthy as she is, thatwe have wrought

681
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.470
So worthy a gentleman tobe her bridegroom?

682
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.030
Not proud, you have; butthankful, that you have:

683
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.400
Proud can I never be ofwhat I hate;

684
00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.330
But thankful even forhate, that is meant love.

685
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.600
How now, how now,chop-logic!

686
00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:29.900
What is this?

687
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.670
"Proud," and "I thank you,"and "I thank you not;"

688
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.770
And yet "not proud,"mistress minion, you,

689
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.930
Thank me no thankings, andproud me no prouds,

690
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.170
But fettle your finejoints 'gainst Thursdaynext,

691
00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.030
To go with Paris to SaintPeter's Church,

692
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:41.770
Or I will drag thee on ahurdle thither.

693
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.430
Out, you green-sicknesscarrion! out, you baggage!

694
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:45.700
You tallow-face!

695
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.100
Fie, fie! what, are youmad?

696
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.630
Good father, I beseech youon my knees,

697
00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:51.270
Hear me with patience butto speak a word.

698
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:53.500
Hang thee, young baggage!disobedient wretch!

699
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.730
I tell thee what: get theeto church o' Thursday,

700
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:57.030
Or never after look me inthe face:

701
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:59.870
Speak not, reply not, donot answer me;

702
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.830
My fingers itch.

703
00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.670
Wife, we scarce thought usblest

704
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.470
That God had lent us butthis only child;

705
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:09.100
But now I see this one isone too much,

706
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.800
And that we have a cursein having her:

707
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.300
Out on her, hilding!

708
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:14.600
God in heaven bless her!

709
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.000
You are to blame, my lord,to rate her so.

710
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.230
Hold your tongue,

711
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:18.670
Good prudence; smatterwith your gossips, go.

712
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.200
I speak no treason.

713
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.330
O, God ye god-den.

714
00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:22.430
May not one speak?

715
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.830
Peace, you mumbling fool!

716
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.470
Utter your gravity over agossip's bowl;

717
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.570
For here we need it not.

718
00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:27.670
You are too hot.

719
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:30.730
God's bread! it makes memad:

720
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:35.330
Day, night, hour, tide,time, work, play,

721
00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.030
Alone, in company, stillmy care hath been

722
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.530
To have her match'd: andhaving now provided

723
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.200
A gentleman of nobleparentage,

724
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.800
Of fair demesnes, youthful,and nobly train'd,

725
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.100
Stuff'd, as they say, withhonourable parts,

726
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.230
Proportion'd as one'sthought would wish a man;

727
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.630
And then to have awretched puling fool,

728
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.970
A whining mammet, in herfortune's tender,

729
00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.270
To answer "I'll not wed; Icannot love,

730
00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.600
I am too young; I prayyou, pardon me."

731
00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.730
But, an you will not wed,I'll pardon you:

732
00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.170
Graze where you will youshall not house with me:

733
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:06.470
Look to't, think on't, Ido not use to jest.

734
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:10.130
Thursday is near; lay handon heart, advise:

735
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.970
An you be mine, I'll giveyou to my friend;

736
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:14.830
And you be not, hang, beg,starve, die in the streets,

737
00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:16.970
For, by my soul, I'llne'er acknowledge thee,

738
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:18.630
Nor what is mine shallnever do thee good:

739
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.130
Trust to't, bethink you;I'll not be forsworn.

740
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.970
Is there no pity sittingin the clouds,

741
00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:27.170
That sees into the bottomof my grief?

742
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.530
O, sweet my mother, castme not away!

743
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:35.900
Delay this marriage for amonth, a week;

744
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.870
Or, if thou do not, makethe bridal bed

745
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:39.900
In that dim monument whereTybalt lies.

746
00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.570
Talk not to me, for I'llnot speak a word:

747
00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:46.530
Do as thou wilt, I've donewith thee.

748
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:52.700
O God!--O nurse, how shallthis be prevented?

749
00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.200
My husband is on earth, myfaith in heaven;

750
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.870
How can that faith returnagain to earth,

751
00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.000
Unless that husband sendit me from heaven

752
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.570
By leaving earth? comfortme, counsel me.

753
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:11.000
Alack, alack, that heavenshould practise stratagems

754
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.330
Upon so soft a subject asmyself!

755
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:18.030
What say'st thou? hastthou not a word of joy?

756
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.970
Some comfort, nurse.

757
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.270
Faith, here it is.

758
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:26.730
Romeo is banish'd; and allthe world to nothing,

759
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.430
That he dares ne'er comeback to challenge thee;

760
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.030
Or, if he do, it needsmust be by stealth.

761
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:34.970
Then, since the case sostands as now it doth,

762
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:38.100
I think it best youmarried with the county.

763
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.200
O, he's a lovelygentleman!

764
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.730
Romeo's a dishclout tohim: an eagle, madam,

765
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:50.330
Hath not so green, soquick, so fair an eye asParis hath.

766
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:51.530
Beshrew my very heart,

767
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.230
I think you are happy inthis second match,

768
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:56.070
For it excels your first:or if it did not,

769
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:58.970
Your first is dead; or'twere as good he were,

770
00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.300
As living here and you nouse of him.

771
00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:04.530
Speakest thou from thyheart?

772
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:08.130
Ay, and from my soul too;Or else beshrew them both.

773
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.270
Amen!

774
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.470
What?

775
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:14.530
Well, thou hast comfortedme marvellous much.

776
00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:19.000
Go in: and tell my lady Iam gone,

777
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.800
Having displeased myfather, to Laurence' cell,

778
00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.230
To make confession and tobe absolved.

779
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:29.900
Marry, I will; and this iswisely done.

780
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.000
Ancient damnation!

781
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.330
O most wicked fiend!

782
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.830
Is it more sin to wish methus forsworn,

783
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.300
Or to dispraise my lordwith that same tongue

784
00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.100
Which she hath praised himwith above compare

785
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.930
So many thousand times?

786
00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.000
Go, counsellor;

787
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.830
Thou and my bosomhenceforth shall be twain.

788
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:58.970
I'll to the friar, to knowhis remedy:

789
00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:05.030
If all else fail, myselfhave power to die.

790
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.130
