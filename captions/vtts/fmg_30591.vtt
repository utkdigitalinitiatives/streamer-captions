00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Narrator) IN THE UNITED
 STATES AND CANADA,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
THERE ARE OVER EIGHT
 MILLION SINGLE MOTHERS.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
THERE ARE ALSO TWO AND A
 HALF MILLION SINGLE FATHERS.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(*)

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, THE
 NUMBER OF MEN LOOKING AFTER

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
CHILDREN BY THEMSELVES HAS
 GROWN AT NEARLY THREE TIMES

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
THE RATE FOR WOMEN.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
SINGLE DADS ARE BECOMING A
 PHENOMENON OF OUR TIMES.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:25.000
(*)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
MARC GAGE IS A FORMER
 TELEVISION NEWS REPORTER

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
EKING OUT A LIVING AS A
 FREELANCE COMMUNICATIONS

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
CONSULTANT IN VANCOUVER.
 HE'S ALSO A SINGLE FATHER,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT
 SOMETHING HE EXPECTED.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
THE MOTHER OF MY CHILD IS AN
OLD FRIEND FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
AND OVER THE COURSE OF TIME,
WE'VE COME TOGETHER FOR ONE

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
THING OR ANOTHER. AND THEN ONE
DARK AND STORMY NIGHT, BACK IN

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
NOVEMBER OF 1991, I WAS
DOWN THERE ON ASSIGNMENT,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
WE GOT TOGETHER. ONE OF
THOSE EVENINGS, AS THEY SAY.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
SHE CALLED ME TO TELL ME THAT
SHE HAD MY BABY DAUGHTER.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
WE HAD A LENGTHY DISCUSSION
AS TO WHY I WASN'T TOLD!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
AND SHE SAID, "WELL, I JUST
DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
AND I DIDN'T WANNA TELL ANYBODY.
AND I PLACED THE CHILD FOR

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
ADOPTION AND THERE'LL BE A
NUMBER OF BITS AND PIECES OF

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
PAPER COMING YOUR WAY. BECAUSE
LEGALLY YOU HAVE TO SIGN OFF

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
ON THE DOTTED LINE, GIVING
PERMISSION FOR THE CHILD TO BE

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
ADOPTED." AND I SAID, "WELL,
LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS FOR

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
HALF A SECOND." AND SHE
SUGGESTED I THINK ABOUT IT

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
AND CALL HER BACK IN A FEW DAYS.
AND I DID. AND I CALLED HER BACK

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
AND I SAID, "LOOK I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THIS AND THERE ARE TWO

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
OPTIONS. ONE - YOU RAISE THE
CHILD AND I PAY. OR B, I BRING

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
THE CHILD TO B.C." AND SHE SAID,
"NO. NO. THE BABY HAS BEEN

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
PLACED. THE ADOPTIVE COUPLE HAVE
BEEN SELECTED AND THEY'RE SIMPLY

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
WAITING FOR YOU TO SIGN
OFF ON THE DOTTED LINE."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
AND I SAID,
"I'M NOT DOING IT."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
THE ADOPTION AGENCY WAS
CALLED JEWELS FOR JESUS.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
QUITE A RELIGIOUS, CHRISTIAN,
BORN AGAIN ORGANIZATION AND

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
THEY HAD PICKED A CHRISTIAN
FAMILY FOR THE CHILD AND AS

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A MATTER OF FACT, UNBEKNOWNST TO
ME, THE MOTHER AND THE FATHER

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
ADOPTEES HAD ALREADY STARTED TO
VISIT KELSEY AND THEY WERE JUST

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
WAITING FOR ME TO COME
IN AND SIGN OFF ON IT.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
AND SHE TRIED EVERYTHING. SHE
WAS QUITE PERSUASIVE BUT SHE -

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
THERE WAS NO BLOODY WAY I WAS
CHANGING MY MIND. END OF STORY.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
THERE'S NO HYPOTHETICAL IN
THIS EQUATION, AS FAR AS I'M

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
CONCERNED. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HELL YOU WOULD DO UNLESS

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH IT,
BOTTOM LINE. SOMETHING INSIDE MY

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
BRAIN SAID, "YOU CAN'T GIVE
AWAY YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD".

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
(Narrator) AND SO
 THEIR JOURNEY BEGAN.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
MARC HAD AN INFANT DAUGHTER
 AND KELSEY HAD A SINGLE DAD.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
(Marc) I THOUGHT, "FEW DIAPERS,
A LITTLE BIT OF FORMULA,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
A LITTLE BIT OF FOOD, BURPING,
WHAT THE HELL, PIECE OF CAKE,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
ANY IDIOT CAN DO IT, RIGHT?"
WRONG! FOR THE FIRST 18 MONTHS,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
TWO YEARS, IT WAS HELL. IT WAS
REALLY DIFFICULT TO BALANCE YOUR

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
LIFE, 'CAUSE I'M 40 YEARS OLD.
ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE IS AN

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
8-WEEK-OLD BABY - WHAT THE
---- AM I DOING? BUT I MEAN,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I MADE THE DECISION. IT WAS A
CONSCIOUS DECISION. THIS IS

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
SOMETHING I WANTED TO DO.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
A HELL OF A LOT
EASIER THAN IT WAS.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
WHEN KELSEY CAME ALONG, I
DIDN'T KNOW THE FIRST THING

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
ABOUT PARENTING. BUT THEN KIDS
DON'T COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
AND THERE'S NO REFUNDS
AND NO RETURNS.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
MARC HAD REMAINED FRIENDS
 WITH HIS EX-WIFE GINETTE,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
WHO RAN A RESTAURANT
 OUTSIDE OF MONTREAL.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
GINETTE WOULD BECOME THE
 FIRST OF THE STAND-IN MOTHERS

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
TO FLOW IN AND
 OUT OF KELSEY'S LIFE.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
USUALLY A WOMAN GOES THROUGH
NINE MONTHS OF GETTING USED TO

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
HAVING A BABY AND THAT'S A
TRAUMA. SO CAN YOU IMAGINE

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
GIVING YOURSELF TWO WEEKS TO
DECIDE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS -

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
AM I GOING TO
DO THIS OR NOT?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Marc) SHE WAS THE ONE TO WHOM
I TURNED WHEN I FIRST DECIDED

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
THAT I WAS GOING TO KEEP MY
CHILD. SO HERE'S MY EX-WIFE

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
COMING OUT TO VANCOUVER WITH ME
ON THE AIRPLANE FROM TORONTO TO

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
HELP ME BEGIN TO RAISE MY CHILD.
IT'S A, IT'S A - I THINK IT'S

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
A SCRIPT FOR A
MOVIE, ISN'T IT?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
(Ginette) I THINK IT WAS A VERY,
VERY POSITIVE CHANGE FOR MARC.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
IT MADE HIM A BETTER PERSON,
A MORE HUMAN PERSON,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
MORE TOLERANT, MORE PATIENT.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE'S PATIENT.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
THAT MEANS HE'S A
LITTLE BIT MORE PATIENT.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
HE WOULD TAKE KELSEY -

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I THINK IT WAS THE
RIGHT DECISION.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
MARC ALSO RELIED
 ON HIS FAMILY.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
HIS SISTER KELLY MOVED IN
 DURING THE EARLY YEARS.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
(Kelly) I SAW MARC WITH KELSEY
AND, AND FIGURED THAT HE ALSO

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
NEEDED MY HELP. SHE'S TAPPED
INTO HIS MATERNAL SIDE, IF YOU

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
WILL. HE SHOWS AFFECTION
OPENLY, WHEREAS BEFORE

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
HE DIDN'T REALLY DO THAT.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
(Marc) FROM A DISTANCE IT LOOKS
PRETTY EASY, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
IT WOULD BE PRETTY EASY. I
MEAN, IT WAS REALLY STRESSFUL,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
SO STRESSFUL I WENT TO MY DOCTOR
AND I SAID, "SOMETIMES I THINK

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I'M GONNA KILL THE KID. OR KILL
MYSELF. OR KILL BOTH OF US."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
AND HE SAYS, "WELL, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO DO THAT BECAUSE

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT. PEOPLE
WHO GENERALLY DO THAT SHOW NO

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
WARNING." HE SAYS, "HOWEVER, GO
AND TALK TO THIS PSYCHOLOGIST".

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
AND I THOUGHT, "OH CHRIST, A
PSYCHOLOGIST - I'M A WACKO."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
HE SAYS, "NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
A WACKO." HE SAYS, "BUT THEY

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
WILL - SHE'LL HELP
YOU THROUGH IT. "

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
(Narrator) AS THE YEARS WORE
 ON FOR MARC AND KELSEY GAGE,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
IT BECAME MORE AND MORE
 JUST THE TWO OF THEM.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
A SINGLE DAD WITH HIS SEVEN
 AND A HALF YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Kelsey) CAN YOU GET ME
A STARBUCKS CAPPUCCINO?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I CANNOT.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
WHY?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
BECAUSE.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
YOU SAID YOU WOULD.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
IN THE SUMMER.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
(Marc) I AM THE MOST UNLIKELY
CANDIDATE FOR PARENTHOOD THAT

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
YOU WILL EVER MEET. ANYBODY WHO
KNOWS ME AND HEARD WHAT I HAD

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
DONE, THOUGHT THEY WERE HEARING
THINGS. THEY THOUGHT IT WAS

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
A JOKE. BECAUSE, I MEAN,
I DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
IT WASN'T PART OF THE EQUATION,
IT WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
YOU HAVE TO TAKE
MORE THAN TWO.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
WHY?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
BECAUSE WE NEED
MORE THAN TWO.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
WHY?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
TWO'S NOTHING, YOU
NEED NOURISHMENT,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
YOU NEED TO EAT
VEGETABLES OR YOUR
TEETH WILL FALL OUT.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
OH, DAD.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
SHE WANTS ME TO CUT THE CRUSTS
OFF BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T LIKE

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
THE CRUSTS. CRUSTS ARE
GOOD FOR YOUR TEETH.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
OH OKAY, OKAY I
HEARD YOU 1,000...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
DO YOU WANT YOUR
TEETH TO FALL OUT?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
YOU'RE WEIRD,
BUT I STILL LIKE YOU.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
OH DADDY, DADDY, CAN WE
GO IN THE PLAYGROUND?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
MARC'S WORK HAS BEEN
 FREELANCE AND IRREGULAR.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
WHILE WAITING FOR A JOB
 OVERSEAS, HE DECIDED NOT TO

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
LEASE AN APARTMENT BUT INSTEAD
 LIVE WITH VARIOUS FRIENDS

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
FOR SHORT PERIODS. BUT
 IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
AND HE AND KELSEY HAVE CAMPED
 OUT IN SEVEN DIFFERENT

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
APARTMENTS. THEY'RE
 CURRENTLY SHARING A TINY

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
CONDO WITH MARILYN,
 A FRIEND OF MARC'S.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
HERE WE ARE.
ARE YOU READY?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
YES, YES.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
IT'S, SHALL WE SAY, IT'S SMALL.
BUT SHE'S GOT A GOOD HEART

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
AND SO SHE'S LOOKING AFTER US
UNTIL I FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
HELL I'M GOING TO DO WITH MY
LIFE. I MEAN, SHE'S A SEVEN AND

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
A HALF YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL
WITH LOTS OF ENERGY. AND SO,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
QUITE FRANKLY, WE DON'T
SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN HERE.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I MEAN, SHE COMES HOME FROM
SCHOOL, SHE HAS HER BATH, GOES

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
TO SLEEP AND THEN UP AND GONE.
AND SHE GOES TO BROWNIES,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
SHE GOES TO KARATE. SHE'S OUT
PLAYING WITH HER FRIENDS.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
THANK GOD THE WEATHER HERE IN
BRITISH COLUMBIA IS CONDUCIVE

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
TO BEING OUTSIDE MORE THAN IT
IS IN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
DURING WHAT THEY CALL "WINTER".

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I PUT EVERYTHING IN STORAGE
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW IF I'D BE

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
COMING BACK HERE. AND BECAUSE
I'M NOT REALLY SETTLED YET,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I DECIDED TO LEAVE EVERYTHING
IN STORAGE - IT'S MUCH CHEAPER

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
TO PAY A HUNDRED A MONTH, THEN
1200 A MONTH AND HAVING TO PUT

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
IT ALL BACK AGAIN.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
(*)

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
SHE'S ASKED ME A COUPLE OF
TIMES WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
OUR OWN PLACE, AND I SAID,
"WHEN DADDY FIGURES OUT WHAT IT

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
IS HE'S GOING TO DO, WE'LL
GET A PLACE TO LIVE".

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
(*)

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I'M GRATEFUL FOR HAVING A
NUMBER OF FRIENDS WHO'VE OFFERED

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
ME A ROOF OVER MY HEAD INSTEAD
OF A DUMPSTER IN AN ALLEY.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
JESUS CHRIST,
THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
SO I'M STAYING WITH A FRIEND
UNTIL I BASICALLY DECIDE WHAT

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I'M GOING TO DO WHEN I GROW UP.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
WHAT IF YOU HAD
SLIPPED? HEAD SPLATTED
ON THE GROUND?!

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
SCRUB THE BODY,
SCRUB THE BODY.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I DON'T ADVOCATE DOING THIS.
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
TWO PARENT FAMILIES ARE MUCH,
MUCH BETTER. MUCH BETTER.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
THIS SINGLE PARENT STUFF IS -
WHILE IT MAY BE NOVEL AND IT

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
MAY BE INTERESTING,
IT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I'M LOOKING FOR NITS,
DO WE SEE ANY NITS IN HERE?

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
(Kelsey) GOD DAD,
YOU'RE WEIRD.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
(Marc) LICE.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
DID YOU GO LIKE THIS?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
EWWW, GROSS!

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
AS KELSEY NEARED HER
 EIGHTH BIRTHDAY,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
SHE WAS BECOMING MORE
 CURIOUS ABOUT THINGS THAT

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
WERE MISSING IN HER LIFE.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
INTO THE SACK.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
SHE KNOWS HER MOTHER EXISTS,
SHE KNOWS SHE LIVES IN ONTARIO

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
AND SHE KNOWS SHE
HAS A HALF-BROTHER.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I'LL SEE YOU IN
THE MORNING, OKAY?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
AND SO MARC GAGE DECIDED IT
 WAS TIME TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
TO TORONTO.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
(Kelsey) YES, AND HERE'S AN
UGLY LOOKING MAN NEAR THIS

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
WONDERFUL LOOKING PIECE OF ART!

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
(Marc) IT WAS KIND OF
ANTI-CLIMACTIC BECAUSE WE BANGED

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
ON THE DOOR, THE DOOR WAS OPEN,
WE WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
THERE WAS MOM AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE STAIRS. KELSEY GOES "MOMMY",

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
HUGGED HER MOMMY AND SAW THE
TWO CATS AND AWAY SHE WENT.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
SHE GAVE US ICE-CREAM
AND HER TWO CATS -

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
ONE'S LAZY AND ONE
LIKES TO BE CHASED.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
(Marc) AND THEN HER HALF-BROTHER
CAME IN, AND THEY GOT ALONG

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
FAMOUSLY. IT WAS AS IF THEY'D,
THEY'D KNOWN EACH OTHER

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
ALL THEIR LIVES. SHE'S ALWAYS
KNOWN SHE'S HAD A MOM,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
AND I GUESS, THIS JUST CONFIRMED
IN HER LITTLE MIND THAT THIS

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
WAS, THAT SHE REALLY DID HAVE
A MOM AND SHE WAS ABLE TO PUT

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
A FACE TO THIS ICON OF
MOTHERHOOD. THE THING THAT,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
THAT BUGS ME, I SUPPOSE, IS
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE, WE'VE

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
BEEN THERE, WE'VE DONE THAT,
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IT BUT THE

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
PHONE HASN'T RUNG AND THERE'S
BEEN NO CORRESPONDENCE FROM

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
EITHER MOTHER OR BROTHER SO THAT
MAY... THAT MAY BE FESTERING

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
AWAY IN HER LITTLE BRAIN. I
DON'T KNOW. THAT'S SOMETHING,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I SUPPOSE, THAT WE'LL HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT. BUT I'M - I'M A BIT

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
PISSED OFF THAT SHE HASN'T
TAKEN MORE OF A ROLE.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
(*)

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
(Marc) DO YOU REMEMBER
THIS PLACE?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Kelsey) YES.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
(Marc) AND HOW OLD WAS THIS?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
100 MILLION YEARS OLD.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
EXACTLY. AND THIS IS
WHERE THEY USED TO
SACRIFICE VIRGINS.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
THAT'S A PERSON WHO'S
NEVER BEEN MARRIED.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
(Marc) THERE'S MORE - THERE'S
MORE OF A STABILITY RIGHT NOW

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
THAN THERE WAS OVER THE
LAST TWO YEARS, I GUESS.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
AND SO I DECIDED, "WELL THE
KID SHOULD HAVE HER OWN ROOM".

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
AND SO, AT THIS POINT
IN TIME, WE'RE RENTING.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Kelsey) MY DAD SAID HE'S HAPPY
I HAVE A ROOM, 'CAUSE WHEN I WAS

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
AT MARILYN'S ALL I HAD WAS,
ALL I SLEPT ON WAS A SOFA.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
AND IT WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE.
SO WHEN WE FIRST MOVED IN,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
HE WAS VERY, VERY HAPPY WE
ALL HAD OUR OWN ROOMS.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
SHORTLY AFTER WE MOVED IN HERE,
THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE SINK IN

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
THE BATHROOM. AND SO I HAD TO
GATHER EVERYTHING OUT AND PUT IT

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
IN A LITTLE BOX UNTIL THE
PLUMBER CAME IN TO REPAIR,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
CORRECT WHATEVER, WHATEVER THE
PROBLEM WAS. SO SHE COMES HOME

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
FROM SCHOOL, COMES UPSTAIRS AND
GOES, "OH MY GOD, DADDY,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
ARE WE MOVING AGAIN?!"
I SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
THE SINK'S JUST BROKEN."

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
(laughs)

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:35.000
(*)

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
WE'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD RAPPORT,
A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
WE'RE BUDDIES, WE'RE PALS.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
AND AS SHE GETS MORE MATURE,
THAT'LL ONLY GET BETTER.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
UNTIL OF COURSE, SHE HAS HER
FIRST PERIOD, AND GETS INTO

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
PUBERTY AND THEN SHE'LL
TELL ME THAT I'M AN IDIOT.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
REEL THIS IN AND LET'S
SEE IF THERE'S FISH AT
THE END OF IT.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
SO I GUESS I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
SO THAT'S CHAPTER... IS IT
CHAPTER TWO, OR CHAPTER 202?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
FOR MARC GAGE IT IS CLEAR THAT
 THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
HE EVER MADE CHANGED
 THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
FOR TOM NELSON OF EDMONTON,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
LIFE OFFERED NO SUCH
 MOMENT OF CHOICE.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
(Tom) I CAUGHT YOUR MOTHER IN
THE MORNING WHEN SHE WOKE UP.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
(Anna) A WOMAN'S DREAM!

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
(Tom) SHE ALWAYS HAD VERY GOOD
HUMOUR. SHE'S SMILING THERE AND

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
THAT WAS A SPLENDID TIME. ONE
OF THE TIMES WHEN YOU THINK

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
BACK IN YOUR LIFE,
THERE ARE FEW
TIMES THAT ARE,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
SORT OF GOLDEN, OKAY.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
TOM NELSON WAS ONLY TEN
 WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
HE WAS RAISED BY
 A SINGLE FATHER.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
TOM GREW TO MANHOOD, SURVIVED
 THE SECOND WORLD WAR,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
BECAME A CAREER ACADEMIC,
 MARRIED AND HAD THREE

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
CHILDREN. IN THE SUMMER OF
 1967, HE AND HIS WIFE, JOYCE,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
WERE EXPECTING
 THEIR FOURTH CHILD.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
SHE DIED IN CHILDBIRTH AND
IT WAS A TERRIBLE TRAUMA.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
YOU FEEL THE DIFFERENT
RESPONSIBILITY WHEN SOMETHING

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
LIKE THAT HAPPENS.
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I'D ALREADY LIVED
THROUGH IT, YOU KNOW.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
AND YOU TOOK CARE OF YOUR
FAMILY ONCE, AND SECONDLY YOU

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
DIDN'T GET MARRIED UNTIL
THEY NO LONGER NEEDED YOU.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
THE BOY WHO'D BEEN RAISED
 BY A SINGLE FATHER

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
WAS NOW A SINGLE DAD HIMSELF
 WITH THREE YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000
MY WIFE DIED 35 YEARS AGO, SO
I'M QUITE A DISTANCE FROM THAT

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
EVENT NOW. BUT WHEN I THINK
ABOUT IT - AND I TRY NOT TO DO

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:02.000
THAT - IT'S AS FRESH AS IT WAS
AT THE TIME I WAITED IN THE,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY
CAME OUT TO TELL ME,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
"YOUR WIFE IS DYING, GO IN AND
SEE HER". AND I WENT IN AND

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
TALKED WITH HER. AND THEN LATER,
WHEN SHE DIED, I TOOK HER TO THE

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
MORGUE MYSELF, YOU KNOW. BUT
THOSE THINGS ARE VERY FRESH

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
AND I TRY NOT TO THINK OF THEM

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
BECAUSE THEY DO
YET OVERWHELM ME.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
THE IRONY OF JOYCE'S DEATH
 WAS NOT LOST ON TOM NELSON,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
WHAT HIS CHILDREN WERE
 NOW GOING THROUGH,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
HE HIMESLF HAD EXPERIENCED.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
MY FATHER TOLD ME IN THE
MORNING. HE SAID, "YOUR MOTHER

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
DIED LAST NIGHT." HE SAID, "I
TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW". HE SAID,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
"I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I WILL
TAKE CARE OF YOU AND I PROMISED

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
YOUR MOTHER THAT I WOULDN'T
MARRY UNTIL YOU'RE GROWN."

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
SO, SO THOSE WERE THE RULES
THAT WERE SET DOWN.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
WE ALL KNOW LIFE GOES ON. AND
YOU HAVE A SET OF OBLIGATIONS

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
- I'VE GOT THREE CHILDREN. MY
WIFE DIED ON MY YOUNGEST CHILD'S

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
SECOND BIRTHDAY. I'VE GOT TO
DEAL WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000
THEIR MOTHER, BECAUSE OF COURSE,
THEY RESIST THAT IDEA BECAUSE

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
HIS ELDEST CHILD, ANNA, IS
 NOW A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
SHE WAS SIX
 WHEN HER MOTHER DIED.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(Anna) MY DAD NEVER LET US SULK
OR, YOU KNOW, "IT'S OKAY TO CRY

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
BUT LIKE, GET OVER IT AND LET'S
GET ON WITH THINGS, YOU KNOW."

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
AND CRYING DOESN'T SOLVE VERY
MUCH. IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD FOR

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
ABOUT LIKE ONE SECOND AND THEN
YOU'RE, THEN YOU'RE AN IDIOT,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
YOU KNOW. AND, AND I DO AGREE
ABOUT THE PICTURES ON THE WALL.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
HE, MY DAD - WE NEVER HAD
PICTURES OUT OF MY MOTHER.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
AND HE NEVER REALLY
TALKED ABOUT HER.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
THESE ARE PICTURES,
OF COURSE, THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
YOUR CHILDHOOD,
YOU KNOW?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
(Anna) YOU CAN'T LIVE LIFE IN
THE PAST. YOU CAN'T SIT AROUND

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
AND GO, "OH, YOU KNOW, IF YOUR
MOTHER WAS HERE TODAY, WE WOULD,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."
WELL, SHE'S NOT, SO DO IT

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
ANYWAY. AND I THINK THAT IS
SORT OF WHAT MY DAD MEANT,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
OR HOW I TOOK IT ANYWAY. IT
ALLOWS YOU TO RECOVER, I THINK,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
FAIRLY QUICKLY FROM LIFE'S
LITTLE, LITTLE TROUBLES.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THE
FASTER YOU DO IT, THE EASIER

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
LIFE IS... YOU KNOW? AND THERE'S
NO POINT IN CRYING ABOUT IT

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
(Tom) AFTER THE CHILDREN ARE IN
BED, I COULD WORK UNTIL ABOUT

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
AND THEN GO TO BED AND,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
ANAESTHETIZED, GO TO SLEEP.
GET UP IN THE MORNING AT EIGHT

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
AND... DO THE SAME THING AGAIN.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
LIKE EVERY OTHER FATHER,
 DR. TOM NELSON,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
ACADEMIC PSYCHOLOGIST, DID
 NOT ESCAPE THE TRAUMA THAT

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
COMES WITH HAVING
 A TEENAGE DAUGHTER.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
(Tom) MY DAUGHTER. MY DAUGHTER
AND I, WE DIFFERED IN, IN A LOT

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
OF RESPECTS. AND SHE JUST
THOUGHT I WAS PRETTY MUCH OUT

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
TO LUNCH, YOU KNOW. AND SO I
COULDN'T ACCEPT THAT KIND OF

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
TREATMENT FROM HER. AND THERE
WAS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
WHICH WE HAD VIRTUALLY NOTHING
TO DO WITH ONE ANOTHER.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
BUT THEN SHE NEEDED ME AT
SOME POINT, AND OF COURSE,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I ALWAYS NEEDED HER.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I, I
DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITH MY DAD,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
YOU KNOW. 'CAUSE HE WAS, HE HAD
AN OPINION ABOUT, JUST ABOUT

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
EVERYTHING. AND HE THOUGHT HE
WAS RIGHT, AND HE TALKED IN A

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
LOUD VOICE AND YOU KNOW,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
AND HE DIDN'T DO THINGS THE
RIGHT WAY. AND HE USED TO WEAR

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
THESE REALLY GARISHLY LOUD TIES
THAT - WITH CLASHING SHIRTS.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
AND I DIDN'T KNOW HOW I COULD
POSSIBLY WALK DOWN THE STREET

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
WITH HIM WEARING THAT. AND HE
HAD THIS BLACK SUIT - I CALLED

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
IT "THE MAFIA SUIT" - IT HAD
LIKE THIS WHITE STITCHING.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
I HATED THAT SUIT.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I HAD BOUGHT A RED
SUEDE JACKET, YOU
KNOW HOW I WAS,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I WAS ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A BARGAIN,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I GOT A TREMENDOUS
BARGAIN ON THIS
JACKET.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
(Anna) BUT NOW, YOU KNOW. NOW
I REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
IT WASN'T HIM AT ALL - IT WAS
ME. I WAS SORT OF A JERK AND...

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
TOO, TOO YOUNG TO KNOW THE
REALITY OF LIFE. AND, YOU KNOW.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
NOW MY DAD'S A PRETTY GOOD GUY,
SO THERE'S HOPE FOR THE FUTURE,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
YOU KNOW. I SUPER LIKE BEING
WITH MY DAD NOW. AND - ARGUING

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
IN PUBLIC NOW IS
A FUN THING!

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
(Tom) WHAT I WONDER ABOUT - AND
I CAN NEVER KNOW - IS WHAT

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:09.000
THEY'RE LIKE INSIDE FROM THIS
EVENT. AND I, I WORRY ABOUT IT,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:16.000
BECAUSE HERE THERE ARE TWO
GENERATIONS OF MASCULINE

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
DOMINATION IN THEIR, IN THEIR
PREPARATION FOR LIFE.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
AND I THOUGHT MORE LIKE MY
FATHER THAN I WOULD HAVE,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
HAD MY MOTHER LIVED. AND NOW
THEY'RE GIVEN THAT AS A FATHER,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
WHO IS ALREADY BIASED

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
AND NOW HAS AN ADDITIONAL
BIAS TO FIX ON THEM.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
(Anna) I THINK SOMETIMES MY DAD
FEELS GUILTY THAT HE WASN'T,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
THAT HE WASN'T MORE HUGGY
AND HE WASN'T MORE KISSY,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
AND HE DIDN'T GIVE US
MORE "I LOVE YOU"S,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
BUT THAT STUFF IS SUPERFICIAL.
YOU KNOW - ANYBODY CAN DO THAT.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LIKE
YOU. YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE JUST

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
EMPTY WORDS. AND I THINK WHAT
YOU DO AND HOW YOU LIVE YOUR

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
LIFE AND HOW YOU TREAT YOUR
CHILDREN AND THE THINGS YOU DO

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
WITH THEM - LIKE ALL THE CAMPING
TRIPS WE WENT ON, AND THE FACT

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
THAT HE HAD THREE CHILDREN
AND HE HAD THREE DOGS TOO.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
AND HE HAD A FULL - YOU KNOW,
FULL-TIME JOB AND HE, HE DID

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
ALL THAT STUFF. THAT STUFF IS,
IN RETROSPECT, YOU KNOW,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
IS WORTH A LOT MORE THAN ALL
THAT OTHER STUFF. ALL THAT OTHER

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
STUFF IS JUST - IT'S GREAT, YOU
KNOW, IT'S OKAY. AND IT'S GOOD

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
SOMETIMES. BUT IF THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO BASE YOUR LIFE

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
FOUNDATION ON,
THEN IT'S NOTHING.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
HERE'S ANOTHER PICTURE
THAT'S A PICTURE OF
YOU KNOW WHO!

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:52.000
IN MY BUFFALO HAT! I
DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
SEEN THAT ONE EITHER.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
THIS IS THE SAME TIME?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
(Tom) YEAH, SAME
TIME, RIGHT.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I CALL THIS
THE GOOD DAYS,
AND THEY WERE.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
MY CHILDHOOD WAS GREAT, LIKE,
I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
AND I DID GET EVERYTHING YOU
NEED FROM, WELL, IN THIS CASE

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:43.000
FROM MY DAD. AND YOU GROW UP TO,
TO BE SELF RELIANT AND CAN MAKE,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
FOR THE MOST PART, VERY SOUND
DECISIONS ABOUT YOURSELF AND,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
AND YOU LEARN TO, I THINK,
LIVE LIFE WITH NO REGRETS.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
(Tom) MY CHILDREN ARE EXTREMELY
STRONG, ALL THREE OF THEM,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
AS PERSONS. I HAVE TWO THAT ARE
MARRIED AND ONE IS PREPARING

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
TO GET MARRIED. YOU KNOW, I'M SO
DELIGHTED WITH THE GRANDCHILDREN

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000
AND, AND, AND BEING IN THEIR
PRESENCE AND BEING EXCEPTED

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000
AS A PERSON WHO IS DESIRABLE
TO BE AROUND, YOU KNOW?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
AT LEAST FOR A COUPLE
OF HOURS! (chuckles)

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
AND SOMEBODY WHO THEY WANT
THEIR CHILDREN TO KNOW.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
WHEN HIS CHILDREN WERE OLD
 ENOUGH TO MAKE THEIR OWN WAY

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
IN THE WORLD, 34 YEARS
 AFTER HIS WIFE DIED,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
AND HE'D RETIRED AS
 DEPARTMENT HEAD OF THE
 UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
TOM NELSON,
 IN HIS 70s, REMARRIED.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
HIS NEW WIFE IS HIS
 FIRST WIFE'S SISTER.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
(*)

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
BUT ANOTHER DAD, ROSS
 HEIGHT IN SASKATCHEWAN,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
IS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
 THE ROLLERCOASTER RIDE

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
OF SINGLE PARENTHOOD.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
(Ross) THIS IS THE WAY IT IS.
PEOPLE MIGHT LOOK AT US FUNNY

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
OR THUMB THEIR NOSES AT ME,
THINK I'M A BURDEN ON SOCIETY,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I DON'T CARE. GO AHEAD. THINK
WHAT YOU WANT. BUT I DON'T

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
EXPECT YOU UNDERSTAND. OR DON'T
TELL ME YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
TO BE ME OR ANY OTHER SINGLE
PARENT DAD, MOM, I DON'T CARE

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
WHAT, JUST BECAUSE YOU SAT IN
SOME SCHOOL AND READ THE BOOK.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
DON'T TELL ME YOU
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
SIX WEEKS AFTER HIS WIFE
 SUDDENLY LEFT WITH THEIR

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
THREE CHILDREN, AND STILL NOT
 SURE WHERE THEY HAD GONE,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
THE BEST THING IN ROSS
 HEIGHT'S LIFE WAS HIS JOB.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
HE WAS A LONG HAUL TRUCK
 DRIVER, LICENSED TO CARRY

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
DANGEROUS GOODS. IT WAS A
 BIG PART OF WHO HE WAS.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
BUT IT CAME TO
 A SUDDEN END.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
(Ross) I KNEW THAT TRACK WAS
THERE - I'D BEEN OVER IT 200

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
TIMES BEFORE. AND I DIDN'T
SEE NOTHING OUT THERE.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
GOT THE THING ON THE TRACKS,
FELT THE FRONT WHEELS ON THE

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
RAILS AND I JUST
LOOKED OUT THE SIDE...

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
AND THIS BIG, DAMNED
BLACK THING...

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
IT WAS JUST BLACK
AND IT WAS HUGE.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
(train whistle blows)

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
A PRAIRIE THUNDER STORM,
 EXHAUSTION AND WORRY

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
WERE A DEADLY COMBINATION
 FOR ROSS THAT NIGHT.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
HE SURVIVED, BUT FOUND
 HIMSELF ON MEDICATION

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
(Ross) OBVIOUSLY I LOST MY JOB
AT KINDERSLEY OVER THAT BECAUSE

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
THERE WAS DANGEROUS GOODS
INVOLVED AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I WENT FROM HAVING A DEDICATED
RUN, SCHEDULED DAYS OFF,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
TO SITTING BY THE PHONE,
WAITING FOR IT TO RING.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
ANOTHER BUMMER, YOU KNOW.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
AND EVERYTHING JUST
WENT WRONG FROM THERE ON.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
THAT JOB MEANT
EVERYTHING TO HIM.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
IT WAS A GOOD JOB.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
ROSS'S FRIEND,
 CAROLINE FENNER.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
I'M SURE IT MADE IT HARD TO
GET OTHER GOOD JOBS SO IT WAS

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
DEVASTATING TO HIS, HIS WORK,
TO HAVE HAD THAT ACCIDENT.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
AND I THINK IT ALSO MAYBE
MADE HIM REALIZE THAT...

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
JUST HOW MUCH HE WAS TROUBLED
BY THE KIDS BEING GONE.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
TO HAVE AS GOOD A DRIVER AS HE
WAS, TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
TO JUST DRIVE OVER THOSE
TRACKS AND NOT SEE THAT TRAIN.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
THAT'S SOMETHING HE WOULDN'T DO.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
HE'S TOO GOOD.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
ROSS'S WIFE HAD LEFT THEIR
 SMALL SASKATCHEWAN TOWN

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
WITH THE THREE KIDS.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
(Ross) I JUST WENT HOME FROM
WORK ONE DAY AND THEY WERE GONE.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
SHE WENT FOR FULL CUSTODY AND
THE JUDGE DIDN'T DO THAT,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
BUT HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE. WHAT
YOU GET IS JOINT CUSTODY WITH

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE BEING WITH
HER. A DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
FULL CUSTODY. AND SHE WAS
GETTING, WHAT WAS I COUGHING UP

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
$450 A MONTH CHILD SUPPORT. AND
THEN I'D SEND BIKE MONEY OUT,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
SKATEBOARD MONEY OUT
AND ALL THIS KIND OF
STUFF WHENEVER I COULD.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I THINK THE LOSS OF HIS
MARRIAGE WAS DEVASTATING BUT

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
BEING WITHOUT HIS CHILDREN
JUST ABOUT KILLED HIM.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
HE REALLY WAS HURTING
ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I'VE ONLY EVER SEEN ROSS
CRY ONCE IN HIS LIFE

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
AND THAT WAS ABOUT THE KIDS.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
AND I DIDN'T GO TO COURT OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO GET THE

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
KIDS BACK. I CONSIDERED IT, I
LOOKED INTO IT. BUT I MEAN,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
IT'S THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS AND INTER-PROVINCIAL

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
LIKE THIS, THE LAWYERS ARE BIG
BUCKS. WHAT MADE IT EVEN WORSE

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
WAS ME BEING OUT HERE, HELPLESS,
KNOWING THEY'RE WAY OUT THERE

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
AND I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
(Caroline) HE WAS HURTING SO BAD
THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIMSELF

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
WHAT HE WAS THINKING OR
FEELING SOME DAYS.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
IT WAS SO HARD ON HIM.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
BEFORE LONG, HE LOST HIS
 HOUSE AND FOUND HIMSELF

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
ON A DOWNHILL SPIRAL.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
IF ANYBODY WANTS TO TRADE
AND TRY IT OUT, LET ME KNOW!

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
AND THEN 18 MONTHS AFTER
 THEY'D BEEN TAKEN AWAY,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
HIS CHILDREN DECIDED THEY
 WANTED TO COME BACK TO

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
SASKATCHEWAN AND LIVE
 WITH THEIR DAD.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
SO AT A TIME WHEN HE FELT
 HE'D REACHED THE VERY BOTTOM,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
ROSS HEIGHT SUDDENLY
 BECAME THE SOLE SUPPORT FOR

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
14-YEAR-OLD JUSTIN,
 13-YEAR-OLD JESSICA

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
AND THE BABY, SHANNON,
 WHO WAS NOW 10.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
(Ross) IT WASN'T A TOUGH
DECISION TO MAKE. I DIDN'T EVEN

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.000
CONSIDER NOT DOING IT. SO. I
CAN'T IMAGINE CONSIDERING NOT

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
DOING IT. THEY'RE YOUR KIDS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE. YOU KNOW.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
THERE'S LOTS OF TIMES I WAS
WORRIED SICK ABOUT FEEDING THEM

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
AND EVERYTHING ELSE, BUT
I DO WHATEVER I CAN DO

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
RIGHT FROM SWEEPING PARKING
LOTS, QUITE OFTEN I GOT TO GO

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
TO SOCIAL SERVICES TO HELP US
OUT. I FEEL BAD WALKING IN THERE

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I
KNOW I GOT NO DAMN CHOICE.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:47.000
(*)

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
YOU DON'T NEED LUNCH
TODAY, DO YOU?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
NO.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
KIND OF BURNT,
THOUGH, HEY DAD?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
DID I?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
KIND OF CRISPY.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
IT'S SUPPOSED TO
BE LIKE THAT.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
I HAD TO TEACH HIM HOW TO
COOK PANCAKES AND MACARONI

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
AND GRILLED CHEESE, BUT I
ALREADY KNEW HOW TO COOK THAT.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH
AUTOMATIC FOR HIM TO
JUST COME HOME AND

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
COOK. AND YOU KNOW,
IT JUST - HE ALWAYS
DID IT.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT IT. NEVER
ASKED US TO DO IT.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
WHEN HE - LIKE HE'LL BE FRYING
THE SPAGHETTI, RIGHT, 'CAUSE HE

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
DOESN'T MICROWAVE IT, HE FRIES
IT. AND THEN HE BURNS IT.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
AND IT'S ALL BURNT AND CRISPY
AND THEN HE MAKES ME EAT IT!

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
THAT'S JUST GROSS.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
HE'S A GOOD COOK IF
HE'S COOKING MEAT
AND POTATOES.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
YEAH. HE'S GOOD AT
WHAT HE CAN MAKE,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
AND THAT'S NOT
A LOT. BUT!

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
WE'D SIT AROUND HERE AND LAUGH
AT OURSELVES, YOU KNOW -

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
AND SOME STUPID REMARK
SOMEBODY WOULD BRING OUT.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
AND THEN WE'D TALK ABOUT -
WE'RE THE MOST FUNCTIONAL

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY AROUND,
YOU KNOW. STUFF LIKE THAT!

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
(laughs)

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
IN A TINY RURAL COMMUNITY
 IN SASKATCHEWAN,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
A MAN LOOKING AFTER HIS
 THREE CHILDREN BY HIMSELF

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
WAS A NOVELTY. THE CHILDREN
 LEARNED EARLY THAT THEIR

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
SINGLE FATHER FAMILY
 WAS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I SAW YOU YESTERDAY.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
YEAH, A LOT OF THE
TEACHERS AND STUFF
WERE KIND OF -

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
THERE WERE A FEW THAT
WEREN'T SURE ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
THE MAN DOING THE
COOKING AND THE CLEANING
AND EVERYTHING.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
AND THEY JUST THOUGHT
THAT WASN'T RIGHT,
AND IT'S A FAIRLY

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
OLD-FASHIONED THINKING
IN MARTENSVILLE, SO...

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
SOME OF THE KIDS TELL ME THAT
THEIR PARENTS WANT TO, LIKE,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
STAY TOGETHER, UNTIL THE KID'S
OUT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANNA

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000
LIKE - THEY THINK THAT IT'LL
RUIN THEIR LIVES OR SOMETHING.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
SO THEY JUST IGNORE EACH OTHER
TOTALLY, BUT THEY STAY TOGETHER.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
AND THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT
IT WAS WEIRD THAT I WAS
LIVING WITH MY DAD AND

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
NOT MY MOM. BECAUSE
USUALLY YOU DON'T
LIVE WITH YOUR DAD.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
I THINK HAVING ONE PARENT'S A
LOT BETTER THAN HAVING TWO,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
ACTUALLY. 'CAUSE MOST OF MY
FRIENDS - BEFORE THEY CAN SLEEP

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
OVER, THEY HAVE TO TALK TO
THEIR MOM AND THEIR DAD.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
AND I JUST TALK TO MY DAD AND
HE SAYS "YES" TO EVERYTHING, SO!

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
I'M BASICALLY ALLOWED
TO DO LOTS OF STUFF.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
SOME STUFF HE DOESN'T LET ME DO
THOUGH, LIKE IF IT'S JUST GOING

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
OVER THE LINE, HE
WON'T LET ME DO IT.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
(knocking on the door)

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
BYE DAD.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
(Ross) SEE YA!

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO IF YOU'RE
LOCKED OUT?

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I DUNNO.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
(Shannon) I THINK IT'S REALLY
FUN LIVING IN MARTENSVILLE.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE, I HAVE A
LOT OF FRIENDS NOW AND...

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
EVERYBODY'S ALWAYS PHONING ME
AND STUFF. SOME... I'M A GOOD

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
PEER MEDIATOR. PEER MEDIATOR IS
SOMEBODY THAT LIKE WALKS AROUND

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
THE SCHOOL GROUNDS AND HELPS
ANYBODY IF THEY'RE HAVING

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
TROUBLES THAT THEY CAN'T SOLVE
FOR THEMSELVES. THEN WE TAKE

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
THEM INTO A ROOM, IT'S KINDA
LIKE COUNSELLING. YOU GET TO

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
KNOW HOW TO SOLVE YOUR OWN
PROBLEMS WITHOUT HAVING TO LIKE,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
BEAT THE CRAP OUTTA EACH OTHER
OR SOMETHING. EVEN THOUGH I'M

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
USUALLY NOT THE FIRST ONE TO
CALL UP AND SAY I'M SORRY.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
WELL, YOU CAN'T SIT DOWN AND
BE "WELL, WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE?" WELL,
THE HELL WITH YOUR LIFE.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
YOU DO WHAT IT TAKES SO
THEY CAN HAVE A LIFE.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
YOU KNOW - NO MATTER
WHAT IT TAKES.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
OKAY, SHANNY, SEE IF
YOU CAN GET THAT IN YOU.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
THEN YOU CAN
TAKE OFF.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
DO YOUR
HOMEWORK AFTER.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
YOU DON'T HAVE
MUCH, RIGHT?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
NO. I ONLY HAVE
TWO QUESTIONS.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
PSHAW. YOU GOTTA
EAT SOME OF THAT.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I ALREADY ATE
SOME OF THAT.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
(Caroline) ROSS IS UM... HARD
AND TOUGH ON THE OUTSIDE,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.000
BUT A BIG SOFT MARSHMALLOW
IN THE MIDDLE. HE'S UM...

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
KIND OF A MACHO KIND OF A GUY
UNTIL YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
HE'S REALLY A GENTLE SOUL.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
HAD ENOUGH?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000
YEAH.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
OKAY. TAKE OFF.
9:30, OKAY?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
UH HUH.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
WELL, WAIT - 9.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
I'M NOT GOING TO
BED AT 9:30!

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE DOING
YOUR TWO QUESTIONS.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
IT DOESN'T TAKE ME HALF
AN HOUR TO DO MY HOMEWORK.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
FINE. 9:30.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
THANK YOU!

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
SEE YA.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
BYE.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000
BE GOOD.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
I WILL.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS
 ROSS STRUGGLED TO KEEP

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
HIS FAMILY TOGETHER,
 BUT THEN A BOMBSHELL.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
(Jessica) ME AND DAD WEREN'T
GETTING ALONG VERY WELL...

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I FIGURED, THOUGHT
MAYBE TAKING SOME TIME
APART WOULD BE A GOOD

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
DECISION - GETTING TO
KNOW MOM BETTER AND...
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
JUSTIN AND JESSICA, THE
 TWO ELDEST CHILDREN,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO MOVE
 BACK IN WITH THEIR MOTHER.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I HAD TO GET USED TO THE IDEA
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN
BRAINS, I CAN'T STOP THEM.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
THE YEARS I'VE HAD THEM,
I'VE TRIED TO SHOW THEM THE

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND
WRONG AND TO BE INDEPENDENT

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
THINKERS AND NOW
THEY'RE THINKING.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
IT'S WHAT I TAUGHT THEM TO DO.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
IN THE WINTER AFTER HER
 BROTHER AND SISTER HAD GONE,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
SHANNON DEVELOPED
 HEALTH PROBLEMS.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
SHE WAS THIN, AND HAD
 DIFFICULTY EATING.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
AFTER NUMEROUS MEDICAL
 APPOINTMENTS, THERE WERE STILL

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
NO DIAGNOSIS AND
 ROSS WAS WORRIED.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
ENDED UP WITH
ANOTHER
PRESCRIPTION?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
UH HUH

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER
IF THOSE PILLS YOU'RE TAKING

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
AREN'T GIVING YOU
A STOMACH ACHE TOO.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
OVER THE LONG PRAIRIE WINTER
 THINGS GOT WORSE FOR ROSS.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
MONEY WAS TIGHTER THAN EVER.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
SHANNON WAS NOW A TEENAGER,
 EXPENSES WERE HIGHER.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
YOU GOTTA EAT
TWO, COME OFF IT,
TRY AND EAT TWO.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
THE CAR NEEDED WORK,
MY PLATES WERE DUE.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
JANUARY AND FEBRUARY AND STUFF
IS A BAD MONTH FOR ME,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
JUST EVERYTHING.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
SHANNY HAD NO CLOTHES TO WEAR
ANYMORE - SHE GREW ABOUT A FOOT.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, EH.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GOT NO
CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
EVERYBODY ELSE IS PULLING THE
STRINGS AND YOU JUST KIND OF

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
SIT THERE AND WONDER WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, EH.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
WHAT ARE WE DOING
THIS SUMMER MAYBE?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I DUNNO.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
MOVING?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
YEAH.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I DON'T CARE.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
TRY AND BE
NICE, OKAY?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
I AM, BUT I DON'T CARE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
HE DECIDED TO MOVE OUT OF
 MARTENSVILLE AND SHARE AN

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
APARTMENT WITH HIS FRIEND,
 CAROLINE, IN SASKATOON,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
A FEW KILOMETRES AWAY. BY THE
 SPRING, SHANNON'S ILLNESS

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
WAS UNDER CONTROL, AND SHE
 WAS SLOWLY RECOVERING.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
BY MID SUMMER IT SEEMED THAT
 LIFE WAS FINALLY TURNING AROUND

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
FOR ROSS HEIGHT. THE
 RELATIONSHIP WITH CAROLINE

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
HAD DEEPENED AND HE NOW HAD A
 WELL PAYING JOB CAT SKINNING

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
FOR THE OIL PATCH.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
(Ross) IT'S FAMILIAR STUFF
AND I ENJOY DOING IT.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
ACTUALLY, I'M VERY GLAD TO
BE DOING IT AGAIN INSTEAD OF

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
COOPED UP IN SHOPS OR SITTING
AROUND WATCHING TV.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
THE WAY IT WORKS, YOU GO AWAY
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND YOU

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
COME HOME FOR A FEW
DAYS OR WHATEVER.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
WHEN THERE'S WORK TO DO, YOU DO
IT, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE MOBILE.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
NOW I CAN BE MOBILE, UNLIKE THE
LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH THE

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
KIDS. FIVE YEARS AGO, OR THREE
YEARS AGO EVEN, LOOKING FIVE

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
MINUTES AHEAD WAS KIND OF
HARD ON THE HEAD!

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
DIDN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
IT'S NICE TO BE ALIVE
AGAIN, THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
BUT THERE WAS TENSION.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
FOR SHANNON, NOW 15, THERE'S
 A DIFFICULT DECISION ON

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
THE HORIZON, SHE HAD BEEN
 VISITING HER OLDER BROTHER

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
AND SISTER AND WAS BEING
 PRESSURED TO MOVE TO

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
VANCOUVER. ROSS HEIGHT
 FEARED HE WOULD SOON LOSE

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
HIS THIRD CHILD.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
(Ross) SHANNY WAS OUT THERE FOR
A WEEK AND I COULD TELL WHEN

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
SHANNON GOT BACK THAT
SHE WAS A DIFFERENT GIRL.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO
CONVINCE HER AGAIN, STILL,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT SHE WAS IN

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
IN SASKATOON.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
DAD GOES AWAY, RIGHT,
AND HE GOES AWAY FOR
LIKE TWO OR THREE WEEKS

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
AT A TIME. AND SHE
DOESN'T SEE HIM
FOR THAT LONG AND

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
SHE STAYS WITH HIS
GIRLFRIEND AND...
I DON'T KNOW.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
I THINK SHE'S JUST
CRAZY AND SHE WANTS
MORE OF HER ACTUAL

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
FAMILY AROUND.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE FAMILY.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
THE DECISION HE'S BEEN DREADING
 IS ABOUT TO BECOME A REALITY.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
AFTER LIVING WITH HER FATHER
 AND CAROLINE IN THE NEW

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
APARTMENT, SHANNON ANNOUNCED
 THAT SHE'D MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
MOVE IN WITH HER MOTHER AND
 ATTEND SCHOOL IN VANCOUVER.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.000
(*)

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
I DON'T THINK SHE'S OKAY. I
DON'T THINK THINGS WILL EVER BE

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
OKAY OUT THERE, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
AND ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU
KNOW, AM I SUPPOSED TO SPEND

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
THE NEXT 20 YEARS
FIGHTING THIS THING TOO?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
EVENTUALLY IT'S GOING TO HAVE
TO BE UP TO THEM TO DECIDE

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
WHICH, WHAT KIND OF
LIFE THEY WANNA HAVE.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO HIM IN THE

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
WORLD IS TO BE A FATHER TO
THOSE KIDS. BE A GOOD PARENT.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
THAT'S HIS JOB.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
YOU KNOW, I DID WHAT I COULD,
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT, WELL,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I
SHOULD HAVE DONE, YOU KNOW?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
HANG ME.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
HE'S JUST VERY
STUBBORN AND ALL
KINDS OF STUFF...

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
HE'S JUST THE WAY
HE SHOULD BE.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
HE'S A DAD!

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
WHAT'S A GOOD DAD? WEAR FUNKY,
YUPPY SHORTS OUT GOLFING, OR?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
DOING WHAT I DID? DOES A GOOD
DAD BRING HOME TONS OF MONEY

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
AND GIVE THE KID 100 BUCKS AND
SAY, "I'LL SEE YOU ON MONDAY",

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
OR WHAT DOES A GOOD DAD DO?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT
I SHOULD BE DOING.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I
ADMIRE ABOUT HIM, IS HOW MUCH

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
HE LOVES HIS KIDS AND THINKS
ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED AND GIVES

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
IT TO THEM, NO MATTER WHAT.
HE'S A GOOD DAD.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I REALLY ADMIRE THAT ABOUT HIM.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
THE CHILDREN ARE NOW
 1800 KILOMETERS AWAY

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
AND HE CONSOLES HIMSELF WITH
 THE MEMORABILIA ALL FAMILIES

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
COLLECT BUT NOT ALL KEEP.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
THE ALL IMPORTANT MEMORIES
 OF A SINGLE DAD.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
THIS WAS FOR LOOKING AFTER
SOMEBODY IN GRADE 1 OR 2.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
YOU KNOW.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
BASKETBALL, VOLLEYBALL,
BADMINTON, STUDENT LEADER,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
THIS KIND OF STUFF. YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
THERE'S NOTHING HERE RECOGNIZED
FOR OUTSTANDING SERVICE OR

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, BUT STILL
IT'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN SPITE

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
OF EVERYTHING THEY
WERE GOING THROUGH.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
AND SHANNY WON HER PIANO, WITH
THE ADJUDICATORS JUDGING,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
JESS WON HER FLUTE. JUSTIN WAS
JAMMIN' AT BUD'S, PLAYING DRUMS.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
AND THE WHOLE TIME THAT WAS
GOING ON, I WAS BEG, BORROWING,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
AND STEALING MONEY TO
KEEP IT ALL GOING, EH.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
SO. WAS IT WORTH IT?
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
I WOULD DO IT OVER 10 TIMES.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:43:35.000
