00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:42.900


2
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
Good day, sir.

3
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.900
I am glad you're well.

4
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.870
I have not seen you long.

5
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.000
How goes the world?

6
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.800
Oh, it wears, sir, as itgrows.

7
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.100
Ay, that's well known: butwhat particular rarity?

8
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.400
What strange,

9
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.770
which manifold record notmatches?

10
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.970
See, magic of bounty!

11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.630
All these spirits thy powershave conjured to attend.

12
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.800
I know the merchant.

13
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.500
I know them both; theother's a jeweller.

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.370
Oh, 'tis a worthy lord.

15
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.730
Nay, that's most fixed.

16
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.870
A most incomparable man,breathed, as it were,

17
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.530
to an untirable andcontinuate goodness:

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.200
he passes.

19
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.230
I have a jewel here

20
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.530
Oh, pray, let's see it.

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.100
For the Lord Timon, sir?

22
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.000
If he will touch theestimate:

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.530
but, for that

24
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.730
'Tis a good form.

25
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.730
And rich, yes.

26
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.930
You are rapt, sir, in somework,

27
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.730
some dedication to thegreat Lord.

28
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.500
A thing slipped idly fromme.

29
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.330
Our poesy is as a gum

30
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.330
which oozes from whence'tis nourished:

31
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.100
the fire in the flint showsnot till it be struck;

32
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.430
our gentle flame provokesitself

33
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.030
and like the current flieseach bound it chafes.

34
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.030
What have you there?

35
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.330
A picture, sir.

36
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.670
When comes your bookforth?

37
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.900
Upon the heels of mypresentment, sir.

38
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.130
Let's see your piece.

39
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.600
It's a good piece.

40
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.100
Oh, so 'tis:

41
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.230
this comes off well andexcellent.

42
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.470
Indifferent.

43
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.330
Admirable: how this gracespeaks his own standing.

44
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630
What a mental power thiseye shoots forth.

45
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.530
How big imagination movesin this lip.

46
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.770
To the dumbness of thegesture one might interpret.

47
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770
It's a pretty mocking ofthe life.

48
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.300
Here is a touch; is itgood?

49
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.630
I will say of it, ittutors nature:

50
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.670
Artificial strife lives inthese touches,

51
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.230
livelier than life.

52
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.970
How this lord is followed.

53
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.670
The senators of Athens:happy man.

54
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.530
Look, more.

55
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.000
You see this confluence, thisgreat flood of visitors?

56
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.670
I have, in this roughwork, shaped out a man,

57
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.600
whom this beneath worlddoth embrace and hug

58
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.100
with amplestentertainment:

59
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.130
my free drift halts notparticularly,

60
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.500
but moves itself in a widesea of tacks:

61
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.670
no levelled malice infects onecomma in the course I hold;

62
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.600
but flies an eagle flight,bold and forth on,

63
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.270
leaving no tract behind.

64
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.270
How shall I understandyou?

65
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.200
I will unbolt to you.

66
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.070
You see how allconditions, how all minds,

67
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.070
as well of glib andslippery creatures

68
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.500
as of grave and austerequality,

69
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.570
tender down their servicesto Lord Timon:

70
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.300
his large fortune upon his goodand gracious nature hanging

71
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.230
subdues and properties tohis love and tendence

72
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.070
all sorts of hearts;

73
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.270
yea, from the glass-facedflatterers

74
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.500
to Apemantus,

75
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.430
whom few things loves betterthan to abhor himself:

76
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.870
even he drops down theknee before him

77
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.000
and returns in peace mostrich in Timon's nod.

78
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.730
I saw them speak together.

79
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.530
Sir, I have on a high andpleasant hill

80
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.370
feigned fortune to be throned:the base of the mount

81
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.870
is ranked with all deserts,all kind of natures,

82
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.670
that labor on the bosom ofthis sphere

83
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.600
to propagate their states.

84
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.900
Amongst them all, whoseeyes are on this sovereignlady fixed,

85
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.670
one do I personate of LordTimon's frame,

86
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.270
whom fortune with herivory hand wafts to her;

87
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.900
whose present grace topresent slaves and servants

88
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.170
translates his rivals.

89
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.500
'Tis conceived to scope.

90
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.270
This throne, this fortune,and this hill, methinks,

91
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.130
with one man beckoned fromthe rest below,

92
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.870
bowing his head againstthe sleepy mount

93
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.170
to climb his happiness,

94
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.300
would be well expressed inour condition.

95
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.130
Nay, sir, but hear me on.

96
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.630
All those which were hisfellows but of late

97
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.670
Mmm.

98
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.130
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

99
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.130
But of late.

100
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.430
Even better than hisvalue,

101
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.800
on the moment follow hisstrides,

102
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.300
his lobbies fill withtendance,

103
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.430
rain sacrificialwhisperings in his ear,

104
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.930
make sacred even hisstirrup,

105
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.970
and through him drink thefree air.

106
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.900
Ay, marry, what of these?

107
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.600
When fortune in her shiftand change of mood

108
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.030
spurns down her latebeloved,

109
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.930
all his dependants thatlabor after him

110
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.770
to the mountain's top, evenon their knees and hands,

111
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.070
let him slip down,

112
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.970
not one accompanying hisdeclining foot.

113
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.930
'Tis common: a thousandmoral paintings I can show

114
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.270
that shall demonstrate thesequick blows of fortune's

115
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.570
more pregnantly thanwords.

116
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.400
Yet you do well to showLord Timon

117
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.270
that mean eyes have seenthe foot above the head.

118
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.870
Imprisoned is he, say you?

119
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.030
Ay, my good lord.

120
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.600
Five talents is his debt,

121
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.070
his means most short, hiscreditors most strait:

122
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.700
your honorable letter hedesires

123
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.070
to those have shut him up;

124
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.670
which failing, periods hiscomfort.

125
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.830
Noble Ventidius!

126
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.270
Well; I am not of that featherto shake off my friend

127
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.030
when he must needs me.

128
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.000
I do know him a gentlemanwell deserves a help:

129
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.600
which he shall have: I'llpay the debt and free him.

130
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.330
Your Lordship ever bindshim.

131
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.570
Commend me to him.

132
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.930
I will send his ransom;

133
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.670
and being enfranchised,bid him come to me.

134
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.470
'Tis not enough to helpthe feeble up,

135
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.670
but to support him after.

136
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.630
Lord Timon, hear me speak.

137
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.730
Freely, good father.

138
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.800
Thou hast a servant namedLucilius.

139
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.770
Yes, I have so: what ofhim?

140
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.970
Most noble Timon, call theman before thee.

141
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.400
Attends he here, or no?

142
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.530
Lucilius!

143
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.630
Here, at Your Lordship'sservice.

144
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.870
This fellow here, LordTimon, this thy creature

145
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.000
at night frequents myhouse.

146
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.270
I am a man that from my firsthave been inclined to thrift;

147
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.100
and my estate deserves anheir more raised

148
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.800
than one which holds atrencher.

149
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.700
Well; what further?

150
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.670
One only daughter have I,no kin else,

151
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.070
on whom I may confer whatI have got.

152
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.170
The maid is fair, of theyoungest for a bride,

153
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.830
and I have bred her at mydearest cost

154
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.270
in qualities of the best.

155
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.430
This man of thine attemptsher love.

156
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.730
I prithee, noble Lord,join with me

157
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.900
to forbid him her resort;

158
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.970
myself have spoke in vain.

159
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.530
The man is honest.

160
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.100
Therefore he will be,Timon:

161
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.730
his honesty rewards him initself;

162
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.530
it must not bear mydaughter.

163
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.870
Does she love him?

164
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.970
She is young and apt.

165
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.770
Our own precedent passionsdo instruct us

166
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.970
what levity's in youth.

167
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.330
And love you the maid?

168
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.330
Ay, my good Lord, and sheaccepts of it.

169
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.930
If, in her marriage, myconsent is missing,

170
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.800
I call the gods to witness,

171
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.330
I will choose mine heirfrom forth the beggarsof this world,

172
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.370
and dispossess her all!

173
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.170
How shall she be endowed,

174
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.370
if she be mated with anequal husband?

175
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.670
Three talents on thepresent; in future, all.

176
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.630
This gentleman of minehath served me long.

177
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.570
To build his fortune, Iwill strain a little,

178
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.600
for 'tis a bond in men.

179
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.830
Give him thy daughter.

180
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.770
What you bestow, in him,I'll counterpoise,

181
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:03.630
make him weigh with her.

182
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.670
My noble Lord,

183
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:12.800
pawn me to this yourhonor, she is his.

184
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.400
My hand to you; my honoron my promise.

185
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:19.930
Humbly I thank YourLordship.

186
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.830
Never may that state offortune fall into my keeping,

187
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.100
that is not owed to you.

188
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.630
Vouchsafe my labor, andlong live Your Lordship!

189
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.730
I thank you; you shallhear from me anon.

190
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.130
What have you there, myfriend?

191
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.500
A piece of painting, whichI do beseech Your Lordshipto accept.

192
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.000
Painting is welcome.

193
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.330
Painting is almost thenatural man;

194
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.600
or since dishonor trafficswith man's nature,

195
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.300
he is but outside.

196
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.700
these pencilled figures areeven such as they give out.

197
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.270
I like your work; youshall find I like it.

198
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.930
Wait attendance till youhear further from me.

199
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.200
The gods preserve you!

200
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.030
Well fare you, gentleman.

201
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.930
Give me your hand; we mustneeds dine together, hmm?

202
00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:00.930
Sir, sir, your jewel hathsuffered under praise.

203
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.230
What, my lord?

204
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.230
Dispraise?

205
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.170
A mere satiety ofcommendations.

206
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.800
If I should pay you for itas 'tis extolled,

207
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.430
it would unclew me quite.

208
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.970
My lord, 'tis rated as thosewhich sell would give.

209
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.400
But you well know, thingsof like value

210
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.830
differing in the owners

211
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.900
are prized by theirmasters.

212
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.070
Believe it, dear lord,

213
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.170
you mend the jewel by thewearing it.

214
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:28.170
Well mocked.

215
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.600
Oh, no, my good lord;

216
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:35.500
he speaks the commontongue, which all menspeak with him.

217
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.130
Look, who comes here: willyou be chid?

218
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.500
We'll bear, with YourLordship.

219
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.470
We'll spare none.

220
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.430
Good morrow to thee,gentle Apemantus.

221
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.070
Till I be gentle, staythou for thy good morrow;

222
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.670
when thou art Timon's dog,and these knaves honest.

223
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.670
Why dost thou call themknaves?

224
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:51.870
Thou knowest them not.

225
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.130
Are they not Athenians?

226
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.130
Yes.

227
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.630
Then I repent not.

228
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.200
You know me, Apemantus?

229
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.170
Thou knowest I do: Icalled thee by thy name.

230
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.630
Thou art proud, Apemantus.

231
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.130
Of nothing so much as thatI am not like Timon.

232
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.430
Whither art going?

233
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.000
To knock out an honestAthenian's brains.

234
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.200
That's a deed thou'lt diefor.

235
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.630
Right, if doing nothing bedeath by the law.

236
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.000
How likest thou thispicture, Apemantus?

237
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.700
The best, for theinnocence.

238
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.470
Wrought he not well thatpainted it?

239
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.670
He wrought better thatmade the painter;

240
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.870
and yet he's but a filthypiece of work.

241
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.470
You're a dog.

242
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.430
Thy mother's of mygeneration: what's she, ifI be a dog?

243
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.600
Wilt dine with me,Apemantus?

244
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.770
No; I eat not lords.

245
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.570
And thou shouldst, thouwouldst anger ladies.

246
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:44.000
O, they eat lords; so theycome by great bellies.

247
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.030
That's a lasciviousapprehension.

248
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.470
So thou apprehendest it.

249
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.970
Take it for thy labor.

250
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.000
How dost thou like thisjewel, Apemantus?

251
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.630
Not as well as plain dealing,

252
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.630
which will not cost a mana doit.

253
00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.370
What dost thou think 'tisworth?

254
00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.400
Not worth my thinking.

255
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.270
How now, poet!

256
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:08.030
How now, philosopher!

257
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.200
Thou liest.

258
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.200
Art not one?

259
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.200
Yes.

260
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.270
Then I lie not.

261
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.700
Art not a poet?

262
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.700
Yes.

263
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700
Then thou liest.

264
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.830
Look in thy last work,

265
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.130
where thou hast feignedhim a worthy fellow.

266
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.770
That's not feigned; he isso.

267
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.270
Yes, he is worthy of thee andto pay thee for thy labor.

268
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.030
He that loves to be flatteredis worthy of the flatterer.

269
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.770
Heavens, that I were alord.

270
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.370
What wouldst do then,Apemantus?

271
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.100
Even as Apemantus does now;hate a lord with my heart.

272
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.270
What, thyself?

273
00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.270
Ay.

274
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.300
Wherefore?

275
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.500
That I had no angry wit tobe a lord.

276
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.000
Art not thou a merchant?

277
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.530
Ay, Apemantus.

278
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.470
Traffic confound thee, ifthe gods will not!

279
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.230
If traffic do it, the godsdo it.

280
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.300
Traffic's thy god; and thygod confound thee.

281
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.430
What trumpet's that?

282
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.030
'Tis Alcibiades, and sometwenty horse,

283
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.300
all of companionship.

284
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.570
Pray, entertain them; givethem guide to us.

285
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.730
Now go not you hence tillI've thanked you.

286
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.730
When dinner's done, youshow me this piece.

287
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.570
I am joyful of your sights.

288
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.070
Oh.

289
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.370
Most welcome, sir!

290
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.970
Sir, you have saved mylonging,

291
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.730
and I feed most hungerlyon your sight.

292
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.100
Right welcome, sir!

293
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.170
Ere we depart, we'll sharea bounteous time

294
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.400
in different pleasures.

295
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.230
Pray, pray let us in.

296
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.330
So, so, there!

297
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.400
Aches contract and starveyour supple joints!

298
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.730
That there should be smalllove among these sweet knaves,

299
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:39.630
and all this courtesy.

300
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.500
The strain of man's bredout into baboon and monkey

301
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.500
What time of day is it,Apemantus?

302
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.630
Time to be honest.

303
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.270
That time serves still.

304
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.370
The more accursed thou,that still omittest it.

305
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.330
Thou art going to LordTimon's feast?

306
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.870
Ay, to see meat fill knavesand wine heat fools.

307
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.330
Fare thee well, fare theewell.

308
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:58.130
Thou art a fool to bid mefarewell twice.

309
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.430
Why, Apemantus?

310
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.870
Shouldst have kept one tothyself,

311
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.070
for I mean to give theenone.

312
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.100
Hang thyself!

313
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.930
No, I will do nothing atthy bidding:

314
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:08.070
make thy requests to thyfriend.

315
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.870
Away, unpeaceable dog, orI'll spurn thee hence!

316
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.000
I will fly, like a dog,the heels of the ass.

317
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.030
Hee-haw.

318
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.830
He's opposite to humanity.

319
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.930
Come, shall we in, andtaste Lord Timon's bounty?

320
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.500
He outgoes the very heartof kindness.

321
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.030
He pours it out;

322
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.800
Plutus, the god of gold,is but his steward.

323
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.170
No meed, but he repayssevenfold above itself;

324
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.930
no gift to him, but breedsthe giver a return

325
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:36.500
exceeding all use of quittance.

326
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.400
The noblest mind he carriesthat ever governed man.

327
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.370
Long may he live infortunes.

328
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.370
Shall we in?

329
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.470
I'll keep you company.

330
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.130
Most honored Timon!

331
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.430
Ventidius!

332
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.800
Oh!

333
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.230
It hath pleased the gods toremember my father's age,

334
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.830
and call him to longpeace.

335
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.370
He is gone happy, and hasleft me rich.

336
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:06.600
And, as in grateful virtue Iam bound to your free heart,

337
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.900
I do return those talents,

338
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.100
doubled with thanks andservice,

339
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.270
from whose help I derivedliberty.

340
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.030
Oh, by no means, honestVentidius;

341
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.230
you mistake my love:

342
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.230
I gave it freely ever;

343
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.200
and there's none can trulysay he gives,

344
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.870
if he receives.

345
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.100
If our betters play atthat game,

346
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.300
we must not dare toimitate them.

347
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.270
Faults that are rich arefair.

348
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:25.630
A noble spirit.

349
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.370
Nay, my lord.

350
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.530
Ceremony was but devisedat first

351
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.870
to set a gloss on faintdeeds,

352
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.770
hollow welcomes, recantinggoodness,

353
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.570
sorry ere 'tis shown;

354
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.670
But where there is truefriendship, there needs none.

355
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.030
Pray, sit;

356
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.130
more welcome are ye to myfortunes

357
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.530
than my fortunes are tome.

358
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.630
My lord, we have alwaysconfessed it.

359
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:49.800
Oh, confessed it!

360
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.100
Hanged it, have you not?

361
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.900
Oh, Apemantus, you arewelcome.

362
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.270
No, you shall not make mewelcome.

363
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.300
I come to have thee thrustme out of doors.

364
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.770
Fie, thou art a churl;

365
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.370
you've a humor there doesnot become a man:

366
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.930
'tis much to blame.

367
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.130
They say, my lords, "irafuror brevis est;"

368
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:23.900
but yond man is everangry.

369
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.830
Go, let him have a tableby himself,

370
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.770
for he does neither affectcompany,

371
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.930
nor is he fit for it, indeed.

372
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.670
Let me stay at thineapperil, Timon.

373
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.900
I come to observe;

374
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.300
I give thee warning on it.

375
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.830
I take no heed of thee;

376
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.930
Thou art an Athenian,therefore welcome:

377
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.430
I myself would have nopower;

378
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:43.070
prithee, let my meat makethee silent.

379
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.430
I scorn thy meat;

380
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.530
'twould choke me, for Ishould ne'er flatter thee.

381
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.500
O you gods, what a numberof men eats Timon,

382
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.600
and he sees 'em not!

383
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.370
It grieves me to see somany

384
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.600
dip their meat in oneman's blood;

385
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.300
and all the madness is, hecheers them up too.

386
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.070
I wonder men dare trustthemselves with men:

387
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.000
Methinks they should invitethem without knives;

388
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.370
good for their meat, andsafer for their lives.

389
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.600
There's much example forit;

390
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.030
the fellow that sits next him,now parts bread with him,

391
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.970
pledges the breath of himin a divided draught,

392
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.670
is the readiest man tokill him.

393
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.170
It has been proved.

394
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.330
If I were a huge man, Iwould fear to drink at meals

395
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.930
lest they should spy mywindpipe's dangerous notes:

396
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.570
Great men should drink withharness on their throats.

397
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.670
My lords, in heart.

398
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.500
And let the health goround.

399
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.770
Let it flow this way, mygood lord.

400
00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.770
Flow this way!

401
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.770
A brave fellow!

402
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.500
He keeps his tides well.

403
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.700
Those healths will makethee and thy state lookill, Timon.

404
00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.270
Here's that which is tooweak to be a sinner,

405
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.830
honest water,

406
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.170
which ne'er left man inthe mire:

407
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:06.800
It and my food are equals;

408
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.630
there's no odds.

409
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.700
Feasts are too proud togive thanks to the gods.

410
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.100
Immortal gods, I craveno pelf;

411
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.100
I pray for no man butmyself.

412
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.270
Grant I may never prove sofond

413
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.270
to trust man on his oathor bond;

414
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.830
or a harlot, for herweeping;

415
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:29.570
or a dog, that seemsa-sleeping;

416
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.300
or a keeper with myfreedom;

417
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.230
or my friends, if I shouldneed 'em.

418
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.870
Amen.

419
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.400
So fall to it.

420
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.800
Rich men sin, and I eatroot.

421
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.670
Much good dich thy goodheart, Apemantus.

422
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.230
All!

423
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.700
May it please Your Honor.

424
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.730
Lord Lucius, out of hisfree love,

425
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.500
hath presented to you fourmilk-white horses

426
00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.770
trapped in silver.

427
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.930
I shall accept themfairly.

428
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.230
Let the presents beworthily entertained.

429
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:36.700
Please you, my lord,

430
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.600
Lord Lucullus entreatsyour company tomorrow

431
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.770
to hunt with him,

432
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.470
and has sent Your Honortwo brace of greyhounds.

433
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.370
I'll hunt with him.

434
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.830
Let them be well received,not without fair reward.

435
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.430
Captain Alcibiades, yourheart's in the field now.

436
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.770
My heart's ever at yourservice, my good lord.

437
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.370
Had you rather be at abreakfast of enemies

438
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.300
than a dinner of friends?

439
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.270
So they were bleeding-new,my lord,

440
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.400
there's no meat like them:

441
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.000
I could wish my bestfriend at such a feast.

442
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.630
Would all those flattererswere thy enemies then,

443
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.030
that then thou mightst kill'em and bid me to 'em!

444
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.030
Might we but have thathappiness, my lord,

445
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.700
that you would once useour hearts,

446
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.200
whereby we might expresssome part of our zeals,

447
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.230
we should think ourselvesforever perfect.

448
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.330
No doubt, my good friends,but the gods themselves

449
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.930
have provided I shall havemuch help from you.

450
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.830
How had you been myfriends else?

451
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.070
Why have you that charitabletitle from thousands,

452
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:44.400
did not you chiefly belongto my heart?

453
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.130
I have told more of you tomyself

454
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.230
than you can with modestyspeak in your own behalf;

455
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.770
and thus far, I confirmyou.

456
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.270
O you gods, think I, whatneed we have any friends,

457
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.200
should we ne'er have needof 'em?

458
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.830
They're the most needlesscreatures living,

459
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:03.770
should we ne'er have useof 'em,

460
00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.030
and should most resemblesweet instruments

461
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.970
hung up in cases that keeptheir sounds to themselves.

462
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:16.130
Why, I have often wishedmyself poorer,

463
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.870
that I might come nearerto you.

464
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.330
We're born to do benefits:

465
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.900
and what better or properercan we call our own

466
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.800
than the riches of ourfriends?

467
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.630
O, what a precious comfort'tis,

468
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.870
to have so many, likebrothers,

469
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.630
commanding one another'sfortunes.

470
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:39.470
Oh, joy's even made a wayere it can be born.

471
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.330
Mine eyes cannot hold outwater, methinks.

472
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.030
To forget their faults, Idrink to you.

473
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.330
Thou weepest to make themdrink, Timon.

474
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.000
Joy had the likeconception in our eyes,

475
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.630
and that instant, like ababe, sprung up.

476
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.800
I laugh to think that babea bastard.

477
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.470
I promise you, my lord,you moved me much.

478
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.500
Much!

479
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:06.900
How now? What means thattrump?

480
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.030
Please you, my lord, thereare certain ladies

481
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.570
most desirous ofadmittance.

482
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.030
Ladies!

483
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.270
What are their wills?

484
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.930
There comes with them aforerunner, my lord,

485
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.730
which bears that office, tosignify their pleasures.

486
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.330
Well, let them have kindadmittance.

487
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.830
Music, make their welcome.

488
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:57.000
Hail, hail, hail to thee,worthy Timon,

489
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:07.370
and to all that of hisbounties taste!

490
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:16.530
The five best sensesacknowledge thee their patron;

491
00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:27.030
and come freely to gratulatethy plenteous bosom:

492
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:38.300
and come freely to gratulatethy plenteous bosom:

493
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.430
There, taste, touch, all,

494
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.570
there, taste, touch, all,

495
00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:44.900
pleased from thy tablerise;

496
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.870
pleased from thy tablerise;

497
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.230
pleased from thy tablerise;

498
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.500
pleased from thy tablerise;

499
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:59.730
They only now come but tofeast thine eyes.

500
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:07.600
They only now come but tofeast thine eyes.

501
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:39.900
You see, my lord, howample you are beloved?

502
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:06.570
Hoy-day, what a sweep ofvanity comes this way!

503
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.800
They dance.

504
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.530
They are mad women.

505
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.300
Like madness is the gloryof this life.

506
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.800
As this pomp shows to alittle oil and root.

507
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.970
We make ourselves fools todisport ourselves;

508
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.230
and spend our flatteriesto drink those men

509
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.530
upon whose age we void itup again

510
00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.930
with poisonous spite andenvy.

511
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.700
Who lives that's notdepraved or depraves?

512
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:45.870
Who dies that bears notone spurn to their graves

513
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:49.200
of their friends' gift?

514
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.470
I should fear that thosethat dance before me now

515
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.770
would one day stamp uponme.

516
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.670
It has been done.

517
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.900
Men shut their doorsagainst a setting sun.

518
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.870
You have done our pleasuresmuch grace, fair ladies,

519
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.530
set a fair fashion on ourentertainment.

520
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.770
I am to thank you for it.

521
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.300
My lord, you take us evenat the best.

522
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.770
'Faith, for the worst isfilthy;

523
00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.670
and would not hold taking,I doubt me.

524
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.570
Flavius, the little casketbring me hither.

525
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.600
Yes, my lord.

526
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.070
More jewels yet!

527
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.900
There is no crossing himin his humor;

528
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:05.900
Else I should tell him

529
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.200
well, in faith I should

530
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.700
when all's spent,

531
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.830
he would be crossed then,he could.

532
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.930
'Tis pity bounty had noteyes behind,

533
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.000
that man might ne'er bewretched for his mind.

534
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.130
Ah, Flavius.

535
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:40.370
My lord, honor me so muchas to advance this jewel;

536
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.630
accept it and wear it,kind my lord.

537
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.800
I am so far already inyour gifts

538
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.130
So are we all.

539
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.530
I beseech Your Honor,vouchsafe me a word;

540
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.700
it does concern you near.

541
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.830
Near!

542
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.030
Why, then, another timeI'll hear:

543
00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.930
What will this come to?

544
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:00.600
He commands us to provideand give great gifts,

545
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.500
and all out of an emptycoffer:

546
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.100
Nor will he know hispurse, or yield me this,

547
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.900
to show him what a beggarhis heart is,

548
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.130
being of no power to makehis wishes good.

549
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.000
His promises fly so beyondhis state

550
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.600
that what he speaks is allin debt;

551
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.300
he owes for every word.

552
00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.170
He is so kind that he nowpays interest for it;

553
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.970
his land's put to theirbooks.

554
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.830
Well, would I were gentlyput out of office

555
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.570
before I were forced out.

556
00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.470
Happier is he that has nofriend to feed

557
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.670
than such that do evenenemies exceed.

558
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.530
I bleed inwardly for mylord.

559
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.430
You do yourselves too muchwrong,

560
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.500
you bate too much of yourown merits:

561
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:38.200
Here, my lord, a token ofour love.

562
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.400
With more than commonthanks I will receive it.

563
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.130
O, he is the very soul ofbounty!

564
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.630
Now I do remember, mylord,

565
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.100
you gave good words theother day

566
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:47.770
of a bay courser I rodeon:

567
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.530
it is yours, because youliked it.

568
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.130
Oh, I beseech you, pardonme, my lord, in that.

569
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.430
You may take my word.

570
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.870
I know no man can justly praisebut what he does affect:

571
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.870
I weigh my friend'saffection with mine own;

572
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:59.870
I'll tell you true.

573
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:00.870
I'll call to you.

574
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.970
Oh, none so welcome.

575
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.100
I take all and yourseveral visitations sokind to heart,

576
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.730
'tis not enough to give;

577
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.500
methinks I could dealkingdoms to my friends

578
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.800
and ne'er be weary.

579
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.700
Alcibiades, thou art a soldier,therefore seldom rich;

580
00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.030
It comes in charity tothee:

581
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.100
for all thy living isamongst the dead.

582
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.930
All the lands thou hastlie in a pitched field.

583
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.830
Ay, defiled land, my lord.

584
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.770
We are so virtuouslybound.

585
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:30.830
And I to you.

586
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.700
So infinitely endeared

587
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.500
So I to you.

588
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.300
Lights, more lights!

589
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.330
The best of happiness,honor and fortunes,

590
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.570
keep with you, Lord Timon!

591
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:46.500
Ready for his friends.

592
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.430
What a coil's here.

593
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.930
Serving of becks andjutting-out of bums.

594
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.630
I doubt whether their legsbe worth the sums

595
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.070
that are paid for them.

596
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.200
Friendship's full ofdregs.

597
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.000
Methinks false hearts shouldnever have sound legs,

598
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.700
thus honest fools lay outtheir wealth on curtsies.

599
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.870
Now, Apemantus, if thouwert not sullen,

600
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.200
I would be good to thee.

601
00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.330
No, I'll nothing:

602
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.000
for if I should be bribedtoo,

603
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.970
there would be none leftto rail upon thee,

604
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.330
and then thou wouldst sinthe faster.

605
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.730
Thou givest so long,Timon,

606
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.670
I fear me thou wilt giveaway thyself in papershortly:

607
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.600
what need these feasts,pomps and vainglories?

608
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.700
Nay, and you begin to railupon society once,

609
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.400
I am sworn not to giveregard to you.

610
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.400
Farewell.

611
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.570
Come again with better music.

612
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.900
So thou wilt not hear me now;

613
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.100
thou shalt not then:

614
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.500
I'll lock thy heaven fromthee.

615
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.470
Oh, that men's ears shouldbe to counsel deaf,

616
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.030
but not to flattery.

617
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.270
Here, my lord.

618
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.070
