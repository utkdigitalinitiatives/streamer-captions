00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:44.530


2
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.470
I thought the king had moreaffected

3
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.800
the Duke of Albany thanCornwall.

4
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.330
It did always seem so to us.

5
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.500
But now, in the division of thekingdom,

6
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
it appears not which of thedukes he values most,

7
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.370
for equalities are so weighedthat curiosity in neither

8
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.730
can make choice of either'smoiety.

9
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.770
Is not this your son, my lord?

10
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.400
His breeding, sir, hath been atmy charge.

11
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.600
I have so often blushed toacknowledge him

12
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.070
that now I am brazed to it.

13
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.200
I cannot conceive you.

14
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.470
Sir, this young fellow's mothercould,

15
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.700
whereupon she grew round-wombedand had, indeed, sir,

16
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.970
a son for her cradle

17
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.400
ere she had a husband for herbed.

18
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.830
Do you smell a fault?

19
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.530
I cannot wish the fault undone,the issue of it being so proper.

20
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.830
But I have, sir, a son by orderof law,

21
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.300
some year elder than this,

22
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.730
who yet is no dearer in myaccount.

23
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.530
Though this knave came somethingsaucily into the world

24
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.130
before he was sent for, yet washis mother fair.

25
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.970
There was good sport at hismaking,

26
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.130
and the whoreson must beacknowledged.

27
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.100
Do you know this noblegentleman, Edmund?

28
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.130
No, my lord.

29
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.430
My lord of Kent.

30
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.800
Remember him hereafter as myhonorable friend.

31
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.470
My services to Your Lordship.

32
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.470
I must love you and sue to knowyou better.

33
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.230
Sir, I shall study deserving.

34
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.400
He hath been out nine years, andaway he shall again.

35
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.800
The king is coming.

36
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.970
Attend the lords of France andBurgundy, Gloucester.

37
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.730
I shall, my liege.

38
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.530
Meantime, we shall express ourdarker purpose.

39
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.400
Give me the map there.

40
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.530
Know that we have divided inthree our kingdom,

41
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.400
and 'tis our fast intent

42
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.030
to shake all care and businessfrom our age,

43
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.100
conferring them on youngerstrengths

44
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.630
while we unburdened crawl towarddeath.

45
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.200
Our son of Cornwall and you,

46
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.870
our no less loving son ofAlbany,

47
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.730
we have this hour a constantwill

48
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.530
to publish our daughters'several dowers

49
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.970
that future strife may beprevented now.

50
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.900
The princes France and Burgundy,

51
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.730
great rivals in our youngestdaughter's love,

52
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.070
long in our court have madetheir amorous sojourn

53
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.600
and here are to be answered.

54
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.300
Tell me, my daughtersÃ³

55
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.300
since now we will divest us bothof rule,

56
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.630
interest of territory, cares ofstateÃ³

57
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.770
which of you shall we say dothlove us most,

58
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.030
that we our largest bounty mayextend

59
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.830
where nature doth with meritchallenge?

60
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.770
Goneril, our eldest-born, speakfirst.

61
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.430
Sir, I love you more than wordcan wield the matter;

62
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.800
dearer than eyesight, space, andliberty;

63
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.470
beyond what can be valued richor rare;

64
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.730
no less than life, with grace,health, beauty, honor;

65
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.700
as much as child e'er loved orfather found;

66
00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.930
a love that makes breath poorand speech unable;

67
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.830
beyond all manner of so much Ilove you.

68
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.200
What shall Cordelia speak?

69
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.200
Love and be silent.

70
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.030
Of all these bounds, even fromthis line to this,

71
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.370
with shadowy forests and withchampaigns riched

72
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.870
with plenteous rivers andwide-skirted meads,

73
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.330
we make thee lady.

74
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.000
To thine and Albany's issues bethis perpetual.

75
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.830
What says our second daughter,

76
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.670
our dearest Regan, wife ofCornwall?

77
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.230
Speak.

78
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.930
I am made of that self metal

79
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.570
as my sister, and prize me ather worth.

80
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.470
In my true heart, I find shenames my very deed of love;

81
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.600
only she comes too short

82
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.000
that I profess myself an enemyto all other joys,

83
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.230
which the most precious squareof sense possesses,

84
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.800
and find I am alone felicitatein your dear highness' love.

85
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.230
Then poor Cordelia.

86
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.430
And yet not so, since I am sure

87
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.970
my love's more ponderous than mytongue.

88
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.130
To thee and thine, hereditaryever,

89
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.730
remain this ample third of ourfair kingdomÃ³

90
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.630
no less in space, validity, andpleasure

91
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.630
than that conferred on Goneril.

92
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.870
Now, our joy,

93
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.070
although our last, not least,

94
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.600
to whose young love

95
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.770
the vines of France and milk ofBurgundy

96
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.130
strive to be interested.

97
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:58.070
What can you say to win a thirdmore opulent than your sisters'?

98
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.970
Speak.

99
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.670
Nothing, my lord.

100
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.700
Nothing?

101
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.730
Nothing.

102
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:13.370
Nothing will come of nothing;speak again.

103
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.230
Unhappy that I am, I cannotheave my heart into my mouth.

104
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.830
I love Your Majesty according tomy bond,

105
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.130
no more nor less.

106
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.500
How, how, Cordelia!

107
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.800
Mend your speech a little, lestyou may mar your fortunes.

108
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.530
Good my lord, you have begot me,bred me, loved me.

109
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.600
I return those duties back asare right fit,

110
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.570
obey you, love you, and mosthonor you.

111
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.830
Why have my sisters husbands ifthey say they love you all?

112
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.270
Haply, when I shall wed, thatlord whose hand

113
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.470
must take my plight

114
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.430
shall carry half my love withhim,

115
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.570
half my care and duty.

116
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.300
Sure, I shall never marry likemy sisters,

117
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.630
to love my father all.

118
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.270
But goes thy heart with this?

119
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.100
Ay, my good lord.

120
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.500
So young and so untender?

121
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.300
So young, my lord, and true.

122
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.930
Let it be so.

123
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.370
Thy truth, then, be thy dower,

124
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.530
for, by the sacred radiance ofthe sun,

125
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.100
the mysteries of Hecate and thenight,

126
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.330
by all the operation of the orbs

127
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.730
from whom we do exist and ceaseto be,

128
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.230
here I disclaim all my paternalcare,

129
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.230
propinquity, and property ofblood

130
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.200
and, as a stranger to my heartand me,

131
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.700
hold thee, from this, forever.

132
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.530
The barbarous Scythian, or hethat makes his generation messes

133
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.600
to gorge his appetite, shall tomy bosom be

134
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.330
as well neighbored, pitied, andrelieved

135
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.200
as thou, my sometime daughter.

136
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.230
Good my liege

137
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.100
Peace, Kent!

138
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.600
Come not between the dragon andhis wrath.

139
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.570
I loved her most

140
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.570
and thought to set my rest onher kind nursery.

141
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.570
Hence, and avoid my sight!

142
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.600
So be my grave my peace,

143
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.570
as here I give her father'sheart from her.

144
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.700
Call France! Who stirs?

145
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.170
Call Burgundy.

146
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.100
Cornwall, Albany.

147
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.470
With my two daughters' dowers,digest this third.

148
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.000
Let pride, which she callsplainness, marry her.

149
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.230
I do invest you jointly with mypower, preeminence,

150
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.230
and all the large effects thattroop with majesty.

151
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.100
Ourself, by monthly course,

152
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.830
with reservation of an hundredknights,

153
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.130
by you to be sustained,

154
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.500
shall our abode make with you bydue turns.

155
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.230
Only we will retain the name andall the addition of a king.

156
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.730
The sway, revenue, execution ofthe rest,

157
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.100
beloved sons, be yours,

158
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.330
which, to confirm, this coronetpart between you.

159
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.900
Royal Lear, whom I have everhonored as my king,

160
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.170
loved as my father, as my masterfollowed,

161
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.570
as my great patron thought on inmy prayersÃ³

162
00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.400
The bow is bent and drawn; makefrom the shaft.

163
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.670
Let it fall rather,

164
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.870
though the fork invade theregion of my heart.

165
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.370
Be Kent unmannerly when Lear ismad?

166
00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.600
What wouldst thou do, old man?

167
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.900
Think'st thou that duty shallhave dread to speak

168
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.600
when power to flattery bows?

169
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.130
To plainness honor's bound whenmajesty falls to folly.

170
00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.970
Reserve thy state

171
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.200
and, in thy best consideration,check this hideous rashness.

172
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.800
Answer my life my judgment,

173
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.330
thy youngest daughter does notlove thee least.

174
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.730
Nor are those empty-hearted

175
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.730
whose low sounds reverb nohollowness.

176
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.100
Kent, on thy life, no more.

177
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.500
My life I never held but as apawn

178
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.670
to wage against thine enemiesnor fear to lose it,

179
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.700
thy safety being motive.

180
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.770
Out of my sight!

181
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.400
See better, Lear, and let mestill remain

182
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.500
the true blank of thine eye.

183
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.970
Now, by Apollo

184
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.100
Now, by Apollo, King, thouswear'st thy gods in vain!

185
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.130
O, vassal! Miscreant!

186
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.500
Dear sir, forbear.

187
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.000
Kill thy physician,

188
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.230
and the fee bestow upon thy fouldisease.

189
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.800
Revoke thy gift

190
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.470
or, whilst I can vent clamorfrom my throat,

191
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.230
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

192
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.270
Hear me, recreant!

193
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:08.530
On thine allegiance, hear me!

194
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.770
Since thou hast sought to makeus break our vow,

195
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.130
which we durst never yet, and bystrained pride

196
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.370
to come betwixt our sentence andour power,

197
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.370
which nor our nature nor ourplace can bear,

198
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:28.900
our potency made good, take thyreward.

199
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.270
Five days we do allot thee forprovision

200
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.900
to shield thee from disasters ofthe world

201
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.430
and on the sixth to turn thyhated back

202
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.530
upon our kingdom.

203
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.800
If, on the tenth day following,

204
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.000
thy banished trunk be found inour dominions,

205
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.070
the moment is thy death.

206
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.570
Away!

207
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:59.430
By Jupiter, this shall not berevoked.

208
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.870
Fare thee well, King.

209
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.730
Sith thus thou wilt appear,

210
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.900
freedom lives hence, andbanishment is here.

211
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.730
The gods to their dear sheltertake thee, maid,

212
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:19.370
that justly think'st and hastmost rightly said.

213
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.930
And your large speeches may yourdeeds approve

214
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:30.530
that good effects may springfrom words of love.

215
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.830
Thus Kent, O princes, bids youall adieu.

216
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.570
He'll shape his old course in acountry new.

217
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.930
Here's France and Burgundy, mynoble lord.

218
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.700
My lord of Burgundy, we firstaddress toward you,

219
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.230
who, with this king, hathrivaled for our daughter.

220
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.500
What, in the least,

221
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.430
will you require in presentdower with her

222
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.830
or cease your quest of love?

223
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.730
Most Royal Majesty, I crave nomore

224
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.200
than hath your highness offered;nor will you tender less.

225
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.200
Right noble Burgundy, when shewas dear to us,

226
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.830
we did hold her so, but now herprice is fallen.

227
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.470
Sir, there she stands.

228
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.170
If aught within this littleseeming substance,

229
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.900
or all of it, with ourdispleasure pieced

230
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.930
and nothing more, may haply likeyour grace,

231
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.400
she's there, and she is yours.

232
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.070
I know no answer.

233
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.900
Will you, with these infirmitiesshe owes,

234
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.970
unfriended, new-adopted to ourhate,

235
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.100
dowered with our curse, andstrangered with our oath,

236
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.400
take her or leave her?

237
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.070
Pardon me, royal sir.

238
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.170
Election makes not up in suchconditions.

239
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.270
Then leave her, sir, for, by thepower that made me,

240
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.900
I tell you all her wealth.

241
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.670
For you, great king,

242
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.870
I would not from your love makesuch a stray

243
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.000
to match you where I hate.

244
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.530
Therefore beseech you

245
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.130
to avert your liking a moreworthier way

246
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.800
than on a wretch whom nature isashamed

247
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.270
almost to acknowledge hers.

248
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.500
This is most strange,

249
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.600
that she, whom even but now wasyour best object,

250
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.670
the argument of your praise,balm of your age,

251
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.870
the best, the dearest,

252
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.430
should in this trice of timecommit a thing so monstrous

253
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.700
to dismantle so many folds offavor.

254
00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.170
Sure, her offense must be ofsuch unnatural degree

255
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.670
that monsters it,

256
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.000
or your fore-vouched affectionfall into taintÃ³

257
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.730
which, to believe of her, mustbe a faith

258
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.870
that reason without miracleshould never plant in me.

259
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.370
I yet beseech Your Majesty.

260
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.570
If for I want that glib and oilyart,

261
00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.270
to speak and purpose notÃ³

262
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:57.670
since what I well intend, I'lldo it before I speakÃ³

263
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.130
that you make known

264
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.270
it is no vicious blot, murder,or foulness,

265
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.500
no unchaste action or dishonoredstep

266
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.000
that hath deprived me of yourgrace and favor.

267
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.070
But even for want of that forwhich I am richer,

268
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.370
a still-soliciting eye

269
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.530
and such a tongue that I am gladI have not,

270
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.100
though not to have it hath lostme in your liking.

271
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.330
Better thou hadst not been born

272
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.830
than not to have pleased mebetter.

273
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.930
Is it but this, a tardiness innature,

274
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.500
that often leaves the historyunspoke

275
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.030
which it intends to do?

276
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.830
My lord of Burgundy, what sayyou to the lady?

277
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.800
Love's not love when 'tismingled with regards

278
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.700
that stand aloof from the entirepoint.

279
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.300
Will you have her?

280
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.670
She is herself a dowry.

281
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.700
Royal Majesty,

282
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.230
give but that portion whichyourself proposed,

283
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.470
and here I take Cordelia by thehand,

284
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.170
Duchess of Burgundy.

285
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.430
Nothing.

286
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.100
I have sworn. I am firm.

287
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.400
I am sorry, then, you have solost a father

288
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.270
that you must lose a husband.

289
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.630
Peace be with Burgundy.

290
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.100
Since that respects of fortuneare his love,

291
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.270
I shall not be his wife.

292
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:33.100
Fairest Cordelia, that art mostrich, being poor;

293
00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.930
most choice, forsaken; and mostloved, despised.

294
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:41.670
Thee and thy virtues here, Iseize upon.

295
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.670
Be it lawful, I take up what'scast away.

296
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.430
Gods, gods.

297
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.300
'Tis strange that from theircold'st neglect,

298
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.270
my love should kindle toinflamed respect.

299
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.730
Thy dowerless daughter, King,thrown to my chance,

300
00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:01.800
is queen of us, of ours, of ourfair France.

301
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.500
Not all the dukes of waterishBurgundy

302
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.130
can buy this unprized preciousmaid of me.

303
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.370
Bid them farewell, Cordelia,though unkind.

304
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:17.000
Thou losest here a better whereto find.

305
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.270
Thou hast her, France.

306
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.300
Let her be thine, for we have nosuch daughter,

307
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.970
nor shall ever see that face ofhers again.

308
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.370
Therefore, be gone

309
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:32.770
without our grace, our love, ourbenison.

310
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.870
Come, noble Burgundy.

311
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.570
Bid farewell to your sisters.

312
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.170
The jewels of our father,

313
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.570
with washed eyes, Cordelialeaves you.

314
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.300
I know you what you are

315
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.970
and, like a sister, am mostloath

316
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.670
to call your faults as they arenamed.

317
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.130
Love well our father.

318
00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.500
To your professed bosoms, Icommit him.

319
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.630
But yet, alas, stood I withinhis grace,

320
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.570
I would prefer him to a betterplace.

321
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.770
So farewell to you both.

322
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.500
Prescribe not us our duties.

323
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.100
Let your study be to contentyour lord,

324
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.200
who hath received you atfortune's alms.

325
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.600
You have obedience scanted

326
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.500
and well are worth the want thatyou have wanted.

327
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.870
Time shall unfold what plaitedcunning hides

328
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:32.970
who covers faults at last withshame derides.

329
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.600
Well may you prosper.

330
00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.070
Come, my fair Cordelia.

331
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.570
Sister, it is not little I haveto say

332
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.570
of what most nearly appertainsto us both.

333
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.730
I think our father will hencetonight.

334
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:54.070
That is most certain, and withyou.

335
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.130
Next month, with us.

336
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.630
You see how full of changes hisage is.

337
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:07.630
The observation we have made onit hath not been little.

338
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.630
He always loved our sister best,

339
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.900
and with what poor judgment hehath now cast her off

340
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.700
appears too grossly.

341
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.400
'Tis the infirmity of his age.

342
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.970
Yet he hath ever but slenderlyknown himself.

343
00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:26.130
The best and soundest of histime hath been but rash.

344
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.600
Then must we look from his age

345
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.900
to receive not alone theimperfections

346
00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.130
of long-engraffed condition

347
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.330
but therewithal the unrulywaywardness

348
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.500
that infirm and choleric yearsbring with them.

349
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.000
Such unconstant starts are welikely to have of him

350
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.400
as this of Kent's banishment.

351
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.430
There is further compliment ofleave-taking

352
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.570
between France and him.

353
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:54.730
Pray you, let's hit together.

354
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.430
If our father carry authority

355
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.370
with such dispositions as hebears,

356
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.430
this last surrender of his willbut offend us.

357
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.700
We shall further think on it.

358
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.700
We must do something and in theheat.

359
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.800
Thou, Nature, art my goddess.

360
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.800
To thy law my services arebound.

361
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.470
Wherefore should I stand in theplague of custom

362
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.530
and permit the curiosity ofnations to deprive me,

363
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.570
for that I am some 12 or 14moon-shines

364
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.570
lag of a brother?

365
00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.900
Why bastard?

366
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.130
Wherefore base

367
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.900
when my dimensions are as wellcompact,

368
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.930
my mind as generous, and myshape as true

369
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.770
as honest madam's issue?

370
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.530
Why brand they us with base,

371
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:10.770
with baseness, bastardy, base,base?

372
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.770
Who, in the lusty stealth ofnature,

373
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.130
take more composition and fiercequality than doth,

374
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.570
within a dull, stale, tired bed,

375
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.170
go to the creating a whole tribeof fops

376
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.900
got 'tween asleep and wake?

377
00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.770
Well, then, legitimate Edgar, Imust have your land.

378
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.300
Our father's love

379
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.670
is to the bastard Edmund as tothe legitimate.

380
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.900
Fine word, "legitimate."

381
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.930
Well, my legitimate, if thisletter speed

382
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.930
and my invention thrive,

383
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.400
Edmund the base shall top thelegitimate.

384
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.300
I grow; I prosper.

385
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.630
Now, gods, stand up forbastards.

386
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.100
Kent banished thus.

387
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.000
And France in choler parted.

388
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.400
And the king gone tonight.

389
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.130
Subscribed his power. Confinedto exhibition.

390
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.800
All this done upon the gad.

391
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.930
Edmund, how now?

392
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.400
What news?

393
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.270
So please Your Lordship, none.

394
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.430
Why so earnestly seek you to putup that letter?

395
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.670
I know no news, my lord.

396
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:38.870
What paper were you reading?

397
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:39.900
Nothing, my lord.

398
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.170
No?

399
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.430
What needed, then,

400
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.300
that terrible dispatch of itinto your pocket?

401
00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.430
The quality of nothing hath notsuch need to hide itself.

402
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.700
Let's see.

403
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.800
Come, if it be nothing, I shallnot need spectacles.

404
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.730
I beseech you, sir, pardon me.

405
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.700
It is a letter from my brotherthat I have not all o'er-read.

406
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.870
And for so much as I haveperused,

407
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.970
I find it not fit for youro'er-looking.

408
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.670
Give me the letter, sir.

409
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:13.900
I shall offend either to detainor give it.

410
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.870
The contents, as in part Iunderstand them,

411
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.930
are to blame.

412
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:18.600
Let's see. Let's see.

413
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.330
I hope, for my brother'sjustification,

414
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.500
he hath writ this

415
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.770
but as an essay or taste of myvirtue.

416
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.970
"This policy and reverence ofage

417
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.600
"makes the world bitter to thebest of our times,

418
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.930
"keeps our futures from us

419
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.500
"till our oldness cannot relishthem.

420
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.000
"I begin to find an idle andfond bondage

421
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.400
"in the oppression of agedtyranny,

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.470
"but as it is suffered.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:57.970
"Come to me, that of this I mayspeak more.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.130
"If our father should sleep tillI waked him,

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.370
"you should enjoy half hisrevenue forever

and live the beloved of yourbrother, Edgar."

428
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.330
Conspiracy?

429
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.570
"...sleep till I waked him,

430
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.670
"you should enjoy half hisrevenue"?

431
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.730
My son Edgar?

432
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.230
Had he a hand to write this,

433
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.300
a heart and brain to breed itin?

434
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.870
When came this to you?

435
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:20.900
Who brought it?

436
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.700
It was not brought me, my lord.

437
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.330
There's the cunning of it.

438
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.970
I found it thrown in at thecasement of my closet.

439
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.300
You know the character to beyour brother's?

440
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.630
If the matter were good, mylord,

441
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.070
I durst swear it were his.

442
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.930
But in respect of that, I wouldfain think it were not.

443
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.000
It is his.

444
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.400
It is his hand, my lord.

445
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.970
But I hope his heart is not inthe contents.

446
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.430
Has he never before sounded youin this business?

447
00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.700
Never, my lord.

448
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.970
But I have heard him oftmaintain it to be fit

449
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.800
that sons at perfect age andfathers declined,

450
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.630
the father should be as ward tothe son

451
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.300
and the son manage his revenue.

452
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.370
O villain, villain!

453
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:00.900
His very opinion in the letter!

454
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.370
Abhorred villain!

455
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:06.870
Unnatural, detested, brutishvillain!

456
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.600
Worse than brutish!

457
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.630
Go, sirrah, seek him.

458
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.470
I'll apprehend him.

459
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.800
Abominable villain!

460
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.800
Where is he?

461
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.070
I do not well know, my lord.

462
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.070
If it shall please you tosuspend your indignation

463
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.470
against my brother

464
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.530
till you can derive bettertestimony of his intent,

465
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.000
you shall run a certain courseÃ³

466
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
where, if you violently proceedagainst him,

467
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.300
mistaking his purpose,

468
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.800
it would make a great gap inyour own honor

469
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.830
and shake in pieces the heart ofhis obedience.

470
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.670
I dare pawn down my life forhim,

471
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:41.270
that he hath wrote this to feelmy affection to your honor

472
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.070
and to no other pretense ofdanger.

473
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.470
Think you so?

474
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.730
If your honor judge it meet, Iwill place you

475
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.230
where you shall hear us conferof this

476
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.100
and, by an auricular assurance,have your satisfaction,

477
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.930
and that with no greater delaythan this very evening.

478
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.330
He cannot be such a monster.

479
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.100
Nor is not, sure.

480
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.470
To his father, who so tenderlyand entirely loves him.

481
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.730
Heaven and Earth!

482
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.970
Seek him out, Edmund.

483
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.130
Wind me into him, I pray you.

484
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.230
Frame the business after yourown wisdom.

485
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.930
I would unstate myself to be ina due resolution.

486
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.500
I will seek him, sir, presently,

487
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.200
convey the business as I shallfind means,

488
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.670
and acquaint you withal.

489
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:27.700
These late eclipses in the Sunand moon portend no good to us.

490
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.630
Though the wisdom of nature canreason it thus and thus,

491
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:35.100
yet nature finds itself scourgedby the sequent effects.

492
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.930
Love cools, friendship fallsoff,

493
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.770
brothers divide.

494
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.600
In cities, mutinies; incountries, discord;

495
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.600
in palaces, treason.

496
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.430
And the bond cracked 'twixt sonand father.

497
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.400
This villain of mine comes underthe prediction;

498
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.300
there's son against father.

499
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.770
The king falls from bias ofnature;

500
00:26:54.770 --> 00:27:00.200
there's father against child.

501
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:05.130
Oh.

502
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:10.000
We have seen the best of ourtime.

503
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.270
Machinations, hollowness,treachery,

504
00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.800
and all ruinous disorders

505
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.600
follow us disquietly to ourgraves.

506
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.830
Find out this villain, Edmund.

507
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.870
It shall lose thee nothing.

508
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.570
Do it carefully.

509
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.900
And the noble and true-heartedKent banished.

510
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.200
His offense: honesty.

511
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.300
'Tis strange.

512
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.600
This is the excellent foppery ofthe world:

513
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.700
that when we are sick in fortune

514
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.200
often the surfeits of our ownbehaviorÃ³

515
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.530
we make guilty of our disasters

516
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.830
the Sun, the moon, and stars

517
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.270
as if we were villains onnecessity;

518
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.530
fools by heavenly compulsion;

519
00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.600
knaves, thieves, and treachers,by spherical predominance;

520
00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.900
drunkards, liars, and adulterers

521
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.130
by an enforced obedience ofplanetary influence;

522
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.870
and all that we are evil in by adivine thrusting on.

523
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.630
An admirable evasion ofwhoremaster man,

524
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:29.400
to lay his goatish dispositionon the charge of a star.

525
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.430
My father compounded with mymother

526
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.400
under the dragon's tail,

527
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.500
and my nativity was under Ursamajor,

528
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.570
so that it follows I am roughand lecherous.

529
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.970
I should have been that I am,

530
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.500
had the maidenliest star in thefirmament twinkled

531
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.270
on my bastardizing.

532
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.370
Edgar

533
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.800
Pat he comes like thecatastrophe of the old comedy.

534
00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.430
My cue is villainous melancholy,

535
00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.300
with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.

536
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:11.770
O, these eclipses do portendthese divisions.

537
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:17.600
How now, brother Edmund?

538
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.000
What serious contemplation areyou in?

539
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.300
I am thinking, brother,

540
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.130
of a prediction I read thisother day

541
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.130
what should follow theseeclipses.

542
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.730
Do you busy yourself with that?

543
00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:34.530
I promise you, the effects hewrites of succeed unhappily,

544
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:38.430
as of unnaturalness between thechild and the parent;

545
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:44.170
death, dearth, dissolutions ofancient amities;

546
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:45.430
divisions in state;

547
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.770
menaces and maledictions againstking and nobles;

548
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.600
needless diffidences; banishmentof friends;

549
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.070
dissipation of cohorts; nuptialbreaches;

550
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.270
and I know not what.

551
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.170
How long have you been a sectaryastronomical?

552
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.400
Come, come.

553
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.630
When saw you my father last?

554
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.270
The night gone by.

555
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.300
Spake you with him?

556
00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:10.730
Ay, two hours together.

557
00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.500
Parted you in good terms?

558
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.130
Found you no displeasure in himby word nor countenance?

559
00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.400
None at all.

560
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.500
Bethink yourself wherein you mayhave offended him.

561
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.670
And at my entreaty, forbear hispresence

562
00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:25.700
until some little time hathqualified the heat

563
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.770
of his displeasure,

564
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.430
which, at this instant, sorageth in him

565
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:31.770
that with the mischief of yourperson,

566
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.800
it would scarcely allay.

567
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.130
Some villain hath done me wrong.

568
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.470
That's my fear.

569
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.430
I pray you, have a continentforbearance

570
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.400
till the speed of his rage goesslower.

571
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.770
And, as I say, retire with me tomy lodging,

572
00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.630
from whence I will fitly bringyou to hear my lord speak.

573
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.230
Pray ye, go.

574
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.900
There's my key.

575
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.330
If you do stir abroad, go armed.

576
00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:56.670
Armed, brother?

577
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.770
Brother, I advise you to thebest.

578
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.500
I am no honest man if there beany good meaning toward you.

579
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.330
I have told you what I have seenand heard,

580
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.970
but faintly nothing like theimage and horror of it.

581
00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.400
Pray you, away.

582
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.500
Shall I hear from you anon?

583
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.900
I do serve you in this business.

584
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.030
A credulous father and a brothernoble,

585
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:33.100
whose nature is so far fromdoing harms

586
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.870
that he suspects none,

587
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.300
on whose foolish honesty mypractices ride easy.

588
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.670
I see the business.

589
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.670
Let me, if not by birth, havelands by wit.

590
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.630
All with me's meet that I canfashion fit.

591
00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.130
Did my father strike mygentleman

592
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.370
for chiding of his fool?

593
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.730
Aye, madam.

594
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.630
By day and night, he wrongs me.

595
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.700
Every hour, he flashes into onegross crime or other

596
00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.700
that sets us all at odds.

597
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.770
I'll not endure it.

598
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.630
His knights grow riotous,

599
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.400
and himself upbraids us on everytrifle.

600
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.730
When he returns from hunting, Iwill not speak with him.

601
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.630
Say I am sick.

602
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.130
If you come slack of formerservices,

603
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.270
you shall do well.

604
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.330
The fault of it, I'll answer.

605
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:26.370
He's coming, madam; I hear him.

606
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.630
Put on what weary negligence youplease,

607
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.200
you and your fellows.

608
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.530
I'll have it come to question.

609
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.900
If he distaste it, let him to mysister,

610
00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.700
whose mind and mine, I know, inthat are one,

611
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.730
not to be over-ruled.

612
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:44.370
Idle old man that still wouldmanage

613
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:47.100
those authorities that he hathgiven away.

614
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.830
Now, by my life, old fools arebabes again

615
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:54.330
and must be used with checks asflatteries

616
00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.930
when they are seen abused.

617
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.430
Remember what I have said.

618
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.770
Well, madam.

619
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.600
And let his knights have colderlooks among you.

620
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.030
What grows of it, no matter.

621
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:07.200
Advise your fellows so.

622
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.630
I would breed from henceoccasions,

623
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:15.200
and I shall, that I may speak.

624
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.130
I'll write straight to my sister

625
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.400
to hold my very course.

626
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.700
Prepare for dinner.

627
00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.370
If but as well I other accentsborrow

628
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.300
that can my speech defuse,

629
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.770
my good intent may carry throughitself

630
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.530
to that full issue for which Irazed my likeness.

631
00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:40.130
Now, banished Kent,

632
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:45.130
if thou canst serve where thoudost stand condemned,

633
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:49.430
so may it come thy master, whomthou lovest,

634
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.930
shall find thee full of labors.

635
00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.830
Let me not stay a jot fordinner.

636
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.700
Go, get it ready.

637
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.270
How now?

638
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.530
What art thou?

639
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.700
A man, sir.

640
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.500
What dost thou profess?

641
00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.730
What wouldst thou with us?

642
00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:14.770
I do profess to be no less thanI seem,

643
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.970
to serve him truly that will putme in trust,

644
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.670
to love him that is honest,

645
00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.770
to converse with him that iswise and says little,

646
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.170
to fear judgment, to fight whenI cannot choose,

647
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.030
and to eat no fish.

648
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.330
What art thou?

649
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.500
A very honest-hearted fellow andas poor as the king.

650
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.900
If thou be as poor for a subjectas he is for a king,

651
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:33.200
thou art poor enough.

652
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.230
What wouldst thou?

653
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.270
Service.

654
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.300
Who wouldst thou serve?

655
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.330
You.

656
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.230
Dost thou know me, fellow?

657
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.070
No, sir; but you have that inyour countenance

658
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.930
that I would fain call master.

659
00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:44.530
What's that?

660
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.500
Authority.

661
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.870
What services canst thou do?

662
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.930
I can keep honest counsel, ride,run,

663
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:56.100
mar a curious tale in tellingit,

664
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.030
and deliver a plain messagebluntly.

665
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.270
That which ordinary men are fitfor, I am qualified in.

666
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.000
And the best of me is diligence.

667
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.230
How old art thou?

668
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.070
Not so young, sir, to love awoman for singing,

669
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.370
nor so old to dote on her foranything.

670
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.000
I have years on my back 48.

671
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.230
Follow me; thou shalt serve me.

672
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.700
If I like thee no worse afterdinner,

673
00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:13.430
I shall not part from theebefore.

674
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:17.530
Dinner, ho, dinner!

675
00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.030
Where's my knave, my fool?

676
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.630
Go you, and call my fool hither.

677
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.370
You, you, sirrah, where's mydaughter?

678
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.330
So please you

679
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.900
What says the fellow there?

680
00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.630
Call the clodpoll back!

681
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.170
Where's my fool, ho-ho-ho?

682
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.370
I think the world's asleep.

683
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.170
How now!

684
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.030
Where's that mongrel?

685
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.330
He says, my lord, your daughteris not well.

686
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.400
Why came not the slave back tome when I called him?

687
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.700
Sir, he answered me in theroundest manner

688
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.770
he would not.

689
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:59.700
He would not?

690
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.430
My lord, I know not what thematter is.

691
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:02.800
But to my judgment, yourhighness

692
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.900
is not entertained with thatceremonious affection

693
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.300
as you were wont.

694
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.470
There's a great abatement ofkindness appears as well

695
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.700
in the general dependents

696
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.800
as in the duke himself also andyour daughter.

697
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.400
Ha! Sayest thou so?

698
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.530
I beseech you, pardon me, mylord, if I be mistaken,

699
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:16.900
for my duty cannot be silent

700
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.370
when I think your highnesswronged.

701
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.600
Thou but rememberest me of mineown conception.

702
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.800
I have perceived a most faintneglect of late,

703
00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.170
which I have rather blamed asmine own jealous curiosity

704
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.030
than as the very pretense andpurpose of unkindness.

705
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.000
I will look further into it.

706
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.130
But where's my fool?

707
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.530
I have not seen him this twodays.

708
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.530
Since my young lady's going intoFrance, sir,

709
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.000
the fool hath much pined away.

710
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.470
No more of that; I have noted itwell.

711
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.930
Go you; tell my daughter I wouldspeak with her.

712
00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.600
Go you, and call hither my fool!

713
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.030
O, you sir, you!

714
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.200
Come you hither, sir.

715
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.370
Who am I, sir?

716
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.830
My lady's father.

717
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.300
"My lady's father."

718
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.800
My lord's knave.

719
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.070
You whoreson dog, you slave, youcur.

720
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.870
I am none of these, my lord; Ibeseech your pardon.

721
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.530
Do you bandy looks with me, yourascal?

722
00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.300
I'll not be strucken, my lord.

723
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.130
Nor tripped neither, you basefootball player.

724
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:29.270
I thank thee, fellow.

725
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.970
Thou servest me, and I'll lovethee.

726
00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:34.370
Come, sir. Arise, away.

727
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.230
No, we'll teach you differences.

728
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.600
Away, away.

729
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.930
Have you wisdom?

730
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.130
If you will measure yourlubber's length again, tarry.

731
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.770
But away.

732
00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.470
Go to.

733
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:51.170
Now, my friendly knave, I thankthee.

734
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.030
Here's earnest for thy service.

735
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.630
Let me hire him too: here's mycoxcomb.

736
00:37:56.630 --> 00:38:01.130
How now, my pretty knave?

737
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.330
How dost thou?

738
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.200
Sirrah, you were best take mycoxcomb.

739
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.600
Why, fool?

740
00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.430
Why? For taking one's part thatout of favor.

741
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:11.500
Nay, and thou canst not smile asthe wind sits;

742
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.000
thou'lt catch cold shortly.

743
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.330
Here, take my coxcomb.

744
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.630
Why, this fellow, he hasbanished two on's daughters

745
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.330
and did the third a blessingagainst his will.

746
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:23.470
If thou follow him, thou mustneeds wear my coxcomb.

747
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:24.830
How now, nuncle!

748
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.670
Would I had two coxcombs and twodaughters!

749
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.230
Why, boy?

750
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.800
If I gave them all me living,I'ld keep my coxcombs myself.

751
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.700
There's mine; beg another of thydaughters.

752
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.670
Take heed, sirrah; the whip.

753
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.870
Truth's a dog must to kennel.

754
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.470
He must be whipped out when Ladythe brach

755
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.700
may stand by the fire and stink.

756
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.270
A pestilent gall to me.

757
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.770
Sirrah, I'll teach thee aspeech.

758
00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:50.930
Do, boy.

759
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:52.430
Mark it, nuncle.

760
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:56.930
Have more than thou showest,speak less than thou knowest,

761
00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:00.600
lend less than thou owest, ridemore than thou goest,

762
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.830
learn more than thou trowest,set less than thou throwest;

763
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:07.270
leave thy drink and thy whore,and keep in-a-door,

764
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.370
and thou shalt have more thantwo tens to a score.

765
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.770
This is nothing, fool.

766
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.930
Then 'tis like the breath of anunfee'd lawyer;

767
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:15.630
you gave me nothing for it.

768
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.770
Can you make no use of nothing,nuncle?

769
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:22.570
Why, no, boy; nothing can bemade out of nothing.

770
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.670
Prithee, tell him.

771
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.200
So much the rent of his landcomes to.

772
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.500
He'll not believe a fool.

773
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.870
A bitter fool.

774
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.930
Dost know the difference, myboy,

775
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.530
between a bitter fool and asweet one?

776
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.300
No, lad; teach me.

777
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.430
That lord that counseled thee togive away thy land,

778
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.800
come place him here by me, anddo thou for him stand.

779
00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.530
The sweet and bitter fool willpresently appear

780
00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.330
the one in motley here, theother found out there.

781
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.030
Dost thou call me fool, boy?

782
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.830
All thy other titles thou hastgiven away

783
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:56.300
that thou wast born with.

784
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.170
This is not altogether fool, mylord.

785
00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.000
No, faith, lords and great menwill not let me.

786
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.500
If I had a monopoly out, they'dhave part on it.

787
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.030
And the ladies too, they'll notlet me have all the fool tomyself;

788
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.100
they'd be snatching.

789
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.700
-Nuncle. -Huh?

790
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.000
Give me an egg, and I'll givethee two crowns.

791
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.300
What two crowns shall they be?

792
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.900
Why, when I've cut the egg inthe middle

793
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.000
and eat up the meat, the twocrowns of the egg.

794
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.600
When thou clovest thy crown inthe middle

795
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.000
and gavest away both parts,

796
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.700
thou borest thy ass on thy backo'er the dirt.

797
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.170
Thou hadst little wit in thybald crown

798
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.100
when thou gavest thy golden oneaway.

799
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.370
If I speak like meself in this,

800
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.830
let him be whipped that firstfinds it so.

801
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.770
Fools have ne'er less grace in ayear.

802
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:41.670
For wise men are grown foppish

803
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:45.830
and know not how their wits towear.

804
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.700
Their manners are so apish.

805
00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.870
When wast thou wont to be sofull of song, sirrah?

806
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.170
I have used it, nuncle,

807
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.200
ever since thou mad'st thydaughters thy mothers.

808
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.970
For when thou gavest them therod

809
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:58.200
and putest down thine ownbreeches,

810
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.630
then they for sudden joy didweep

811
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:01.870
and I for sorrow sung

812
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:04.570
that such a king should playbo-peep

813
00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.930
and go the fools among.

814
00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.600
O nuncle, prithee, keep aschoolmaster

815
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.870
that could teach thy fool tolie.

816
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.600
I'd fain learn to lie.

817
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.200
And you lie, sirrah, we'll haveyou whipped.

818
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.430
I marvel what kin thou and thydaughters are.

819
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:22.130
They'd have me whipped forspeaking true;

820
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:23.570
thou'st have me whipped forlying;

821
00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.670
sometimes I'm whipped forholding me peace.

822
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.070
I'd rather be any kind of thingthan a fool.

823
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.500
And yet I would not be thee,nuncle.

824
00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.030
Thou hast pared thy wit on bothsides

825
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:35.130
and left nothing in the middle.

826
00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.470
Here comes one of the parings.

827
00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.370
How now, daughter?

828
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.200
What makes that frontlet on?

829
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.070
You're too much of late in thefrown.

830
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.330
Thou wast a pretty fellow

831
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.270
when thou hadst no need to carefor her frowning.

832
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:50.630
Now thou art an O without afigure.

833
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.500
I am better than thou art now.

834
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.800
I am a fool; thou art nothing.

835
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.970
Yes, forsooth, I will hold mepeace.

836
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.830
So your face bids me, though yousay nothing.

837
00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.970
Mum, mum, mum.

838
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.070
He that keeps no crust norcrumb,

839
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.700
weary of all, shall want some.

840
00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.000
That's a shealed peasecod.

841
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.800
Not only, sir, this yourall-licensed fool,

842
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.930
but other of your insolentretinue

843
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.830
do hourly carp and quarrel,

844
00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:15.130
breaking forth in rank andnot-to-be endured riots.

845
00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.530
Sir, I had thought, by makingthis well known to you,

846
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.400
to have found a safe redress butnow grow fearful

847
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.400
by what yourself too late havespoke and done

848
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.130
that you protect their courseand put it on by your allowance,

849
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.400
which, if you should,

850
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.670
the fault would not 'scapecensure,

851
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.800
nor the redresses sleep,

852
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.700
which, in the tender of awholesome weal,

853
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.430
might in their working do youthat offense,

854
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.800
which else were shame that theirnecessity

855
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.870
will call discreet proceeding.

856
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:42.930
For, you trow, nuncle,

857
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.630
the hedge-sparrow fed the cuckooso long,

858
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.500
it had its head bit off by itsyoung!

859
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:50.730
So out went the candle, and wewere left darkling.

860
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:53.500
Are you our daughter?

861
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.700
I would you would make use ofyour good wisdom,

862
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.370
whereof I know you are fraught,

863
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.530
and put away these dispositions

864
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.530
which of late transport you fromwhat you rightly are.

865
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:06.470
May not the ass know when thecart draws the horse?

866
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.400
Oh, whoops, Jug.

867
00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.430
I love thee.

868
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.130
Does any here know me?

869
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.870
This is not Lear.

870
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:16.470
Does Lear walk thus, speak thus?

871
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.200
Where are his eyes?

872
00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.970
Either his notion weakens

873
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.330
or his discernings arelethargied.

874
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.600
Waking? 'Tis not so.

875
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.200
Who is it that will tell me whoI am?

876
00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.230
Lear's shadow.

877
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.670
I would learn that, for by themarks

878
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:30.300
of sovereignty, knowledge, andreason,

879
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.200
I should be false persuaded Ihad daughters.

880
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.970
Which they will make an obedientfather.

881
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.300
Your name, fair gentlewoman?

882
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.970
This admiration, sir,

883
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:46.130
is much o' the savor of otheryour new pranks.

884
00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:51.200
I do beseech you to understandmy purposes aright.

885
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:57.100
As you are old and reverend,should be wise.

886
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.630
Here you do keep a hundredknights and squiresÃ³

887
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:02.730
men so disordered, so deboshedand bold

888
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.000
that this our court, infectedwith their manners,

889
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.900
shows like a riotous inn.

890
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.000
Epicurism and lust makes it morelike a brothel or a tavern

891
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.270
than a graced palace.

892
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.400
The shame itself doth speak forinstant remedy.

893
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.530
Be then desired by her

894
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.170
that else will take the thingshe begs:

895
00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.500
a little to disquantity yourtrain

896
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.630
and the remainder that shallstill depend

897
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.100
to be such men as may besortyour age,

898
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.800
which know themselves and you.

899
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.270
Darkness and devils!

900
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.370
Saddle my horses! Call my traintogether!

901
00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:31.800
Degenerate bastard!

902
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.900
I'll not trouble thee.

903
00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.570
Yet have I left a daughter.

904
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.000
You strike my people,

905
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.930
and your disordered rabble makeservants of their betters.

906
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.170
Woe, that too late repentsÃ³

907
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:41.300
O, sir, are you come?

908
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.330
Is it your will?

909
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:43.370
Speak, sir.

910
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:44.770
Prepare my horses.

911
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:47.530
Ingratitude, thou marble-heartedfiend,

912
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.500
more hideous when thou show'stthee in a child

913
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.530
than the sea-monster.

914
00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:51.800
Pray, sir, be patient.

915
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.870
Detested kite!

916
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.830
Thou liest.

917
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.530
My train are men of choice andrarest parts

918
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.700
who all particulars of dutyknow,

919
00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.370
and, with the most exact regard,

920
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:03.970
support the worships of theirname.

921
00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:08.200
O most small fault,

922
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.330
how ugly didst thou in Cordeliashow

923
00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.770
which, like an engine,

924
00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.730
wrenched my frame of nature fromthe fixed place,

925
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.730
drew from my heart all love, andadded to the gall.

926
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:18.900
O Lear, Lear, Lear.

927
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.430
Beat at this gate

928
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:23.300
that let thy folly in and thydear judgment out!

929
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.630
Go, go, my people.

930
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.530
My lord, I am as guiltless as Iam ignorant

931
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.930
of what hath moved you.

932
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.400
It may be so, my lord.

933
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.930
Hear, Nature, hear.

934
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.500
Dear goddess, hear.

935
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.170
Suspend thy purpose if thoudidst intend

936
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.470
to make this creature fruitful.

937
00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:45.670
Into her womb, convey sterility.

938
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:49.000
Dry up in her the organs ofincrease.

939
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.430
And from her derogate body

940
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:54.600
never spring a babe to honorher.

941
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.970
If she must teem, create herchild of spleen

942
00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.130
that it may live

943
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.530
and be a thwart disnaturedtorment to her.

944
00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:04.230
Let it stamp wrinkles in herbrow of youth,

945
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.570
with cadent tears fret channelsin her cheeks,

946
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.400
turn all her mother's pains andbenefits

947
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.470
to laughter and contempt

948
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:16.330
that she may feel how sharperthan a serpent's tooth it is

949
00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:19.270
to have a thankless child.

950
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:22.170
Away, away!

951
00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.570
Now, gods that we adore,wherefore comes this?

952
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.800
Never afflict yourself to knowmore of it,

953
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.400
but let his disposition havethat scope

954
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.100
as dotage gives it.

955
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.100
What, fifty of my followers at aclap within a fortnight?

956
00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.270
What's the matter, sir?

957
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.430
I'll tell thee: life and death!

958
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:39.770
I am ashamed that thou hastpower

959
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:41.600
to shake my manhood thus,

960
00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.000
that these hot tears, whichbreak from me perforce,

961
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.130
should make thee worth them.

962
00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.730
Blasts and fogs upon thee!

963
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.930
The untented woundings of afather's curse

964
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.130
pierce every sense about thee.

965
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.230
Old fond eyes, beweep this causeagain,

966
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.230
I'll pluck ye out and cast you,

967
00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.730
with the waters that you loose,to temper clay.

968
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.100
It is come to this?

969
00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.530
Let it be so.

970
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.100
I have another daughter,

971
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.400
who, I am sure, is kind andcomfortable.

972
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.900
When she shall hear this ofthee,

973
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:23.400
with her nails, she'll flay thywolvish visage.

974
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.730
Thou shalt find that I'll resumethat shape

975
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.430
which thou dost think I havecast off forever.

976
00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.270
Do you mark that, my lord?

977
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:39.930
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,to the great love I bear you

978
00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:41.470
Pray you, content.

979
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.270
What, Oswald, ho!

980
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:47.430
You, sir, more knave than fool,after your master.

981
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.570
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear,

982
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.600
tarry, take the fool with thee!

983
00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.800
The fox, when one has caughther,

984
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.600
and such a daughter should sureto the slaughter

985
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.170
if my cap would buy a halter!

986
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.470
And so the fool follows after!

987
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:03.600
This man hath had good counsel:a hundred knights.

988
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.500
'Tis politic and safe

989
00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.200
to let him keep at point ahundred knightsÃ³

990
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.900
yes, that, on every dream, eachbuzz, each fancy,

991
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.130
each complaint, dislike,

992
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.030
he may enguard his dotage intheir powers

993
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.830
and hold our lives in mercy?

994
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:18.030
Oswald, I say!

995
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:20.200
Well, you may fear too far.

996
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:26.070
Safer than trust too far.

997
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.870
Let me still take away the harmsI fear,

998
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.470
not fear still to be taken.

999
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:35.600
I know his heart.

1000
00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.200
What he hath uttered I have writmy sister.

1001
00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.500
If she sustain him and hishundred knights

1002
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.800
when I have showed theunfitnessÃ³

1003
00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.800
how now, Oswald?

1004
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.630
What, have you writ that letterto my sister?

1005
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:48.930
Aye, madam.

1006
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.000
Take you some company, and awayto horse.

1007
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.270
Inform her full of my particularfear.

1008
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.030
And thereto add such reasons asyour own

1009
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:59.730
as may compact it more.

1010
00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.930
Get you gone, and hasten yourreturn.

1011
00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:07.070
No, no, my lord,

1012
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.670
this milky gentleness and courseof yours,

1013
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.370
though I condemn not, yet, underpardon,

1014
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:13.170
you are much more attasked forwant of wisdom

1015
00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.170
than praised for harmfulmildness.

1016
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:19.700
How far your eyes may pierce, Icannot tell.

1017
00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.670
Striving to be better, oft wemar what's well.

1018
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.430
Nay, then.

1019
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.870
Oh, well, the event.

1020
00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:51.600
Go you before to Gloucester withthese letters.

1021
00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.300
Acquaint my daughter no furtherwith anything you know

1022
00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.170
than comes from her demand outof the letter.

1023
00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.770
If your diligence be not speedy,I shall be there before you.

1024
00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.070
I will not sleep, my lord, tillI have delivered your letter.

1025
00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.500
If a man's brains were in hisheels,

1026
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.430
were't not in danger of kibes?

1027
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.200
Ay, boy.

1028
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.300
Then, I prithee, be merry; thywit shall not go slip-shod.

1029
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.830
Ha, ha, ha.

1030
00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.270
Shalt see thy other daughterwill use thee kindly,

1031
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:21.400
for though she's as like this asa crab's like an apple,

1032
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.730
yet I can tell what I can tell.

1033
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.100
What canst tell, boy?

1034
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.170
She will taste as like this as acrab does to a crab.

1035
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.600
Canst tell why one's nose stands

1036
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.630
in the middle on's face?

1037
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.900
No.

1038
00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.600
To keep his eyes on either sideof his nose,

1039
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.170
that what a man cannot smellout,

1040
00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.800
he may spy into.

1041
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.100
I did her wrong.

1042
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.700
Canst tell how an oyster makeshis shell?

1043
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:40.800
No!

1044
00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.530
No, nor I neither!

1045
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.570
But I can tell why a snail has ahouse.

1046
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:45.800
Why?

1047
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.000
To put his head in,

1048
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.430
not to give it away to hisdaughters

1049
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:50.830
and leave his horns without acase.

1050
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.070
I shall forget my nature.

1051
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:56.730
So kind a father.

1052
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.430
Be my horses ready?

1053
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.830
Thy asses are gone about 'em.

1054
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:06.330
The reason why the seven starsare no more than seven

1055
00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:07.530
is a pretty reason.

1056
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.600
Because they're not eight?

1057
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.830
Yes, indeed.

1058
00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:13.000
Thou would make a good fool.

1059
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.530
To take 't again perforce.

1060
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.200
Monster ingratitude.

1061
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.630
If thou wert my fool, nuncle,

1062
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:22.670
I'ld have thee beaten for beingold before thy time.

1063
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.530
How's that?

1064
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:35.000
Thou shouldst not have been oldtill thou hadst been wise.

1065
00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.770
O, let me not be mad, not mad.

1066
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.070
Sweet heaven, keep me in temper.

1067
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.000
I would not be mad.

1068
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.130
How now! Are my horses ready?

1069
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:48.130
Ready, my lord.

1070
00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:49.470
Come, boy.

1071
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.700
She that's a maid now and laughsat my departure

1072
00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:02.030
shall not be a maid long unlessthings be cut shorter.

1073
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.030
