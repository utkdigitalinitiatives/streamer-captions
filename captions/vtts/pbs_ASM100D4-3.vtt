THE MOST BASIC
FINANCIAL IMPULSE OF ALL

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.960
IS TO SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.600
BECAUSE, AS WEVE BEEN
PAINFULLY REMINDED

BY THE RECENT MONTHS
OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL,

THE FUTURE IS SO UNPREDICTABLE.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.900
THE WORLD REALLY CAN
BE A DANGEROUS PLACE.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.060
NOT MANY OF US GET THROUGH LIFE
WITHOUT A LITTLE BAD LUCK.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.660
SOME OF US GET A LOT.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.660

IN THE WRONG PLACE

LIKE NEW ORLEANS WHEN
HURRICANE KATRINA HIT.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.230
THE QUESTION IS,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.730
HOW SHOULD WE DEAL
WITH THE RISKS

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.130

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.260

ON THE VOLUNTARY CHARITY
OF OUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.760
WHEN CALAMITY STRIKES?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.730
OR SHOULD WE BE ABLE
TO COUNT ON THE STATE--

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.100
IN OTHER WORDS, THE
COMPULSORY CONTRIBUTIONS

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.300
OF OUR FELLOW TAXPAYERS--

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.400

IN THE LAST WEEK
OF AUGUST 2005,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.060
IT CAUSED DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

NATURAL CATASTROPHE

THAT NOW THREATENS THE

HOW THE RISK MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM WE CALL INSURANCE

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:10.060
SIMPLY FAILED WHEN FACED WITH
A CALAMITY ON THIS SCALE.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.930
THE HURRICANE DIDNT HIT
NEW ORLEANS DIRECTLY.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.730

THE HUGE STORM SURGE

THE REAL LESSON OF KATRINA

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.730
IS THAT EVEN WHEN WE THINK
WERE PROTECTED AGAINST RISK,

VOLUMINOUS CALCULATIONS

NOW HOUSED AT THE NATIONAL
ARCHIVES OF SCOTLAND,

AND YOU CAN SEE HOW HE RAN THE
NUMBERS OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:10.200
MAKING VERY CAREFUL ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT THE MAXIMUM NUMBER

OF WIDOWS AND ORPHANS THAT
WOULD HAVE TO BE PROVIDED FOR.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.560
THE KEY POINT, HOWEVER,
WAS THAT FROM NOW ON,

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.300

JUST PAY MONEY IN

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.630

WOULD PAY PREMIUMS

THAT WOULD BE USED
TO CREATE A FUND,

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.160
AND THE FUND WOULD
THEN BE INVESTED FOR
PROFITABLE PURPOSES.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.760

HENCEFORTH WOULD BE PAID

OUT OF THE RETURNS
ON THAT MONEY,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:40.460
LEAVING THE PREMIUMS
TO ACCUMULATE.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.260
ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED
FOR THE SCHEME TO WORK

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:46.930
WAS AN ACCURATE PROJECTION OF
HOW MANY WIDOWS AND ORPHANS

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.530

BE IN THE FUTURE,

JUST FOR SCOTTISH CLERGYMEN

TAKEN OUT INSURANCE,

WHAT NO ONE ANTICIPATED
BACK IN 1744

WAS THAT THE CAREFUL
CALCULATIONS OF

WOULD GROW INTO TODAYS
HUGE INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

AS ROBERT WALLACE
UNDERSTOOD 250 YEARS AGO,

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.530
SIZE MATTERS IN INSURANCE,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.560
BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE
ARE PAYING INTO A FUND,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.000
THE EASIER IT BECOMES,
BY THE LAW OF AVERAGES,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.230
TO PREDICT HOW MUCH WILL HAVE
TO BE PAID OUT EACH YEAR.

ALTHOUGH NO INDIVIDUALS DATE OF
DEATH CAN BE KNOWN IN ADVANCE,

TURNED OUT TO BE WORTH

EMERGE IN JAPAN--

TAKE CARE OF RISK.

RISE OF WELFARE.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.460
TO THE EMPERORS ARMED FORCES

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:16.060
AND DELIVER HIM AN EMPIRE.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.200
THE WARTIME SLOGAN ALL
PEOPLE ARE SOLDIERS

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.960
WAS ADAPTED TO BECOME

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:30.260
ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE INSURANCE.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.000
THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT
JAPAN HAD GONE TO WAR

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.630
WITH THE WORLDS
ECONOMIC COLOSSUS,

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:42.500
THE UNITED STATES.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.400
JAPANS WARFARE STATE PROVED
TO BE A MASSIVE MISTAKE.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.460
QUITE APART FROM THE
NEARLY 3 MILLION LIVES LOST

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.260
IN JAPANS DOOMED
BID FOR EMPIRE,

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.700
BY 1945, THE VALUE OF
JAPANS ENTIRE CAPITAL STOCK

00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.360
SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN REDUCED
TO ZERO BY AMERICAN BOMBERS.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.800
CITIES BUILT LARGELY OUT
OF WOOD WERE INCINERATED.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.630
NEARLY 1/3 OF THE
URBAN POPULATION

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:24.100
LOST THEIR HOMES.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.400
PRACTICALLY THE ONLY CITY TO
SURVIVE INTACT WAS KYOTO,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.030
THE FORMER IMPERIAL CAPITAL.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:37.660
1945 MAY HAVE SEEN THE END OF
THE JAPANESE WARFARE STATE,

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.100
BUT IT WASNT THE END OF
THE JAPANESE EXPERIMENT

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.460
WITH STATE-SPONSORED WELFARE.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.760
IN JAPAN, AS IN MOST
COMPETENT COUNTRIES,
THE LESSON WAS CLEAR.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.200
THE WORLD WAS JUST
TOO DANGEROUS A PLACE

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.830
FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE
MARKETS TO COPE WITH.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.630
BUT WITH THE BEST
WILL IN THE WORLD,

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.530
PEOPLE COULDNT BE EXPECTED
TO INSURE THEMSELVES

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:58.760
AGAINST THE U.S. AIR FORCE.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.800
THE ANSWER PRACTICALLY
EVERYWHERE WAS THE SAME--

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.660
FOR GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:09.300
IN EFFECT, TO
NATIONALIZE RISK.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.800
PERHAPS THE MOST FAMILIAR
SYSTEM OF WELFARE

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.630
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.100
ALSO BORN IN THE RUINS OF WAR

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.730
WAS DEVISED BY THE
BRITISH ECONOMIST

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.360
WILLIAM BEVERIDGE.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.800
WHEN THE JAPANESE CAME UP WITH

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.660
THEIR OWN COMPREHENSIVE WELFARE
SYSTEM IN OCTOBER 1947,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.900
THEIR ADVISORY COMMITTEE
ON SOCIAL SECURITY

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:35.660
RECOMMENDED WHAT AMOUNTED
TO BEVERIDGI NO NIHON-BAN--

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.060
BEVERIDGE FOR THE JAPANESE.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.630
AND YET, THEY WENT EVEN FURTHER
THAN BEVERIDGE HAD INTENDED,

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:42.230
AS THIS COPY OF
THEIR REPORT HERE

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.360
IN THE LIBRARY OF THE JAPANESE
NATIONAL PARLIAMENT MAKES CLEAR.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.000
IT CALLED ON THE GOVERNMENT

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.700
TO PROVIDE AGAINST
EVERY CAUSE OF POVERTY.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.800
SICKNESS AND
INJURY, DISABILITY,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.900
DEATH, CHILDBIRTH,
LARGE FAMILIES,

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.560
OLD AGE AND UNEMPLOYMENT.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.300
WHATEVER THE REASON, THE
NEEDY WOULD BE GUARANTEED

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:06.560
THE MINIMUM STANDARD OF LIVING
BY NATIONAL ASSISTANCE.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:11.630
[MONKS CHANTING]

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.630
THE JAPANESE WOULD NO LONGER
HAVE TO RELY ON THE BENEVOLENCE

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.860
OF A FEUDAL LORD OR
THE LUCK OF THE GODS.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.760
THE WELFARE STATE
WOULD COVER THEM

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.330
AGAINST ALL THE VAGARIES
AND VICISSITUDES

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:27.300
OF THE MODERN WORLD.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.300
IF THEY COULDNT
AFFORD EDUCATION,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.460
THE STATE WOULD PAY.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:36.300
IF THEY COULDNT FIND
WORK, THE STATE WOULD PAY.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.500
IF THEY WERE TOO ILL TO
WORK, THE STATE WOULD PAY.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.830
WHEN THEY RETIRED,
THE STATE WOULD PAY.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.530
AND WHEN THEY FINALLY DIED,

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:55.160
THE STATE WOULD PAY
THEIR DEPENDENTS.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.100
SO WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE WAR IN JAPAN

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:02.100
WAS MERELY THE EXTENSION OF
THE WARFARE WELFARE STATE.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.300
THE SLOGAN NOW BECAME

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.930
ALL PEOPLE SHOULD
HAVE PENSIONS.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.060
THE JAPANESE WELFARE STATE

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.960
SEEMED TO BE A MIRACLE
OF EFFECTIVENESS.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.600
IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND EDUCATION,
JAPAN LED THE WORLD.

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.860
BY THE LATE 1970s, THE
JAPANESE COULD BOAST

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:31.960
THAT THEIR COUNTRY HAD BECOME
THE WELFARE SUPERPOWER.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.130
RUN LIKE THIS, THE
WELFARE STATE SEEMED
TO MAKE SO MUCH SENSE.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.730
JAPAN HAD ACHIEVED
SECURITY FOR ALL,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.430
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GROWING
SO RAPIDLY THAT BY 1968,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.630
IT HAD THE SECOND LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.200
ONE U.S. ECONOMIST
EVEN PREDICTED

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.500
THAT JAPANS PER CAPITA INCOME
WOULD OVERTAKE AMERICAS

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.100
BY THE YEAR 2000.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.360
WELFARE WAS WORKING
WHERE WARFARE HAD FAILED

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.900
TO MAKE JAPAN TOP NATION.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.100
THE KEY TURNED OUT TO
BE NOT A FOREIGN EMPIRE

00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.730
BUT A DOMESTIC SAFETY NET.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.160
AND YET, THERE WAS A
CATCH, A FATAL FLAW

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.030
IN THE DESIGN OF THE
POST-WAR WELFARE STATE.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.560
JUST WHAT WAS IT THAT
CAUSED THOSE PREDICTIONS

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:26.460
OF JAPANS ULTIMATE TRIUMPH
TO FAIL TO COME TRUE?

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.000
THE WELFARE STATE LOOKED TO
BE WORKING SMOOTHLY ENOUGH

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.660
IN 1970s JAPAN,

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:38.630
BUT ELSEWHERE THERE WERE
SIGNS THAT ALL WAS NOT WELL.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.730
IN BRITAIN AND THROUGHOUT
THE WESTERN WORLD,

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.900
THE WELFARE STATE, IT SEEMED,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.160
HAD REMOVED THE INCENTIVES

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:49.060
WITHOUT WHICH A CAPITALIST
ECONOMY SIMPLY CANNOT FUNCTION--

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.660
THE CARROT OF SERIOUS
MONEY FOR THOSE WHO STRIVE,

00:25:53.660 --> 00:26:00.400
THE STICK OF HARDSHIP
FOR THOSE WHO ARE IDLE.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:07.530
THE RESULT WAS STAGFLATION--
LOW GROWTH AND HIGH INFLATION.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.760
WHAT WAS TO BE DONE?

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.730
ONE MAN AND HIS PUPILS
THOUGHT THEY KNEW THE ANSWER.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.600
THANKS IN LARGE MEASURE
TO THEIR INFLUENCE,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.800
ONE OF THE GREAT ECONOMIC TRENDS

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.200
OF THE PAST 25 YEARS

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.360
HAS BEEN FOR THE WELFARE
STATE TO BE DISMANTLED,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.200
REINTRODUCING PEOPLE
WITH A SHARP SHOCK

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.830
TO THE UNPREDICTABLE MONSTER

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:33.600
THEY THOUGHT THEY
HAD ESCAPED FROM...

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:46.660
RISK.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:51.560
IN 1976, A DIMINUTIVE PROFESSOR
CALLED MILTON FRIEDMAN

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.230
WORKING HERE AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.300
WON THE NOBEL
PRIZE IN ECONOMICS.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.230
MILTON FRIEDMAN WON HIS PLACE
IN THE ECONOMIC HALL OF FAME

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:07.430
BY RESTATING THIS
SIMPLE EQUATION...

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.630
...WHERE M IS
THE MONEY SUPPLY,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.560
V IS THE VELOCITY
AT WHICH IT CIRCULATES,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.930
P IS THE PRICE LEVEL

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.700
AND Q IS THE
QUANTITY OF EXPENDITURES.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.900
FRIEDMANS OBSERVATION
WAS SIMPLE--

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.930
IF THE MONEY SUPPLY WENT UP,
THEN SO DID THE PRICE LEVEL,

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:24.800
HENCE THE QUANTITY
THEORY OF MONEY.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.430
BUT YOU NEEDED MUCH MORE THAN A
PIECE OF CHALK AND A BLACKBOARD

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:30.900
TO ANSWER THE SECOND
CRUCIAL QUESTION

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.760

URGING HIM TO REDUCE
THE GOVERNMENT DEFICIT

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.500
THAT HED IDENTIFIED
AS THE MAIN CAUSE

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.600
OF CHILES SKY-HIGH INFLATION,

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.900
THEN RUNNING AT AN
ANNUAL RATE OF 900%.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.760
A MONTH AFTER FRIEDMANS VISIT,

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.660
THE CHILEAN JUNTA ANNOUNCED
THAT INFLATION WOULD BE STOPPED

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.260
AT ANY COST.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:15.330
THE REGIME CUT GOVERNMENT
SPENDING BY 27%.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:19.730
THIS PROBLEM OF INFLATION
IS NOT OF RECENT ORIGIN.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.430
IT ARISES FROM TRENDS
TOWARDS SOCIALISM

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.530
THAT STARTED 40 YEARS AGO

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.400
AND REACHED THEIR LOGICAL
AND TERRIBLE CLIMAX

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:39.600
IN THE ALLENDE REGIME.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.730
FRIEDMAN FOUND HIMSELF DENOUNCED
FOR ACTING AS A CONSULTANT

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:47.060
TO A MILITARY DICTATOR
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXECUTIONS

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.130
OF MORE THAN 2,000 REAL
AND SUSPECTED COMMUNISTS

00:31:51.130 --> 00:32:08.960
AND THE TORTURE OF
NEARLY 30,000 MORE.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.700
CHICAGOS ROLE IN
CHILES NEW REGIME

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.500
CONSISTED OF MORE THAN JUST
A VISIT BY MILTON FRIEDMAN.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.530
SINCE THE 1950s, THERE
HAD BEEN A STEADY STREAM

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.160
OF BRIGHT YOUNG ECONOMISTS
GOING FROM THIS PLACE,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.200
THE CATHOLIC
UNIVERSITY IN SANTIAGO,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.400
AND THEYD COME BACK
CONVINCED OF THE NEED
TO BALANCE THE BUDGET,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.600
TIGHTEN THE MONEY SUPPLY,
AND LIBERALIZE TRADE.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.630
THESE WERE THE CHICAGO BOYS,
FRIEDMANS FOOT SOLDIERS,

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.030
AND YET THE MOST
RADICAL OF THEIR IDEAS

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.560
WENT BEYOND WHAT FRIEDMAN
HAD RECOMMENDED TO PINOCHET.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.730
IT AMOUNTED TO A
FULL-SCALE ROLLING BACK

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.030
OF THE WELFARE STATE.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.730
THE CONSERVATIVE
ECONOMIC REVOLUTION

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.730
DIDNT BEGIN IN THATCHERS
BRITAIN OR REAGANS AMERICA,

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:56.200
IT BEGAN RIGHT HERE IN CHILE.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.360
THE MASTERMIND BEHIND THIS
WHOLESALE DISMANTLING

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.830
OF THE WELFARE STATE
WAS A YOUNG ECONOMIST

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:06.760
CALLED JOSE PINERA.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.330
CHILES ECONOMY WAS DESTROYED.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.400
WE HAVE HAD 50 YEARS
OF PROTECTIONISM,

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.660
STATE INTERVENTION, AND SOME
LIGHT SOCIALISM, IF YOU WANT,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.960
AND THEN THAT WAS EXACERBATED
DURING THE ALLENDE GOVERNMENT.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.530
WE HAD CREATED A SORT
OF WELFARE STATE,

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:29.400
AND THAT, OF COURSE, WAS
GOING BANKRUPT IN CHILE.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.130
BETWEEN 1979 AND 1981,

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.800
PINERA AND HIS COLLEAGUES

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.800
ERECTED A RADICALLY NEW
PENSION SYSTEM FOR CHILE,

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.630
GIVING EVERY WORKER THE CHANCE

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.000
TO OPT OUT OF THE OLD
PAY-AS-YOU-GO STATE SYSTEM.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.430
INSTEAD OF A PAYROLL TAX,

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:47.200
EACH WORKER NOW COULD PUT
10% OF HIS WAGES ASIDE

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.960
INTO AN INDIVIDUAL PERSONAL
RETIREMENT ACCOUNT

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.900
TO BE MANAGED BY PRIVATE
COMPETING COMPANIES.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.700
THERE WAS ALSO A SMALL PREMIUM

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.960
FOR DISABILITY AND
LIFE INSURANCE.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.030
THE IDEA WAS TO GIVE
EACH WORKER A SENSE

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:02.630
THAT THE MONEY BEING PUT
ASIDE WAS HIS OWN PROPERTY,

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.000
HIS OWN CAPITAL.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:12.660
[MAN SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:16.530
PINERA GAMBLED. HE
GAVE WORKERS A CHOICE.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.230
STICK WITH THE OLD
SYSTEM OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:25.300
OR OPT FOR THE NEW PERSONAL
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:29.500
CONVINCE BY PINERAS ARGUMENT,
80% MADE THE SWITCH

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:35.830
TO A PRIVATE PENSION PLAN.

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.100
BUT WAS IT WORTH IT?

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.260
WAS IT WORTH THE
HUGE MORAL COMPROMISE

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.600
THAT THE CHICAGO BOYS
AND THE HARVARD MAN MADE

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.360
WHEN THEY GOT INTO BED

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.700
WITH A TORTURING,
MURDEROUS DICTATORSHIP?

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.660
WELL, THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.400
VERY MUCH DEPENDS ON WHETHER
YOU THINK THEIR REFORMS

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.730
HELPED PAVE A PEACEFUL WAY BACK

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:57.130
TO A SUSTAINABLE
DEMOCRACY IN CHILE,

00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:05.330
AND I THINK THEY DID.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:10.100
IN 1980, PINOCHET CONCEDED
A NEW CONSTITUTION

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.830
THAT PRESCRIBED A
10-YEAR TRANSITION

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:13.860
BACK TO DEMOCRACY.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:17.360
10 YEARS LATER, HE
STEPPED DOWN AS PRESIDENT.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.600
DEMOCRACY WAS RESTORED.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.100
AND BY THAT TIME, THE
ECONOMIC MIRACLE WAS UNDERWAY

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:29.800
THAT HELPED TO
ENSURE ITS SURVIVAL.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.330
FOR THE PENSION REFORM
NOT ONLY CREATED

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.260
A NEW CLASS OF
PROPERTY OWNERS,

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.800
EACH WITH HIS OWN
RETIREMENT NEST EGG,

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:45.360
IT ALSO GAVE THE CHILEAN ECONOMY
A MASSIVE SHOT IN THE ARM.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.560
THESE BROKERS AT
THE BANCO DE CHILE

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:52.100
ARE INVESTING CHILEAN WORKERS
PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.600
AND THEYVE BEEN DOING A
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.700
AVERAGE RETURNS ON THE
PERSONAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.160
HAS BEEN OVER 10%,

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.430
REFLECTING THE FACT THAT
IN THE 20 YEARS AFTER 1987,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.360
THE CHILEAN STOCK
MARKET HAS GONE UP

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.060
BY A FACTOR OF 18.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.660
OF COURSE, THE CHILEAN MARKETS,
LIKE ALL STOCK MARKETS,

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.530
HAS TAKEN A DIVE IN
THE LAST 2 YEARS.

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:20.130
AND THATS NOT THE ONLY
DOWN SIDE TO THE SYSTEM.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.930
SINCE NOT EVERYONE IN THE
ECONOMY HAS A FULLTIME JOB,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:29.260
NOT EVERYONE ENDS UP
PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.860
WHICH LEAVES A SUBSTANTIAL
CHUNK OF THE POPULATION

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:38.860
WITH NO PENSION COVERAGE AT ALL.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.300
IM STANDING IN FRONT OF THE
COMMUNIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.800
HERE IN LA VICTORIA,
A SUBURB OF SANTIAGO

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.900
WHICH WAS ONCE OF THE
HOTBEDS OF OPPOSITION

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.360
TO THE PINOCHET REGIME.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:52.360
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HERE
ARE EITHER UNEMPLOYED

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.930
OR WORK IN THE
INFORMAL SECTOR,

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.860
THEY DONT OR CANT PAY
INTO THE PENSION SYSTEM,

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.430
WHICH MEANS THEY DONT
GET ANYTHING OUT OF IT.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.700
THIS IS THE KIND OF
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE CHE GUEVARA

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:08.960
IS STILL THE LOCAL
HERO, NOT JOSE PINERA.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:11.460
THE POOR OF CHILE MAY NOT
HAVE A PRIVATE PENSION PLAN

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.160
AND MAY HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH
A MEAGER GOVERNMENT HANDOUT

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.400
IN THEIR OLD AGE,

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.230
BUT EVEN THEY HAVE BENEFITED

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.900
FROM CHILES RAPIDLY
GROWING ECONOMY.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:28.930
GROWTH MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN
THE LIFE OF EVERY CITIZEN.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:33.460
THE POVERTY RATE IN CHILE HAS
GONE DOWN FROM AROUND 50%

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.930
TO 13% NOW,

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.900
SO THIS HAS BEEN,
REALLY, A HUGE SUCCESS

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.400
AND THE PENSION REFORM HAS BEEN
A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THIS.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.260
THE IMPROVEMENT IN CHILES
ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.830
SINCE THE CHICAGO BOYS REFORMS
IS VERY HARD TO ARGUE WITH.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.760
IN THE 15 YEARS BEFORE
MILTON FRIEDMANS VISIT,

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.300
THE GROWTH RATE HERE WAS
A MEASLY .17% A YEAR.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.130
IN THE SUBSEQUENT 15
YEARS, IT INCREASED BY
A FACTOR OF NEARLY 20.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.530
THE POVERTY RATE
HERE IS DOWN TO 15%

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.060
COMPARED WITH 40% IN THE
REST OF LATIN AMERICA.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.760
AND WHEN YOU LOOK DOWN
AT SANTIAGOS SHINY NEW
FINANCIAL DISTRICT,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.730
YOU CAN SEE WHY THE CHILEAN
PENSION REFORM HAS BEEN IMITATED

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:16.560
RIGHT ACROSS THE REGION AND
INDEED AROUND THE WORLD.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.460
FOR BRITAINS
MARGARET THATCHER,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:22.360
THE GENERAL FROM CHILE AND
THE PROFESSOR FROM CHICAGO

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.300
WERE HEROES WHOD DEMONSTRATED

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.530
THAT ONLY BY ROLLING
BACK THE WELFARE STATE

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:31.760
COULD GOVERNMENTS
REVIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.960
YET ONE COUNTRY WHERE THIS
RECIPE HAS NOT BEEN TRIED

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:41.430
IS THE COUNTRY THATS
COME TO NEED IT MOST.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:46.030
JAPAN.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:51.130
SO SUCCESSFUL WAS THE
JAPANESE WELFARE SUPERPOWER

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.760
THAT BY THE 1970s,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:59.760
LIFE EXPECTANCY WAS THE
LONGEST IN THE WORLD.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.760
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT
JAPANS WELFARE STATE

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:11.000
WAS TOO SUCCESSFUL.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.900
TODAY, THE PROGRAMS RUN HERE
AT JAPANS MINISTRY OF WELFARE

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.230
RELY ON AN EVER-SMALLER
NUMBER OF ACTIVE WORKERS

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:21.500
TO SUPPORT AN EVER-RISING
POPULATION OF RETIREES.

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.160
BACK IN 1960, THERE
WAS SOMETHING LIKE
11 ACTIVE WORKERS

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.060
FOR EVERY ONE RETIRED PERSON.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.900
BUT BY 2025, THAT NUMBER
COULD SINK AS LOW AS 2.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.800
IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WILL
BE ONE OLD-AGE PENSIONER

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.030
FOR EVERY 2 BUREAUCRATS
WORKING HERE AT THE MINISTRY.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.930
IN JUST 30 YEARS, THE COST
OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.500
HAS RISEN IN RELATION TO
JAPANS NATIONAL INCOME

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:49.200
BY A FACTOR OF 4.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.360
TODAY, VIRTUALLY ALL JAPANS
HEALTH INSURANCE SOCIETIES

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.300
AND THE PENSION FUNDS ARE
NEARLY OUT OF MONEY, TOO.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.500
JAPANS ONCE-SO-SUPER
WELFARE STATE

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:11.030
IS THREATENING TO
BANKRUPT THE NATION.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:15.030
INSURANCE--IT SEEMED
SUCH A BRILLIANT IDEA

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.400
IN THE CALCULATIONS OF
THOSE SCOTTISH MINISTERS

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.500
AND EVEN MORE
BRILLIANT IN JAPANS

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.600
ALL-ENCOMPASSING WELFARE STATE.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.330
BUT AS WEVE SEEN,
THE BEST LAID SCHEMES

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.900
CAN BE THROWN INTO DISARRAY BY
AN UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.430
SO IS THERE ANY BETTER
WAY OF MANAGING RISK

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.730
IN AN UNCERTAIN WORLD?

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:38.000
DISASTERS LIKE 9/11 AND
KATRINA EXPOSED THE LIMITS

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.760
OF BOTH TRADITIONAL INSURANCE
AND THE WELFARE STATE.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.860
BUT INSURANCE AND WELFARE
ARENT THE ONLY WAYS

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.900
TO BUY YOURSELF PROTECTION
AGAINST FUTURE SHOCKS.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.930
THESE DAYS, THE
SMART WAY OF DOING IT

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.230
IS BY BEING HEDGED.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.230
NOW, EVERYBODYS
HEARD OF HEDGE FUNDS,

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.730
BUT WHAT EXACTLY
DOES HEDGING MEAN

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:01.930
AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.760
TO MOST OF US, HEDGE
FUNDS ARE A MYSTERY.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.500
BUT THE ONE THING WE DO KNOW

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.230
IS THAT THEY CAN MAKE
YOU STUPENDOUSLY RICH.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.400
ONE HUGELY SUCCESSFUL
HEDGE FUND MANAGER

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.800
PAID $60 MILLION
FOR THIS CEZANNE

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.160
AND HE OWNS THIS DEGAS, TOO.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.860
NOT TO MENTION A JASPER JOHNS
HE PAID $80 MILLION FOR.

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:36.230
HES ALSO GIVEN HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHARITY.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:41.100
KEN GRIFFIN IS THE FOUNDER OF
THE CITADEL INVESTMENT GROUP,

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.430
ONE OF THE WORLDS
BIGGEST HEDGE FUNDS.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:47.800
LAST YEAR, HE NAVIGATED HIS
WAY THROUGH THE CREDIT CRUNCH

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.930
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO PAY HIMSELF
MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.930
TO MOST OF US, RISK IS SCARY.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.230
BUT ALL OF GRIFFINS
VAST WEALTH HAS COME

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.830
BECAUSE HES FOUND A
WAY OF MANAGING RISK

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.760
WITH A MIXTURE OF
MATHEMATICAL PRECISION

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.530
AND BRILLIANT INTUITION.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.330
IT COMES DOWN TO HAVING
TO MAKE A JUDGMENT CALL.

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.400
AND GOOD RISK MANAGERS
AND GOOD RISK TAKERS

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:14.700
ARE INDIVIDUALS
THAT HAVE A HISTORY

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.760
OF MAKING GOOD JUDGMENT CALLS
IN PRICING ASSETS OR CONTRACTS

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.960
OR DERIVATIVES IN THE
FACE OF UNCERTAINTY.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.660
AND IS THAT JUDGMENT,
WHEN YOU MAKE IT,

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:31.230
SOMETHING THAT IS 99%
MATHEMATICS, ALGEBRA

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.900
OR IS THE INTUITION
ELEMENT, THE UNQUANTIFIABLE
ELEMENT, BIGGER THAN THAT?

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.400
SO WHAT I FIND IS THAT PEOPLE
WHO ARE REALLY GOOD AT THIS

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:41.560
HAVE GREAT INTUITION,
THEY HAVE GREAT INSTINCT.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:44.330
THEIR GUT ACTUALLY
TELLS THEM SOMETHING.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.830
THE MATHEMATICS ARE IMPORTANT

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.830
BECAUSE THEY DEMONSTRATE
YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:52.560
BUT ULTIMATELY, THE
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR
NOT TO TAKE A GIVEN RISK

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.460
I THINK IS REALLY A
HUMAN JUDGMENT CALL

00:42:55.460 --> 00:43:04.800
IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.600
THE ORIGINS OF HEDGING,
APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH,

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.260
FOR A FARMER, NOTHING
IS MORE IMPORTANT

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.460
THAN THE FUTURE
PRICE OF HIS CROP

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.130
AFTER ITS BEEN HARVESTED
AND BROUGHT TO MARKET.

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:19.100
BUT THAT COULD BE HIGHER OR
MUCH LOWER THAN HE EXPECTS.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.000
A FUTURES CONTRACT ALLOWS
HIM TO PROTECT HIMSELF

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.030
BY COMMITTING A
MERCHANT TO BUY THE CROP

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.030
WHEN ITS BROUGHT TO
MARKET AT A PRICE AGREED

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.360
WHEN THE SEEDS
ARE BEING PLANTED.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.160
THE FARMER GETS A FLOOR BELOW
WHICH THE PRICE CANT SINK,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.760
THE MERCHANT GETS A CEILING
ABOVE WHICH IT CANT RISE.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.260
BY SIGNING A FUTURES
CONTRACT, BOTH THE
FARMER AND THE MERCHANT

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.830
HAVE HEDGED THEIR BETS.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.760
BOTH PARTIES ARE BETTER
OFF, AND BECAUSE OF THAT,

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.400
THE WORLD AS A WHOLE
IS MUCH BETTER OFF.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.260
IT ENCOURAGES
CAPITAL FORMATION, IT
ENCOURAGES INVESTMENT,

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:57.700
IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO DO
WHAT IS NEEDED TO BE DONE

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.360
TO MAKE THE WORLD
A BETTER PLACE.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.500
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
STANDARDIZED FUTURES CONTRACT,

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.430
AGREED RULES, AND AN
EFFECTIVE CLEARING HOUSE,

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:13.930
THE FIRST TRUE FUTURES
MARKET WAS BORN.

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:18.530
AND ITS BIRTHPLACE WAS
HERE IN THE WINDY CITY--

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:22.330
CHICAGO.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:27.030
AFTER THE CITYS
FUTURES EXCHANGE WAS
ESTABLISHED IN 1874,

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:32.430
HEDGING COMMODITIES
BECAME STANDARD PRACTICE.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.630
THE NEXT STEP WAS FOR A
CONDITIONAL KIND OF FUTURE

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:40.200
TO EVOLVE--THE OPTION.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.060
SOME OF THIS REALLY IS
THE FINANCIAL EQUIVALENT

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.500
OF ROCKET SCIENCE,

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.860
BUT THE UNDERLYING
PRINCIPLE IS SIMPLE.

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:50.460
BECAUSE THEYRE DERIVED
FROM UNDERLYING ASSETS,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.460
ALL FUTURES CONTRACTS
ARE KNOWN AS DERIVATIVES.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.000
BUT AN EVEN SMARTER KIND OF
DERIVATIVE IS AN OPTION.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.060
THE BUYER OF A COAL OPTION
AS THE RIGHT, SAY, TO BUY

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:06.330
A BARREL OF OIL FOR
$120 IN A YEARS TIME.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.760
NOW, IF THE PRICE OF OIL
RISES TO $150 A BARREL,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.930
THEN THE OPTION
IS IN THE MONEY,

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.260
AND A SMART GUY MAKES
A PROFIT OF $30.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.900
BUT IF THAT DOESNT HAPPEN,
IF THE PRICE OF OIL

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:20.230
STAYS THE SAME OR
ACTUALLY DECLINES,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.830
HES UNDER NO OBLIGATION
TO CARRY THROUGH THE DEAL.

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.730
ALL HE DOES IS TO WRITE OFF
THE COST OF THE OPTION ITSELF.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.560
WELL, ITS BY BUYING
AND SELLING COMPLEX,

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.330
SMART DERIVATIVES LIKE OPTIONS

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.400
THAT KEN GRIFFIN HAS
BECOME A BILLIONAIRE.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:43.200
[OVERLAPPING CHATTER]

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.660
IN THEORY, DERIVATIVES
OFFERED A NEW WAY

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.000
TO HEDGE AGAINST AN
UNCERTAIN FUTURE.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.400
A MUCH SMARTER WAY THAN
BORING OLD INSURANCE

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.200
AND MUCH MORE PROFITABLE.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.630
HEDGING ALSO USHERED
IN A NEW PHASE

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:01.860
BY SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS
OF FINANCIAL GLOBALIZATION.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.200
AND WITH THE ARRIVAL
OF THE HEDGE FUND

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.930
CAME A NEW KIND OF
ECONOMIC HIT MAN.

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:12.630
THE GRANDMASTER OF THE
NEW HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:21.830
WAS GEORGE SOROS.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:26.360
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.260
SOROS BROUGHT TO GLOBAL FINANCE

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.900
A BRAND-NEW THEORY
OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.630
THAT UNDERLINED THE
FALLIBILITY OF HUMAN NATURE

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.800
AND THE INSTABILITY
OF FINANCIAL MARKETS.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.830
YOUR ACTIONS, YOU HAVE
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES,

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:46.800
SO THE OUTCOME WILL NOT
CORRESPOND TO YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.600
AND THAT IS THE WAY

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:56.830
HUMAN AFFAIRS GENERALLY WORK.

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.830
ACCORDING TO SOROS
THEORY OF REFLEXIVITY,

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:03.500
FINANCIAL MARKETS CANT POSSIBLY
BE PERFECTLY EFFICIENT,

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:04.700
MUCH LESS RATIONAL,

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.630
FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT
PRICES ARE JUST THE REFLECTION

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.730
OF THE IGNORANCE
AND THE BIASES,

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:11.800
MOSTLY COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.430
OF MILLIONS OF INVESTORS.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.900
IN SOROS EYES, MARKETS
ARE BOUND TO GO THROUGH

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.360
CYCLES OF BOOM AND BUST

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.230
AS SURELY AS THE
HUMAN TEMPERAMENT

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:27.160
IS PRONE TO BOUTS OF
EUPHORIA AND DESPONDENCY.

00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:31.100
SOROS QUANTUM FUND
HAD MADE MILLIONS

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.260
FROM SHORT SELLING,

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.760
A TYPE OF DEALING WHICH
BORROWS STOCKS OR CURRENCIES

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.000
AND SELLS THEM FOR
FUTURE DELIVERY

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.460
ON THE CALCULATION THAT
THEYLL GO DOWN IN VALUE.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.960
HIS BIGGEST COUPS CAME FROM
BEING RIGHT ABOUT LOSERS,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.000
NOT WINNERS, AND THE
GREATEST OF THESE

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.200
WAS AMONG THE MOST
MOMENTOUS SPECULATIVE HITS

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:57.530
IN ALL FINANCIAL HISTORY.

00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:59.960
ON SEPTEMBER THE 16TH, 1992,

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:03.730
WITH THE BRITISH
POUND IN BIG TROUBLE,

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:04.800
I WATCHED AS SOROS

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.260
PUT OUT A CONTRACT ON
THE BANK OF ENGLAND.

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:11.960
I BECAME CONVINCED THAT
SPECULATORS LIKE SOROS

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.500
WERE BOUND TO WIN IF IT
CAME TO A STRAIGHT SHOWDOWN

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.160
WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.

00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.300
IT WAS A MATTER OF
SIMPLE ARITHMETIC.

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:22.730
A TRILLION DOLLARS OF
CURRENCY TRADED EVERY DAY

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.760
ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:23.960
ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:31.460
AGAINST THE MEAGER HARD CURRENCY
RESERVES OF THE U.K. TREASURY.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.960
AT THAT TIME, THE BRITISH
POUND WAS TIGHTLY LINKED

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.800
TO THE GERMAN MARK
THROUGH THE E.R.M.,

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.430
THE EUROPEAN EXCHANGE
RATE MECHANISM.

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:43.660
AS GERMAN INTEREST RATES ROSE
IN THE WAKE OF THAT COUNTRYS

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.660
HUGELY EXPENSIVE REUNIFICATION,
BRITAINS RATE HAD TO RISE, TOO,

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:50.460
HURTING HOMEOWNERS
AND BUSINESSES.

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:54.400
SOROS CALCULATED THAT THE
BRITISH CHANCELLOR NORMAN LAMONT

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.360
WOULD BE FORCED TO
WITHDRAW FROM THE E.R.M.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.830
AND DEVALUE THE POUND.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.930
IT WAS THE BIGGEST
BET OF SOROS LIFE.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:08.200
SO SURE WAS HE THAT
THE POUND WOULD DROP

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.300
THAT HE BET $10 BILLION.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.730
MORE THAN THE ENTIRE
CAPITAL OF HIS FUND.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:17.930
THE RISK-REWARD WAS
DISPROPORTIONATE,

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:24.760
AND THEREFORE, IT SEEMS
LIKE A GOOD SPECULATION

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.660
OR INVESTMENT, IF YOU LIKE,

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.300
IN SHORTING THE POUND.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.830
I WAS EQUALLY CONVINCED

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.900
THAT STERLING WOULD
HAVE TO BE DEVALUED,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.830
THOUGH ALL I HAD TO
BET WAS MY CREDIBILITY.

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.030
THAT EVENING, I
HEADED TO THE OPERA

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:41.800
TO SEE VERDIS THE
FORCE OF DESTINY.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:52.060
IT PROVED EXCEEDINGLY
APPROPRIATE.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:55.930
AT THE INTERVAL, THEY ANNOUNCED
THAT CHANCELLOR NORMAN LAMONT

00:49:55.930 --> 00:49:58.900
HAD APPEARED IN THERE, IN
THE TREASURY COURTYARD,

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:02.300
TO SAY THAT BRITAIN WAS
WITHDRAWING FROM THE E.R.M.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.130
HOW WE ALL CHEERED.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.900
TODAY HAS BEEN AN
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.200
AND TURBULENT DAY.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.500
MASSIVE SPECULATIVE FLOWS
HAVE CONTINUED TO DISRUPT

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:17.100
THE FUNCTIONING OF THE
EXCHANGE RATE MECHANISM.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:20.860
SOROS MADE A BILLION
DOLLARS THAT DAY.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:26.830
AND THAT WAS ONLY 40% OF
HIS FUNDS ANNUAL PROFITS.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.730
DO YOU FEEL OR DID YOU
FEEL A SENSE OF TRIUMPH

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:34.500
WHEN YOUR PROPHESY CAME TRUE
AND THE BET PAID OFF HUGELY?

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.200
OF COURSE. IT WAS LIKE WHEN
YOURE BETTING AND YOU WIN,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.200
NATURALLY, YOU HAVE
THAT SATISFACTION

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:50.060
AND ALSO THE PROFIT.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.130
IN THE PAST DECADE, THE
TRADE IN DERIVATIVES

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.230
BY HEDGE FUNDS LIKE SOROS

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:59.630
HAS SEEMED TO TAKE OVER
THE WORLD OF FINANCE.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:01.030
BY THE END OF 2007,

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.230
THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF ALL
DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:09.200
REACHED A STAGGERING
$596 TRILLION.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:14.160
THATS 43 TIMES THE SIZE
OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.430
THERE ARE TREMENDOUS
ECONOMIC BENEFITS

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:18.100
FOR PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.300
$20 BILLION IN THE HANDS
OF A THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:23.960
IS REALLY A
21ST-CENTURY PHENOMENA.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:25.830
THIS NEVER HAPPENED
50 YEARS AGO.

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:31.260
YET AS MANY HAVE DISCOVERED
TO THEIR GREAT COST RECENTLY,

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:33.430
THERE ARE DOWNSIDES
TO HEDGING, TOO.

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:36.160
WHEN BILLIONAIRE
INVESTOR WARREN BUFFET

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.160
DESCRIBED DERIVATIVES

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.900
AS FINANCIAL WEAPONS
OF MASS DESTRUCTION,

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.860
HE ALL BUT PROPHESIED
THE DOWNFALL

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.660
OF AMERICAN
INSURANCE GIANT AIG,

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.700
WHOSE EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS
ARE THERE BEHIND ME,

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.230
BROUGHT LOW, NOT BY SELLING
INSURANCE POLICIES,

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.530
BUT BY SELLING DERIVATIVES
THAT BLEW UP IN ITS FACE.

00:51:55.530 --> 00:52:00.160
OUR BASIC HUMAN URGE TO
PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST RISK

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.630
HAS PROVED FRUSTRATINGLY
DIFFICULT TO SATISFY.

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:10.700
INSURANCE COMPANIES LET US DOWN.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:14.400
WELFARE STATES SINK
INTO INSOLVENCY.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:22.430
AND DERIVATIVES TURN OUT TO
BE A DOUBLE-EDGE WEAPON, TOO.

00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:26.000
[GUNSHOT]

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.660
AND SO FOR MANY FAMILIES,
PROVIDING FOR THE FUTURE

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:32.900
NOW TAKES ONE VERY SIMPLE FORM--

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.100
AN INVESTMENT IN A HOUSE,

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:37.760
THE VALUE OF WHICH IS
SUPPOSED TO KEEP GOING UP

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:43.400
UNTIL THE DAY THE
BREADWINNERS NEED TO RETIRE.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.330
IF THE PENSION PLAN
FALLS SHORT, NEVER MIND.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:52.730
THERES ALWAYS HOME SWEET HOME.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:55.100
ENCOURAGING HOME
OWNERSHIP MAY WELL CREATE

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.800
A POLITICAL CONSTITUENCY
FOR CAPITALISM,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.800
BUT IT ALSO DISTORTS
THE CAPITAL MARKET

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.300
BY PERSUADING PEOPLE
TO BET THE HOUSE

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:05.160
ON, WELL, THE HOUSE.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.930
PEOPLE NEED TO BORROW
MONEY, OF COURSE,

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.900
TO START UP BUSINESSES OR
TO BUY EXPENSIVE ASSETS,

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.360
BUT IT SEEMS DANGEROUS TO LURE
THEM INTO STAKING EVERYTHING

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.030
ON THE FAR-FROM-RISK-FREE
PROPERTY MARKET.

00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:19.700
FROM BUCKINGHAMSHIRE TO
BOLIVIA TO BONNY SCOTLAND,

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.330
THE KEY IS TO STRIKE
THE RIGHT BALANCE

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.300
BETWEEN DEBT AND INCOME.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.600
NEXT TIME ON THE
ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.360
ILL BE SHOWING HOW THE
ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMY

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:38.500
MANAGED TO GET THAT
BALANCE PERILOUSLY WRONG.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.300
NEXT TIME ON THE
ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.800
AMERICANS KNOW THAT
THERES NO PLACE LIKE HOME,

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.600
EVEN IF ALL THE HOMES
ARE RATHER SIMILAR.

00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.330
IS HOME OWNERSHIP THE PATH
TO FINANCIAL SECURITY?

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:52.300
THE ROOSEVELT ADMINISTRATION
PIONEERED THE IDEA

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.700
OF A PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:56.300
OR IS IT THE ROAD TO RUIN?

00:53:56.300 --> 00:54:00.600
A SMALL TREMOR IN AMERICAS
VERY OWN REAL ESTATE MARKET

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:04.300
WOULD CAUSE A FINANCIAL
EARTHQUAKE ALL AROUND THE WORLD.

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.730
THE ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:09.400
A FINANCIAL HISTORY
OF THE WORLD.

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:13.930
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT
THE ASCENT OF MONEY

00:54:13.930 --> 00:54:36.400
AND WATCH THE FILM, VISIT...

00:54:36.400 --> 00:55:06.600
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE
BY FRIENDS OF NCI

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.130
FUNDING FOR THE
ASCENT OF MONEY

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:25.030
WAS PROVIDED BY...

00:55:25.030 --> 00:55:29.330
MY IDEA CREATED JOBS
FOR 2,000 PEOPLE.

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:33.160
MY IDEA WILL BRING
RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:37.130
AN ENTREPRENEUR WITH AN
IDEA CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:41.200
I HAVE AN IDEA.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:48.000
AND BY...

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.000
