2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.900
We'll fight with him tonight.

3
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.930
It may not be.

4
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.400
You give him then the advantage.

5
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.270
Not a whit.

6
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.500
Why say you so? Looks he not forsupply?

7
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.300
So do we.

8
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.730
His is certain; ours isdoubtful.

9
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.630
Good cousin, be advised; stirnot tonight.

10
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.900
Do not, my lord.

11
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.700
You do not counsel well.

12
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.030
You speak it out of fear andcold heart.

13
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.100
Do me no slander, Douglas.

14
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.730
By my life, and I dare wellmaintain it with my life,

15
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.900
if well-respected honor prick meon,

16
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.270
I hold as little counsel withweak fear as you, my lord,

17
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.230
or any Scot that this day lives.

18
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.300
Let it be seen tomorrow in thebattle which of us fears.

19
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.570
Yea, or tonight.

20
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.500
Content.

21
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.330
Tonight, say I.

22
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.870
Come, come. It may not be.

23
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.430
I do wonder much, being men ofsuch great leading as you are,

24
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.170
that you foresee not whatimpediments

25
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.070
drag back our expedition.

26
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.700
Certain horse of my cousinVernon's

27
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.000
are not yet come up.

28
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.130
Your uncle Worcester's horsecame but today.

29
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.900
And now their pride and mettleis asleep,

30
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.370
their courage with hard labortame and dull,

31
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.400
that not a horse is half thehalf of himself.

32
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.170
So are the horses of the enemyin general

33
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.570
journey-bated and brought low.

34
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.400
The better part of ours are fullof rest.

35
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.170
The number of the king exceedethours.

36
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.200
For God's sake, cousin, staytill all come in.

37
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.430
I come with gracious offers fromthe king

38
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.900
if you vouchsafe me hearing andrespect.

39
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.870
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt.

40
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.830
And would to God you were of ourdetermination.

41
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.500
Some of us love you well andeven though some envy

42
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.370
your great deservings and goodname,

43
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.870
because you're not of ourquality

44
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.430
but stand against us like anenemy.

45
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.800
And God defend but still Ishould stand so,

46
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.900
so long as out of limit and truerule

47
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.430
you stand against anointedmajesty.

48
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.730
But to my charge.

49
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.530
The king hath sent to know thenature of your griefs

50
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.200
and whereupon you conjure fromthe breast of civil peace

51
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.300
such bold hostility,

52
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.770
teaching his duteous landaudacious cruelty.

53
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.500
If that the king have any wayyour just deserts forgot,

54
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.170
which he confesseth to bemanifold,

55
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.370
he bids you name your griefs.

56
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.170
And with all speed, you shallhave your desires

57
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.130
with interest and pardonabsolute for yourself

58
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.000
and these herein misled by yoursuggestion.

59
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.300
The king is kind, and well weknow the king knows

60
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.070
at what time to promise, when topay.

61
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.630
My father and my uncle andmyself did give him

62
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.630
that same royalty he wears.

63
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.800
And when he was not six andtwenty strong,

64
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.830
sick in the world's regard,wretched and low,

65
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.930
a poor unminded outlaw sneakinghome,

66
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.230
my father gave him welcome tothe shore.

67
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.000
And when he heard him swear andvow to God

68
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.570
he came but to be Duke ofLancaster,

69
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.700
to sue his livery and beg hispeace

70
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.070
with tears of innocency andterms of zeal,

71
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.830
my father, in kind heart andpity moved,

72
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.000
swore him assistance andperform'd it too.

73
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.370
And when the lords and barons ofthe realm

74
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.770
perceived Northumberland didlean to him,

75
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.130
the more and less came in withcap and knee,

76
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.270
met him in boroughs, cities,villages,

77
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.630
attended him on bridges, stoodin lanes,

78
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.170
laid gifts before him, proffer'dhim their oaths,

79
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.830
gave him their heirs, as pagesfollow'd him

80
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.230
even at the heels in goldenmultitudes.

81
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.500
He presently,as greatness knowsitself,

82
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.370
steps me a little higher thanhis vow made to my father,

83
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.500
while his blood was poor,

84
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.170
upon the naked shore atRavenspurgh

85
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.130
and now, forsooth, takes on himto reform

86
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.100
some certain edicts and somestrait decrees

87
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.870
that lie too heavy on thecommonwealth,

88
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.100
cries out upon abuses,

89
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100
seems to weep over his country'swrongs,

90
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.370
and by this face, this seemingbrow of justice,

91
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.830
did he win the hearts of allthat he did angle for.

92
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.730
Proceeded further; cuts me offthe heads

93
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.600
of all the favorites that theabsent king

94
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600
in deputation left behind himhere

95
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.500
while he was personal in theIrish wars.

96
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.500
Tut!

97
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.430
I came not to hear this.

98
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.730
Then to the point.

99
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.630
In short time after, he deposedthe king;

100
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.500
soon after that, deprived him ofhis life;

101
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.400
and, in the neck of that, task'dthe whole state.

102
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.570
To make that worse, suffer'd hiskinsman Mortimer,

103
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.370
who is, if every owner were wellplaced,

104
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.300
indeed his king, to be engagedin Wales,

105
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.230
there without ransom to lieforfeited;

106
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.400
disgraced me in my happyvictories;

107
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.630
sought to entrap me byintelligence;

108
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.600
rated mine uncle from thecouncil-board;

109
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.530
in rage, dismiss'd my fatherfrom the court;

110
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.400
broke oath on oath; committedwrong on wrong;

111
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.770
and, in conclusion,

112
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.870
drove us to seek out this headof safety

113
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.230
and withal to pry into histitle,

114
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.530
the which we find too indirectfor long continuance.

115
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.770
Shall I return this answer tothe king?

116
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.400
Not so, Sir Walter.

117
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.030
We'll withdraw a while.

118
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.070
Go to the king.

119
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.630
Let there be impawn'd somesurety for a safe return again,

120
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.630
and in the morning earl

121
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.930
shall mine uncle bring him ourpurposes.

122
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.700
And so farewell.

123
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.030
I would you would accept ofgrace and love.

124
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.830
And may be so we shall.

125
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.870
Pray God you do.

126
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.000
Hie, good Sir Michael.

127
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.170
Bear this sealed brief withwinged haste

128
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.770
to the lord marshal, this to mycousin Scroop,

129
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.200
and all the rest to whom theyare directed.

130
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.000
If you knew how much they do toimport,

131
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.100
you would make haste.

132
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.300
My good lord, I do guess theirtenor.

133
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.170
Like enough you do.

134
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.670
Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is aday

135
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.270
wherein the fortune of tenthousand men

136
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.030
must bide the touch.

137
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.170
For, sir, at Shrewsbury,

138
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.670
as I am truly given tounderstand,

139
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.200
the king, with mighty andquick-raised power,

140
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.200
meets with Lord Harry.

141
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.200
And, I fear, Sir Michael,

142
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.470
what with the sickness ofNorthumberland,

143
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.300
whose power was in the firstproportion,

144
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.500
and what with Owen Glendower'sabsence thence,

145
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.030
who with them was a rated sinewtoo

146
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.130
and comes not in, o'er-ruled byprophecies,

147
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.400
I fear the power of Percy is tooweak

148
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.130
to wage an instant trial withthe king.

149
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.730
Doubt not, my lord; they shallbe well opposed.

150
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.530
I hope no less.

151
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.430
Yet needful 'tis to fear.

152
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.300
And, to prevent the worst, SirMichael, speed,

153
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.330
for if Lord Percy thrive not,ere the king dismiss his power,

154
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.130
he means to visit us,

155
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.870
for he hath heard of ourconfederacy,

156
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.370
and 'tis but wisdom to makestrong against him.

157
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.530
Therefore, make haste.

158
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.630
I must go write again to otherfriends.

159
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.130
So farewell, Sir Michael.

160
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.170
