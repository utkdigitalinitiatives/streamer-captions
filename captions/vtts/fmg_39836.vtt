00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.030
AT AROUND 9:25 A.M.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.260
AN OFFICIAL CAR IS MAKING
ITS WAY THROUGH THE

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.700
STREETS OF MADRID,
THE SPANISH CAPITAL.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.660
SUDDENLY THERE'S A
MASSIVE EXPLOSION.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.800
THE CAR IS FLUNG
HIGH INTO THE AIR.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.160
THE THREE OCCUPANTS
ARE KILLED INSTANTLY.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.530
ONE OF THEM IS SPAIN'S
PRIME MINISTER,

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.300
ADMIRAL LUIS
CARRERO BLANCO.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.960
BUT WHO WOULD WANT
HIM DEAD, AND WHY?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:56.030

THE SPANISH PRIME
MINISTER, ADMIRAL LUIS

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.560
CARRERO BLANCO HAS JUST
BEEN KILLED BY A BOMB

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.160
HIDDEN IN A TUNNEL
UNDER THE ROAD.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.030
THE FORCE OF THE
EXPLOSION WAS SO GREAT

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.900
THAT HIS CAR WAS
HELD OVER THE TOP

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.600
OF AN ADJACENT FIVE
STORY BUILDING.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.000
IT WILL BE TWO DAYS

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.130
RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE ASSASSINATION.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.800
THEN A GROUP KNOWN AS ETA,
FROM THE BASQUE REGION

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.200
IN NORTHERN SPAIN, STEPS
FORWARD CLAIMING THEY

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.930
KILLED BLANCO BECAUSE OF
HIS UNSWERVING SUPPORT

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.460
FOR SPAIN'S AGING
FASCIST DICTATOR

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.530
GENERAL
FRANCISCO FRANCO.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.330
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS 70
YEARS OLD AT THE TIME,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.400
BLANCO HAD BEEN NAMED AS
FRANCO'S CHOSEN SUCCESSOR

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.800
AND ETA KNEW HE WOULD
CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.000
FRANCO'S HARDLINE POLICIES
SO HE'S MARKED FOR DEATH.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.860
FRANCO WOULD DIE HIMSELF
TWO YEARS LATER,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.130
BUT IT WOULD
MAKE NO DIFFERENCE

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.730
TO ETA'S WAR OF TERROR
AGAINST THE SPANISH STATE.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.230
THEY CONTINUE WITH
THEIR VIOLENT CAMPAIGN

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.700
OF BOMBING
AND ASSASSINATION,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.760
RESULTING OVER THE YEARS
IN HUNDREDS OF DEATHS.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.460
ALONG THE WAY MANY ETA
MEMBERS THEMSELVES WILL DIE

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.930
- EITHER IN SHOOTOUTS
WITH THE AUTHORITIES

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.100
OR IN FRONT OF
JUDICIAL FIRING SQUADS.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.400
BUT NONE OF THIS
MATTERS TO THEM.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.260
THEY'RE DETERMINED
TO FORCE SPAIN

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.330
TO RECOGNIZE
THEIR RIGHT TO AN

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.200
INDEPENDENT HOMELAND
OF THEIR OWN.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
ETA, WHO'S FULL NAME IS
EUSKADI TA ASKATASUNA,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.860
MEANING "BASQUE HOMELAND
AND FREEDOM", IS AN

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.030
EXTREME NATIONALIST GROUP
DEDICATED TO FREEING THE

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.430
BASQUE REGION IN NORTHERN
SPAIN FROM SPANISH RULE.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.600
THE BASQUE'S ANCESTORAL
HOMELAND STRETCHES INLAND

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.500
FROM THE BAY OF BISCAY AND
CONSISTS OF THE PROVINCES

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.000
OF VIZCAYA, GUIPUZCOA,
NAVARRA AND ALAVA.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.960
IT ALSO OCCUPIES A SMALL
PART OF SOUTHWEST FRANCE,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.200
NAMELY THE PROVINCES OF
LABOURD, BASSE NAVARRE

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.060
AND SOULE.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.660
THE TWO LARGEST TOWNS ARE
THE SEASIDE RESORT AREA OF

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.300
SAN SEBASTIAN AND BILBAO,
ONCE AN ANCIENT PORT

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.030
BUT NOW A THRIVING
INDUSTRIAL CENTER.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.030
WITH A POPULATION OF AROUND
TWO AND A HALF MILLION,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.630
85% OF THE BASQUES
LIVE IN SPAIN

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.960
WITH THE
REST IN FRANCE.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.100
THE ORIGINS OF THE BASQUE
PEOPLE ARE LOST IN TIME.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.730
WHAT IS KNOWN, HOWEVER,
IS THAT THEY'VE OCCUPIED

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.300
THEIR PRESENT TERRITORY
SINCE BEFORE THE ROMANS

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.930
STARTED CONQUERING
THE REST OF EUROPE.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.930
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
LANGUAGE, EUSKARA,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.200
WHICH HAS NO RECOGNIZABLE
LINK WITH ANY OTHER

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.260
KNOWN LANGUAGE AND THEY'RE
DETERMINED TO PRESERVE IT.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.160
DOWN THROUGH
THE CENTURIES

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.430
THE BASQUES HAVE DEVELOPED
A UNIQUE CULTURE,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.100
OWING NOTHING TO
EITHER SPAIN OR FRANCE.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.400
THIS IS REFLECTED IN
THEIR NATIONAL DRESS,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.460
THEIR COOKING, THEIR
MUSIC, THEIR LITERATURE,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.900
AND THEIR RELIGION.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.600
THEY REMAIN A FIERCELY
INDEPENDENT PEOPLE,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.260
RESISTING INVASION ATTEMPTS
FROM ROMANS TO MOORS.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.760
THIS ENABLED THE BASQUES
TO BE MORE OR LESS

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.030
SELF-GOVERNING UNTIL THE
LATTER PART OF THE 19TH

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.030
CENTURY WHEN, FOLLOWING
A PERIOD OF CIVIL WAR,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.660
THE SPANISH DECIDED TO
MAKE THE BASQUE REGION

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.530
A PART OF SPAIN.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.430
SPAIN REMAINED NEUTRAL
DURING WWI BUT BY 1936

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.000
THE COUNTRY WAS DRIFTING,
ONCE AGAIN, TOWARDS

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.900
CIVIL WAR AS THE SPANISH
REPUBLIC, ESTABLISHED

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.830
JUST FIVE YEARS EARLIER,
FOUND ITSELF UP AGAINST

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.330
THE FORCES OF FASCISM LED BY
GENERAL FRANCISCO FRANCO.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.700
DURING THE WAR THE BASQUE
PROVINCES OF ALAVA

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.100
AND NAVARRA SIDE WITH
FRANCO WHILE GUIPUZCOA

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.960
AND VIZCAYA JOIN FORCES
WITH THE REPUBLICANS.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.400
IN OCTOBER 1936 THE
BASQUE REGION IS

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.160
DECLARED INDEPENDENT
BY THE REPUBLIC.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.060
THIS INFURIATES FRANCO
WHO IS NOW DETERMINED

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.230
TO STAMP OUT
BASQUE NATIONALISM.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.700
IN A CYNICAL EXAMPLE OF
EUROPEAN POWER POLITICS,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.300
THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR
IS EXPLOITED BY BOTH

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.630
ADOLF HITLER,
CHANCELLOR OF GERMANY,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.160
AND BENITO MUSSOLINI,
THE ITALIAN DICTATOR,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.400
AS THEY SHIP IN TROOPS AND
EQUIPMENT TO AID FRANCO.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.730
FACED WITH SUCH
OVERWHELMING ODDS,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.460
THE REPUBLICANS
QUICKLY LOSE GROUND.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.430
IN APRIL 1937,
GERMAN PLANES BOMB

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.760
THE BASQUE TOWN
OF GUERNICA.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.530
AND IN JUNE, BILBAO, THE
LAST BASQUE STRONGHOLD,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.060
FALLS TO
FRANCO'S FORCES.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.400
THE BASQUE GOVERNMENT
NOW GOES INTO EXILE -

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.900
FIRST TO BARCELONA
AND THEN TO FRANCE.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.330
IN APRIL 1939, HAVING WON
THE CIVIL WAR AT A COST OF

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.130
MORE THAN A MILLION
LIVES, A RUINED ECONOMY,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.400
AND A LASTING
LEGACY OF HATRED,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.600
FRANCO STARTS
TAKING HIS REVENGE

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.100
ON THE BASQUES WHO SIDED
WITH THE REPUBLICANS.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.360
AT THE SAME TIME HE ALLOWS
THE TWO PROVINCES WHO HAD

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.430
SUPPORTED HIM TO RETAIN
A DEGREE OF AUTONOMY.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.600
BUT IN DEALING
WITH WHAT HE CALLS

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.530
THE "TRAITOR PROVINCES",
HE EXECUTES THOUSANDS

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.960
AND CONDEMNS MANY
MORE TO LABOR CAMPS

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.400
WHERE THEY PERISH IN
THE HARSH CONDITIONS.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.600
FRANCO ALSO CRACKS DOWN
HARD ON THE BASQUE CULTURE

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.930
AND THE BASQUE
PEOPLE THEMSELVES.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.730
THEY'RE FORBIDDEN TO USE
THEIR LANGUAGE IN PUBLIC

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.830
OR FLY THE BASQUE
NATIONAL FLAG.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.660
PROPERTY IS CONFISCATED,
CLERICS ARE DISMISSED,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.030
AND INTELLECTUALS AND
POLITICIANS WHO SPEAK OUT

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.260
AGAINST FRANCO ARE
THROWN INTO JAIL,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.260
MANY OF THEM
UNDERGOING TORTURE.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.560
BUT IF THE SPANISH
DICTATOR THINKS THIS

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.260
WILL SOLVE WHAT HE AND HIS
SENIOR COHORTS REGARD AS

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.700
"THE BASQUE PROBLEM",

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.500
HE COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN MORE WRONG.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.930
ALL HIS BRUTALITY SERVES
IS TO HARDEN THE RESOLVE

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.000
OF THE BASQUES, WHO STOOD
AGAINST HIM EVEN MORE.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.830
FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR,
AROUND 150,000 BASQUES

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.660
HAD FLED INTO EXILE.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.960
MANY OF THEM TO FRANCE
WHERE THEY REMAIN

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.900
UNTIL THE START OF
WWII IN SEPTEMBER 1939

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.300
WHEN SOME OF THEM
MOVE EITHER TO ENGLAND

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.560
OR VARIOUS SOUTH
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.960
HOWEVER, A LARGE NUMBER
OF BASQUES CHOOSE TO STAY

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.530
IN FRANCE WHERE THEY
JOIN THE FRENCH RESISTANCE

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.430
AGAINST
NAZI OCCUPATION.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.100
LATER, OTHERS FORM A
SPECIAL BASQUE BATTALION

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.700
KNOWN AS GERNIKA
AND THEY JOIN FORCES

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.930
WITH THE ALLIES IN
DRIVING THE GERMANS BACK

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.730
THROUGH FRANCE FOLLOWING
D-DAY ON JUNE 6, 1944.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.930
AT THE END OF THE WAR
IN EUROPE IN MAY 1945,

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.200
SEVERAL HUNDRED OF
THESE EXPERIENCED

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.630
GERNIKA VETERANS
SLIP BACK INTO SPAIN,

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.060
WHICH HAD REMAINED
NEUTRAL THROUGHOUT,

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.030
AND HIDE OUT IN
THE BASQUE MOUNTAINS.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.860
NOW THE WAR IS OVER
THEY'RE BACK ON THE

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.760
OLD AGENDA - ENDING
SPAIN'S DOMINATION

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.430
OVER THE BASQUES.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.760
SPAIN'S DICTATOR,
GENERAL FRANCO,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.830
IS DETERMINED
NOT TO GIVE WAY

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.730
TO THE BASQUE INSURGENCE
CLAMORING FOR INDEPENDENCE

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.430
AND SENDS IN HIS TROOPS
TO ROOT THEM OUT.

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.100
BUT HAVING HONED THEIR
SKILLS ON THE BATTLEFIELDS

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.600
OF EUROPE, THE BASQUES
NOW HAVE THE ABILITY

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.660
TO MOUNT A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE
GUERILLA CAMPAIGN.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.500
BASQUE RESISTANCE TO
FRANCO GROWS DAILY.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.000
THE BASQUE GOVERNMENT
IS RESTORED IN PARIS

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.730
AND THE BASQUE NATIONALIST
PARTY, THE PNV,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.130
IS STEADILY
REBUILDING ITSELF.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.860
IN MAY 1947 THERE'S
A GENERAL STRIKE

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.500
IN THE INDUSTRIAL
CITY OF BILBAO.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.460
IT REPRESENTS THE FIRST
OPEN CHALLENGE TO FRANCO'S

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.860
REPRESSIVE REGIME
SINCE THE CIVIL WAR.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.700
FRANCO REACTS
WITH TYPICAL FURY,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.100
DISMISSING 15,000
WORKERS FROM THEIR JOBS

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.960
AND JAILING
HUNDREDS OF OTHERS.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.060
DESPITE THIS, MANY BASQUES
CONSIDERED THE STRIKE

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.430
A SUCCESS AND OVER
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.930
A NUMBER OF SIMILAR
ACTIONS TAKE PLACE

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.260
WITH HEAVILY ARMED POLICE
TRYING TO MAINTAIN ORDER.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.160
WITH EACH STRIKE OR
DEMONSTRATION AGAINST

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.530
HIS AUTHORITY, FRANCO
BECOMES EVER MORE FURIOUS.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.400
HE'S DETERMINED TO CRUSH
BASQUE NATIONALISM

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.630
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.160
HE NOW BRINGS SO MUCH
PRESSURE TO BEAR THAT MUCH

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.300
OF THE BASQUE NETWORK
OPERATING IN SPAIN IS LEFT

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.030
IN RUINS AS ITS MEMBERS
ARE ARRESTED, FLEE ABROAD,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.430
OR RETREAT ONCE MORE
TO THE MOUNTAINS.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.500
BUT THEIR DESIRE
FOR INDEPENDENCE

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.060
IS VIRTUALLY
UNQUENCHABLE.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.900
HOWEVER, IT WILL NOT BE
UNTIL JULY 31, 1959,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.930
THE 20TH YEAR OF FRANCO'S
IRON RULE, THAT A GROUP OF

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.300
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN GET
TOGETHER IN THE BASQUE

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.130
COUNTRY AND FORM AN ARMED
REVOLUTION MOVEMENT.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.530
THEY'RE DETERMINED
TO WIN SELF GOVERNMENT

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.730
FOR THEIR HOMELAND.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.900
THE GROUP IS KNOWN AS ETA
AND IT WILL SOON BECOME

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.460
ONE OF THE MOST NOTORIOUS
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.560
IN EUROPE.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.130
IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE ETA
IS ATTRACTING A GREAT DEAL

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.700
OF ATTENTION, NOT JUST
FROM THE WARY SPANISH

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.600
AUTHORITIES BUT ALSO FROM
THOUSANDS OF ORDINARY

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.530
BASQUE CITIZENS WHO
ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:42.400
THEIR FIGHT FOR
INDEPENDENCE.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.700
THE POLICE SOON CRACK
DOWN ON THE FLEDGLING

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.100
ORGANIZATION AND
START MAKING ARRESTS.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.030
SEVERAL OF ETA'S
LEADING OPERATIVES

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.730
NOW FLEE ACROSS THE
MOUNTAINS INTO FRANCE.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.600
ONCE OVER THE BORDER
THEY'RE RECEIVED AS HEROES

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.430
BY THE FRENCH FOR WHAT'S
SEEN AS THEIR COURAGEOUS

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.330
STAND AGAINST FRANCO'S
FASCIST REGIME.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.700
WITH MANY OF THEIR
COMPANIONS LANGUISHING

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.330
IN SPANISH JAILS, THE
GROUP, NOW HIDING OUT

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
IN BOTH FRANCE
AND SPAIN,

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.730
UNDERGOES A RIGOROUS
TRAINING PROGRAM

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.900
AS THEY BEGIN TO PLAN
A SERIES OF ATTACKS

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.630
THAT WILL PROVE THEY'RE
STILL VERY MUCH IN BUSINESS.

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.960
THEY ALSO EMBARK ON A
SPREE OF ROBBERIES,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.430
RAISING MONEY TO BUY THE
WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES AND

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.460
VEHICLES THEY NEED IN
THEIR WAR OF TERROR

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.000
AGAINST THE SPANISH
AUTHORITIES.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.260
AS THE POLICE HUNT
FOR THEM INTENSIFIES,

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.560
ETA'S CORE MEMBERS
NOW SET UP SECRET BASES

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.730
HIDDEN DEEP IN THE
REMOTE BASQUE HILLS.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.360
HERE THEY FEEL SAFE
KNOWING THAT THEIR FELLOW

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.430
COUNTRYMEN WILL GIVE
THEM PLENTY OF WARNING

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:48.260
IF THE POLICE APPEAR
TO BE GETTING TOO CLOSE.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.200
ETA REGARDS THE POLICE
AS THE UNACCEPTABLE FACE

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.760
OF SPANISH REPRESSION AND
PUTS THEM TOP OF THE

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.800
HIT LIST DURING THEIR
CAMPAIGN OF TERROR

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.230
AGAINST THE STATE.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.100
THE POLICE AND THE
COUNTRY'S CIVIL GUARD

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.730
REACT WITH PREDICTABLE
FURY, BREAKING UP PRO-ETA

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.060
DEMONSTRATIONS WITH
MAXIMUM FORCE.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.300
HOWEVER, MANY ORDINARY
BASQUES ABHOR THE VIOLENCE.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.800
AS CLAIR GETTEGO, A
TEACHER POINTED OUT,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.860
ALL THEY WANT TO
DO IS LIVE IN PEACE

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.560
WITH THEIR
SPANISH NEIGHBORS.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.500
WE WANT TO
BE INDEPENDENT.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.000
ALL WE WANT IS TO
BE INDEPENDENT.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.460
AND THEN, IF WE WERE
INDEPENDENT, I'M SURE

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.160
SHOULD BE VERY FRIENDLY
TO SPANISH PEOPLE.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.530
WE SHOULD.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.260
WE HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST THEM. I MEAN,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.360
AS LONG AS THEY DON'T
HAVE NOTHING AGAINST US.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.230
>>BUT AS GENERAL FRANCO
URGES THE AUTHORITIES TO

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.630
CRACK DOWN EVEN HARDER
ON PEOPLE TAKING TO THE

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.060
STREETS, THE BASQUE
DREAM OF INDEPENDENCE

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.260
SEEMS EVER MORE REMOTE.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.200
AND WHEN, ON DECEMBER 20,
1973, SPANISH PRIME MINISTER

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.500
ADMIRAL LUIS CARRERO
BLANCO IS BLOWN TO BITS

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.500
IN HIS CAR ALONG WITH HIS
DRIVER AND BODYGUARD,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.060
FRANCO IS DOUBLY
DETERMINED TO CRUSH

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.960
THE RESISTANCE
TO HIS REGIME.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.500
ETA'S CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE
CONTINUED THROUGHOUT

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.100
THE FOLLOWING YEAR
WITH A SERIES OF BOMBS,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.030
INCLUDING ONE IN A
MADRID BAR FREQUENTED BY

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.530
SECURITY OFFICERS, AND
INDIVIDUAL ASSASSINATIONS.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.100
IN ADDITION THEY ORGANIZE
POLITICAL PRISONERS'

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.800
HUNGER STRIKES AND
INITIATE INDUSTRIAL UNREST

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.200
THROUGHOUT THE
BASQUE REGION.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.700
AND THEY NEVER LET UP
ON THEIR MAIN DEMAND:

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.700
COMPLETE FREEDOM
FOR THE BASQUES

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.630
AND THE RIGHT TO
GOVERN THEMSELVES.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.600
BUT AS LONG AS
FRANCO IS IN POWER

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.730
THE MORE REALISTIC
AMONG THEM KNOW

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.600
SELF DETERMINATION
IS A FORLORN HOPE.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.700
IN THE SPRING OF 1975,
ETA ASSASSINATE

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.760
A NUMBER OF
POLICE OFFICERS.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.630
ON APRIL 25TH FRANCO
RETALIATES BY SUSPENDING

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:58.900
THE CONSTITUTION IN THE
BASQUE PROVINCES OF

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.030
VIZCAYA AND GUIPUZCOA
AND IMPOSING MARTIAL LAW,

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:07.630
OR AS IT WAS KNOWN,
A STATE OF EXCEPTION.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.530
IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS
POLICE ROUND UP

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.130
AND IMPRISON 3,000
BASQUE CITIZENS.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:17.000
ETA RESPONDS IN KIND.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.160
PANIC NOW BEGINS TO SPREAD
IN SPAIN AS NO ONE KNOWS

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.230
WHERE THE TERRORISTS
WOULD STRIKE NEXT.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.300
FRANCO LIFTED HIS MARTIAL
LAW DECREE ON JULY 25,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.930
BUT AS THIS DID NOTHING
TO LESSEN THE VIOLENCE

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:33.560
HE RE-IMPOSED IT
A MONTH LATER.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.630
THEN, ON SEPTEMBER THE
26TH, FIVE TERRORISTS,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.060
TWO OF WHOM WERE ETA
MEMBERS, ANGEL OTAEGUI

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.260
AND JUAN PAREDES MANOT,
KNOWN AS "TXIQUI",

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.530
WERE EXECUTED
BY FIRING SQUAD

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.300
AFTER BEING
CONVICTED OF MURDER.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.760
THIS CAUSED OUTRAGE AND
THOUSANDS OF PROTESTERS

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.500
TOOK TO THE STREETS; BUT
IT HAD NO EFFECT ON FRANCO

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.760
AND HE GAVE THE GO AHEAD
FOR 15 OTHER ETA MEMBERS

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.600
TO FACE TRIAL INCLUDING
TWO WHO HAD TAKEN PART

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.760
IN THE ASSASSINATION
OF THE PRIME MINISTER,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.960
CARRERO BLANCO,
TWO YEARS EARLIER.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.930
AGAIN ETA ESCALATES
THE VIOLENCE,

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:15.100
GOING AFTER THE
POLICE IN PARTICULAR.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:19.000
INEVITABLY CIVILIANS GET
CAUGHT UP IN THE CROSSFIRE.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.060
BY NOW ETA IS ATTRACTING
FUNDS AND WEAPONS FROM

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.630
STATES LIKE CUBA, LIBYA,
RUSSIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.630
ETA IS ALSO KNOWN TO HAVE
HAD SUPPORTIVE LINKS

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.630
WITH THE PROVISIONAL
IRA, NOW WAGING ITS OWN

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.660
WAR OF TERROR ON THE
BRITISH AUTHORITIES.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.360
ON NOVEMBER 20, 1975, MUCH
TO THE DELIGHT OF ETA,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.200
FRANCO DIES FROM
HEART FAILURE.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.530
AGED 82, HE HAD KEPT
AN IRON GRIP ON SPAIN

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.600
FOR THE LAST 39 YEARS,
LONGER THAN ANY OTHER

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.760
EUROPEAN DICTATOR.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.230
ON NOVEMBER THE 22ND, JUST
TWO DAYS AFTER THE DEATH

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.700
OF GENERAL FRANCO, PRINCE
JUAN CARLOS IS SWORN IN

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.200
AS KING OF SPAIN.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.530
THE NEXT DAY HE JOINED
THOUSANDS OF HIS

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.260
FELLOW CITIZENS FOR
FRANCO'S FUNERAL.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.800
HE WAS ALREADY WELL
USED TO GOVERNMENT,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.830
HAVING BEEN ACTING
HEAD OF STATE

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.630
DURING FRANCO'S EARLIER
PERIOD OF ILLNESS.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.730
THEN ON OCTOBER 30, 1975,
FRANCO, KNOWING HE DIDN'T

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:25.060
HAVE MUCH LONGER TO LIVE,
GIVES HIM FULL CONTROL.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.800
FOLLOWING FRANCO'S DEATH,
THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.660
TOWARDS THE BASQUES
RELAXED A LITTLE AND THEY

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.900
BEGAN TO ALLOW THE REGION
A DEGREE OF AUTONOMY.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.100
ETA RESPONDS BY CUTTING BACK
ON ITS TERROR CAMPAIGN,

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:41.630
WAITING TO SEE HOW THE
SITUATION DEVELOPS.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:45.100
BUT IN THEIR EYES PROGRESS
TOWARDS FULL INDEPENDENCE

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.900
IS PAINFULLY SLOW, AND BY
SPRING 1978, FRUSTRATED

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:53.200
AND ANGRY, THEY FALL BACK
ON THEIR VIOLENT WAYS.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.900
MEANWHILE ETA'S POLITICAL
WING, THE BATASUNA PARTY,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.200
WHICH HAS THE SUPPORT
OF AROUND 20%

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.630
OF THE BASQUE PEOPLE,
IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.530
A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.200
BUT AS ONE TIME ETA
SUPPORTER JUAN AKANEIRA

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.930
REMARKED IN 1978, IT
SEEMS A LONG TIME COMING.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.160
FOR US, THE END OF THE
DICTATORSHIP, THE DEATH

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.230
OF FRANCO, HASN'T MEANT
TO THE BASQUE COUNTRY

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.360
ANY PROGRESSIVE ADVANCE
AND WE ARE STILL LIVING

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.460
IN A SIMILAR TO
DICTATORSHIP SYSTEM.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.460
WE THINK THAT TO
SPEAK OF DEMOCRACY

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.560
IN THE BASQUE COUNTRY
THERE HAS TO BE

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.630
A BREAK WITH THE
PAST DICTATORSHIP.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.930
AND FOR US THAT MEANS
THAT OUR POLITICAL PROGRAM

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.130
MUST BE ACCEPTED BY
THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT,

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.060
BY THE SPANISH ARMY,
WHICH IS THE SAME THAT

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.760
BEGAN THE CIVIL WAR IN
1936 AND IS STILL IN POWER.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.360
>>LATER IN THE YEAR,
HOWEVER, SPAIN'S NEW

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.000
FLEDGLING DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT AGREES TO

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.700
MANY OF ETA'S DEMANDS,
INCLUDING GIVING THE

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.100
BASQUES THEIR OWN
PARLIAMENT AND LIFTING

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.360
FRANCO'S BAN ON MANY
OF THEIR TRADITIONAL

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.600
CUSTOMS AND PRACTICES.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.630
AN AMNESTY IS GRANTED
TO ALL ETA PRISONERS

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.800
HELD IN SPANISH JAILS.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.800
BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S A
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.960
THE CONCESSIONS
ARE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.500
FOR ETA'S HARDLINERS.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.130
THEY WANT NOTHING LESS
THAN FULL INDEPENDENCE

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.130
AND VOW TO CONTINUE
WITH THE VIOLENCE

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.760
UNTIL THE SPANISH
GOVERNMENT GIVES IN.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.630
BUT THE GOVERNMENT
HAD ALWAYS MAINTAINED

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.800
IT WOULD NEVER
TALK TO ETA UNLESS

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.360
AND UNTIL THEY
RENOUNCE VIOLENCE.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.360
THE DEATH TOLL BEGINS
TO RISE MORE STEEPLY

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.200
THAN AT ANY OTHER
TIME IN ETA'S HISTORY.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.360
BUT NOW THE VICTIMS
ARE NOT JUST POLICE

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.000
OR MEMBERS OF
THE CIVIL GUARD,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.930
INNOCENT MEMBERS
OF THE PUBLIC

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.960
GET CAUGHT UP
IN THE VIOLENCE

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.000
AS THE TERRORISTS
ATTEMPT TO SHOOT

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.660
AND BOMB THEIR WAY
TO A SETTLEMENT.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.960
THERE IS NO REAL PATTERN
TO THE ATTACKS; MOST OCCUR

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.160
IN THE BASQUE PROVINCES
OF GUIPUZCOA AND VIZCAYA.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.130
SPAIN ITSELF GETS OFF
RELATIVELY LIGHTLY

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.730
AS ETA CONCENTRATES
MAINLY ON HITTING TARGETS

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.900
IN THE CAPITAL, MADRID,
AND OCCASIONALLY

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.630
THE CITY OF
LOGRONO IN THE NORTH.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:13.630
BUT NOW A SECRET SPANISH
COMMANDO GROUP KNOWN AS GAL,

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.960
GRUPOS ANTITERRORISTAS
DE LIBERACION,

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.660
DECIDES TO TAKE THE
FIGHT BACK TO ETA

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.630
IN AN ASSASSINATION
PROGRAM OF THEIR OWN.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:26.860
A GREAT MANY ETA
AND EX-ETA MEMBERS

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:30.100
LIVE IN FRANCE, JUST
ACROSS THE SPANISH BORDER.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.030
ONE OF THEM IS JUAN OTEGI,
A FURNITURE MAKER

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.400
BUT AT ONE TIME ACTIVE
WITH ETA IN MADRID.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.630
HE'S NOW SUSPECTED
OF BEING INVOLVED IN

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.700
SMUGGLING ARMS FROM FRANCE
INTO THE BASQUE REGION.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:46.630
HE'S A PRIME
TARGET FOR GAL.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.560
ON THE LATE AFTERNOON
OF AUGUST 2, 1985,

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.430
THEY SEND TWO MOTORCYCLE
HITMEN TO SHOOT HIM

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.560
AS HE DRIVES BACK TO
HIS HOME AFTER WORK.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.930
OTEGI DOESN'T
STAND A CHANCE.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:10.100
FATALLY WOUNDED, HE
VEERS OFF THE ROAD.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.100
MEANWHILE HIS KILLERS
GET CLEAN AWAY.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.700
A SHORT TIME LATER GAL
GOES AFTER MEMBERS OF ETA

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.900
LIVING IN THE FRENCH
CITY OF BAYONNE,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.960
A SHORT DISTANCE FROM
THE SPANISH BORDER.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:29.030
THEY KILL SIX AND WOUND
A GREAT MANY MORE.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.360
MEANWHILE OTEGI IS
BURIED IN THE BASQUE TOWN

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.630
OF ORDIZIA, JUST ONE OF
EIGHTEEN ETA MEMBERS

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.660
MURDERED BY GAL HIT SQUADS
OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.360
AS TIME PASSES THE
SPANISH AUTHORITIES

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.730
BECAME EXTREMELY
FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.900
THAT ETA TERRORISTS
APPEARED TO BE LIVING

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.460
BEYOND THEIR
REACH IN FRANCE.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.560
BUT IN 1992, IN A NEW
DEGREE OF COOPERATION,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.730
FRENCH POLICE NOW PLACE
KNOWN LEADING ETA MEMBERS

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.730
ON THEIR SIDE OF THE BORDER
UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:05.030
IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE THEY
START MAKING IMPORTANT

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:11.200
ARRESTS, LEAVING ETA
IN A STATE OF DISARRAY.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.000
ETA MIGHT BE WEAKENED, BUT
AS TWO CAR BOMBS IN MADRID

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.900
SOON DEMONSTRATE, LEAVING
SIX SOLDIERS DEAD

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.000
AND DOZENS OF
CIVILIANS INJURED,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.460
THE ORGANIZATION SEEMS
FAR FROM FINISHED.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.930
DESPITE THIS, SPAIN'S
SECURITY MINISTER, RAFAEL

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:32.100
VERA, REMAINS CONVINCED
THAT ETA IS A SPENT FORCE.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.500
BUT ETA STILL WON'T
LET UP IN ITS DEMANDS

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.230
FOR COMPLETE BASQUE
AUTONOMY; AS FAR AS

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.860
THEY'RE CONCERNED,
THE FIGHT GOES ON.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.360
MEANWHILE THE SPANISH
AUTHORITIES, ALTHOUGH

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.000
PREPARED TO HOLD TALKS
WITH ETA'S POLITICAL WING,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.900
THE BATASUNA PARTY CONTINUE
TO TAKE A TOUGH LINE.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.300
IN JULY 1997, ETA KIDNAPS
AND KILLS A PROMINENT

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.900
SPANISH POLITICIAN,
MIGUEL ANGEL BLANCO.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.930
SIX MILLION
SPANISH CITIZENS

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.600
TAKE TO THE
STREETS IN PROTEST.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.460
THE FOLLOWING YEAR ETA
ANNOUNCES A CEASEFIRE,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.630
BUT IT DOESN'T LAST AND
THEY'RE SOON PLANTING BOMBS

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.460
AND HITTING
INDIVIDUALS AGAIN.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.900
IN 2001, DESPERATE TO MAKE
MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THE

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.460
SPANISH AUTHORITIES, ETA
SAYS IT WILL NOW TARGET

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.530
THE VITAL TOURIST
INDUSTRY.

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.200
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
YEARS BOMBS HIT HOTELS

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.760
IN THE POPULAR HOLIDAY
RESORTS OF BENIDORM

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.130
AND ALICANTE ON
THE COSTA BLANCA.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.360
SPAIN REACTS BY ARRESTING
A GREAT MANY ETA LEADERS

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.200
AND IMPOSING A BAN ON
THEIR POLITICAL WING,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.600
THE BATASUNA PARTY.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.930
MEANWHILE THE ATTACKS FAIL
TO DETER THE TOURISTS AND

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.600
THEY CONTINUE TO FLOCK TO
SPAIN IN THEIR THOUSANDS,

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:58.160
PARTICULARLY
FROM THE U.K.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.430
THEN ON MARCH 11, 2004,
A SERIES OF BOMBS

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.000
HIT FOUR CROWDED COMMUTER
TRAINS IN MADRID.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.060
NEARLY 200 PEOPLE
DIE AND AROUND 1,800

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:16.430
ARE INJURED
IN THE BLASTS.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.000
AT FIRST EVERYONE
BLAMES ETA,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.600
BUT IT TURNS OUT
LATER TO HAVE BEEN

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.260
CARRIED OUT BY
ISLAMIST EXTREMISTS.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.560
ON MARCH 22, 2006, ETA
DECLARES ANOTHER CEASEFIRE,

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.630
SWEARING THAT THIS TIME
IT WILL BE PERMANENT.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.960
BUT LATER THAT YEAR
THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.930
AND CALL IT OFF.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.460
THEY MARK THIS WITH A
VENGEANCE ON DECEMBER 30,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.530
2006, BY PLANTING A BOMB
IN A MULTI-STORY CAR PARK

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.800
AT MADRID'S
BARAJAS AIRPORT,

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.900
THE BUSIEST
IN THE COUNTRY.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.530
THE MASSIVE EXPLOSION SENDS
A HUGE PLUME OF SMOKE

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.600
INTO THE AIR, WRECKS FIVE
FLOORS IN THE BUILDING,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.800
KILLS TWO PEOPLE
AND INJURES ANOTHER 19.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.830
SINCE IT CAME INTO
BEING IN 1959,

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.860
ETA HAS NEVER WAVERED
IN ITS DEMAND FOR

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.260
AN INDEPENDENT AND SELF
GOVERNING BASQUE STATE.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.600
BUT AS TIME WENT BY
AND THE DEATH TOLL

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.460
STEADILY MOUNTED, ETA BEGAN
TO LOSE THE SUPPORT OF A

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.630
GREAT MANY ORDINARY BASQUE
CITIZENS WHO AGREED WITH

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.600
THE TERROR ORGANIZATION'S
AIMS BUT NOT ITS METHODS.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.630
THEY'VE GROWN TIRED OF THE
SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.460
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE, AS PAUL
WILKINSON, PROFESSOR OF

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.360
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
AT ABERDEEN UNIVERSITY,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.800
SEES ONLY TOO CLEARLY.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.700
THE FACT IS THAT ETA IS
NOW ON A HIDING TO NOTHING.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.260
THEY ARE
EFFECTIVELY ISOLATED

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.200
WITHIN THE
BASQUE COMMUNITY.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.660
THEY CAN NO LONGER GO ROUND
WITH A COLLECTING BOX

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.260
AND EXPECT IT TO BE FILLED
BY WILLING BASQUE HANDS.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.560
INDEED THERE HAVE BEEN
MASSIVE DEMONSTRATIONS,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.330
AS YOU KNOW, AGAINST
TERRORISM IN THE HEART OF

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.860
THE BASQUE REGION.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.360
AND THE OTHER POLITICAL
PARTIES ARE GENERALLY

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.730
TOTALLY OPPOSED TO
THE KIND OF VIOLENCE

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.830
THAT ETA HAS
BEEN USING.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.960
>>DURING ITS LONG, BLOODY
CAMPAIGN ETA IS THOUGHT

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.130
TO HAVE KILLED AT
LEAST 800 PEOPLE.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.560
BUT LIKE SO MANY
OTHER SIMILAR

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.260
TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS
AROUND THE WORLD,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.830
ETA HAS FOUND, MUCH
TO ITS OWN COST,

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:28.700
THAT IN THE LONG RUN
NOTHING IS TO BE GAINED

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.160
THROUGH THE BOMB
AND THE GUN.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.700
WITH GOOD WILL
ON BOTH SIDES

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.760
THE FORCES OF TRUE
DEMOCRACY WILL ALWAYS

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:36.760
TRIUMPH OVER INDISCRIMINATE
VIOLENCE AND HATRED.
