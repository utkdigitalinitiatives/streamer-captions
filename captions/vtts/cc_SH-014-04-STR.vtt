00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.100


2
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.770
What, is Antonio here?

3
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.430
Ready, so please yourgrace.

4
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.770
I am sorry for thee.

5
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.200
Thou art come to answer astony adversary,

6
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800
an inhuman wretchuncapable of pity,

7
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.430
void and empty from anydram of mercy.

8
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.570
I have heard your gracehath ta'en great pains

9
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.470
to qualify his rigorouscourse.

10
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.230
But since he standsobdurate and that nolawful means

11
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.830
can carry me out of hisenvy's reach,

12
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.230
I do oppose my patience tohis fury

13
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.570
and am armed to sufferwith a quietness of spirit

14
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.570
the very tyranny and rageof his.

15
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.970
Go one, and call the Jewinto the court.

16
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.470
He is ready at the door.

17
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.000
He comes, my lord.

18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.070
Make room,

19
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
and let him stand beforeour face.

20
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.500
Shylock,

21
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.600
the world thinks--

22
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.570
and I think so too--

23
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.270
that thou but lead'st thisfashion of thy malice

24
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.000
to the last hour of act,

25
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.330
and then 'tis thought,

26
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.670
thou'lt show thy mercy andremorse more strange

27
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.370
than is thy strangeapparent cruelty.

28
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.530
And where thou now exactsthe penalty,

29
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.770
which is a pound of thispoor merchant's flesh,

30
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.970
thou wilt not only loosethe forfeiture,

31
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
but touched with humangentleness and love,

32
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.670
forgive a moiety of theprincipal,

33
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.130
glancing an eye of pity onhis losses

34
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.200
which have of late sohuddled on his back.

35
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.700
Enow to press a royalmerchant down

36
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.530
and pluck commiseration ofhis state

37
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.170
from brassy bosoms andrough hearts of flint,

38
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.370
from stubborn Turks andTartars

39
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.470
never trained to officesof tender courtesy.

40
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.170
We all expect a gentleanswer, Jew.

41
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.770
I have possessed yourgrace of what I purpose,

42
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.800
and by our holy Sabbathhave I sworn

43
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.030
to have the due andforfeit of my bond.

44
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.570
If you deny it,

45
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.900
let the danger light uponyour charter

46
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.800
and your city's freedom.

47
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.600
You'll ask me why I ratherchoose to have

48
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.700
a weight of carrion fleshthan to receive 3,000 ducats.

49
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.800
I'll not answer that.

50
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.000
But say it is my humor, isit answered?

51
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.630
What if my house betroubled with a rat,

52
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.100
and I be pleased to give 10,000ducats to have it baned?

53
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.470
Are you answered yet?

54
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.300
Some men there are lovenot a gaping pig,

55
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.130
some that are mad whenthey behold a cat,

56
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.270
and others, when thebagpipe sings i'th'nose,

57
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.830
cannot contain theirurine.

58
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.830
For affection,

59
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.230
master of passion,

60
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.930
sways it to the mood ofwhat it likes or loathes.

61
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.270
Now, for your answer:

62
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.170
As there is no firm reasonto be rendered

63
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.830
why he cannot abide agaping pig,

64
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.000
why he a harmlessnecessary cat,

65
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.530
why he a woollen bagpipe,

66
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.030
but of force must yield tosuch inevitable shame

67
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.200
as to offend, himselfbeing offended,

68
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.200
so can I give no reason,nor I will not

69
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.770
more than a lodged hateand a certain loathing

70
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230
I bear Antonio

71
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.030
that I follow thus alosing suit against him.

72
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.300
Are you answered?

73
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.600
This is no answer, thouunfeeling man,

74
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.430
to excuse the current ofthy cruelty.

75
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.470
I am not bound to pleasethee with my answers.

76
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.030
Do all men kill the thingthey do not love?

77
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.230
Hates any man the thing hewould not kill?

78
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.770
Every offense is not ahate at first.

79
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.770
What, wouldst thou have aserpent sting thee twice?

80
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.100
I pray you think youquestion with the Jew.

81
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.330
You may as well go standupon the beach

82
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.470
and bid the main floodbate his usual height.

83
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.430
You may as well usequestion with the wolf

84
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.330
why he hath made the ewebleat for the lamb.

85
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
You may as well forbid themountain pines

86
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.900
to wag their high tops andto make no noise

87
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.930
when they are fretten withthe gusts of heaven.

88
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.230
You may as well doanything most hard

89
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.800
as seek to soften that--than which what's harder--

90
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.870
his Jewish heart.

91
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.470
Therefore, I do beseechyou,

92
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.500
make no more offers, useno farther means,

93
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500
but with all brief andplain conveniency,

94
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.330
let me have judgment andthe Jew his will.

95
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.600
For thy 3,000 ducats, hereis 6.

96
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.330
If every ducat in 6,000ducats

97
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.570
were in 6 parts and everypart a ducat,

98
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.570
I would not draw them.

99
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.200
I would have my bond.

100
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.930
How shalt thou hope formercy, rendering none?

101
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.930
What judgment shall Idread, doing no wrong?

102
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.230
No wrong!

103
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.300
You have amongst you manya purchased slave,

104
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.230
which, like your asses andyour dogs and mules,

105
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.300
you use in abject and inslavish parts

106
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.930
because you bought them.

107
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.400
Shall I say to you, "Letthem be free.

108
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.300
"Marry them to your heirs.

109
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.270
"Why sweat they underburdens?

110
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.230
"Let their beds be made assoft as yours.

111
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.430
Let their palates beseasoned with such viands?"

112
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.000
You will answer, "Theslaves are ours."

113
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.300
So do I answer you.

114
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.070
The pound of flesh which Idemand of him is dearly bought.

115
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.000
'Tis mine, and I will haveit.

116
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.700
If you deny me, fie uponyour law.

117
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.470
There is no force in thedecrees of Venice.

118
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.030
I stand for judgment.

119
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.400
Answer!

120
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.030
Shall I have it?

121
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.570
Upon my power, I maydismiss this court,

122
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.600
unless Bellario, a learneddoctor

123
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.670
whom I have sent for todetermine this,

124
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.330
come here today.

125
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.930
My lord, here stayswithout

126
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.670
a messenger with lettersfrom the doctor,

127
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.930
new come from Padua.

128
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.170
Bring us the letters.

129
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.530
Call the messenger.

130
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.530
Good cheer, Antonio.

131
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.030
What, man, courage yet.

132
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.830
The Jew shall have my flesh,blood, bones, and all,

133
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.970
ere thou shalt lose for meone drop of blood.

134
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.930
I am a tainted wether of theflock, meetest for death.

135
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.830
The weakest kind of fruitdrops earliest to the ground,

136
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.570
and so let me.

137
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.300
You cannot better beemployed, Bessanio,

138
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.430
than to live still, andwrite mine epitaph.

139
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.430
Come you from Padua, fromBellario?

140
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.070
From both, my lord.

141
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.230
Bellario greets yourgrace.

142
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.030
Why dost thou whet thyknife so earnestly?

143
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.000
To cut the forfeiture fromthat bankrupt there.

144
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.530
Not on thy sole, but onthy soul, harsh Jew,

145
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.370
thou mak'st thy knifekeen.

146
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.930
But no metal can-- no, notthe hangman's axe--

147
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.670
bear half the keenness ofthy sharp envy.

148
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.130
Can no prayers piercethee?

149
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.900
No, none that thou hastwit enough to make.

150
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.830
Oh, be thou damned,inexecrable dog.

151
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.700
And for thy life, letjustice be accused.

152
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.530
Thou almost mak'st mewaver in my faith

153
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.470
to hold opinion withPythagoras

154
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.570
that souls of animalsinfuse themselves

155
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.130
into the trunks of men.

156
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:39.230
Thy currish spirit governeda wolf, who, hang'd forhuman slaughter,

157
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.870
even from the gallows didhis fell soul fleet,

158
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.000
and while thou layest inthy unhallowed dam,

159
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.670
infused itself in thee.

160
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.470
For thy desires arewolvish, bloody, starved,and ravenous.

161
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.500
Till thou canst rail theseal from off my bond,

162
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.270
thou but offend'st thylungs to speak so loud.

163
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.630
Repair thy wit, goodyouth,

164
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.700
or it will fall tocureless ruin.

165
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.800
I stand here for law.

166
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.370
This letter from Bellariodoth commend

167
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.470
a young and learned doctorto our court.

168
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.870
Where is he?

169
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.200
He attendeth here hard by

170
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.100
to know your answerwhether you'll admit him.

171
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.070
With all my heart.

172
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.630
Some three or four of you

173
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.930
go give him courteousconduct to this place.

174
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.770
Meantime, the court shallhear Bellario's letter.

175
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.300
"Your grace shallunderstand

176
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.770
"that at the receipt of yourletter, I am very sick,

"between the Jew andAntonio the merchant.

182
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.470
"We turned o'er many bookstogether.

183
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.330
"He is furnished with myopinion,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.930
"which, bettered with hisown learning--

185
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.670
"the greatness whereof Icannot enough commend--

187
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.030
"to fill up your grace'srequest in my stead.

188
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.930
"I beseech you let his lackof years be no impediment

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.670
"to let him lack areverend estimation,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:09.100
"for I never knew so younga body with so old a head.

"I leave him to yourgracious acceptance,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.930
whose trial shall betterpublish his commendation."

193
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.900
You hear the learnedBellario what he writes.

194
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.070
And here, I take it, isthe doctor come.

195
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.970
Give me your hand.

196
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.130
Came you from oldBellario?

197
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.300
I did, my lord.

198
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.730
You are welcome; take yourplace.

199
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.000
Are you acquainted withthe difference

200
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.330
that holds the presentquestion in the court?

201
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.930
I am informed throughly ofthe cause.

202
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.700
Which is the merchant hereand which the Jew?

203
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.570
Antonio and old Shylock,both stand forth.

204
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.400
Is your name Shylock?

205
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.270
Shylock is my name.

206
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.970
Of a strange nature isthat suit you follow,

207
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.330
yet in such rule that theVenetian law

208
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.770
cannot impugn you as youdo proceed.

209
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.630
You stand within hisdanger, do you not?

210
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.170
Ay, so he says.

211
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.030
Do you confess the bond?

212
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.200
I do.

213
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.930
Then must the Jew bemerciful.

214
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.270
On what compulsion must I?

215
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.700
Tell me that.

216
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.100
The quality of mercy isnot strained.

217
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.870
It droppeth as the gentlerain from heaven

218
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.400
upon the place beneath.

219
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.330
It is twice blest.

220
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.500
It blesseth him that givesand him that takes.

221
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.430
'Tis mightiest in themightiest.

222
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.100
It becomes the throned monarchbetter than his crown.

223
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.530
His sceptre shows theforce of temporal power,

224
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.270
the attribute to awe andmajesty,

225
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.270
wherein doth sit the dreadand fear of kings.

226
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.570
But mercy is above thissceptred sway.

227
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.130
It is enthroned in thehearts of kings.

228
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.530
It is an attribute to Godhimself.

229
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.370
And earthly power doththen show likest God's

230
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.370
when mercy seasonsjustice.

231
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.330
Therefore, Jew, thoughjustice be thy plea,

232
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.970
consider this that, in thecourse of justice,

233
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.800
none of us should seesalvation.

234
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.530
We do pray for mercy,

235
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.530
and that same prayer dothteach us all

236
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.930
to render the deeds ofmercy.

237
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.000
I have spoke thus much tomitigate the justice ofthy plea.

238
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.430
Which, if thou follow, thisstrict court of Venice

239
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.530
must needs give sentence'gainst the merchant there.

240
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.230
My deeds upon my head.

241
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:54.170
I crave the law, the penaltyand forfeit of my bond.

242
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.830
Is he not able todischarge the money?

243
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.570
Yes, here.

244
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.300
I tender it for him in thecourt.

245
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.100
Yea, twice the sum.

246
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.970
If that will not suffice,I will be bound to pay itten times o'er

247
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.200
on forfeit of my hands, myhead, my heart.

248
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.930
If this will not suffice,

249
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.500
it must appear that malicebears down truth.

250
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.530
And I beseech you,

251
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.030
wrest once the law to yourauthority

252
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.670
to do a great right, do alittle wrong,

253
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.970
and curb this cruel devilof his will.

254
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.530
It must not be.

255
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.970
There is no power inVenice can alter a decreeestablished.

256
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.400
'Twill be recorded for aprecedent,

257
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.200
and many an error by thesame example will rushinto the state.

258
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.400
It cannot be.

259
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.700
A Daniel come to judgment.

260
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.270
Yea, a Daniel.

261
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.670
Oh, wise young judge, howI do honor thee.

262
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.600
I pray you, let me lookupon the bond.

263
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.000
Here 'tis, most reverenddoctor.

264
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.730
Here it is.

265
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.030
Shylock,

266
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.200
there's thrice thy moneyoffered thee.

267
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.070
An oath, an oath, I havean oath in heaven.

268
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.100
Shall I lay perjury uponmy soul?

269
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.330
No, not for Venice.

270
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.530
Why, this bond is forfeit,

271
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.870
and lawfully by this,

272
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.070
the Jew may claim a poundof flesh

273
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.270
to be by him cut off nearestthe merchant's heart.

274
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.500
Be merciful.

275
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.730
Take thrice thy money.

276
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.400
Bid me tear the bond.

277
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.800
When it is paid accordingto the tenor.

278
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.330
It doth appear you are aworthy judge.

279
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.970
You know the law.

280
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.070
Your exposition hath beenmost sound.

281
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.270
I charge you, by the law,

282
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.600
whereof you are awell-deserving pillar,

283
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.730
proceed to judgment.

284
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.800
By my soul, I swear thereis no power in the tongueof man to alter me.

285
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.400
I stay here on my bond.

286
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.370
Most heartily, I dobeseech the court to givethe judgment.

287
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.670
Why then, thus it is.

288
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.100
You must prepare yourbosom for his knife.

289
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.200
Oh, noble judge.

290
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.100
Oh, excellent young man.

291
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.270
For the intent and purposeof the law hath fullrelation to the penalty

292
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.870
which here appeareth dueupon the bond.

293
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.000
'Tis very true.

294
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.400
Oh, wise and uprightjudge.

295
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.300
How much more elder artthou than thy looks.

296
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.370
Therefore, lay bare yourbosom.

297
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.470
Ay, his breast.

298
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.370
So says the bond.

299
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.730
Doth it not, noble judge?

300
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.300
Nearest his heart.

301
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.400
Those are the very words.

302
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.570
It is so.

303
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.600
Are there balance here toweigh the flesh?

304
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.000
I have them ready.

305
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.570
Have by some surgeon,Shylock, on your charge,

306
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.230
to stop his wounds, lesthe do bleed to death?

307
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.900
Is it so nominated in thebond?

308
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.400
It is not so expressed,but what of that?

309
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.800
'Twere good you do so muchfor charity.

310
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.500
I cannot find it.

311
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.830
'Tis not in the bond.

312
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.370
You, merchant, have youanything to say?

313
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.870
But little.

314
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.970
I am armed and wellprepared.

315
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.430
Give me your hand,Bassanio.

316
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.900
Fare you well.

317
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.700
Grieve not that I amfall'n to this for you,

318
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.830
for herein, fortune showsherself more kind than isher custom.

319
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.470
It is still her use to letthe wretched man outlivehis wealth

320
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.370
to view with hollow eyeand wrinkled brow

321
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.100
an age of poverty fromwhich lingering penance

322
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.870
of such misery doth shecut me off.

323
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.970
Commend me to yourhonorable wife.

324
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.100
Tell her the process ofAntonio's end.

325
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.470
Say how I loved you.

326
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.470
Speak me fair in death.

327
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.300
And when the tale is told,

328
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.870
bid her be judge whetherBassanio had not once a love.

329
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.170
Repent but you that youshall lose your friend,

330
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.030
and he repents not that hepays your debt.

331
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.200
For if the Jew do cut butdeep enough,

332
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.900
I'll pay it instantly withall my heart.

333
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.770
Antonio, I am married to awife which is as dear tome as life itself,

334
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.130
but life itself, my wife,and all the world

335
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.870
are not with me esteemedabove thy life.

336
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.870
I would lose all, ay,sacrifice them all

337
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.670
here to this devil, todeliver you.

338
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.700
Your wife would give youlittle thanks for that

339
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.600
if she were by to hear youmake the offer.

340
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.130
I have a wife who Iprotest I love.

341
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.470
I would she were inheaven,

342
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.730
so she could entreat somepower to change thiscurrish Jew.

343
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.570
'Tis well you offer itbehind her back.

344
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.470
The wish would make elsean unquiet house.

345
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.530
These be the Christianhusbands?

346
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.300
I have a daughter.

347
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.830
Would any of the stock ofBarabbas

348
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.330
had been her husbandrather than a Christian.

349
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.000
We trifle time.

350
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.970
I pray thee, pursuesentence.

351
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.100
A pound of that samemerchant's flesh is thine.

352
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.570
The court awards it, andthe law doth give it.

353
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.470
Most rightful judge.

354
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.630
And you must cut thisflesh from off his breast.

355
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.570
The law allows it, and thecourt awards it.

356
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.870
Most learned judge.

357
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.700
A sentence!

358
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.200
Come...

359
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.800
prepare.

360
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.430
Tarry a little; there issomething else.

361
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.200
This bond doth give theehere no jot of blood.

362
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.370
The words expressly are "apound of flesh."

363
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.570
Take then thy bond.

364
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.530
Take thou thy pound offlesh.

365
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.970
But in the cutting of itif thou dost shed one dropof Christian blood,

366
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.800
thy lands and goods are,by the laws of Venice,

367
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.770
confiscate unto the stateof Venice.

368
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.000
Oh, upright judge!

369
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.300
Mark, Jew.

370
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.370
Oh, learned judge.

371
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.470
Is that the law?

372
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.730
Thyself shall see the act.

373
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.100
For, as thou urgestjustice,

374
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.030

375

378
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.270
Pay the bond thrice andlet the Christian go.

379
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.530
Here is the money.

380
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.500
Soft, the Jew shall haveall justice.

381
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.730
Soft, no haste.

382
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.470
He shall have nothing butthe penalty.

383
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.530
Oh, Jew, an upright judge.

384
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.970
A learned judge.

385
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.930
Therefore prepare thee tocut off the flesh.

386
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.170

387
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.930
nor cut thou less nor morebut just a pound of flesh.

388
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.700
If thou tak'st more orless than just a pound,

389
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.500
be it so much as makes it lightor heavy in the substance

390
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.930
or the division of thetwentieth part of onepoor scruple,

391
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.570
nay, if the scale do turn butin the estimation of a hair,

392
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.800

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.100

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.270
A Daniel, Jew.

395
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.500
Now, infidel, I have youon the hip.

396
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.430
Why doth the Jew pause?

397
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.830
Take thy forfeiture.

398
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.170

He hath refused it in theopen court.

402
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.870
He shall have merelyjustice and his bond.

403
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.770
A Daniel still say I, asecond Daniel.

404
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.830
I thank thee, Jew, forteaching me that word.

405
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.670
Shall I not have barely myprincipal?

406

Thou shalt have nothingbut the forfeiture

407
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.400
to be so taken at thyperil, Jew.

408
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.370
Why then, the devil givehim good of it.

409
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.530
I'll stay no longerquestion.

410
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.770
Tarry, Jew, the law hathyet another hold on you.

411
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.800
It is enacted in the lawsof Venice

412
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.030
if it be proved against analien

413
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.400
that by direct or indirectattempts

414
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.600

415
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.570

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.730
shall seize one half hisgoods.

417
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.000
The other half comes to theprivy coffer of the state.

418
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.830
And the offender's lifelies in the mercy of theDuke only

419
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.170
'gainst all other voice.

420
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.300
In which predicament I saythou stand'st,

421
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.200
for it appears by manifestproceedings

422
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.070
that indirectly, anddirectly too,

423
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.000
thou hast contrivedagainst the very life ofthe defendant,

424
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and thou hast incurred thedanger formerly by merehearsed.

425
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.300
Down therefore, and begmercy of the Duke.

426
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.070
Beg that thou mayst haveleave to hang thyself.

427
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.570
And yet, thy wealth beingforfeit to the state,

428
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.670
thou hast not left thevalue of a cord.

429
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.730
Therefore, thou must behanged at the state's charge.

430
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.830
That thou shalt see thedifference of our spirit,

431
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.370
I pardon thee thy lifebefore thou ask it.

432

which humbleness may driveinto a fine.

435
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.030
Ay, for the state, not forAntonio.

436
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.430
Nay, take my life and all.

437
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.070
Pardon not that.

438
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.700
You take my house when youdo take the prop

439
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.700
that doth sustain myhouse.

440
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.600
You take my life when youdo take the means wherebyI live.

441
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.730
What mercy can you renderhim, Antonio?

442
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.030
A halter gratis.

443
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.430
Nothing else, for God'ssake.

444
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:30.700
So please, my lord, theDuke, and all the court,

445
