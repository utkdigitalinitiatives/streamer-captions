00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.100


2
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.770
What, is Antonio here?

3
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.430
Ready, so please your grace.

4
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.770
I am sorry for thee.

5
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.200
Thou art come to answer a stony adversary,

6
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800
an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity,

7
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.430
void and empty from any dram of mercy.

8
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.570
I have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains

9
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.470
to qualify his rigorous course.

10
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.230
But since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means

11
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.830
can carry me out of his envy's reach,

12
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.230
I do oppose my patience to his fury

13
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.570
and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit

14
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.570
the very tyranny and rage of his.

15
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.970
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

16
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.470
He is ready at the door.

17
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.000
He comes, my lord.

18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.070
Make room,

19
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.070
and let him stand before our face.

20
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.500
Shylock,

21
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.600
the world thinks--

22
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.570
and I think so too--

23
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.270
that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice

24
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.000
to the last hour of act,

25
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.330
and then 'tis thought,

26
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.670
thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange

27
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.370
than is thy strange apparent cruelty.

28
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.530
And where thou now exacts the penalty,

29
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.770
which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,

30
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.970
thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,

31
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
but touched with human gentleness and love,

32
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.670
forgive a moiety of the principal,

33
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.130
glancing an eye of pity on his losses

34
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.200
which have of late so huddled on his back.

35
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.700
Enow to press a royal merchant down

36
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.530
and pluck commiseration of his state

37
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.170
from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,

38
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.370
from stubborn Turks and Tartars

39
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.470
never trained to offices of tender courtesy.

40
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.170
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

41
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.770
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose,

42
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.800
and by our holy Sabbath have I sworn

43
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.030
to have the due and forfeit of my bond.

44
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.570
If you deny it,

45
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.900
let the danger light upon your charter

46
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.800
and your city's freedom.

47
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.600
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have

48
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.700
a weight of carrion flesh than to receive 3,000 ducats.

49
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.800
I'll not answer that.

50
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.000
But say it is my humor, is it answered?

51
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.630
What if my house be troubled with a rat,

52
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.100
and I be pleased to give 10,000 ducats to have it baned?

53
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.470
Are you answered yet?

54
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.300
Some men there are love not a gaping pig,

55
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.130
some that are mad when they behold a cat,

56
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.270
and others, when the bagpipe sings i'th'nose,

57
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.830
cannot contain their urine.

58
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.830
For affection,

59
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.230
master of passion,

60
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.930
sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes.

61
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.270
Now, for your answer:

62
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.170
As there is no firm reason to be rendered

63
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.830
why he cannot abide a gaping pig,

64
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.000
why he a harmless necessary cat,

65
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.530
why he a woollen bagpipe,

66
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.030
but of force must yield to such inevitable shame

67
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.200
as to offend, himself being offended,

68
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.200
so can I give no reason, nor I will not

69
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.770
more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing

70
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230
I bear Antonio

71
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.030
that I follow thus a losing suit against him.

72
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.300
Are you answered?

73
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.600
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,

74
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.430
to excuse the current of thy cruelty.

75
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.470
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

76
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.030
Do all men kill the thing they do not love?

77
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.230
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

78
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.770
Every offense is not a hate at first.

79
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.770
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

80
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.100
I pray you think you question with the Jew.

81
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.330
You may as well go stand upon the beach

82
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.470
and bid the main flood bate his usual height.

83
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.430
You may as well use question with the wolf

84
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.330
why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb.

85
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
You may as well forbid the mountain pines

86
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.900
to wag their high tops and to make no noise

87
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.930
when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven.

88
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.230
You may as well do anything most hard

89
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.800
as seek to soften that-- than which what's harder--

90
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.870
his Jewish heart.

91
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.470
Therefore, I do beseech you,

92
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.500
make no more offers, use no farther means,

93
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.500
but with all brief and plain conveniency,

94
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.330
let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

95
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.600
For thy 3,000 ducats, here is 6.

96
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.330
If every ducat in 6,000 ducats

97
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.570
were in 6 parts and every part a ducat,

98
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.570
I would not draw them.

99
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.200
I would have my bond.

100
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.930
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

101
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.930
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

102
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.230
No wrong!

103
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.300
You have amongst you many a purchased slave,

104
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.230
which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

105
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.300
you use in abject and in slavish parts

106
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.930
because you bought them.

107
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.400
Shall I say to you, "Let them be free.

108
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.300
"Marry them to your heirs.

109
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.270
"Why sweat they under burdens?

110
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.230
"Let their beds be made as soft as yours.

111
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.430
Let their palates be seasoned with such viands?"

112
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.000
You will answer, "The slaves are ours."

113
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.300
So do I answer you.

114
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.070
The pound of flesh which I demand of him is dearly bought.

115
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.000
'Tis mine, and I will have it.

116
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.700
If you deny me, fie upon your law.

117
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.470
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

118
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.030
I stand for judgment.

119
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.400
Answer!

120
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.030
Shall I have it?

121
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.570
Upon my power, I may dismiss this court,

122
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.600
unless Bellario, a learned doctor

123
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.670
whom I have sent for to determine this,

124
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.330
come here today.

125
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.930
My lord, here stays without

126
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.670
a messenger with letters from the doctor,

127
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.930
new come from Padua.

128
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.170
Bring us the letters.

129
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.530
Call the messenger.

130
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.530
Good cheer, Antonio.

131
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.030
What, man, courage yet.

132
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.830
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,

133
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.970
ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

134
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.930
I am a tainted wether of the flock, meetest for death.

135
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.830
The weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground,

136
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.570
and so let me.

137
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.300
You cannot better be employed, Bessanio,

138
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.430
than to live still, and write mine epitaph.

139
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.430
Come you from Padua, from Bellario?

140
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.070
From both, my lord.

141
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.230
Bellario greets your grace.

142
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.030
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

143
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.000
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

144
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.530
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,

145
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.370
thou mak'st thy knife keen.

146
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.930
But no metal can-- no, not the hangman's axe--

147
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:12.670
bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy.

148
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.130
Can no prayers pierce thee?

149
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.900
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

150
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.830
Oh, be thou damned, inexecrable dog.

151
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.700
And for thy life, let justice be accused.

152
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.530
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith

153
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.470
to hold opinion with Pythagoras

154
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.570
that souls of animals infuse themselves

155
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.130
into the trunks of men.

156
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:39.230
Thy currish spirit governed a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,

157
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.870
even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,

158
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.000
and while thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,

159
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.670
infused itself in thee.

160
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.470
For thy desires are wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.

161
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.500
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,

162
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.270
thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud.

163
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.630
Repair thy wit, good youth,

164
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.700
or it will fall to cureless ruin.

165
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.800
I stand here for law.

166
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.370
This letter from Bellario doth commend

167
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.470
a young and learned doctor to our court.

168
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.870
Where is he?

169
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.200
He attendeth here hard by

170
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.100
to know your answer whether you'll admit him.

171
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.070
With all my heart.

172
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.630
Some three or four of you

173
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.930
go give him courteous conduct to this place.

174
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.770
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

175
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.300
"Your grace shall understand

176
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.770
"that at the receipt of your letter, I am very sick,

177
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.730
"but in the instant that your messenger came,

178
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.830
"in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome.

179
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.670
"His name is Balthasar.

180
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.800
"I acquainted him with the cause in controversy

181
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.200
"between the Jew and Antonio the merchant.

182
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.470
"We turned o'er many books together.

183
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.330
"He is furnished with my opinion,

184
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.930
"which, bettered with his own learning--

185
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.670
"the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend--

186
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.830
"comes with him at my importunity

187
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.030
"to fill up your grace's request in my stead.

188
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.930
"I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment

189
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.670
"to let him lack a reverend estimation,

190
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:09.100
"for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.

191
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.800
"I leave him to your gracious acceptance,

192
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.930
whose trial shall better publish his commendation."

193
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.900
You hear the learned Bellario what he writes.

194
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.070
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

195
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.970
Give me your hand.

196
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.130
Came you from old Bellario?

197
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.300
I did, my lord.

198
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.730
You are welcome; take your place.

199
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.000
Are you acquainted with the difference

200
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.330
that holds the present question in the court?

201
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.930
I am informed throughly of the cause.

202
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.700
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew?

203
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.570
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

204
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.400
Is your name Shylock?

205
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.270
Shylock is my name.

206
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.970
Of a strange nature is that suit you follow,

207
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.330
yet in such rule that the Venetian law

208
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.770
cannot impugn you as you do proceed.

209
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.630
You stand within his danger, do you not?

210
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.170
Ay, so he says.

211
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.030
Do you confess the bond?

212
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.200
I do.

213
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.930
Then must the Jew be merciful.

214
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:25.270
On what compulsion must I?

215
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.700
Tell me that.

216
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.100
The quality of mercy is not strained.

217
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.870
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

218
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.400
upon the place beneath.

219
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.330
It is twice blest.

220
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.500
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.

221
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.430
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.

222
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.100
It becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.

223
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.530
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,

224
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.270
the attribute to awe and majesty,

225
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.270
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings.

226
00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.570
But mercy is above this sceptred sway.

227
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:04.130
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings.

228
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:07.530
It is an attribute to God himself.

229
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.370
And earthly power doth then show likest God's

230
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.370
when mercy seasons justice.

231
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.330
Therefore, Jew, though justice be thy plea,

232
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.970
consider this that, in the course of justice,

233
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.800
none of us should see salvation.

234
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.530
We do pray for mercy,

235
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.530
and that same prayer doth teach us all

236
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.930
to render the deeds of mercy.

237
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.000
I have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea.

238
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.430
Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice

239
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.530
must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

240
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.230
My deeds upon my head.

241
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:54.170
I crave the law, the penalty and forfeit of my bond.

242
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.830
Is he not able to discharge the money?

243
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.570
Yes, here.

244
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:04.300
I tender it for him in the court.

245
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.100
Yea, twice the sum.

246
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.970
If that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er

247
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.200
on forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.

248
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.930
If this will not suffice,

249
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.500
it must appear that malice bears down truth.

250
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.530
And I beseech you,

251
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.030
wrest once the law to your authority

252
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.670
to do a great right, do a little wrong,

253
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.970
and curb this cruel devil of his will.

254
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.530
It must not be.

255
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.970
There is no power in Venice can alter a decree established.

256
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.400
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,

257
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.200
and many an error by the same example will rush into the state.

258
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.400
It cannot be.

259
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.700
A Daniel come to judgment.

260
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.270
Yea, a Daniel.

261
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.670
Oh, wise young judge, how I do honor thee.

262
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.600
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

263
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.000
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor.

264
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.730
Here it is.

265
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.030
Shylock,

266
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:58.200
there's thrice thy money offered thee.

267
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.070
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven.

268
00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.100
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

269
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.330
No, not for Venice.

270
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.530
Why, this bond is forfeit,

271
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.870
and lawfully by this,

272
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.070
the Jew may claim a pound of flesh

273
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.270
to be by him cut off nearest the merchant's heart.

274
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.500
Be merciful.

275
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.730
Take thrice thy money.

276
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.400
Bid me tear the bond.

277
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.800
When it is paid according to the tenor.

278
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.330
It doth appear you are a worthy judge.

279
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.970
You know the law.

280
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.070
Your exposition hath been most sound.

281
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.270
I charge you, by the law,

282
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.600
whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,

283
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.730
proceed to judgment.

284
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.800
By my soul, I swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me.

285
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.400
I stay here on my bond.

286
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.370
Most heartily, I do beseech the court to give the judgment.

287
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.670
Why then, thus it is.

288
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.100
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

289
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.200
Oh, noble judge.

290
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.100
Oh, excellent young man.

291
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.270
For the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty

292
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.870
which here appeareth due upon the bond.

293
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.000
'Tis very true.

294
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.400
Oh, wise and upright judge.

295
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.300
How much more elder art thou than thy looks.

296
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.370
Therefore, lay bare your bosom.

297
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.470
Ay, his breast.

298
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.370
So says the bond.

299
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.730
Doth it not, noble judge?

300
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.300
Nearest his heart.

301
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.400
Those are the very words.

302
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.570
It is so.

303
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.600
Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?

304
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.000
I have them ready.

305
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.570
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,

306
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.230
to stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death?

307
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.900
Is it so nominated in the bond?

308
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.400
It is not so expressed, but what of that?

309
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.800
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

310
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.500
I cannot find it.

311
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.830
'Tis not in the bond.

312
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.370
You, merchant, have you anything to say?

313
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.870
But little.

314
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:53.970
I am armed and well prepared.

315
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.430
Give me your hand, Bassanio.

316
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.900
Fare you well.

317
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:07.700
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you,

318
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:12.830
for herein, fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom.

319
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.470
It is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth

320
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.370
to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow

321
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.100
an age of poverty from which lingering penance

322
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.870
of such misery doth she cut me off.

323
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.970
Commend me to your honorable wife.

324
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.100
Tell her the process of Antonio's end.

325
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.470
Say how I loved you.

326
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.470
Speak me fair in death.

327
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.300
And when the tale is told,

328
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.870
bid her be judge whether Bassanio had not once a love.

329
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.170
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,

330
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.030
and he repents not that he pays your debt.

331
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.200
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,

332
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.900
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.

333
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.770
Antonio, I am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself,

334
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.130
but life itself, my wife, and all the world

335
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.870
are not with me esteemed above thy life.

336
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.870
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all

337
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.670
here to this devil, to deliver you.

338
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.700
Your wife would give you little thanks for that

339
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.600
if she were by to hear you make the offer.

340
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.130
I have a wife who I protest I love.

341
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.470
I would she were in heaven,

342
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:18.730
so she could entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

343
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.570
'Tis well you offer it behind her back.

344
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.470
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

345
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:26.530
These be the Christian husbands?

346
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:32.300
I have a daughter.

347
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.830
Would any of the stock of Barabbas

348
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.330
had been her husband rather than a Christian.

349
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.000
We trifle time.

350
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.970
I pray thee, pursue sentence.

351
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.100
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.

352
00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.570
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

353
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.470
Most rightful judge.

354
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.630
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.

355
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.570
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

356
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.870
Most learned judge.

357
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.700
A sentence!

358
00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.200
Come...

359
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.800
prepare.

360
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.430
Tarry a little; there is something else.

361
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.200
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.

362
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.370
The words expressly are "a pound of flesh."

363
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.570
Take then thy bond.

364
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.530
Take thou thy pound of flesh.

365
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:11.970
But in the cutting of it if thou dost shed one drop of Christian blood,

366
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.800
thy lands and goods are, by the laws of Venice,

367
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.770
confiscate unto the state of Venice.

368
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.000
Oh, upright judge!

369
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.300
Mark, Jew.

370
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.370
Oh, learned judge.

371
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.470
Is that the law?

372
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:28.730
Thyself shall see the act.

373
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.100
For, as thou urgest justice,

374
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.030
be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.

375
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:35.330
Oh, learned judge.

376
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.130
Mark, Jew, a learned judge.

377
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.430
I take this offer then.

378
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.270
Pay the bond thrice and let the Christian go.

379
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.530
Here is the money.

380
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.500
Soft, the Jew shall have all justice.

381
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.730
Soft, no haste.

382
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.470
He shall have nothing but the penalty.

383
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:56.530
Oh, Jew, an upright judge.

384
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:57.970
A learned judge.

385
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.930
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.

386
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.170
Shed thou no blood,

387
00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.930
nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh.

388
00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.700
If thou tak'st more or less than just a pound,

389
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.500
be it so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance

390
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.930
or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple,

391
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.570
nay, if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair,

392
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:25.800
thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.

393
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.100
A second Daniel.

394
00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.270
A Daniel, Jew.

395
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.500
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

396
00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.430
Why doth the Jew pause?

397
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:35.830
Take thy forfeiture.

398
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.170
Give me my principal and let me go.

399
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.400
I have it ready for thee.

400
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.570
Here it is.

401
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.170
He hath refused it in the open court.

402
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:01.870
He shall have merely justice and his bond.

403
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.770
A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel.

404
00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:06.830
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

405
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.670
Shall I not have barely my principal?

406
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.500
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture

407
00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.400
to be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

408
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.370
Why then, the devil give him good of it.

409
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.530
I'll stay no longer question.

410
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.770
Tarry, Jew, the law hath yet another hold on you.

411
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.800
It is enacted in the laws of Venice

412
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.030
if it be proved against an alien

413
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.400
that by direct or indirect attempts

414
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.600
he seek the life of any citizen,

415
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.570
the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive

416
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:51.730
shall seize one half his goods.

417
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:56.000
The other half comes to the privy coffer of the state.

418
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.830
And the offender's life lies in the mercy of the Duke only

419
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.170
'gainst all other voice.

420
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.300
In which predicament I say thou stand'st,

421
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.200
for it appears by manifest proceedings

422
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.070
that indirectly, and directly too,

423
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.000
thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant,

424
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and thou hast incurred the danger formerly by me rehearsed.

425
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.300
Down therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.

426
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.070
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself.

427
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.570
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,

428
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.670
thou hast not left the value of a cord.

429
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:45.730
Therefore, thou must be hanged at the state's charge.

430
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.830
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,

431
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.370
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.

432
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:55.130
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's.

433
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.400
The other half comes to the general state

434
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.770
which humbleness may drive into a fine.

435
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.030
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

436
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.430
Nay, take my life and all.

437
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.070
Pardon not that.

438
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:13.700
You take my house when you do take the prop

439
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.700
that doth sustain my house.

440
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.600
You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live.

441
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.730
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

442
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.030
A halter gratis.

443
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.430
Nothing else, for God's sake.

444
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:30.700
So please, my lord, the Duke, and all the court,

445
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.130
to quit the fine for one half of his goods,

446
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.470
I am content.

447
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.930
So he will let me have the other half in use,

448
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.700
to render it upon his death unto the gentleman

449
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.230
that lately stole his daughter.

450
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.900
Two things provided more:

451
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:50.330
that for this favor, he presently become a Christian.

452
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.730
The other, that he do record a gift

453
00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.470
here in the court of all he dies possessed

454
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.400
unto his son, Lorenzo, and his daughter.

455
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.200
He shall do this, or else I do recant

456
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.700
the pardon I late pronounced here.

457
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.870
Art thou contented, Jew?

458
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.000
What dost thou say?

459
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.200
I am content.

460
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.930
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

461
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:03.170
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.

462
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.130
I am not well.

463
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.800
Send the deed after me, and I will sign it.

464
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.930
Get thee gone, but do it.

465
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.430
In christening, thou shalt have two godfathers.

466
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:37.400
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more

467
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.900
to bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.

468
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.700
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

469
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.130
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon.

470
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.830
I must away this night toward Padua,

471
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.930
and it is meet I presently set forth.

472
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.170
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.

473
00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:09.970
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,

474
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.970
for in my mind, you are much bound to him.

475
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.270
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend have, by your wisdom,

476
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.900
been this day acquitted of grievous penalties.

477
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.370
in lieu whereof 3,000 ducats, due unto the Jew,

478
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.000
we freely cope your courteous pains withal.

479
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.100
And stand indebted, over and above,

480
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.730
in love and service to you evermore.

481
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:40.930
He is well paid that is well satisfied.

482
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.630
And I, delivering you, am satisfied

483
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.430
and therein do account myself well paid.

484
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.270
My mind was never yet more mercenary.

485
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.330
I pray you know me when we meet again.

486
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.000
I wish you well, so I take my leave.

487
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.070
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.

488
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.630
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, not as fee.

489
00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.500
Grant me two things, I pray:

490
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.200
not to deny me, and to pardon me.

491
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.100
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.

492
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.370
Give me your gloves.

493
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.370
I'll wear them for your sake.

494
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.200
And for your love, I'll take this ring from you.

495
00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.630
Do not draw back your hand.

496
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.500
I'll take no more, and you, in love, cannot deny me this.

497
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.770
This ring, good sir?

498
00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.270
Alack, it is a trifle.

499
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.130
I will not shame myself to give you this.

500
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.830
I will have nothing else but only this.

501
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:27.530
And now methinks I have a mind to it.

502
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.730
There's more depends on this than on the value.

503
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.900
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you

504
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.630
and find it out by proclamation.

505
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.270
Only for this, I pray you pardon me.

506
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:38.930
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.

507
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.800
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks you teach me

508
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.230
how a beggar should be answered.

509
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.570
This ring, good sir, was given me by my wife.

510
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.000
And when she put it on, she made me vow

511
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.030
I should neither sell nor lose nor give it.

512
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.070
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts,

513
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.900
and if your wife be not a madwoman

514
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.230
and know how well I have deserved this ring,

515
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:04.330
she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me.

516
00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.330
Well, peace be with you.

517
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:11.100
My lord, Bassanio, let him have the ring.

518
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.870
Let his deserving, and my love withal

519
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.430
be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.

520
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.170
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him.

521
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.470
Give him the ring.

522
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.570
Bring him, if thou canst, unto Antonio's house.

523
00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.300
Away, make haste.

524
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.600
Come, you and I will thither presently,

525
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.900
and in the morning early, we will both fly toward Belmont.

526
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.330
Come, Antonio.

527
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.700
Inquire the Jew's house out.

528
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:10.800
Give him this deed; let him sign it.

529
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.470
We'll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home.

530
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.730
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

531
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:16.800
Fair sir!

532
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:20.300
You are well o'erta'en.

533
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.970
My lord, Bassanio, upon more advice,

534
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.930
hath sent you here this ring

535
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.100
and doth entreat your company at dinner.

536
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.030
That cannot be.

537
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.370
His ring I do accept most thankfully, and so I pray you tell him.

538
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:36.070
Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.

539
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.570
That will I do.

540
00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.870
Sir, I would speak with you.

541
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.670
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,

542
00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:45.870
which I did make him swear to keep forever.

543
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.270
Thou mayst, I warrant.

544
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.600
We shall have old swearing

545
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.630
that they did give the rings away to men.

546
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.630
But we'll outface them and outswear them too.

547
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.630
Away, make haste.

548
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.670
Thou know'st where I will tarry.

549
00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.100
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

550
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.770
