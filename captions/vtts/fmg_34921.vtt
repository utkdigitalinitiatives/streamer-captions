00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Narrator:
 THE AMERICAN FAMILY.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
IT'S SURE A LOT DIFFERENT
 THAN IT USED TO BE.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I WOULDN'T SAY ANDY'S
THE MOST RESPONSIBLE FATHER,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
BUT HE'S FINE.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Narrator:
 TODAY, A LOOK
 AT ONE MODERN FAMILY.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Woman:
 THIS HOUSE THAT WE LIVE IN
 WAS ANDY'S HOUSE,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
AND THE BOYS
AND I FELT

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
A LITTLE BIT LIKE
WE WERE GUESTS.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I GET TO WATCH
A WRESTLING GAME KIND OF.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Narrator:
 AND NEW INSIGHTS INTO WHAT
 IT MEANS TO BE A STEPPARENT.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
MY SORT OF RULE
OF THUMB, WHICH I GET
ENORMOUS HASSLE ABOUT,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
IS, AS A STEPPARENT,
YOU CAN BE A GOOD HOST
AND FRIEND, AND THAT'S IT.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I THINK IT MAY BE
THAT YOU WISH SO MUCH

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
YOU COULD GET CLOSE...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Narrator:
 "BRAZELTON ON PARENTING."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
OVER THE LAST GENERATION,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
OUR DEFINITION
OF THE WORD "FAMILY"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
SURE, THERE'S STILL
THE TRADITIONAL NOTION

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
OF MOM, DAD, AND THE KIDS,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
BUT OUR HIGH RATE
OF DIVORCE, FOR ONE,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
HAS TRANSFORMED THE STRUCTURE
OF THE FAMILY FOREVER.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
TODAY, WE'RE GOING TO
EXPLORE THE NEW FAMILY

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
AND START BY LOOKING
THROUGH THE EYES OF PARENTS

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
WHO'VE DISCOVERED
NEW MEANING

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
TO THE PHRASE,
"HAPPILY EVER AFTER."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Brazelton:
 A PORTRAIT OF OUR NEW FAMILY.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
THIS IS WHERE THEY LIVE,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
AND THIS IS
 WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
JIMMY, AGE 12,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
LILLY, 11,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
BILLY, 9,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
TWINS SUMMER
 AND HANNAH, 8,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
HATTIE, 2 1/2.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Boy:
 YOU GUYS, DO YOU
 WANT TO PLAY?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
THERE'S NOT A DAY
GOES BY THAT ANDY AND I
DON'T SAY TO EACH OTHER,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
"ARE WE THE LUCKIEST
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD?"

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Brazelton:
 NANCY AND ANDY,
 BOTH DIVORCED,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
ACTUALLY MET
 THROUGH THEIR KIDS
 ON A SKI TRIP.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Nancy: HE WAS PULLING OUT
 RAW BROCCOLI FROM HIS
 BACKPACK AT A SKI LODGE.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
EVERYBODY WAS HAVING HOT
CHOCOLATE, AND HIS DAUGHTER'S
WERE EATING RAW BROCCOLI.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Andy:
 THAT'S SORT OF
 HOW WE MET.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
( overlapping dialogue )

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Brazelton:
 THEIR FIRST DATE WAS,
 WELL, UNUSUAL.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Nancy:
 WE WENT ON OUR FIRST DATE,
 AND HE ACTUALLY TOOK NOTES.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I'VE GOT THESE CUTE
LITTLE GIRLS,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
AND I WANT TO MAKE
SURE THEY'RE GETTING
GOOD QUALITY CARE.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I WAS A PRETTY TOUGH
INTERVIEWER.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Brazelton:
 IT WAS A LITTLE MORE
 RELAXED FOR THE KIDS.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Nancy:
 THEY'RE THE ONES WHO KNEW
 EACH OTHER FROM SCHOOL.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
IT WASN'T LIKE
 THEY WERE STRANGERS.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Brazelton:
 THINGS PROGRESSED QUICKLY.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Nancy:
 WE KNEW WE WERE
 GETTING MARRIED.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
THE KIDS THOUGHT WE
 WOULD GET MARRIED, TOO,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
BUT THEY WOULD SAY,
 "DON'T GET MARRIED."

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
THE BOYS WOULD SAY
"I DON'T LIKE THE GIRLS,"

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
AND THE GIRLS WOULD SAY,
"I DON'T LIKE THE BOYS."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Andy:
 ONE MORNING, WE GOT THE TWO
 OLDEST, LILLY AND JIMMY,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND I JUST SAID,
 "I'M GOING TO TELL
 YOU TWO A SECRET.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
DON'T TELL THE LITTLE ONES.
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
WE DIDN'T TELL THEM
 WE WERE GOING TO DO IT
 IN ABOUT 36 HOURS.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
AND THE KIDS ALL THOUGHT
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Brazelton:
 AND ONCE THE DUST SETTLED?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Nancy:
 WE HEAR SOME FRIENDS
 TALK ABOUT

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
THAT STEPSIBLINGS DON'T
 GET ALONG REAL WELL AND--

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Andy:
 THEY REALLY, YOU KNOW,
 DO SEEM TO GET ALONG.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Nancy:
 THEY DO, AND HERE WE HAVE

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
SOME NORMAL
 SIBLING RELATIONSHIPS

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
WHERE IT'S REALLY

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
THE BOYS DO
MOST OF THE FIGHTING,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH
WITH EACH OTHER.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
ONCE IN A WHILE,
 THEY TEASE THE GIRLS,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
BUT THE GIRLS WILL TEASE
 THEM RIGHT BACK.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Andy: AND THEN THE BABY,
 HATTIE, HAS REALLY BROUGHT
 EVERYONE TOGETHER.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Nancy:
 SHE IS A GREAT JOY.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I DIDN'T EXPECT
 TO BE DOING THIS
 AT 44 YEARS OLD.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
HATTIE WAS BORN
JUST FOUR MONTHS EARLY.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
SHE WAS ONLY
A POUND AND A HALF.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Nancy:
 EVERYBODY JUST REALLY GATHERS
 AROUND THIS LITTLE KID,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
AND, YOU KNOW,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
SHE'S AN INTEGRAL PART
OF EVERYBODY'S LIFE,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
AND I THINK THAT SORT OF
MADE EVERYBODY FEEL CLOSER.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
THE BOYS--
 ONE OF THE NICER THINGS

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
FOR ME
 WITH HAVING HATTIE

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IS SEEING SUCH A DIFFERENT
 SIDE TO THEM.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
IT'S ALL OF A SUDDEN
A VERY GENTLE,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
VERY NICE SIDE.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Andy:
 THEY REFER TO EACH OTHER
 AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Nancy:
 WE NEVER HEAR "STEPBROTHER"
 OR "STEPSISTER."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
IT'S ALWAYS "MY SISTER,"
"MY BROTHER."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL TALK ABOUT,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
YOU KNOW,
ANDY IS THE STEPFATHER
AND I'M THE STEPMOTHER,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
BUT THEY TALK
ABOUT EACH OTHER
AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Brazelton:
 NANCY AND ANDY ARE
 SENSITIVE STEPPARENTS.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
ANYBODY CAN HAVE
A BOO-BOO.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Nancy:
TO ME, THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IS WALKING THAT LINE

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
WHERE YOU DON'T WANT TO
OVERSTEP YOUR BOUNDARIES,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
YOU KNOW,
WITH DISCIPLINE.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
WALK IT OFF.
YOU'RE DONE.
GOOD JOB, SUMMER.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Nancy:
FORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW,
WITH THE GIRLS,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
THEY'RE
REALLY GOOD KIDS,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I DON'T NEED TO
DISCIPLINE THEM.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
GOOD!  GOOD!
( laughs )

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Nancy:
 I DON'T WANT TO
 PUSH MYSELF,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
BECAUSE I KNOW
 THEY HAVE A MOTHER.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I CHERISH ALL THOSE
MOMENTS WITH THEM.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
I CAN BE A FRIEND
 TO THEM, TOO.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I THINK IT'S MAYBE
 NOT AS INTENSE

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
AS A MOTHER-DAUGHTER
 RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I LOVE THEM

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
AND HOPE THAT
THEY LOVE ME.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Andy:
 THE BOYS, THEY'VE GOT
 A GREAT DAD.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I DON'T TAKE THE ACTIVE
ROLE WITH THE BOYS

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
AS A FATHER FIGURE.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I'M JUST A ROLE MODEL.
 THEY SEE A GUY THAT
 GETS UP EARLY,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
WORKS HARD, WORKS LATE.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Nancy:
 ON THE WEEKENDS,
 WE'VE GOT TO DO THE CHORES

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
BEFORE WE CAN
GO OUT AND PLAY.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
BUT WHEN WE PLAY,
WE PLAY.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Brazelton:
 NOW HE'S GOT BOYS,
 AND SHE'S GOT DAUGHTERS--

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
A DREAM, BUT CHAOS.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
TRYING TO GET
FIVE LUNCHES READY,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
WITH A BABY
IN THE BACKGROUND,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
AND MAKE SURE
 WE HAVE FIVE FRUITS

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
AND VEGETABLES APIECE,
 YOU KNOW, FOR--

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
THAT'S 35 PIECES
OF FRUIT A DAY.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
THAT'S A LOT OF FRUIT.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
COME ON, TROOPS.
WE'RE GOING FOR THE PICNIC.
LET'S ROLL.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
WHOO!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Andy:
 WE'RE GOING TO GET
 EIGHT PEOPLE ON SEVEN BIKES,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
 FOR A THREE-MILE BIKE RIDE.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
AND HOPEFULLY
THE SALAMI WON'T FALL
OUT OF THE KNAPSACK,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
AND WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO SAY
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
THAT WE HAVE FOR THE DAY.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Brazelton:
 THERE IT IS AGAIN--
 THEY FEEL LUCKY.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Andy:
 WE'RE THE KIND OF--
 THE HALF-FULL GLASS.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Nancy:
 WE BOTH LOOK AT THINGS
 AS THE GLASS IS HALF-FULL.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I THINK IF I HAD STOPPED
 TO THINK MAYBE ABOUT

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
ALL THE PROBLEMS,
 THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
MAYBE IT WOULD
HAVE GIVEN PAUSE,
BUT I DON'T THINK SO.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I MEAN,
THE JOY I HAVE,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
BEING WITH HIM,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
IS WORTH ANY TRIAL
AND TRIBULATION.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
( singing )

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Nancy:
 I DON'T LOOK AT THEM
 AS "MY BOYS"

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
AND THEN "HIS GIRLS."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I LOOK AT THEM
 AS "OUR CHILDREN."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Brazelton:
 IT ALL COMES TOGETHER

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
WHEN THEY ALL
 COME TOGETHER.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
SITTING AROUND
THE DINING ROOM TABLE
IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES--

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
WHEN WE'VE GOT
ALL THE KIDS THERE.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
JUST WATCHING THEM
SO ANIMATED AND HAVING
A GOOD TIME,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AND SHARING THEIR DAY.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
AND THEY'VE GOT,
 YOU KNOW, SO MANY PEOPLE

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
THAT THEY CAN PICK
 AND CHOOSE FROM,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
WHO THEY WANT TO
 SHARE SOMETHING WITH.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Nancy:
 HERE WE GO...

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Andy:
 I JUST LOVE NANCY--
 WHEN I COME HOME FROM WORK,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
THAT THE MEALS
 THAT SHE HAS PREPARED--

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
TO ME, THAT JUST
SAYS IT ALL.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
AND I JUST LOVE
A BIG DINING ROOM TABLE
FILLED WITH... EVERYONE.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
TO ME, THAT'S
THE NAME OF THE GAME.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
JUST SHARING YOUR LIFE.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I'D BE VERY LONELY
IF I DIDN'T HAVE ANDY,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
THE KIDS.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
IT'S MY PLEASURE
TO INTRODUCE

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
THE DANCING
GRANT GIRLS.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
LEADING THE WAY
IS SUMMER GRANT.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
WOULD YOU PLEASE
COME UP, SUMMER GRANT?
FOLLOWED BY...

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Brazelton:
 WHAT MAKES THE NEW
 FAMILY WORK?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
- IT'S THE SAME OLD THING.
- I'LL TAKE BABY HATTIE GRANT.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Nancy:
 I THINK OUR FAMILY IS SPECIAL

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE
JUST NUTS ABOUT EACH OTHER,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
AND I THINK
THE KIDS SEE THAT,
AND HOPEFULLY--

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT DIVORCE ANYWAY,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
AND YOU THINK,
"HAVE I RUINED THEIR LIVES?"

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
AND I HOPE THAT THEY
 CAN SEE, YOU KNOW,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
WHAT A TERRIFIC
 MARRIAGE IS LIKE,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
AND THAT I HOPE
 WE'RE MODELING

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
WHAT LOVE IS.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
HAPPILY EVER AFTER--

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I USED TO THINK
OF IT AS AN IDEAL,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
BUT NOW, TO ME,
IT'S JUST REALITY.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
THIS IS
 "HAPPILY EVER AFTER."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
( cheering )

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000

CRYSTAL, IT'S ALMOST AS IF
WE WERE TRYING TO FIND

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
NEW WAYS TO BECOME
FAMILIES TODAY.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
THERE ARE SO MANY
NONTRADITIONAL FAMILIES,
AND THEY NEED HELP.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
THERE ARE GOOD RESOURCES
ON THE INTERNET

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES
OF FAMILY SITUATIONS.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
WE'RE GOING LOOK
 AT ONE SITE TODAY

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
CALLED "THE STEPPARENTING
 CONNECTION,"

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
AND THIS SITE PROVIDES
 GOOD INFORMATION

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
FOR PARENTS WHO
 ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
THE DIFFERENT ROLES
 THAT THEY MAY PLAY
 AS A STEPPARENT.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
YOU CAN SEE THAT
 THERE'S INFORMATION

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
LIKE SHARING WEDDING PLANS

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
OR EVEN GUIDELINES FOR BUILDING
 STRONGER STEPFAMILIES.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
THEY ALSO HAVE
 A BULLETIN BOARD.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
ON THIS BULLETIN BOARD,
 YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
QUESTIONS THAT
 HAVE BEEN ASKED

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000

SOME OF THE TOPICS INCLUDE
 STEPPARENTING SUPPORT,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
DEALING WITH THE EX,
 OR EVEN BEING ENGAGED

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000

IT'S SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

OUR INTERNET
QUESTION TODAY

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
COMES FROM JENNY
IN KOHLER, WISCONSIN.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
HER QUESTION READS,
 "MY STEPSON IS SEVEN YEARS OLD

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
AND IS USED TO HIS FATHER'S
 UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
 WHEN HE VISITS US.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
MY HUSBAND AND I RECENTLY
 HAD A DAUGHTER OF OUR OWN,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
AND WE ARE CONCERNED
 ABOUT HOW HER ARRIVAL

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
WILL AFFECT
 OUR FAMILY DYNAMICS.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
HOW CAN WE MAKE
 THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD FEEL
 A PART OF THE NEW FAMILY?"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
WHAT A GREAT QUESTION.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
IT SHOWS THE PASSION
THAT YOU HAVE, TO TRY TO
INCORPORATE THIS LITTLE BOY.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
HE'LL FEEL THAT.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
RESPECT HIS FEELINGS

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE
HE'S LOST HIS FATHER.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
HE HASN'T A PLACE
IN THE FAMILY ANYMORE,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
AND IT'S GOING
TO TAKE TIME.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'D DO?
I'D USE THE BABY

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
AS YOUR LINE
OF COMMUNICATION.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
BABIES ARE JUST
SO EXCITING

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
FOR SOMEBODY WHO
CAN UNDERSTAND THEM.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
THIS LITTLE BOY MIGHT LEARN
HOW TO DIAPER THE BABY,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
FEED THE BABY,
WATCH THE BABY
LEARN TO DEVELOP.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
AND IF HE DOES,
HE'LL FEEL LIKE PART
OF THE FAMILY.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
BABIES ARE MAGICAL.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000

OVER HALF THE CHILDREN
IN THE U.S.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
ARE LIVING
IN STEPFAMILIES TODAY.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
WITH ME TODAY IS
DR. JOY BROWNE,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
PSYCHOLOGIST, AUTHOR,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
HOST OF HER OWN RADIO
AND TELEVISION SHOW,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
AND SHE TALKS
TO LOTS OF PARENTS.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
JOY, WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO BE A STEPPARENT?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WELL, I'M NOT
A STEPPARENT,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
BUT I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST
WHO DEALS WITH THIS A LOT,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
AS YOU POINT OUT,
STATISTICALLY.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
MY SORT OF RULE OF THUMB,
WHICH I GET ENORMOUS
HASSLE ABOUT,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
IS, AS A STEPPARENT,
YOU CAN BE A GOOD HOST
AND FRIEND, AND THAT'S IT.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
THINK ABOUT THE THINGS
YOU REMEMBER MOST
FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
IT WAS NOT YOUR PARENT
BEING A WARDEN
OR A DISCIPLINARIAN.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
IT WAS GUIDING YOU,
SPENDING TIME WITH YOU,
BEING A FRIEND TO YOU.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I'M NOT CERTAINLY
SUGGESTING THAT PARENTS

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
SHOULDN'T TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR SETTING STRUCTURE,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
BUT THE DISCIPLINARY
FUNCTION OF PARENT

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
HAS TO BE WITH
THE BIOLOGICAL PARENT,
NOT WITH THE STEPPARENT,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
BECAUSE, OTHERWISE,
THE CHILD WILL SAY,
QUITE LEGITIMATELY,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
"YOU'RE NOT MY PARENT."

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
WELL, YOUR BRINGING UP
THE ISSUE OF DISCIPLINE
IS THE PROBLEM,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
AND, YET, I THINK IT MAY BE
THAT YOU WISH SO MUCH

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
YOU COULD GET CLOSE
TO THAT STEPCHILD

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
AND GIVE 'EM WHAT YOU
FEEL LIKE THEY'VE LOST

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
WHEN THEIR
REAL PARENT LEFT.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
- WHAT YOU VALUE
  IS THE TIME SPENT.
- SURE.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
YOU, AS A STEPPARENT, CAN
SPEND TIME WITH THAT CHILD

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
WITHOUT SAYING:
"HAVE YOU DONE
YOUR HOMEWORK?"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
"FINISH YOUR MEAL,"
"DON'T TALK TO
YOUR MOTHER THAT WAY,"

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
"DON'T HIT YOUR
BROTHER OR SISTER."

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AGAIN, I THINK
MOST OF US--

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
AND I WOULD CERTAINLY
INCLUDE MYSELF IN THIS--

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
CONFUSE THE ROLE
OF PARENT WITH THAT OF

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
THE ONE WHO HAS
TO TELL A CHILD

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
WHEN THEY'RE
DOING SOMETHING WRONG,
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
WHEN THEY'RE DOING
SOMETHING RIGHT

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
IS WHEN IT
REALLY MATTERS.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
AND I'LL BET THE STEPPARENT
IS ALWAYS FEELING

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
A COMPETITIVE FEELING

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
FOR THAT PARENT
THAT'S ABSENT,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
AND THE SORT OF GATEKEEPING--
"I'VE GOT TO BE BETTER
THAN THAT PERSON."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I THINK THAT'S A VERY
MALE POINT OF VIEW.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I THINK THAT'S SORT OF
A COMPETITIVE THING,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
IF I SOMEHOW HAVE TO
COMPETE WITH THIS PERSON
WHO'S NOT HERE.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
IT'S NOT COMPETING FOR
THE CHILD'S ATTENTION.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
IT'S COMPETING FOR
THE MOTHER'S ATTENTION--

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
"HEY, AM I
A BETTER HUSBAND?"

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT EXISTS, BUT IT'S
MISDIRECTED, IT'S PROJECTED.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I WONDER IF THERE ISN'T,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
IN THE BACK OF EVERY
STEPPARENT'S MIND,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
"I'M NOT THIS CHILD'S
REAL PARENT.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
I CAN'T REALLY KNOW HER."

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
IF I HAD A NICKEL
FOR EVERY PARENT WHO SAID,
"MY KID TELLS ME EVERYTHING,"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AND THE KID SAYS,
"I DON'T TELL
MY PARENTS ANYTHING--"

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I THINK THAT NOTION

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
OF CLOSENESS
AND INTIMACY

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
IS SOMEWHAT OF AN ILLUSION
ON THE PARENT'S PART.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
THEREFORE, WE FEEL THAT
THEY'RE A REFLECTION ON US,
WHICH THEY ARE NOT.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
THEY'RE A REFLECTION
ON THEMSELVES.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
IT'S A MUCH MORE LIMITED
AND MUCH MORE PERVASIVE ROLE

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
THAN WE THINK
OF IT AS BEING.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
TO BE A GOOD PARENT IS
NOT TO FORM THAT CHILD.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
IT'S TO NURTURE THAT CHILD,
TO LOVE THAT CHILD,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
TO HELP THAT CHILD
FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
SO THE ROLE OF STEPPARENT,
WHEN WE GET THAT DEFINITION,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
BECOMES VERY EASY
BECAUSE THE ROLE IS

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
TO MAKE THAT CHILD FEEL
WELCOME, WHICH IS A GOOD
HOSTESS OR GOOD HOST,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
AND TO FEEL VALUABLE,
WHICH IS A GOOD FRIEND.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
BUT STILL,
PARENTS SAY TO ME,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
"I WANT TO LOVE
HER AS MUCH

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
AS I DO
MY OWN CHILDREN."

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
THAT DRIVES ME CRAZY,
LIKE SOMEHOW YOU COULD
MEASURE LOVE ON A SCALE.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
WE DON'T LOVE
OUR CHILDREN THE SAME.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
WE DON'T LOVE
TWO CHILDREN THE SAME.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
WE MAY LOVE THEM
THE SAME, WHATEVER
THAT MESSY WORD MEANS.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
WE DON'T FEEL THE SAME
ABOUT OUR BOY CHILDREN
AND OUR GIRL CHILDREN.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
WE DON'T FEEL THE SAME
WAY ABOUT OUR OLDEST
AND OUR YOUNGEST.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
WHY SHOULD WE
FEEL THE SAME ABOUT
ANY TWO HUMAN BEINGS?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I THINK THAT'S
A MISTAKEN NOTION.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
WE GET VERY GOOEY
WITH THAT "L" WORD.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE SAYING,
"DON'T TRY SO HARD

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
TO BE THE SAME
WITH YOUR OWN CHILDREN
AND STEPCHILDREN."

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I'M SAYING BE THE BEST
PERSON YOU CAN BE

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
TO EVERYBODY YOU RUN INTO,
INCLUDING THOSE
IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
THAT'S VERY FEMALE.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
- WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
  IT'S BRILLIANT.
- I SEE.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR, WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Man:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
MY NAME IS JANET.
I'M A SINGLE MOM
OF A FIVE-YEAR-OLD BOY.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I'M BASICALLY
 HIS ONLY CAREGIVER.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
SO IT'S VERY STRESSFUL.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
HE GOES THROUGH
DIFFERENT PHASES.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
HE'S GOING THROUGH
THAT PHASE AGAIN

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
WHERE ON THE WAY OUT
THE DOOR, RUNNING LATE,
HE ACTS UP,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
AND I DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH DISCIPLINE BECAUSE
WE'RE GOING TO MISS THE BUS.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
AND WE'RE IN THE SUPERMARKET
AND IT'S THE END OF THE DAY.
HE'S TIRED AND HUNGRY.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
THE FOOD THERE

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
AND GO THROUGH IT
ALL OVER THE NEXT DAY.
SO I END UP--

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I DON'T HAVE OTHER OPTIONS.
 SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
 FOR ME

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
TO DO WHAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE
AND TO TAKE CARE OF HIM

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
THE WAY I USED TO
WHEN I WAS HOME WITH HIM
FOR HIS FIRST 3 1/2 YEARS.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
NOW, WORKING
AND DOING IT ON MY OWN,
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SHORTCHANGE HIM,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
AND I DON'T WANT TO TEAR
ALL OF MY HAIR OUT EITHER.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I HEAR THIS A LOT
FROM WORKING PARENTS--

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
THAT IT'S SO HARD TO GO HOME
AT THE END OF THE DAY
AND BE DISCIPLINARIAN.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY
ALL DAY LONG.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
YOU'VE MISSED THEM.
THEY'VE MISSED YOU.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS
WHEN THEY ALWAYS ACT UP.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
EVERY ONE YOU DESCRIBED
WERE TRANSITIONAL TIMES,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
WHEN YOU WERE BOTH UNDER
A CERTAIN KIND OF STRESS

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
AND YOU HAD TO
GET THINGS DONE.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I PREFER TO HAVE HIM
HOME EARLIER, BUT I
TAKE HIM WITH ME.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT
THE SECRET ANSWER.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
WELL, I THINK
YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH
SOMETHING IN YOURSELF.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
- HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THAT?
- I'M SURE I AM,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
BECAUSE I THINK A LOT
OF THE STRESS HE HAS

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
IS DIRECTLY
GENERATED FROM ME.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
WELL, I THINK YOU
BETTER THINK ABOUT

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
YOUR OWN SIDE
OF IT FIRST,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT
 MEANS TO YOU TO BE ALONE.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
AND THEN PULL YOURSELF BACK
AND LOOK AT WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO HIM,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
'CAUSE I THINK
HE PROBABLY IS ASKING
FOR SOME DISCIPLINE,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
BUT HE PROBABLY IS ASKING
EVEN MORE FOR YOU ALL
TO GET CLOSE AGAIN.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
WHAT I WOULD DO
FIRST IS GO HOME

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
AND SIT AND ROCK
AND GET CLOSE AGAIN,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
AND THEN SAY,
"NOW LET'S GO TO THE STORE,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
AND YOU CAN HELP ME
PICK THINGS OUT."

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I'M SURE YOU
DO THAALREADY.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I ALWAYS SAY EVERYBODY
WHO IS AWAY ALL DAY

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
OUGHT TO HAVE A GREAT
BIG ROCKING CHAIR.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
WHEN YOU COME IN
THE FRONT DOOR, YOU KNOW
HE'S GOING TO FALL APART.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
SO SIT DOWN
IN A BIG ROCKING
CHAIR AND JUST ROCK

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
AND SAY,
"HOW WAS YOUR DAY?"

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
AND HE'LL SAY, "EHH!"
AND YOU SAY, "MINE WAS, TOO.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I'VE MISSED YOU
ALL DAY LONG."

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
WHEN HE FINALLY
RELAXES IN YOUR ARMS,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
THEN TAKE HIM
TO DO THE THINGS.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
OKAY.  THANK YOU.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
( audience applauding )

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
WE'RE AN ADOPTIVE FAMILY.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
MY HUSBAND
AND I ADOPTED

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
A 10-MONTH-OLD BABY
FROM CHINA.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
NOW SHE'S THREE,
AND SHE'S HEALTHY,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
AND SHE'S BRIGHT,
AND SHE'S JUST
A WONDERFUL CHILD.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
MY QUESTION
TO YOU TODAY IS,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
WHEN AND HOW DO
I BEGIN TO TELL HER

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
ABOUT HER--
THE ADOPTIVE PROCESS?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
TO THIS DATE, SHE KNOWS
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS--

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
SHE KNOWS
SHE'S FROM CHINA,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AND DADDY'S FROM BOSTON
AND MOMMY'S FROM NEW YORK.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE
KIND OF UNDERSTANDS--

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
THAT WE'RE FROM
DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
AND I DO THE SIMILARITIES
AND DIFFERENCES
THING WITH HER,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
WITH HAIR AND EYES
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
SO YOU'RE ALREADY
TELLING HER.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
YEAH, I'VE STARTED
TO TELL HER A LITTLE BIT,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
BUT I WONDER, YOU KNOW,
WHAT POINT DO I BEGIN TO...

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
MAKE IT A FORMAL
SORT OF...

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I DON'T THINK YOU
EVER NOT TELL HER.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
YOU'VE ALREADY LAID
THE GROUNDWORK.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
SOONER OR LATER,
IT'LL COME UP--
"AM I ADOPTED?"

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
"YEAH."
IT'LL PROBABLY COME UP
AT FOUR AND FIVE

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
WHEN OTHER KIDS
TEASE HER 'CAUSE SHE
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE YOU.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
AND SHE'S GONNA COME
 HOME RUSHING TO YOU,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
SAYING, "WHY DON'T I
LOOK LIKE YOU?"

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
AND THEN YOU SAY,
"WELL, YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU WERE ADOPTED.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
REMEMBER?
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS."

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
- AND IT'S THAT YOU
  NEVER DON'T TELL HER.
- MM-HMM.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
YOU KNOW, THIS
IS THE TROUBLE

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
WITH BEING
AN ADOPTIVE PARENT.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
YOU ARE VULNERABLE.
YOU'D LIKE TO PROTECT THEM

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
FROM THE FACT THAT
THEY'RE DIFFERENT

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
FROM KIDS WHO HAD
THEIR OWN PARENTS.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
YES, OF COURSE.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
ANY PARENT, I GUESS,
WANTS TO PROTECT
THEIR CHILD.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
YOU SAID SOMETHING
VERY INTERESTING.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
YOU WANTED TO MAKE
THE DIFFERENCES IMPORTANT,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
AND THAT'S TRUE,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
BUT IT'S NOT
 GOING TO WORK.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
SHE'S STILL GOING TO COME
TO YOU FOR BEING TEASED,
FOR BEING DIFFERENT.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
IS HAVE HANDLED
YOUR OWN FEELINGS

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
SO WHEN SHE
COMES TO YOU,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
YOU'RE READY
TO HELP HER WITH HERS.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
AND IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
ONE THING I'D LIKE
TO URGE YOU TO DO

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
IS LET HER KNOW
SOME CHINESE ADULTS

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
SO SHE CAN IDENTIFY
WITH THEM.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
IT ISN'T THAT THEY'LL
 TAKE HER AWAY FROM YOU

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
BUT IT'LL GIVE HER
SOME IDEA

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
OF WHAT SHE MIGHT BE
WHEN SHE GROWS UP,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
AND A CHILD NEEDS
TO KNOW THAT.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
WELL, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
THANK YOU.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
GREAT.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT pampers.com.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
ALTHOUGH FAMILIES TODAY

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
COME IN MANY MORE FLAVORS
THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
I THINK THE BASIC
INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESS

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
REMAIN THE SAME.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
IN A GOOD FAMILY,
THERE'S MUTUAL RESPECT,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
AND THAT MEANS RESPECT
FOR THE CHILDREN, TOO,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
FOR THEIR NEEDS,
FOR THEIR UNIQUENESS,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
FOR THE SPECIAL SPIRIT

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
THAT LETS US SEE THE WORLD
AS ONLY A CHILD CAN SEE.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
