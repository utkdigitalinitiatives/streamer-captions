00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370


2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.570
Whither away so fast?

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.000
O, God save ye!

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.070
Even to the hall, to hearwhat shall become

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.570
of the great Duke ofBuckingham.

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.230
I'll save you that labour,sir. All's now done,

7
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.370
but the ceremony ofbringing back the prisoner.

8
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.830
Were you there?

9
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.270
Yes, indeed, was I.

10
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.970
Pray, speak what hashappen'd.

11
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.930
You may guess quicklywhat.

12
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.730
Is he found guilty?

13
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.530
Yes, truly is he, andcondemn'd upon't.

14
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.370
I am sorry for't.

15
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.130
So are a number more.

16
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.570
But, pray, how pass'd it?

17
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.070
I'll tell you in a little.

18
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.300
The great duke came to thebar;

19
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.600
where to his accusations

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.370
He pleaded still notguilty

21
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.070
and alleged many sharpreasons to defeat the law.

22
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.970
The king's attorney on thecontrary

23
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.330
Urged on the examinations,proofs, confessions

24
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.570
Of divers witnesses;

25
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.200
which the duke desired tohave brought

26
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400
viva voce to his face:

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.430
At which appear'd againsthim his surveyor;

28
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.330
Sir Gilbert Peck hischancellor; and John Car,

29
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.770
Confessor to him; withthat devil-monk,

30
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.230
Hopkins, that made thismischief.

31
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.500
That was he that fed himwith his prophecies?

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.930
The same.

33
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.670
All these accused himstrongly;

34
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.300
which he fain would haveflung from him,

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.430
but, indeed, he could not:

36
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.370
And so his peers, uponthis evidence,

37
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.370
Have found him guilty ofhigh treason.

38
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.300
Much he spoke, andlearnedly, for life;

39
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.070
but all was either pitiedin him or forgotten.

40
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.730
After all this, how did hebear himself?

41
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.030
When he was brought againto the bar,

42
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.530
to hear his knell rungout, his judgment,

43
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.670
he was stirr'd with suchan agony,

44
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.270
he sweat extremely,

45
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.930
And something spoke incholer, ill, and hasty:

46
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.970
But he fell to himselfagain,

47
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.230
and sweetly in all therest

48
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.300
show'd a most noblepatience.

49
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.270
I do not think he fearsdeath.

50
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.170
Sure, he does not:

51
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230
He never was so womanish;

52
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.470
the cause he may a littlegrieve at.

53
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.530
Certainly the cardinal isthe end of this.

54
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.270
'Tis likely, By allconjectures:

55
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.800
first, Kildare'sattainder,

56
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.900
Then deputy of Ireland;who removed,

57
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.000
Earl Surrey was sentthither, and in haste too,

58
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.470
Lest he should help hisfather.

59
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.600
That trick of state was adeep envious one.

60
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.630
At his return no doubt hewill requite it.

61
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.530
This is noted, and generally,whoever the king favours,

62
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.000
The cardinal instantlywill find employment,

63
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.670
And far enough from courttoo.

64
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.330
All the commons hate himperniciously,

65
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.430
and, o' my conscience,wish him ten fathom deep:

66
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.700
this duke as much theylove and dote on;

67
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.730
call him bounteousBuckingham,

68
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.230
The mirror of allcourtesy;--

69
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.570
Stay there, sir,

70
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.400
And see the noble ruin'dman you speak of.

71
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.000
All good people,

72
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.470
You that thus far havecome to pity me,

73
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.300
Hear what I say, and thengo home and lose me.

74
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.070
I have this day received atraitor's judgment,

75
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.800
And by that name must die:yet, heaven bear witness,

76
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800
And if I have a conscience,let it sink me,

77
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.400
Even as the axe falls, ifI be not faithful!

78
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.170
The law I bear no malicefor my death;

79
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.030
'T has done, upon thepremises, but justice:

80
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.400
But those that sought it Icould wish more Christians:

81
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.330
Be what they will, Iheartily forgive 'em:

82
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.230
Yet let 'em look theyglory not in mischief,

83
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.370
Nor build their evils onthe graves of great men;

84
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.530
For then my guiltless bloodmust cry against 'em.

85
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.430
For further life in thisworld I ne'er hope,

86
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.170
Nor will I sue,

87
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.970
although the king havemercies

88
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.930
more than I dare makefaults.

89
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.670
You few that loved me,

90
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.900
And dare be bold to weepfor Buckingham,

91
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.670
His noble friends andfellows,

92
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.930
whom to leave is onlybitter to him, only dying,

93
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.100
Go with me, like goodangels, to my end;

94
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.030
And, as the long divorceof steel falls on me,

95
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.870
Make of your prayers onesweet sacrifice,

96
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.770
And lift my soul toheaven.

97
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.870
Lead on, o' God's name.

98
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.600
I do beseech your grace,for charity,

99
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.870
If ever any malice in yourheart were hid against me,

100
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.830
now to forgive me frankly.

101
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:11.930
Sir Thomas Lovell,

102
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.330
I as free forgive you as Iwould be forgiven:

103
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.970
I forgive all;

104
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.470
There cannot be thosenumberless offences

105
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.700
'Gainst me, that Icannot take peace with:

106
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.000
no black envy shall markmy grave.

107
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.230
Commend me to his grace;

108
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.370
And if he speak ofBuckingham, pray, tell him

109
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.830
you met him half inheaven:

110
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.930
my vows and prayers yetare the king's;

111
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.400
and, till my soul forsake,

112
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.670
shall cry for blessings onhim:

113
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.670
may he live longer

114
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.630
than I have time to tellhis years!

115
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.970
Ever beloved and lovingmay his rule be!

116
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.330
And when old time shalllead him to his end,

117
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.530
Goodness and he fill upone monument!

118
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.630
To the water side I mustconduct your grace;

119
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.900
Then give my charge up toSir Nicholas Vaux,

120
00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.600
Who undertakes you to yourend.

121
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.000
Prepare there, the duke iscoming:

122
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.730
see the barge be ready;

123
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.870
And fit it with suchfurniture

124
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.570
as suits the greatness ofhis person.

125
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.070
Nay, Sir Nicholas, Let italone;

126
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.030
my state now will but mockme.

127
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.100
When I came hither,

128
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.830
I was lord high constableand Duke of Buckingham;

129
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.030
now, poor Edward Bohun:

130
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.930
Yet I am richer than mybase accusers,

131
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.670
That never knew what truthmeant:

132
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.670
I now seal it; And withthat blood

133
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.070
will make 'em one daygroan for't.

134
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.200
My noble father, Henry ofBuckingham,

135
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.730
Who first raised headagainst usurping Richard,

136
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.500
Flying for succor to hisservant Banister,

137
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.830
Being distress'd, was bythat wretch betray'd,

138
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.830
And without trial fell;God's peace be with him!

139
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.130
Henry the Seventhsucceeding,

140
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.830
truly pitying my father'sloss,

141
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.430
like a most royal prince,restored me to my honours,

142
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.470
and, out of ruins, made myname once more noble.

143
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.130
Now his son, Henry theEighth, life, honour, name

144
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.700
and all that made me happy

145
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.970
at one stroke has takenfor ever from the world.

146
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.770
I had my trial, and, mustneeds say, a noble one;

147
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.900
which makes me, a littlehappier

148
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.530
than my wretched father:

149
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.930
Yet thus far we are one infortunes:

150
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.370
both gell by our servants,by those men we loved most;

151
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.230
A most unnatural andfaithless service!

152
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.030
Heaven has an end in all:yet, you that hear me,

153
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.670
This from a dying manreceive as certain:

154
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.170
Where you are liberal ofyour loves and counsels

155
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.870
Be sure you be not loose;

156
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.130
for those you make friendsand give your hearts to,

157
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.730
when they once perceive theleast rub in your fortunes,

158
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.470
fall away like waterfrom ye,

159
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:59.200
never found again but wherethey mean to sink ye.

160
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
All good people, Prayfor me!

161
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.600
I must now forsake ye:

162
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.270
the last hour of my longweary life

163
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.200
is come upon me.Farewell:

164
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.870
And when you would saysomething that is sad,

165
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:30.470
Speak how I fell. I havedone; and God forgive me!

166
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.600
O, this is full of pity!

167
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.800
Sir, it calls, I fear,

168
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.700
too many curses on theirbeads that were the authors.

169
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.330
If the duke be guiltless,

170
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.930
'Tis full of woe:

171
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.470
yet I can give you inklingof an ensuing evil,

172
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.730
if it fall,

173
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.170
Greater than this.

174
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.700
Good angels keep it fromus!

175
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.530
What may it be? You do notdoubt my faith, sir?

176
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.630
This secret is so weighty,

177
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.030
'twill require a strongfaith to conceal it.

178
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:40.230
Let me have it; I do nottalk much.

179
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.800
I am confident, You shall,sir:

180
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.070
did you not of late dayshear

181
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.600
A buzzing of a separation

182
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.130
Between the king andKatharine?

183
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.600
Yes, but it held not:

184
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.930
For when the king onceheard it, out of anger

185
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.670
He sent command to thelord mayor straight

186
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:58.870
To stop the rumor, andallay those tongues

187
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.000
That durst disperse it.

188
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.730
But that slander, sir,

189
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.170
Is found a truth now: forit grows again

190
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.970
Fresher than e'er it was;

191
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.630
and held for certain

192
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.800
The king will ventureat it.

193
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.500
Either the cardinal,

194
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.300
Or some about him near,

195
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.100
have, out of malice to thegood queen,

196
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.000
possess'd him with ascruple

197
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.030
That will undo her: toconfirm this too,

198
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.670
Cardinal Campeius isarrived, and lately;

199
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.400
As all think, for thisbusiness.

200
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.930
'Tis the cardinal;

201
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.000
And merely to revenge himon the emperor

202
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.170
For not bestowing on him,at his asking,

203
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.230
The archbishopric ofToledo, this is purposed.

204
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.730
I think you have hit themark:

205
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.130
but is't not cruel

206
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.570
That she should feel thesmart of this?

207
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.500
The cardinal will have hiswill, and she must fall.

208
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.470
'My lord, the horses yourlordship sent for,

209
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.670
with all the care I had,

210
00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.530
I saw well chosen, ridden,and furnished.

211
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.700
They were young andhandsome,

212
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.830
and of the best breed inthe north.

213
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.800
When they were ready toset out for London,

214
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.530
a man of my lordcardinal's,

215
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.630
by commission and mainpower, took 'em from me;

216
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.800
with this reason: Hismaster would be served

217
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.370
before a subject, if notbefore the king;

218
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.870
which stopped our mouths,sir.'

219
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.800
I fear he will indeed:well, let him have them:

220
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.170
He will have all, I think.

221
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.330
Well met, my lordchamberlain.

222
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.570
Good day to both yourgraces.

223
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.200
How is the king employ'd?

224
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.800
I left him private,

225
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.370
Full of sad thoughts andtroubles.

226
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.070
What's the cause?

227
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.000
It seems the marriage withhis brother's wife

228
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.530
Has crept too near hisconscience.

229
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:50.470
No, his conscience

230
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:51.700
Has crept too near anotherlady.

231
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.770
'Tis so:

232
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.130
This is the cardinal'sdoing, the king-cardinal:

233
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.200
That blind priest, likethe eldest son of fortune,

234
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.900
Turns what he list.

235
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.070
The king will know him oneday.

236
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.930
Pray God he do! he'llnever know himself else.

237
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.600
How holily he works in allhis business!

238
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.330
And with what zeal! for,

239
00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:07.500
now he has crack'd theleague

240
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.500
Between us and the emperor,the queen's great nephew,

241
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.100
He dives into the king'ssoul, and there scatters

242
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.730
Dangers, doubts, wringingof the conscience,

243
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.130
Fears, and despairs;

244
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.530
and all these for hismarriage:

245
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.170
And out of all these torestore the king,

246
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.300
He counsels a divorce; aloss of her

247
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.230
That, like a jewel, hashung twenty years

248
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.100
About his neck, yet neverlost her lustre;

249
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.000
Of her that loves him withthat excellence

250
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.730
That angels love good menwith; even of her

251
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.870
That, when the greateststroke of fortune falls,

252
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.600
Will bless the king: andis not this course pious?

253
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.930
Heaven keep me from suchcounsel! '

254
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.130
Tis most true these newsare every where;

255
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.270
every tongue speaks 'em,

256
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.270
And every true heart weepsfor't:

257
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.770
all that dare

258
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.630
Look into these affairssee this main end,

259
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.430
The French king's sister.

260
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.700
Heaven will one day openthe king's eyes,

261
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.770
that so long have sleptupon this bold bad man.

262
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:03.770
And free us from hisslavery.

263
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.730
We had need pray,

264
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.470
And heartily, for ourdeliverance;

265
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.830
Or this imperious man willwork us all

266
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.070
From princes into pages:all men's honours

267
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.070
Lie like one lump beforehim, to be fashion'd

268
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.500
Into what pitch he please.

269
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500
For me, my lords,

270
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.000
I love him not, nor fearhim; there's my creed:

271
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.600
As I am made without him,so I'll stand,

272
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.030
If the king please; hiscurses and his blessings

273
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.900
Touch me alike, they'rebreath I not believe in.

274
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:29.930
I knew him, and I knowhim; so I leave him

275
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.900
To him that made himproud, the pope.

276
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.070
Let's in;

277
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.600
And with some otherbusiness put the king

278
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.900
From these sad thoughts,that work too much upon him:

279
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.470
My lord, you'll bear uscompany?

280
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.400
Excuse me;

281
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.930
The king has sent meotherwhere: besides,

282
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.300
You'll find a most unfittime to disturb him:

283
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.070
Health to your lordships.

284
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.370
Thanks, my good lordchamberlain.

285
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.970
How sad he looks! sure, heis much afflicted.

286
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.130
Who's there, ha?

287
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:23.770
Pray God he be not angry.

288
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:30.870
Who's there, I say? Howdare you thrust yourselves

289
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.430
Into my privatemeditations?

290
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.130
Who am I? ha?

291
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.800
A gracious king thatpardons all offences

292
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.070
Malice ne'er meant: ourbreach of duty this way

293
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.870
Is business of estate; inwhich we come

294
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.130
To know your royalpleasure.

295
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.130
Ye are too bold:

296
00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.770
Go to; I'll make ye knowyour times of business:

297
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.570
Is this an hour fortemporal affairs, ha?

298
00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:01.130
Who's there? my good lordcardinal? O my Wolsey,

299
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.630
The quiet of my woundedconscience;

300
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.100
Thou art a cure fit for aking.

301
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:07.870
You're welcome,

302
00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.330
Most learned reverend sir,into our kingdom:

303
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.730
Use us and it.

304
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.070
My good lord, have greatcare

305
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:13.230
I be not found a talker.

306
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.770
Sir, you cannot.

307
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.400
I would your grace wouldgive us but an hour

308
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.830
Of private conference.

309
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.430
We are busy; go.

310
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.600
This priest has no pridein him?

311
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.100
Not to speak of:

312
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.470
I would not be so sickthough for his place:

313
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.070
But this cannot continue.

314
00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:26.930
If it do,

315
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.800
I'll venture onehave-at-him.

316
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.100
I another.

317
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.770
Your grace has given aprecedent of wisdom

318
00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.600
Above all princes, incommitting freely

319
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.770
Your scruple to the voiceof Christendom:

320
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.070
Who can be angry now? whatenvy reach you?

321
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.370
The Spaniard, tied bloodand favour to her,

322
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.500
Must now confess, if theyhave any goodness,

323
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.000
The trial just and noble.All the clerks,

324
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.230
I mean the learned ones,in Christian kingdoms

325
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.270
Have their free voices:Rome, the nurse of judgment,

326
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.630
Invited by your nobleself, hath sent

327
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.400
One general tongue untous, this good man,

328
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.700
This just and learnedpriest, Cardinal Campeius;

329
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.900
Whom once more I presentunto your highness.

330
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.730
And once more in mine armsI bid him welcome,

331
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.670
And thank the holyconclave for their loves:

332
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.770
They have sent me such a manI would have wish'd for.

333
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.100
Your grace must needs deserveall strangers' loves,

334
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.200
You are so noble. To yourhighness' hand

335
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.500
I tender my commission; bywhose virtue,

336
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.630
The court of Romecommanding, you, my lord

337
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:21.470
Cardinal of York, are join'dwith me their servant

338
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.000
In the unpartial judgingof this business.

339
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.270
Two equal men. The queenshall be acquainted

340
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.830
Forthwith for what youcome. Where's Gardiner?

341
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.500
I know your majesty hasalways loved her

342
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.570
So dear in heart, not todeny her that

343
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.370
A woman of less placemight ask by law:

344
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.230
Scholars allow'd freely toargue for her.

345
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.730
Ay, and the best she shallhave; and my favour

346
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:45.330
To him that does best: Godforbid else. Cardinal,

347
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.830
Prithee, call Gardiner tome, my new secretary:

348
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.830
I find him a fit fellow.

349
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.600
Give me your hand much joy

350
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.030
and favour to you; You arethe king's now.

351
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.100
But to be commanded

352
00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.470
For ever by your grace,whose hand has raised me.

353
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.430
Come hither, Gardiner.

354
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.070
My Lord of York, was notone Doctor Pace

355
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.000
In this man's place beforehim?

356
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.100
Yes, he was.

357
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.570
Was he not held a learnedman?

358
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:24.830
Yes, surely.

359
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.730
Believe me, there's an illopinion spread then

360
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.070
Even of yourself, lordcardinal.

361
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.170
How! of me?

362
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.970
They will not stick to sayyou envied him,

363
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.300
And fearing he would rise,he was so virtuous,

364
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.070
Kept him a foreign manstill; which so grieved him,

365
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.000
That he ran mad and died.

366
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.430
Heaven's peace be withhim!

367
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.070
That's Christian careenough: for living murmurers

368
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.030
There's places of rebuke.He was a fool;

369
00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.200
For he would needs bevirtuous: that good fellow,

370
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.830
If I command him, followsmy appointment:

371
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.100
I will have none so nearelse.

372
00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.830
Learn this, brother,

373
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.300
We live not to be grip'dby meaner persons.

374
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.800
Deliver this with modestyto the queen.

375
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.800
The most convenient placethat I can think of

376
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.670
For such receipt oflearning is Black-Friars;

377
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.300
There ye shall meet aboutthis weighty business.

378
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.430
My Wolsey, see itfurnish'd. O, my lord,

379
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.530
Would it not grieve anable man to leave

380
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:24.370
So sweet a bedfellow? But,conscience, conscience!

381
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.370
O, 'tis a tender place;and I must leave her.

382
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:39.800
Not for that neither: here'sthe pang that pinches:

383
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.230
His highness having livedso long with her,

384
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.500
and she so good a lady

385
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.870
that no tongue could everpronounce

386
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:46.900
dishonour of her;

387
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.630
by my life, she never knewharm-doing:

388
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.330
O, now, after so manycourses

389
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.970
of the sun enthroned,

390
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.300
Still growing in a majestyand pomp, the which

391
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.200
To leave a thousand-foldmore bitter than

392
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:06.200
'Tis sweet at first toacquire,--after this process,

393
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.100
To give her the avaunt!

394
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.400
It is a pity would move amonster.

395
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.030
Hearts of most hard temper

396
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.900
Melt and lament for her.

397
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.800
O, God's will!

398
00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.730
much better she ne'er hadknown pomp:

399
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.430
though't be temporal,

400
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.930
Yet, if that quarrel,fortune,

401
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.900
do divorce it from thebearer,

402
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.270
'tis a sufferance panging

403
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.270
As soul and body'ssevering.

404
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.230
Alas, poor lady!

405
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.730
She's a stranger nowagain.

406
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.600
So much the more

407
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.770
Must pity drop upon her.

408
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:35.430
Verily, I swear, 'tisbetter to be lowly born,

409
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.630
And range with humblelivers in content,

410
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:40.070
Than to be perk'd up in aglistering grief,

411
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.370
And wear a golden sorrow.

412
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:43.270
Our content is our besthaving.

413
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.470
By my troth andmaidenhead,

414
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:46.270
I would not be a queen.

415
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.870
Beshrew me, I would,

416
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.530
And venture maidenheadfor't;

417
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.770
and so would you,

418
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.070
For all this spice of yourhypocrisy:

419
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.670
You, that have so fairparts of woman on you,

420
00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.070
Have too a woman's heart;

421
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:05.530
which ever yet affectedeminence, wealth, sovereignty;

422
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.930
Which, to say sooth, areblessings; and which gifts,

423
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.830
Saving your mincing,

424
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.930
the capacity of your softcheveril conscience

425
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.000
would receive,

426
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.670
If you might please tostretch it.

427
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.070
Nay, good troth.

428
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.330
Yes, troth, and troth; youwould not be a queen?

429
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:28.700
No, not for all the richesunder heaven.

430
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.230
'Tis strange: a three-pencebow'd would hire me,

431
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.770
Old as I am, to queen it:

432
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.170
but, I pray you,

433
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.730
What think you of aduchess?

434
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.470
have you limbs to bearthat load of title?

435
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.730
No, in truth.

436
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:48.170
Then you are weakly made:pluck off a little;

437
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.230
I would not be a youngcount in your way,

438
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.630
For more than blushingcomes to:

439
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.970
if your back cannotvouchsafe this burthen,

440
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.500
'tis too weak ever to geta boy.

441
00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.600
How you do talk!

442
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.370
I swear again, I would notbe a queen

443
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.330
For all the world.

444
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.270
In faith, for littleEngland

445
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.530
You'ld venture anemballing:

446
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.230
I myself would forCarnarvonshire,

447
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:11.670
although there long'd nomore

448
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.330
to the crown but that.

449
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.470
Lo, who comes here?

450
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.630
Good morrow, ladies. Whatwere't worth to know

451
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.600
The secret of yourconference?

452
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.730
My good lord,

453
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.530
Not your demand; it valuesnot your asking:

454
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.430
Our mistress' sorrows wewere pitying.

455
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.470
It was a gentle business,

456
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.500
and becoming the action ofgood women:

457
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.870
there is hope all will bewell.

458
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.430
Now, I pray God, amen!

459
00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.370
You bear a gentle mind,

460
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.230
and heavenly blessingsfollow such creatures.

461
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.170
That you may, fair lady,

462
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:47.100
Perceive I speaksincerely,

463
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.070
and high note's ta'en ofyour many virtues,

464
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.830
the king's majestycommends his good opinion

465
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.430
of you to you,

466
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:55.970
and does purpose honour toyou

467
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.870
no less flowing thanMarchioness of Pembroke:

468
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.700
to which title a thousandpound a year,

469
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.700
annual support, out of hisgrace he adds.

470
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:09.170
I do not know

471
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.730
What kind of my obedienceI should tender;

472
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.470
More than my all isnothing:

473
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.270
nor my prayers are notwords duly hallow'd,

474
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.970
nor my wishes more worththan empty vanities;

475
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.200
yet prayers and wishes areall I can return.

476
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.130
Beseech your lordship,

477
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.300
Vouchsafe to speak mythanks and my obedience,

478
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.500
As from a blushinghandmaid, to his highness;

479
00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.030
Whose health and royalty Ipray for.

480
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.700
Lady, I shall not fail toapprove

481
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.270
the fair conceit the kinghath of you.

482
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.730
I have perused her well;

483
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.830
Beauty and honour in herare so mingled

484
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.830
That they have caught theking:

485
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.970
and who knows yet

486
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.700
But from this lady mayproceed a gem

487
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.270
To lighten all this isle?

488
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.530
I'll to the king, and sayI spoke with you.

489
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.530
My honour'd lord.

490
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:15.930
Why, this it is; see, see!

491
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.070
I have been beggingsixteen years in court,

492
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.900
Am yet a courtierbeggarly,

493
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.130
and you, O fate!

494
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.000
A very fresh-fishhere--fie, fie, fie upon

495
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.200
This compell'd fortune!

496
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.470
--have your mouth fill'dup

497
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.670
Before you open it.

498
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.070
This is strange to me.

499
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.970
How tastes it? is itbitter?

500
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.530
forty pence, no.

501
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.700
There was a lady once,'tis an old story,

502
00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.000
That would not be a queen,

503
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.700
that would she not,

504
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.170
For all the mud in Egypt:have you heard it?

505
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.670
Come, you are pleasant.

506
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.470
With your theme,

507
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.770
I could O'ermount thelark.

508
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.330
The Marchioness ofPembroke!

509
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.130
A thousand pounds a yearfor pure respect!

510
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.730
No other obligation!

511
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.430
By my life, that promisesmoe thousands:

512
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.930
honour's train is longerthan his foreskirt.

513
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.670
By this time I know

514
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.770
your back will bear aduchess:

515
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.870
say, are you not strongerthan you were?

516
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.600
Good lady, Make yourselfmirth

517
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.130
with your particularfancy,

518
00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.400
And leave me out on't.

519
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.330
Would I had no being,

520
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.300
If this salute my blood ajot:

521
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.530
it faints me to think whatfollows.

522
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.370
The queen is comfortless,

523
00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.930
and we forgetful in ourlong absence:

524
00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:50.630
pray, do not deliver

525
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.170
what here you've heard toher.

526
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.300
What do you think me?

527
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.130
Whilst our commission fromRome is read,

528
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.730
Let silence be commanded.

529
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.630
What's the need?

530
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.500
It hath already publiclybeen read,

531
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.170
And on all sides theauthority allow'd;

532
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.200
You may, then, spare thattime.

533
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.500
Say, Henry King of England,come into the court.

534
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.530

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.100
And to bestow your pity onme:

540
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.200
for I am a most poorwoman,

541
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.570
and a stranger,

542
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.830
Born out of yourdominions;

543
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.530
having here no judgeindifferent,

544
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:44.870
nor no more assurance

545
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:48.730
Of equal friendship andproceeding.

546
00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:54.800
Alas, sir, in what have Ioffended you?

547
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.130
what cause hath mybehavior

548
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.700
given to your displeasure,

549
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.730
That thus you shouldproceed to put me off,

550
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.530
And take your good gracefrom me?

551
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.000
Heaven witness,

552
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.130
I have been to you a trueand humble wife,

553
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:19.000
At all times to your willconformable;

554
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.430
Ever in fear to kindleyour dislike,

555
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.570
Yea, subject to yourcountenance,

556
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.700
glad or sorry as I saw itinclined:

557
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.170
when was the hour

558
00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.330
I ever contradicted yourdesire,

559
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.370
Or made it not mine too?

560
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.370
Or which of your friends

561
00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.730
Have I not strove to love,

562
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.330
although I knew he weremine enemy?

563
00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.370
what friend of mine

564
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.300
That had to him derivedyour anger,

565
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.730
did I continue in myliking?

566
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.500
nay, gave notice he wasfrom thence discharged.

567
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.470
Sir, consider that I havebeen your wife,

568
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.730
in this obedience,

569
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:11.670
Upward of twenty years,

570
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.800
and have been blest withmany children by you:

571
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.930
if, in the course andprocess of this time,

572
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:24.070
you can report, and proveit too,

573
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.630
against mine honour aught,

574
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.930
My bond to wedlock, or mylove and duty,

575
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:35.700
Against your sacredperson, in God's name,

576
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.600
Turn me away;

577
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.170
and let the foul'stcontempt

578
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.300
Shut door upon me,

579
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.930
and so give me up to thesharp'st kind of justice.

580
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.930
Please you sir,

581
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.130
The king, your father,

582
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:52.400
was reputed for a princemost prudent,

583
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:57.300
of an excellent andunmatch'd wit and judgment:

584
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.530
Ferdinand, My father, kingof Spain,

585
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.400

586
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.130
that there had reign'd bymany

587
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.100
A year before:

588
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:10.530
it is not to be question'd

589
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.830
That they had gather'd awise council to them

590
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.800
Of every realm, that diddebate this business,

591
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.730

It's fit this royalsession do proceed;

And that, without delay,

612
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.770
Lord cardinal, to you Ispeak.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:28.370
Your pleasure, madam?

614
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:33.070
Sir,I am about to weep;

615
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.470
but, thinking that we area queen,

616
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.570
or long have dream'd so,

617
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.600
certain the daughter of aking,

618
00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.970
my drops of tears I'llturn to sparks of fire.

619
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.670
Be patient yet.

620
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.000
I will, when you arehumble;

621
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.230
nay, before, or God willpunish me.

622
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:55.030
I do believe,

623
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.630
Induced by potentcircumstances,

624
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.330
that you are mine enemy,

625
00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.370
and make my challenge

626
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.470
You shall not be my judge:

627
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:03.070
for it is you have blownthis coal

628
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.870
betwixt my lord and me;

629
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.430
Which God's dew quench!

630
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.170
Therefore I say again,

631
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.200
I utterly abhor, yea, frommy soul

632
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.030
Refuse you for my judge;

633
00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:18.970
whom, yet once more,

634
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:21.370
I hold my most maliciousfoe,

635
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.730
and think not at all afriend to truth.

636
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:24.600
I do profess

637
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.230
You speak not likeyourself;

638
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:28.870
who ever yet have stood tocharity,

639
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.000
and display'd the effectsof wisdom

640
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.400
and disposition gentle,

641
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.600
o'ertopping woman's power.

642
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.000
Madam, you do me wrong:

643
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.470
I have no spleen againstyou;

644
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.230
nor injustice for you orany:

645
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.430
how far I have proceeded,

646
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.900
Or how far further shall,

647
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.500
is warranted by a commissionfrom the consistory,

648
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.300
Yea, the whole consistoryof Rome.

649
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.170
You charge me that I haveblown this coal:

650
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:56.130
I do deny it:

651
00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.830
The king is present:

652
00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.400
if it be known to him thatI gainsay my deed,

653
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.530
how may he wound,

654
00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.770
And worthily, myfalsehood!

655
00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.600
yea, as much as you havedone my truth.

656
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.670
If he know that I am freeof your report,

657
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.270
he knows I am not of yourwrong.

658
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.270
Therefore in him it liesto cure me:

659
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.370
and the cure is,

660
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:18.670
to remove these thoughtsfrom you:

661
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.870
the which before hishighness shall speak in,

662
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.530
I do beseech you, graciousmadam,

663
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.470
to unthink your speakingand to say so no more.

664
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.600
My lord,

665
00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.200
my lord, I am a simplewoman,

666
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.270
much too weak to opposeyour cunning.

667
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.100
You're meek andhumble-mouth'd;

668
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.530
You sign your place andcalling,

669
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:41.470
in full seeming,

670
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.530
With meekness andhumility;

671
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.270
but your heart is cramm'dwith arrogancy,

672
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.930
spleen, and pride.

673
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.130
You have, by fortune andhis highness' favours,

674
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.670
Gone slightly o'er lowsteps and now are mounted

675
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.600
Where powers are yourretainers, and your words,

676
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.670
Domestics to you, serveyour will as't please

677
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.230
Yourself pronounce theiroffice.

678
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.970
I must warn you, You tendermore your person's honour

679
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.870
than your high professionspiritual:

680
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:12.370
that again I do refuse youfor my judge;

681
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.970

To bring my whole cause'fore his holiness,

684
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.070
And to be judged by him.

685
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:27.800
The queen is obstinate,

686
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800
Stubborn to justice, aptto accuse it,

687
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.500
and disdainful to be triedby't: '

688
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.730
tis not well.

689
00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.200
She's going away.

690
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.570

705
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.670
For speaking false inthat:

The queen of earthlyqueens: she's noble born;

That it shall please youto declare,

717

in hearing of all theseears,

although not there at onceand fully satisfied,

721
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.200
--whether ever I didbroach

722
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.430
this business to yourhighness;

723
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.300
or laid any scruple inyour way,

724
00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.270
which might induce you tothe question on't?

725
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:11.630
or ever have to you,

726
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.200
but with thanks to God

727
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.030
for such a royal lady,

728
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.130
spake one the least word

729
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.270
that might be to theprejudice

730
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.200
of her present state,

731
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.000
Or touch of her goodperson?

732
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.700
My lord cardinal, I doexcuse you;

733
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:25.030
yea, upon mine honour, Ifree you from't.

734
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.730
You are not to be taught

735
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.900
That you have manyenemies,

736
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.000
that know not why they areso,

737
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.430
but, like to village-curs,

738
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:31.930
Bark when their fellowsdo:

739
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.800
by some of these the queenis put in anger.

740
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.930
You're excused:

741
00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.200
But will you be morejustified?

742
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.100
You ever have wish'd thesleeping of this business;

743
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.500
never desired it to bestirr'd;

744
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.330
but oft have hinder'd,oft,

745
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.430
The passages made towardit:

746
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:49.400
on my honour,

747
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.130
I speak my good lordcardinal to this point,

748
00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.800
And thus far clear him.

749
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.570
Now, what moved me to't,

750
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.870
I will be bold with timeand your attention:

751
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.130
Then mark the inducement.

752
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:12.370
Thus it came; give heedto't:

753
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.130
My conscience firstreceived a tenderness,

754
00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:18.500
Scruple, and prick,

755
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.700
on certain speechesutter'd

756
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.170
by the Bishop of Bayonne,

757
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.530
then French ambassador;

758
00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.270
Who had been hither senton the debating

759
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.400
A marriage 'twixt the Dukeof Orleans

760
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.000
and our daughter Mary:

761
00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:34.870
i' the progress of thisbusiness,

762
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:37.070
Ere a determinateresolution,

763
00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:42.670
he, I mean the bishop, didrequire a respite;

764
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:48.330
Wherein he might the kinghis lord advertise

765
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.970
Whether our daughter werelegitimate,

766
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.770
Respecting this ourmarriage with the dowager,

767
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:58.770
Sometimes our brother'swife.

768
00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:05.500
This respite shook thebosom of my conscience,

769
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.570
enter'd me, Yea, with asplitting power,

770
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.170
and made to tremble theregion of my breast;

771
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.230
which forced such way,

772
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.770
That many mazedconsiderings did throng

773
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.330
And press'd in with thiscaution.

774
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.870
First, methought I stoodnot

775
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.270
in the smile of heaven;

776
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.770
who had commanded nature,that my lady's womb,

777
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:26.730
If it conceived a malechild by me,

778
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:29.470
should do no more officesof life to't

779
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:32.730
than the grave does to thedead;

780
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.270
for her male issue or diedwhere they were made,

781
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:39.800
or shortly after thisworld had air'd them:

782
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.330
hence I took a thought,

783
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.500
This was a judgment on me;

784
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.700
that my kingdom,

785
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.830
Well worthy the best heiro' the world,

786
00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.830
should not be gladded in'tby me:

787
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.300
then follows, that Iweigh'd the danger

788
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:04.100
which my realms stood inby this my issue's fail;

789
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.900
and that gave to me many agroaning throe.

790
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:15.900
Thus hulling in the wildsea of my conscience,

791
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.200
I did steer toward thisremedy,

792
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.670
whereupon we are nowpresent here together:

793
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:24.200
that's to say, I meant torectify my conscience,

794
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.600
--which I then did feelfull sick,

795
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.700
and yet not well,--

796
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.630
By all the reverendfathers of the land

797
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.630
And doctors learn'd:

798
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.630
first I began in private

799
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.730
With you, my Lord ofLincoln;

800
00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.030
you remember how under myoppression I did reek,

801
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.230
When I first moved you.

802
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.100
Very well, my liege.

803
00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.600
I have spoke long:

804
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.770
be pleased yourself to say

805
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.270
How far you satisfied me.

806
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.530
So please your highness,

807
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.100
The question did at firstso stagger me,

808
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.100
Bearing a state of mightymoment in't

809
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.870
And consequence of dread,

810
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.770
that I committed thedaring'st counsel

811
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.500
which I had to doubt;

812
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.700
And did entreat yourhighness

813
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.070
to this course which youare running here.

814
00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.330
I then moved you,

815
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.200
My Lord of Canterbury;

816
00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.970
and got your leave to makethis present summons:

817
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.030
unsolicited I left noreverend person

818
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.870
in this court;

819
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.500
But by particular consent

820
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.330
proceeded under your handsand seals:

821
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.730
therefore, go on:

822
00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.130
For no dislike i' theworld

823
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.630
against the person of thegood queen,

824
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:29.100
but the sharp thorny pointsof my alleged reasons,

825
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.070
drive this forward:

826
00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.470
Prove but our marriagelawful,

827
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.770
by my life and kinglydignity,

828
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.730
we are contented

829
00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.500
To wear our mortal stateto come with her,

830
00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.000
Katharine our queen,

831
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.430
before the primestcreature

832
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:48.270
That's paragon'd o' theworld.

833
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.730
So please your highness,

834
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:14.170
The queen being absent,

835
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.370
'tis a needful fitnessthat we adjourn this court

836
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.530
till further day:

837
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.370
Meanwhile must be anearnest motion

838
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.430
Made to the queen, to callback her appeal

839
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:24.670
She intends unto hisholiness.

840
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.300
I may perceive thesecardinals trifle with me:

841
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:40.970
I abhor this dilatorysloth and tricks of Rome.

842
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.170
My learn'd and well-belovedservant, Cranmer,

843
00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.230
Prithee, return:

844
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:45.270
with thy approach, I know,

845
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.000
My comfort comes along.

846
00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.830
Break up the court:

847
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.070
I say, set on.

848
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
