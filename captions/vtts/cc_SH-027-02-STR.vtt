00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500


2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.230
What, have I scaped love-letters

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.730
in the holiday- time of my beauty,

4
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.970
and am I now a subject for them?

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.730
Let me see.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.630
'Ask me no reason why I love you;

7
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.600
for though Love use Reason for his physician,

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.900
he admits him not for his counsellor.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.530
You are not young, no more am I;

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.670
go to then, there's sympathy:

11
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.000
you are merry, so am I; ha, ha!

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.700
then there's more sympathy: you love sack,

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.370
and so do I;

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.770
would you desire better sympathy?

15
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.570
Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,

16
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.000
--at the least, if the love of soldier

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.930
can suffice,-- that I love thee.

18
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.600
I will not say, pity me;

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.370
'tis not a soldier-like phrase:

20
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.630
but I say, love me.

21
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.900
By me, Thine own true knight,

22
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.330
By day or night,

23
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.070
Or any kind of light,

24
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.930
With all his might

25
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.570
For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'

26
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.300
What a Herod of Jewry is this!

27
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.000
O wicked world!

28
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.530
One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with age

29
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.270
to show himself a young gallant!

30
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.330
What an unweighed behavior

31
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.870
hath this Flemish drunkard picked

32
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.530
--with the devil's name!

33
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.470
--out of my conversation,

34
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.530
that he dares in this manner assay me?

35
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.230
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company!

36
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.800
What should I say to him?

37
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.100
I was then frugal of my mirth:

38
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.970
Heaven forgive me!

39
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.330
Why, I'll exhibit a bill

40
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.200
in the parliament for the putting down of men.

41
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.970
How shall I be revenged on him?

42
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.900
for revenged I will be,

43
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.670
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.

44
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.830
Mistress Page! trust me,

45
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.570
I was going to your house.

46
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.630
And, trust me, I was coming to you.

47
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.600
You look very ill.

48
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.370
Nay, I'll ne'er believe that;

49
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.900
I have to show to the contrary.

50
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.230
Faith, but you do, in my mind.

51
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.500
Well, I do then; yet I say

52
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.300
I could show you to the contrary.

53
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.330
O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!

54
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.700
What's the matter, woman?

55
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.400
O woman, if it were not

56
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.500
for one trifling respect,

57
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.300
I could come to such honour!

58
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.430
Hang the trifle, woman!

59
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.330
take the honour. What is it?

60
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.170
dispense with trifles; what is it?

61
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.200
If I would but go to hell

62
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.730
for an eternal moment or so,

63
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.170
I could be knighted.

64
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.770
What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford!

65
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.230
These knights will hack;

66
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.830
and so thou shouldst not alter the article of thy gentry.

67
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.170
We burn daylight: here, read, read;

68
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.070
perceive how I might be knighted.

69
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.770
I shall think the worse of fat men,

70
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.130
as long as I have an eye to make difference

71
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.200
of men's liking:

72
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.100
and yet he would not swear;

73
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800
praised women's modesty;

74
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.830
and gave such orderly

75
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.370
and well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness,

76
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.730
that I would have sworn his disposition

77
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.530
would have gone to the truth of his words;

78
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.200
but they do no more adhere

79
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.400
and keep place together

80
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.500
than the Hundredth Psalm

81
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.230
to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.'

82
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.100
What tempest, I trow,

83
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.230
threw this whale,

84
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.470
with so many tuns of oil in his belly,

85
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.230
ashore at Windsor?

86
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.200
How shall I be revenged on him?

87
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.000
I think the best way were to entertain him with hope,

88
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.270
till the wicked fire of lust

89
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.770
have melted him in his own grease.

90
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.830
Did you ever hear the like?

91
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.770
Letter for letter,

92
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.770
but that the name of Page and Ford differs!

93
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.900
To thy great comfort in this mystery

94
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.600
of ill opinions,

95
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.900
here's the twin-brother of thy letter:

96
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.100
but let thine inherit first;

97
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.170
for, I protest, mine never shall.

98
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.900
I warrant he hath a thousand of these letters,

99
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.530
writ with blank space for different names

100
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.500
--sure, more,

101
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.070
--and these are of the second edition:

102
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.030
he will print them, out of doubt;

103
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.370
for he cares not what he puts into the press,

104
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.500
when he would put us two.

105
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.670
I had rather be a giantess,

106
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.270
and lie under Mount Pelion.

107
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.470
Well, I will find you twenty lascivious turtles

108
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.970
ere one chaste man.

109
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.100
Why, this is the very same; the very hand,

110
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.500
the very words. What doth he think of us?

111
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.630
Nay, I know not:

112
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.700
it makes me almost ready to

113
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.100
wrangle with mine own honesty.

114
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.430
I'll entertain myself like one

115
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.770
that I am not acquainted withal;

116
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.730
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me,

117
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.330
that I know not myself,

118
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.770
he would never have boarded me in this fury.

119
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.030
'Boarding,' call you it?

120
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.170
I'll be sure to keep him above deck.

121
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.970
So will I if he come under my hatches,

122
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.700
I'll never to sea again.

123
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.830
Let's be revenged on him:

124
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.830
let's appoint him a meeting;

125
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.130
give him a show of comfort in his suit

126
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.400
and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,

127
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.800
till he hath pawned his horses

128
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.530
to mine host of the Garter.

129
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.030
Nay, I will consent

130
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.300
to act any villany against him,

131
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.370
that may not sully

132
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.170
the chariness of our honesty.

133
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.830
O, that my husband saw this letter!

134
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.300
it would give eternal food to his jealousy.

135
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.870
Why, look where he comes;

136
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.530
and my good man with him

137
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.700
he's as far from jealousy

138
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.500
as I am from giving him cause;

139
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.830
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.

140
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.100
You are the happier woman.

141
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.830
Let's consult together against this greasy knight.

142
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.170
Come hither.

143
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.030
Well, I hope it be not so.

144
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.430
Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:

145
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.500
Sir John affects thy wife.

146
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.370
Why, sir, my wife is not young.

147
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.330
He wooes both high and low,

148
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.500
both rich and poor,

149
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.600
Both young and old,

150
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.770
one with another, Ford;

151
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.870
He loves the gallimaufry:

152
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.130
Ford, perpend.

153
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.670
Love my wife!

154
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.630
With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,

155
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.730
Like Sir Actaeon he,

156
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.430
with Ringwood at thy heels:

157
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.930
O, odious is the name!

158
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.470
What name, sir?

159
00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.270
The horn, I say. Farewell.

160
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.930
Take heed, have open eye,

161
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.870
for thieves do foot by night:

162
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.600
Take heed, ere summer comes

163
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.000
or cuckoo-birds do sing.

164
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.170
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!

165
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.800
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

166
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.600
I will be patient; I will find out this.

167
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.770
And this is true;

168
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.370
I like not the humour of lying.

169
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.370
He hath wronged me in some humours:

170
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.270
I should have borne

171
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.400
the humoured letter to her;

172
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.900
but I have a sword which can bite upon my necessity.

173
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.400
He loves your wife;

174
00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.970
there's the short and the long.

175
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.900
My name is Corporal Nym;

176
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.400
I speak and I avouch;

177
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.230
'tis true: my name is Nym

178
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:14.970
and Falstaff loves your wife.

179
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.530
Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,

180
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.700
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.

181
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.800
'The humour of it,' quoth a'!

182
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.670
here's a fellow frights English out of his wits.

183
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.830
I will seek out Falstaff.

184
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.700
I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.

185
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.530
If I do find it: well.

186
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.630
I will not believe such a Cataian,

187
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:46.730
though the priest o' the town

188
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.470
commended him for a true man.

189
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.670
'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.

190
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.400
How now, Meg!

191
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.730
Whither go you, George? Hark you.

192
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.830
How now, sweet Frank!

193
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.870
why art thou melancholy?

194
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.170
I melancholy! I am not melancholy.

195
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.670
Get you home, go.

196
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.630
Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,

197
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.970
will you come, Mistress Page?

198
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.330
Have with you.

199
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.730
You'll come to dinner, George.

200
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.870
Look who comes yonder:

201
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.830
she shall be our messenger

202
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.870
to this paltry knight.

203
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.400
Trust me, I thought on her:

204
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.570
she'll fit it.

205
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.300
You are come to see my daughter Anne?

206
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.200
Ay, forsooth; and, I pray,

207
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.400
how does good Mistress Anne?

208
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.830
Go in with us and see:

209
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.930
we have an hour's talk with you.

210
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.900
How now, Master Ford!

211
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.170
You heard what this knave told me,

212
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.330
did you not?

213
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.300
Yes: and you heard what the other told me?

214
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.630
Do you think there is truth in them?

215
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.470
Hang 'em, slaves!

216
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.230
I do not think

217
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.070
the knight would offer it:

218
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:56.630
but these that accuse him

219
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.270
in his intent towards our wives

220
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.700
are a yoke of his discarded men;

221
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.370
very rogues, now they be out of service.

222
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.400
Were they his men?

223
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.470
Marry, were they.

224
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.200
I like it never the better for that.

225
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.100
Does he lie at the Garter?

226
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.930
Ay, marry, does he.

227
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.130
If he should intend this voyage towards my wife,

228
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.400
I would turn her loose to him; and what he gets more of her

229
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.530
than sharp words, let it lie on my head.

230
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.930
I do not misdoubt my wife;

231
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.870
but I would be loath

232
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.000
to turn them together.

233
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.130
A man may be too confident:

234
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.030
I would have nothing lie on my head:

235
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.630
I cannot be thus satisfied.

236
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.500
Look where my ranting host

237
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.930
of the Garter comes:

238
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.100
there is either liquor in his pate

239
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.000
or money in his purse

240
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.470
when he looks so merrily.

241
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.330
How now, mine host!

242
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.530
How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.

243
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.830
Cavaleiro-justice, I say!

244
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.430
I follow, mine host, I follow.

245
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.600
Good morrow and twenty, good Master Page!

246
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.870
Will you go with us? we have sport in hand.

247
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.530
Tell him, cavaleiro-justice;

248
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.170
tell him, bully-rook.

249
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.670
Sir, there is a fray to be fought

250
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.870
between Sir Hugh the Welsh priest

251
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.530
and Caius the French doctor.

252
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.000
Good mine host o' the Garter,

253
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.070
a word with you.

254
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.370
What sayest thou, my bully-rook?

255
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.230
Will you go with us to behold it?

256
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.700
My merry host hath had the measuring

257
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.830
of their weapons;

258
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.700
and, I think,

259
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.770
hath appointed them contrary places;

260
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:23.700
for, believe me,

261
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.900
I hear the parson is no jester.

262
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.870
Hark, I will tell you

263
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.230
what our sport shall be.

264
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.570
Hast thou no suit against my knight,

265
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.100
my guest-cavaleire?

266
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.270
None, I protest:

267
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.970
but I'll give you a pottle

268
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.970
of burnt sack to give me

269
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.800
recourse to him and tell him

270
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:44.230
my name is Brook; only for a jest.

271
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:46.870
My hand, bully;

272
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.800
thou shalt have egress and regress;

273
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.030
--said I well?

274
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.070
--and thy name shall be Brook.

275
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.500
It is a merry knight.

276
00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.270
Will you go, An-heires?

277
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.800
Have with you, mine host.

278
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800
I have heard the Frenchman

279
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.130
hath good skill in his rapier.

280
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.670
Tut, sir, I could have told you more.

281
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.400
These days, you stand upon distance,

282
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.070
your passes, stoccadoes,

283
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:17.330
and I know not what: 'tis the heart,

284
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.700
Master Page; 'tis here, 'tis here.

285
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.900
I have seen the time,

286
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.470
with my long sword

287
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.630
I could have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.

288
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.800
Here, boys, here, here!

289
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.900
shall we wag?

290
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.870
Have with you.

291
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:41.600
I would rather hear them scold than fight.

292
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.030
Though Page be a secure fool,

293
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.370
an stands so firmly

294
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:46.930
on his wife's frailty,

295
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.300
yet I cannot put off

296
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.270
my opinion so easily:

297
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.630
she was in his company at Page's house;

298
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:59.000
and what they made there, I know not.

299
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Well, I will look further into't:

300
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and I have a disguise to sound Falstaff.

301
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.270
If I find her honest,

302
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.530
I lose not my labour;

303
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.530
if she be otherwise,

304
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.700
'tis labour well bestowed.

305
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.800
I will not lend thee a penny.

306
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.100
Why, then the world's mine oyster.

307
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.470
Which I with sword will open.

308
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.000
I will retort the sum in a quippage.

309
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.930
Not a penny. I have been content,

310
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.970
sir, you should lay my countenance to pawn;

311
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.430
I have grated upon my good friends

312
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.330
for three reprieves for you

313
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.970
and your coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked

314
00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.370
through the grate, like a geminy of baboons.

315
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.470
I am damned in hell for swearing

316
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.300
to gentlemen my friends,

317
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.000
you were good soldiers and tall fellows;

318
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.500
and when Mistress Bridget lost the handle

319
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.600
of her fan, I took't upon mine honour

320
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.070
thou hadst it not.

321
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.000
Didst not thou share?

322
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.630
hadst thou not fifteen pence?

323
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.770
Reason, you rogue, reason:

324
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:16.370
thinkest thou I'll endanger my soul gratis?

325
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.570
At a word, hang no more about me,

326
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.570
I am no gibbet for you.

327
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.870
Go. A short knife and a throng!

328
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.730
To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.

329
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.100
You'll not bear a letter for me?

330
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.130
You stand upon your honour!

331
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.600
Why, thou unconfinable baseness,

332
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.900
it is as much as I can do

333
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.670
to keep the terms of my honour precise:

334
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.270
I, I,

335
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:46.800
I myself sometimes,

336
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.270
leaving the fear of God

337
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.370
on the left hand

338
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:50.830
and hiding mine honour

339
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.500
in my necessity,

340
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.500
am fain to shuffle,

341
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.370
to hedge and to lurch;

342
00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.530
and yet you, rogue,

343
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.600
will ensconce your rags,

344
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.370
your cat-a-mountain looks,

345
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.570
your red-lattice phrases,

346
00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.070
and your bold-beating oaths,

347
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.130
under the shelter of your honour!

348
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.330
You will not do it, you!

349
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.470
I do relent: what would thou more of man?

350
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.430
Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.

351
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:23.430
Let her approach.

352
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.270
Give your worship good morrow.

353
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.400
Good morrow, good wife.

354
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.100
Not so, an't please your worship.

355
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.500
Good maid, then.

356
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.800
I'll be sworn,

357
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.770
As my mother was,

358
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:40.830
the first hour I was born.

359
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.300
I do believe the swearer. What with me?

360
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.800
Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?

361
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.370
Two thousand, fair woman:

362
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.730
and I'll vouchsafe thee the hearing.

363
00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:54.800
There is one Mistress Ford, sir:

364
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.930
I pray, come a little nearer this ways:

365
00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.400
I myself dwell with master Doctor Caius,

366
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.670
Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--

367
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.700
Your worship says very true:

368
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.500
I pray your worship,

369
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.030
come a little nearer this ways.

370
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:13.270
I warrant thee, nobody hears;

371
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:18.200
mine own people, mine own people.

372
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.900
Are they so? God bless them

373
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.200
and make them his servants!

374
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:26.130
Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?

375
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.570
Why, sir, she's a good creature.

376
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.500
Lord Lord! your worship's a wanton!

377
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.100
Well, heaven forgive you

378
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.370
and all of us, I pray!

379
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.330
Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--

380
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.270
Marry, this is the short

381
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.970
and the long of it;

382
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.030
you have brought her

383
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.670
into such a canaries as 'tis wonderful.

384
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.000
The best courtier of them all,

385
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.400
when the court lay at Windsor,

386
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.700
could never have brought her

387
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.370
to such a canary.

388
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.530
Yet there has been knights,

389
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:57.300
and lords, and gentlemen,

390
00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.630
with their coaches,

391
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.830
I warrant you, coach after coach,

392
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.730
letter after letter,

393
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.600
gift after gift; smelling so sweetly,

394
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.270
all musk, and so rushling, I warrant you,

395
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.270
in silk and gold; and in such alligant terms;

396
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:11.700
that would have won any woman's heart;

397
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.670
and, I warrant you,

398
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.130
they could never get an eye-wink of her:

399
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.230
I had myself twenty angels

400
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:22.030
given me this morning;

401
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.400
but I defy all angels,

402
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.170
in any such sort, as they say,

403
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.400
but in the way of honesty:

404
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.830
and, I warrant you,

405
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.670
they could never get her so much

406
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.230
as sip on a cup with the proudest

407
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.270
of them all:

408
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.900
and yet there has been earls,

409
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.870
nay, which is more, pensioners;

410
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:44.070
but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

411
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.530
But what says she to me?

412
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.100
be brief, my good she-Mercury.

413
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.470
Marry, she hath received your letter,

414
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.970
for the which she thanks you

415
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.530
a thousand times;

416
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.070
and she gives you to notify

417
00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.800
that her husband will be absence

418
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.870
from his house between ten and eleven.

419
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.870
Ten and eleven?

420
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.070
Ay, forsooth;

421
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.670
and then you may come

422
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.270
and see the picture, she says,

423
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:12.600
that you wot of:

424
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.770
Master Ford, her husband,

425
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.100
will be from home.

426
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:18.300
Alas! the sweet woman

427
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.470
leads an ill life with him:

428
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.870
he's a very jealousy man:

429
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:25.500
she leads a very frampold life

430
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.900
with him, good heart.

431
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.700
Ten and eleven.

432
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.830
Woman, commend me to her;

433
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.370
I will not fail her.

434
00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:34.830
Why, you say well.

435
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.930
But I have another messenger

436
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.530
to your worship.

437
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.730
Mistress Page hath her

438
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.530
hearty commendations to you too:

439
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:50.500
and let me tell you in your ear,

440
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.430
she's as fartuous a civil modest wife,

441
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.000
and one, that will not miss you

442
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.330
morning nor evening prayer,

443
00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.070
as any is in Windsor,

444
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:02.270
whoe'er be the other:

445
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.900
and she bade me tell your worship

446
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.130
that her husband is seldom from home;

447
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.300
but she hopes there will come a time.

448
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.800
I never knew a woman so dote

449
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.970
upon a man:

450
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.900
surely I think you have charms,

451
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.600
la; yes, in truth.

452
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.800
Not I, I assure thee:

453
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.800
setting the attractions

454
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.900
of my good parts aside

455
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.600
I have no other charms.

456
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.130
Blessing on your heart for't!

457
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.870
But, I pray thee, tell me this:

458
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.800
has Ford's wife and Page's wife

459
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.970
acquainted each other how they love me?

460
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.700
That were a jest indeed!

461
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.900
they have not so little grace, I hope:

462
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.400
that were a trick indeed!

463
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.400
but Mistress Page would desire you

464
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.170
to send her your little page,

465
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.900
of all loves:

466
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.130
her husband has a marvellous infection

467
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.830
to the little page;

468
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.270
and truly Master Page is an honest man.

469
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.170
Never a wife in Windsor

470
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.270
leads a better life than she does:

471
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:05.730
do what she will, say what she will,

472
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.630
take all, pay all,

473
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.670
go to bed when she list,

474
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:08.670
rise when she list,

475
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:09.630
all is as she will:

476
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.430
and truly she deserves it;

477
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:12.900
for if there be a kind woman

478
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.730
in Windsor, she is one.

479
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.970
You must send her your page;

480
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.570
no remedy.

481
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.230
Why, I will.

482
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.030
Nay, but do so,

483
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.900
and, look you,

484
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.030
he may come and go between you both;

485
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.670
and in any case have a nay-word,

486
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.900
that you may know one another's mind,

487
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.900
and the boy never need

488
00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.530
to understand any thing;

489
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.930
for 'tis not good that children

490
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.470
should know any wickedness:

491
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.270
old folks, you know, have discretion,

492
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.570
as they say, and know the world.

493
00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.070
Fare thee well:

494
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.870
woman, commend me to them both:

495
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.800
there's my purse; I am yet thy debtor.

496
00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:01.970
Boy, go along with this woman.

497
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.300
This news distracts me!

498
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.670
This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:

499
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.470
Clap on more sails; pursue;

500
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.070
up with your fights:

501
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.000
Give fire: she is my prize,

502
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.830
or ocean whelm them all!

503
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.300
Sayest thou so, old Jack?

504
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.230
go thy ways;

505
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.670
I'll make more of thy old body

506
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.570
than I have done.

507
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.430
Will they yet look after thee?

508
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.630
Wilt thou, after the expense

509
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:54.400
of so much money, be now a gainer?

510
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.070
Good body, I thank thee.

511
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.700
Let them say 'tis grossly done;

512
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.270
so it be fairly done, no matter.

513
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:09.700
Sir John, there's one Master Brook

514
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.370
below would fain speak with you,

515
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.300
and be acquainted with you;

516
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.900
and hath sent your worship

517
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.230
a morning's draught of sack.

518
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.100
Brook is his name?

519
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.600
Ay, sir.

520
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.670
Call him in.

521
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.030
Such Brooks are welcome

522
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.870
that o'erflow such liquor.

523
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.170
Ah, ha!

524
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.070
Mistress Page and Mistress Ford

525
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.030
have I encompassed you? go to; via!

526
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.100
Bless you, sir!

527
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:51.870
And you, sir! Would you speak with me?

528
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.030
I make bold to press

529
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.530
with so little preparation upon you.

530
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.600
You're welcome. What's your will?

531
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.100
Give us leave, drawer.

532
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.100
Sir, I am a gentleman

533
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.070
that have spent much;

534
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.430
my name is Brook.

535
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.570
Good Master Brook,

536
00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.070
I desire more acquaintance of you.

537
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.900
Good Sir John, I sue for yours:

538
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.200
not to charge you;

539
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.670
for I must let you understand

540
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.170
I think myself in better plight

541
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.430
for a lender than you are:

542
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.570
the which hath something embolden'd me

543
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.100
to this unseasoned intrusion;

544
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.100
for they say, if money go before,

545
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.030
all ways do lie open.

546
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.700
Money is a good soldier, sir,

547
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.000
and will on.

548
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.770
Troth, and I have a bag

549
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.630
of money here troubles me:

550
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.070
if you will help to bear it, Sir John,

551
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.300
take all, or half, for easing me

552
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.770
of the carriage.

553
00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:00.130
Master Brook, I know not how I may deserve

554
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:01.500
to be your porter.

555
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.530
I will tell you, sir,

556
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.600
if you will give me the hearing.

557
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.700
Speak, good Master Brook:

558
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.700
I shall be glad to be your servant.

559
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.300
Sir, I hear you are a scholar,

560
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.730
I will be brief with you,

561
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.770
and you have been a man long known to me,

562
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.070
though I had never so good means, as desire,

563
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.070
to make myself acquainted with you.

564
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:20.630
I shall discover a thing to you,

565
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.730
wherein I must very much lay open

566
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.630
mine own imperfection:

567
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.470
but, good Sir John,

568
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.330
as you have one eye upon my follies,

569
00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.900
as you hear them unfolded,

570
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.370
turn another into the register

571
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.630
of your own;

572
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.630
that I may pass

573
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.870
with a reproof the easier,

574
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.830
sith you yourself know how easy

575
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.430
it is to be such an offender.

576
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.930
Very well, sir; proceed.

577
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:46.230
There is a gentlewoman in this town;

578
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.230
her husband's name is Ford.

579
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.900
Well, sir.

580
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.730
I have long loved her, and,

581
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:56.770
I protest to you,

582
00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.670
bestowed much on her;

583
00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.670
followed her

584
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.030
with a doting observance;

585
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.530
engrossed opportunities to meet her;

586
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.730
fee'd every slight occasion

587
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.770
that could but niggardly

588
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.100
give me sight of her;

589
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.430
not only bought many presents

590
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:09.070
to give her,

591
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.230
but have given largely

592
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.870
to many to know

593
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.470
what she would have given;

594
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.070
briefly, I have pursued her

595
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.770
as love hath pursued me;

596
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:17.700
which hath been

597
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.470
on the wing of all occasions.

598
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:21.970
But whatsoever I have merited,

599
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.030
either in my mind or,

600
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.270
in my means, meed,

601
00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.870
I am sure, I have received none;

602
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.770
unless experience be a jewel

603
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.700
that I have purchased

604
00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.330
at an infinite rate,

605
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.770
and that hath taught me to say this:

606
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.270
'Love like a shadow flies

607
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.930
when substance love pursues;

608
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.570
Pursuing that that flies,

609
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.900
and flying what pursues.'

610
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:43.730
Have you received no promise

611
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.070
of satisfaction at her hands?

612
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.000
Never.

613
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.800
Have you importuned her to such a purpose?

614
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.630
Never.

615
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.230
Of what quality was your love, then?

616
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.970
Like a fair house built

617
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.570
on another man's ground;

618
00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.400
so that I have lost my edifice

619
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.430
by mistaking the place

620
00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.270
where I erected it.

621
00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.200
To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?

622
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:05.270
When I have told you that,

623
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.700
I have told you all.

624
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:10.970
Some say, that though she appear

625
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.700
honest to me,

626
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.900
yet in other places

627
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.870
she enlargeth her mirth

628
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.700
so far that

629
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.400
there is shrewd construction

630
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.900
made of her.

631
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.730
Now, Sir John,

632
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.770
here is the heart of my purpose:

633
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.600
you are a gentleman

634
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.170
of excellent breeding,

635
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.600
admirable discourse,

636
00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.270
of great admittance,

637
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.270
authentic in your place and person,

638
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.100
generally allowed

639
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.270
for your many war-like, court-like,

640
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.370
and learned preparations.

641
00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.430
O, sir!

642
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.500
Believe it, for you know it.

643
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.430
There is money;

644
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.070
spend it,

645
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.270
spend it;

646
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.800
spend more;

647
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.300
spend all I have;

648
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.230
only give me so much

649
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.200
of your time in exchange of it,

650
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.470
as to lay an amiable siege

651
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.770
to the honesty of this Ford's wife:

652
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.500
use your art of wooing;

653
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.200
win her to consent to you:

654
00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:16.770
if any man may, you may as soon as any.

655
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:18.470
Would it apply well

656
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.330
to the vehemency

657
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.470
of your affection,

658
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.030
that I should win what you would enjoy?

659
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.000
Methinks you prescribe

660
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.830
to yourself very preposterously.

661
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.530
O, understand my drift.

662
00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.270
She dwells so securely

663
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.130
on the excellency of her honour,

664
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.370
that the folly of my soul

665
00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.030
dares not present itself:

666
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:36.270
she is too bright

667
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.370
to be looked against.

668
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:39.900
Now, could I could come to her

669
00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.600
with any detection in my hand,

670
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.030
my desires had instance

671
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.670
and argument to commend themselves:

672
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:46.370
I could drive her then

673
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.900
from the ward of her purity,

674
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.270
her reputation, her marriage-vow,

675
00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.500
and a thousand other her defences,

676
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.830
which now are too too strongly

677
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.930
embattled against me.

678
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.700
What say you to't, Sir John?

679
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.570
Master Brook,

680
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.100
I will first make bold

681
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.300
with your money;

682
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:13.530
next, give me your hand;

683
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.830
and last, as I am a gentleman,

684
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.300
you shall, if you will,

685
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.400
enjoy Ford's wife.

686
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.230
O good sir!

687
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.500
I say you shall.

688
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.000
Want no money, Sir John;

689
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.500
you shall want none.

690
00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.730
Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook;

691
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.700
you shall want none.

692
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.230
I shall be with her,

693
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.370
I may tell you,

694
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.930
by her own appointment;

695
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.170
even as you came in to me,

696
00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.630
her assistant or go-between parted from me:

697
00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.200
I say I shall be with her

698
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.470
between ten and eleven;

699
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:48.370
for at that time

700
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:50.700
the jealous rascally knave her husband

701
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.030
will be forth.

702
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:52.900
Come you to me at night;

703
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.270
you shall know how I speed.

704
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.300
I am blest in your acquaintance.

705
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.600
Do you know Ford, sir?

706
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.670
Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave!

707
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:03.470
I know him not:

708
00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.400
yet I wrong him to call him poor;

709
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.270
they say the jealous wittolly knave

710
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.670
hath masses of money;

711
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.570
for the which his wife

712
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.000
seems to me well-favored.

713
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.170
I will use her as the key

714
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:14.500
of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;

715
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.100
and there's my harvest-home.

716
00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.030
I would you knew Ford, sir,

717
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.170
that you might avoid him

718
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:20.930
if you saw him.

719
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:27.300
Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue!

720
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.500
I will stare him out of his wits;

721
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.070
I will awe him with my cudgel:

722
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.630
it shall hang like a meteor

723
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.830
o'er the cuckold's horns.

724
00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.830
Master Brook, thou shalt know

725
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:39.730
I will predominate over the peasant,

726
00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.600
and thou shalt lie with his wife.

727
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.370
Come to me soon at night.

728
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:49.200
Ford's a knave,

729
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.030
and I will aggravate his style;

730
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:57.770
and shalt know him for knave and cuckold.

731
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:00.370
Come to me soon at night.

732
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.470
What a damned Epicurean rascal is this!

733
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:11.700
My heart is ready to crack with impatience.

734
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.800
Who says this is improvident jealousy?

735
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.830
my wife hath sent to him;

736
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.800
the hour is fixed; the match is made.

737
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.070
Would any man have thought this?

738
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.000
See the hell of having a false woman!

739
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.570
My bed shall be abused,

740
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.470
my coffers ransacked,

741
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:30.000
my reputation gnawn at;

742
00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.770
and I shall not only

743
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.470
receive this villanous wrong,

744
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.570
but stand under the adoption

745
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.770
of abominable terms,

746
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.700
and by him that does me this wrong.

747
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:46.330
Terms! names! Amaimon sounds well;

748
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.730
Lucifer, well; Barbason, well;

749
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.600
yet they are devils' additions,

750
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.000
the names of fiends:

751
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.070
but Cuckold! Wittol!

752
00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:04.970
Cuckold! the devil himself

753
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.370
hath not such a name.

754
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:09.430
Page is an ass, a secure ass:

755
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.600
he will trust his wife;

756
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.070
he will not be jealous.

757
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.500
I will rather trust a Fleming

758
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.370
with my butter,

759
00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.570
Parson Hugh the Welshman with my cheese,

760
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.270
an Irishman with my aqua-vitae bottle,

761
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.800
or a thief to walk my ambling gelding,

762
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.500
than my wife with herself;

763
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.270
then she plots,

764
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.400
then she ruminates,

765
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.530
then she devises;

766
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.600
and what they think in their hearts

767
00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:30.430
they may effect,

768
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.770
they will break their hearts

769
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.700
but they will effect.

770
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.570
God be praised for my jealousy!

771
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.100
Eleven o'clock the hour.

772
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.130
I will prevent this, detect my wife,

773
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:42.470
be revenged on Falstaff,

774
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.230
and laugh at Page.

775
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.030
I will about it;

776
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.130
better three hours too soon

777
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.500
than a minute too late.

778
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.870
Fie, fie, fie!

779
00:30:54.470 --> 00:31:06.530
cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

780
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:16.470
