00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800


2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.230
Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;

3
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.100
For through this glade anon the deer will come;

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.270
And in this covert will we make our stand,

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.670
Culling the principal of all the deer.

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.470
I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.430
That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.830
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.430
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:

10
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.900
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,

11
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.600
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day

12
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.700
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.

13
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.300
Hey, here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.330
From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.730
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.

16
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.330
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;

17
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.400
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,

18
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.530
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:

19
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.570
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,

20
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.200
No humble suitors press to speak for right,

21
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.230
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;

22
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.530
For how can I help them, and not myself?

23
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.630
Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:

24
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.400
This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.

25
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.600
Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,

26
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.270
For wise men say it is the wisest course.

27
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600
Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.

28
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.830
Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.

29
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.930
My queen and son are gone to France for aid;

30
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.070
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick

31
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.530
Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister

32
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.170
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,

33
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.170
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;

34
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.770
For Warwick is a subtle orator,

35
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.170
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.

36
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.970
By this account then Margaret may win him;

37
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.470
For she's a woman to be pitied much:

38
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.330
Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;

39
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.770
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,

40
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.370
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.

41
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.830
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;

42
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.500
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;

43
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.200
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;

44
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.000
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,

45
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.900
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,

46
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.370
And in conclusion wins the king from her,

47
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.730
With promise of his sister, and what else,

48
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.470
To strengthen and support King Edward's place.

49
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.470
O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,

50
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.930
Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!

51
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.830
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?

52
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.000
More than I seem, and less than I was born to:

53
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.170
A man at least, for less I should not be;

54
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.530
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

55
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.800
Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.

56
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.270
Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.

57
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.670
But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?

58
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.170
My crown is in my heart, not on my head;

59
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.600
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,

60
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.730
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:

61
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.200
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

62
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.130
Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,

63
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.470
Your crown content and you must be contented

64
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.830
To go along with us; for as we think,

65
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.470
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;

66
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.230
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance

67
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.530
Will apprehend you as his enemy.

68
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.670
But did you never swear, and break an oath?

69
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.670
No, never such an oath; nor will not now.

70
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.830
Where did you dwell when I was King of England?

71
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.930
Here in this country, where we now remain.

72
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.930
I was anointed king at nine months old;

73
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.030
My father and my grandfather were kings,

74
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.630
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:

75
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.070
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?

76
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.370
No;

77
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.470
For we were subjects but while you were king.

78
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.530
Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?

79
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:30.200
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!

80
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.300
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,

81
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.870
And as the air blows it to me again,

82
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.470
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,

83
00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.030
And yielding to another when it blows,

84
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.600
Commanded always by the greater gust;

85
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.270
Such is the lightness of you common men.

86
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.170
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin

87
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.300
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.

88
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.300
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;

89
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.700
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.

90
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.130
We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.

91
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.900
So would you be again to Henry,

92
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.230
If he were seated as King Edward is.

93
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.070
We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,

94
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.700
To go with us unto the officers.

95
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.200
In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:

96
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.870
And what God will, that let your king perform;

97
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.170
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.

98
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:05.700
Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field

99
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.970
This lady's husband, Sir John Grey, was slain,

100
00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.900
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:

101
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.670
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;

102
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.500
Which we in justice cannot well deny,

103
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.430
Because in quarrel of the house of York

104
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.100
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

105
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.330
Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;

106
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.530
It were dishonour to deny it her.

107
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:35.800
It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.

108
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.570
Yea, is it so?

109
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.770
I see the lady hath a thing to grant,

110
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.930
Before the king will grant her humble suit.

111
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.870
He knows the game: how true he keeps the wind!

112
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.400
Silence!

113
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.670
Widow, we will consider of your suit;

114
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.800
And come some other time to know our mind.

115
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.400
Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:

116
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.770
May it please your highness to resolve me now;

117
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.930
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.

118
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.770
Ay, widow? then I'll warrant you all your lands,

119
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.900
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.

120
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.370
Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a clap.

121
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.070
I fear her not, unless she chance to fall.

122
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.270
Merry. God's forbot! for he'll take vantages.

123
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.430
How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.

124
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.930
I think he means to beg a child of her.

125
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.230
Nay, whip me then: he'll rather give her two.

126
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.000
Three, my most gracious lord.

127
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.470
You shall have four, if you'll be ruled by him.

128
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.800
'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.

129
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.630
Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

130
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.070
Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.

131
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.970
Ay, good leave have you; for you will have leave,

132
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.230
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.

133
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.100
Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?

134
00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.730
Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

135
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.300
And would you not do much to do them good?

136
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.470
To do them good, I would sustain some harm.

137
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.570
Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.

138
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.770
Therefore I came unto your majesty.

139
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:22.400
I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.

140
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.000
So shall you bind me to your highness' service.

141
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:32.430
What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?

142
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:35.130
What you command, that rests in me to do.

143
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.430
But you will take exceptions to my boon.

144
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.100
No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

145
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:44.330
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.

146
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.670
Why, then I will do what your grace commands.

147
00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.530
He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble.

148
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.870
As red as fire! nay, then her wax must melt.

149
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.970
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?

150
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:04.570
An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.

151
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.100
That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.

152
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.600
Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.

153
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.100
I take my leave with many thousand thanks.

154
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.930
But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

155
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.170
The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.

156
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.370
Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.

157
00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.970
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?

158
00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:39.000
My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;

159
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.100
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.

160
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.830
No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.

161
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:49.630
Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.

162
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.570
But now you partly may perceive my mind.

163
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.270
My mind will never grant what I perceive

164
00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.630
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.

165
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:04.970
To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.

166
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:12.030
To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.

167
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.370
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.

168
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.500
Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;

169
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.600
For by that loss I will not purchase them.

170
00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.630
Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.

171
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.400
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.

172
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.300
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination

173
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.570
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:

174
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.970
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'

175
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.030
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;

176
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.630
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.

177
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:48.900
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.

178
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.270
The widow likes him not, she knits her brows.

179
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.270
He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.

180
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.170
Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;

181
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.230
Her words do show her wit incomparable;

182
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:08.430
All her perfections challenge sovereignty:

183
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.030
One way or other, she is for a king;

184
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:17.000
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--

185
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.100
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?

186
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.800
'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:

187
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.700
I am a subject fit to jest withal,

188
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.870
But far unfit to be a sovereign.

189
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.400
Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee

190
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.070
I speak no more than what my soul intends;

191
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.970
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

192
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.530
And that is more than I will yield unto:

193
00:13:56.530 --> 00:14:00.230
I know I am too mean to be your queen,

194
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.670
And yet too good to be your concubine.

195
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:08.370
You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.

196
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.870
'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.

197
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.270
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.

198
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.530
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;

199
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.400
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,

200
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.770
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing

201
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.870
To be the father unto many sons.

202
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:32.700
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

203
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.100
The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.

204
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.300
When he was made a shriver, 'twas for shift.

205
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.100
Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.

206
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.770
The widow likes it not, for she looks vexed.

207
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.800
You'll think it strange if I should marry her.

208
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.070
To whom, my lord?

209
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.830
Why, Clarence, to myself.

210
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.830
That would be ten days' wonder at the least.

211
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.370
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.

212
00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.600
By so much is the wonder in extremes.

213
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:10.400
Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both

214
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.870
Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.

215
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:20.430
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,

216
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.170
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.

217
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:26.300
See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:

218
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.630
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,

219
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.300
To question of his apprehension.

220
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:39.230
Sweet widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.

221
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.200
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.

222
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.470
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,

223
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.700
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,

224
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:05.600
To cross me from the golden time I look for!

225
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.870
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--

226
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.030
The lustful Edward's title buried--

227
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:16.600
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,

228
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.770
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,

229
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.700
To take their rooms, ere I can plant myself:

230
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:28.270
A cold premeditation for my purpose!

231
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.900
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;

232
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.870
Like one that stands upon a promontory,

233
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.700
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,

234
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.270
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,

235
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.670
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,

236
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.070
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:

237
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.330
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;

238
00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.130
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;

239
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.370
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,

240
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:52.670
Flattering me with impossibilities.

241
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.300
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,

242
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.700
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.

243
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:09.270
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;

244
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.900
What other pleasure can the world afford?

245
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:16.970
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,

246
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.530
And deck my body in gay ornaments,

247
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:25.300
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.

248
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.730
O miserable thought! and more unlikely

249
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.730
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!

250
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.930
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:

251
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.170
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,

252
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.670
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,

253
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:48.300
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;

254
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.400
To make an envious mountain on my back,

255
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.970
Where sits deformity to mock my body;

256
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.330
To shape my legs of an unequal size;

257
00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.370
To disproportion me in every part,

258
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.870
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp

259
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.970
That carries no impression like the dam.

260
00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.200
And am I then a man to be beloved?

261
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.000
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!

262
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.470
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,

263
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.100
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such

264
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.100
As are of better person than myself,

265
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.400
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,

266
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.070
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,

267
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.670
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head

268
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:33.730
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.

269
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.770
And yet I know not how to get the crown,

270
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.930
For many lives stand between me and home:

271
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.300
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,

272
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.900
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,

273
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.830
Seeking a way and straying from the way;

274
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.900
Not knowing how to find the open air,

275
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.970
But toiling desperately to find it out,--

276
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.600
Torment myself to catch the English crown:

277
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600
And from that torment I will free myself,

278
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.230
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.

279
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:08.200
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,

280
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.170
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,

281
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.730
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,

282
00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.000
And frame my face to all occasions.

283
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.330
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;

284
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.930
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;

285
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.330
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,

286
00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.000
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,

287
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.070
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.

288
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.570
I can add colours to the chameleon,

289
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.170
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,

290
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.270
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.

291
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.970
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?

292
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.100
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

293
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.770


294
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.900
Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,

295
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.700
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state

296
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.000
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

297
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.070
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret

298
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.930
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve

299
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.630
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,

300
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.470
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:

301
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.200
But now mischance hath trod my title down,

302
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.470
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;

303
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.730
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,

304
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.570
And to my humble state conform myself.

305
00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:01.270
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

306
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.730
From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears

307
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:10.630
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.

308
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:16.270
Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,

309
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:18.270
And sit thee by our side:

310
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.370
Yield not thy neck

311
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.000
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind

312
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.630
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.

313
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.500
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;

314
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.870
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.

315
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.570
Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts

316
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.770
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.

317
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.700
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,

318
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.030
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,

319
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.300
Is of a king become a banish'd man,

320
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.970
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;

321
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:04.170
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York

322
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.970
Usurps the regal title and the seat

323
00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:09.930
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.

324
00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.300
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,

325
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:17.230
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,

326
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:22.130
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;

327
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.700
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:

328
00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.000
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;

329
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.930
Our people and our peers are both misled,

330
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.770
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,

331
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:41.130
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

332
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.670
Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,

333
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.430
While we bethink a means to break it off.

334
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.700
The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.

335
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.400
The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.

336
00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:00.170
O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.

337
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.230
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!

338
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.130
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?

339
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:14.500
Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.

340
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.900
Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?

341
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.770
Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;

342
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.070
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.

343
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.270
From worthy Edward, King of Albion,

344
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.270
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,

345
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.870
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,

346
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.330
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;

347
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.100
And then to crave a league of amity;

348
00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.030
And lastly, to confirm that amity

349
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.230
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant

350
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.800
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,

351
00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.870
To England's king in lawful marriage.

352
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.500
If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.

353
00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:00.330
And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,

354
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:01.970
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,

355
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:07.700
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue

356
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.770
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;

357
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.270
Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,

358
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.030
Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.

359
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:22.000
King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,

360
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.630
Before you answer Warwick. His demand

361
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.670
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,

362
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.470
But from deceit bred by necessity;

363
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.470
For how can tyrants safely govern home,

364
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.230
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?

365
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.830
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,

366
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.830
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,

367
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:49.330
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.

368
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:53.070
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage

369
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.870
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;

370
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.200
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,

371
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.170
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

372
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.430
Injurious Margaret!

373
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.670
And why not queen?

374
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.770
Because thy father Henry did usurp;

375
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:12.870
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.

376
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:15.270
Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,

377
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.570
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;

378
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.800
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,

379
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.700
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;

380
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.100
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,

381
00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.400
Who by his prowess conquered all France:

382
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.170
From these our Henry lineally descends.

383
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.770
Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,

384
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:38.400
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost

385
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.830
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?

386
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.930
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.

387
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.530
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree

388
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.200
Of threescore and two years; a silly time

389
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.800
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.

390
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.430
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,

391
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.200
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,

392
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.730
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

393
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.100
Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,

394
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.630
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?

395
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:08.830
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.

396
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.530
Call him my king by whose injurious doom

397
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.300
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,

398
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.570
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,

399
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.200
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,

400
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.030
When nature brought him to the door of death?

401
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.300
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,

402
00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.900
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.

403
00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.300
And I the house of York.

404
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.800
Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,

405
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.430
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,

406
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:37.700
While I use further conference with Warwick.

407
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.300
Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!

408
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:47.730
Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,

409
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.770
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath

410
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.670
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.

411
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.170
Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.

412
00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:58.700
But is he gracious in the people's eye?

413
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.970
The more that Henry was unfortunate.

414
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:06.230
Then further, all dissembling set aside,

415
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.330
Tell me for truth the measure of his love

416
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:11.130
Unto our sister Bona.

417
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.000
Such it seems

418
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.630
As may beseem a monarch like himself.

419
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:20.930
Myself have often heard him say and swear

420
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:24.930
That this his love was an eternal plant,

421
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.000
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,

422
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.430
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,

423
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.730
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,

424
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.800
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.

425
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.930
Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.

426
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.500
Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:

427
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.570
Yet I confess that often ere this day,

428
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.970
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,

429
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.400
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

430
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.430
Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;

431
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.270
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn

432
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.430
Touching the jointure that your king must make,

433
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.630
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.

434
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.530
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness

435
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.600
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.

436
00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.630
To Edward, but not to the English king.

437
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.530
Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device

438
00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:33.000
By this alliance to make void my suit:

439
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.100
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.

440
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.400
And still is friend to him and Margaret:

441
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.000
But if your title to the crown be weak,

442
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.930
As may appear by Edward's good success,

443
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:45.500
Then 'tis but reason that I be released

444
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.600
From giving aid which late I promised.

445
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.570
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand

446
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.130
That your estate requires and mine can yield.

447
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.700
Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,

448
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.930
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.

449
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.230
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,

450
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.770
You have a father able to maintain you;

451
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.500
And better 'twere you troubled him than France.

452
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.970
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,

453
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:16.530
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!

454
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.330
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,

455
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.900
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold

456
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.900
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;

457
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.030
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.

458
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.070
(horns sound)

459
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.000
Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

460
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.770
My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,

461
00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:40.470
Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:

462
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.400
These from our king unto your majesty:

463
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:48.000
And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.

464
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.070
Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?

465
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.900
Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.

466
00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.630
Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.

467
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.500
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!

468
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.330
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,

469
00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.270
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?

470
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.470
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?

471
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.570
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?

472
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.400
I told your majesty as much before:

473
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:46.830
This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.

474
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.930
King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,

475
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.830
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,

476
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:56.930
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,

477
00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:00.270
No more my king, for he dishonours me,

478
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:04.930
But most himself, if he could see his shame.

479
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:11.770
Did I impale him with the regal crown?

480
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.600
Did I put Henry from his native right?

481
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.670
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?

482
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:22.170
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:

483
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.870
And to repair my honour lost for him,

484
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:35.700
I here renounce him and return to Henry.

485
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.770
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,

486
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.670
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:

487
00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.370
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,

488
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:50.430
And replant Henry in his former state.

489
00:31:51.300 --> 00:32:01.900
Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;

490
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:06.370
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,

491
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:10.970
And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.

492
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:16.200
So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,

493
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.400
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us

494
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.600
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,

495
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.930
I'll undertake to land them on our coast

496
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:25.200
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.

497
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.900
Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged

498
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.470
But by thy help to this distressed queen?

499
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:34.370
Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,

500
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.670
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?

501
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.770
My quarrel and this English queen's are one.

502
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.470
And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.

503
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.370
And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.

504
00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:46.000
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved

505
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.270
You shall have aid.

506
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.770
Let me give humble thanks for all at once.

507
00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.030
Then, England's messenger, return in post,

508
00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:55.000
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,

509
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.630
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers

510
00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:00.500
To revel it with him and his new bride:

511
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:04.130
Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.

512
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.730
Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,

513
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.970
I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.

514
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.270
Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,

515
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.200
And I am ready to put armour on.

516
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.730
Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,

517
00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:25.500
And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.

518
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.930
There's thy reward: be gone.

519
00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.930
But, Warwick,

520
00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.770
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,

521
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.900
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;

522
00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.900
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen

523
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.530
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.

524
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:45.030
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,

525
00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:50.600
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

526
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.670
This shall assure my constant loyalty,

527
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:01.530
That if our queen and this young prince agree,

528
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.530
I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy

529
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.200
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

530
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:14.300
Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.

531
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.170
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,

532
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.200
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;

533
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.330
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,

534
00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:26.000
That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.

535
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.270
Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;

536
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.730
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

537
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:40.030
Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,

538
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.530
I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,

539
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.700
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.

540
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:11.200
I came from Edward as ambassador,

541
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.500
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:

542
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.630
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,

543
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.930
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.

544
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.970
Had he none else to make a stale but me?

545
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.300
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.

546
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.530
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,

547
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.370
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:

548
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:43.700
Not that I pity Henry's misery,

549
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:49.200
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.

550
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.200
