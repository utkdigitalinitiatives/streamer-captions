00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.630


2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.500
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.170
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.

4
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.470
The weary way hath made you melancholy.

5
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.630
No, Uncle, but our crosses on the way

6
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.970
have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.

7
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.170
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

8
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.500
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years

9
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
hath not yet dived into the world's deceit.

10
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
Nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show,

11
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
which God, he knows,

12
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.900
seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.

13
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.070
Those uncles which you want were dangerous.

14
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.330
Your grace attended to their sugared words

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.270
but looked not on the poison of their hearts.

16
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.500
God keep you from them and from such false friends.

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.700
God keep me from false friends.

18
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.430
But they were none.

19
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.600
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.770
God bless your grace with health and happy days.

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.200
I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.

22
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.200
I thought my mother and my brother York

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.030
would long ere this have met us on the way.

24
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.330
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not to tell us

25
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.300
whether they will come or no.

26
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.000
And in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.400
Welcome, my lord.

28
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.930
What, will our mother come?

29
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.970
On what occasion, God he knows, not I,

30
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030
the queen your mother and your brother York

31
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.730
have taken sanctuary.

32
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.800
The tender prince would fain have come with me

33
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.000
to meet your grace

34
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.430
but by his mother was perforce withheld.

35
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.530
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course

36
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:07.870
is this of hers.

37
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.600
Lord cardinal, will your grace persuade the queen

38
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.930
to send the Duke of York

39
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.800
unto his princely brother presently?

40
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him

41
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.200
and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.300
My lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory

43
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.270
can from his mother win the Duke of York,

44
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.830
anon expect him here.

45
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.000
But if she be obdurate to mild entreaties,

46
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.500
God in Heaven forbid

47
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.000
we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary.

48
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.070
Not for all this land would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

49
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.500
You are too senseless-- obstinate, my lord,

50
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.300
too ceremonious and traditional.

51
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.770
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age.

52
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.800
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.

53
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.530
The benefit thereof is always granted

54
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.200
to those whose dealings have deserved the place

55
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.130
and those who have the wit to claim the place.

56
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.630
This prince hath neither claimed it nor deserved it

57
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.930
and therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.

58
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.930
Then taking him from thence that is not there,

59
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.970
you break no privilege nor charter there.

60
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.570
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,

61
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.770
but sanctuary children...

62
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.800
Never till now.

63
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.270
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.

64
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.500
Come on, Lord Hastings; will you go with me?

65
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.300
I go, my lord.

66
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.070
Good lords...

67
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.570
Make all the speedy haste you may.

68
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.700
Say, Uncle Gloucester...

69
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.900
If our brother come,

70
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.900
where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

71
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.200
Where it seems best unto your royal self.

72
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.700
If I may counsel you, some day or two,

73
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.570
your highness shall repose you at the Tower,

74
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.530
then where you please and shall be thought most fit

75
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.770
for your best health and recreation.

76
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.830
I do not like the tower of any place.

77
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.430
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

78
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.300
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,

79
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.000
which since succeeding ages have re-edified.

80
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.300
Is it upon record or else reported successively

81
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.870
from age to age, he built it?

82
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.430
Upon record, my gracious lord.

83
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.100
But say, my lord, it were not registered,

84
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.000
methinks the truth should live from age to age,

85
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.400
as 'twere retailed to all posterity,

86
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.630
even to the general all-ending day.

87
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.930
So wise so young, they say, do ne'er live long.

88
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.930
What say you, Uncle?

89
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.470
I say without characters, fame lives long.

90
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.830
That Julius Caesar was a famous man.

91
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.530
With what his valor did enrich his wit,

92
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.930
his wit set down to make his valor live.

93
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.530
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,

94
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.430
for now he lives in fame, though not in life.

95
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.700
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham.

96
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.270
What, my gracious lord?

97
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.100
An if I live until I be a man,

98
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.170
I'll win our ancient right in France again

99
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.970
or die a soldier as I lived a king.

100
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.970
Short summers lightly have a forward spring.

101
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.900
Now in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

102
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.370
Richard of York.

103
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.300
How fares our loving brother?

104
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.870
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.

105
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.300
Aye, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.

106
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.870
Too late he died that might have kept that title

107
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.430
which by his death hath lost much majesty.

108
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.830
How fares our cousin, noble lord of York?

109
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.130
I thank you, gentle uncle.

110
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.000
O, my lord, you said that idle weeds are fast in growth.

111
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.500
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.

112
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.230
He hath, my lord.

113
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.030
And therefore, is he idle?

114
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.470
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.

115
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.000
Then is he more beholding to you than I.

116
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.430
He may command me as my sovereign,

117
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.970
but you have power in me as in a kinsman.

118
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.970
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

119
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.400
My dagger, little cousin?

120
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.770
With all my heart.

121
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.470
A beggar, brother?

122
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.100
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give

123
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.930
and being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

124
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.470
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.

125
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.600
A greater gift.

126
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.570
Then that's the sword to it.

127
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.630
Aye, gentle cousin, were it light enough.

128
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.770
O, then I see you will but part with light gifts.

129
00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.900
In weightier things, you'll say a beggar nay.

130
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.630
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.

131
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.700
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

132
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.030
What? Would you have my weapon, little lord?

133
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.200
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

134
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200
How?

135
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.530
Little.

136
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.000
My lord of York will still be cross in talk.

137
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.730
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.

138
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.100
You mean to bear me, not to bear with me.

139
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.630
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me.

140
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.830
Because that I am little like an ape,

141
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.400
he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

142
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.430
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons.

143
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.400
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,

144
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.730
he prettily and aptly taunts himself.

145
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.570
So cunning and so young is wonderful.

146
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.030
My lord, will it please you pass along?

147
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.670
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham will to your mother

148
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.600
to entreat of her to meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

149
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.570
What? Will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

150
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.930
My lord protector needs will have it so.

151
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.670
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

152
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.270
Why? What should you fear?

153
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.300
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.

154
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.900
My grandam told me he was murdered there.

155
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.800
I fear no uncles dead.

156
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.630
Nor none that live, I hope.

157
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.100
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.

158
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.430
But come, my lord.

159
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.470
With a heavy heart, thinking on them,

160
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.930
go I unto the Tower.

161
00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.170
Think you, my lord, this little prating York

162
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.500
was not incensed by his subtle mother

163
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.130
to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

164
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.200
No doubt, no doubt.

165
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.630
O, 'tis a parlous boy:

166
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.530
bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.

167
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.070
He is all the mother's from the top to toe.

168
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.230
Well, let them rest.

169
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.600
Come hither, Catesby.

170
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.600
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend

171
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.870
as closely to conceal what we impart.

172
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.000
What think'st thou?

173
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.270
Is it not an easy matter

174
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.900
to make William Lord Hastings of our mind

175
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.730
for the installment of this noble duke

176
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.200
in the seat royal of this famous isle?

177
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.070
He for his father's sake so loves the prince

178
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.200
that he will not be won to aught against him.

179
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.400
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley?

180
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.100
What will he?

181
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.500
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

182
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.870
Well, then, no more but this.

183
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.770
Go, gentle Catesby.

184
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:57.130
And as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings,

185
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.570
how he doth stand affected to our purpose.

186
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.200
And summon him tomorrow to the Tower

187
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.370
to sit about the coronation.

188
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.030
If thou dost find him tractable to us,

189
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.400
encourage him, and tell him all our reasons.

190
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.170
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,

191
00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:14.200
be thou so too and so break off the talk

192
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.430
and give us notice of his inclination,

193
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:18.930
for we tomorrow hold divided councils

194
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.000
wherein thyself shall highly be employed.

195
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.970
Commend me to Lord Hastings.

196
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.600
Tell him, Catesby,

197
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.100
his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries

198
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.200
tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle.

199
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.900
And bid my lord for joy of this good news

200
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.370
give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

201
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.870
Good Catesby, go; effect this business soundly.

202
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.070
My good lords both, with all the heed I can.

203
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.200
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

204
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.130
You shall, my lord.

205
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.070
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.

206
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.230
Now, my lord, what shall we do

207
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.770
if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

208
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.570
Chop off his head, man.

209
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.630
Somewhat we will do.

210
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.030
And look, when I am king,

211
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.070
claim thou of me the earldom of Hereford

212
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.930
and all the movables

213
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.130
whereof the king my brother was possessed.

214
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:24.770
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.

215
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.570
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.

216
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.270
Come, let us sup betimes,

217
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.370
that afterwards, we may digest our complots in some form.

218
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.770
My lord.

219
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.330
My lord.

220
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.470
Who knocks?

221
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.130
One from the Lord Stanley.

222
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.800
What is't o'clock?

223
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.170
Upon the stroke of four.

224
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.730
Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?

225
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.400
So it appears by that I have to say.

226
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.100
First, he commends him to the noble sir.

227
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.270
And what then?

228
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.230
Then sends upon your lordship that this night,

229
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.970
he dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.

230
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.600
Besides, he says there are two councils kept

231
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.770
and that may be determined at the one

232
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.600
which may make you and him to rue at the other.

233
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.830
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,

234
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.570
if you will presently take horse with him

235
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.830
and with all speed post with him toward the north

236
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.100
and shun the danger that his soul divines.

237
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.100
Go, fellow, go.

238
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.730
Return unto thy lord.

239
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.930
Bid him not fear the separated council.

240
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.930
His honor and myself are at the one,

241
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.470
and at the other is my good friend Catesby,

242
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.100
where nothing can proceed that toucheth us

243
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.670
whereof I shall not have intelligence.

244
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.300
Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance.

245
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.600
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so simple

246
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.700
to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers.

247
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.700
To fly the boar before the boar pursues

248
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.200
were to incense the boar to follow us

249
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.870
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase.

250
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.930
Go.

251
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.870
Bid thy master rise and come to me,

252
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.200
and we will both together to the Tower,

253
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.400
where he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.

254
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.470
I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.

255
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.370
Oh.

256
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.070
Many good morrows to my noble lord.

257
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.970
Good morrow, Catesby.

258
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.700
You are early stirring.

259
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.230
What news?

260
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.070
What news, in this, our tottering state?

261
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.530
O, it is a reeling world indeed, my lord.

262
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.670
And I believe 'twill never stand upright

263
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.400
till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

264
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.700
How wear the garland?

265
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.130
O, dost thou mean the crown?

266
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.270
Aye, my good lord.

267
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.900
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders

268
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.300
before I'll see the crown so foul misplaced.

269
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.530
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

270
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.800
Aye, on my life.

271
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.500
And hopes to find you forward upon his party

272
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.100
for the gain thereof.

273
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.270
And thereupon he sends you this good news:

274
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.970
that this same very day, your enemies,

275
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.830
the kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.

276
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.970
Indeed, I am no mourner for this news...

277
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.870
Because they have been still my adversaries.

278
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.570
But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,

279
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.100
to bar my master's heirs in true descent,

280
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.670
God knows I will not do it.

281
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.970
To the death.

282
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.900
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind.

283
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.370
But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,

284
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.700
that they which brought me in my master's hate,

285
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.700
I live to look upon their tragedy.

286
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.870
O, Catesby.

287
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.730
Ere a fortnight make me older,

288
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.970
I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.

289
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.670
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,

290
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.000
when men are unprepared and look not for it.

291
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.270
O monstrous, monstrous.

292
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:40.370
So falls it out with Rivers, Vaughan, Grey.

293
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.700
And so 'twill do with some men else

294
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.370
who think themselves as safe as thou and I,

295
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.900
who, as thou know'st,

296
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.470
are dear to princely Richard and to Buckingham.

297
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.130
The princes both make high account of you,

298
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.230
for they account his head upon the bridge.

299
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.930
I know they do.

300
00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:59.730
And I have well deserved it.

301
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.200
Come on, come on.

302
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.970
Where is your boar spear, man?

303
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.800
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided?

304
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.230
My lord, good morrow.

305
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.970
Morrow, Catesby.

306
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.500
You may jest on, but by the holy rood,

307
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.200
I do not like these several councils, I...

308
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.800
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you.

309
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.670
And never in my days, I do protest,

310
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.100
was it so precious to me as 'tis now.

311
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.470
Think you but that I know our state secure,

312
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.730
I would be so triumphant as I am?

313
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.070
The lords at Pomfret,

314
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:43.900
when they rode from London, were jocund

315
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.770
and supposed their states were sure,

316
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.000
and they indeed had no cause to mistrust,

317
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.800
and yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.

318
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.170
This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt.

319
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.500
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.

320
00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.100
What, shall we toward the Tower?

321
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.330
The night is spent.

322
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:09.800
Come, come; have with you.

323
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.600
Wot you what, my lord?

324
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:31.130
Today the lords you talked of are beheaded.

325
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.230
They for their truth might better wear their heads

326
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.700
than some that have accused them wear their hats.

327
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.130
Come, my lord; let's away.

328
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.130
Go on before.

329
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.600
I'll talk with this good fellow.

330
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.600
Well met, Hastings.

331
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.230
How goes the world with thee?

332
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.900
The better that your lordship please to ask.

333
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.630
I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now

334
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.130
than when I met thee last.

335
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.330
Where now we meet,

336
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.930
then was I going prisoner to the Tower

337
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.730
by the suggestion of the queen's allies.

338
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.070
But now I tell thee-- keep it to thyself--

339
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.400
this day, those enemies are put to death,

340
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.700
and I in better state than e'er I was.

341
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.930
God hold it to your honor's good content.

342
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.630
Gramercy, Hastings.

343
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.000
There.

344
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Drink that for me.

345
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.430
Why, thank you, Robert.

346
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.030
Well met, my lord.

347
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.970
I am glad to see your honor.

348
00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.800
I thank you kindly, good Sir John.

349
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.600
I am in your debt for your last exercise.

350
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.170
Come the next Sabbath, I will content you.

351
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.330
What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?

352
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.770
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest.

353
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.600
Your honor hath no shriving work in hand.

354
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.770
Good faith, and when I met this holy man,

355
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.700
the men you talked of came into my mind.

356
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.230
What, go you toward the Tower?

357
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.530
I do, my lord.

358
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.170
But long I cannot stay there.

359
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.970
I shall return before your lordship thence.

360
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.600
Hey, like enough, for I stay dinner there.

361
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.970
And supper too, although thou know'st it not.

362
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.230
I'll wait upon your lordship.

363
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.600
Come. Shall we go?

364
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.630
I'll wait upon your lordship.

365
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.930
Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this:

366
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.630
Today shalt thou behold a subject die

367
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.000
for truth, for duty, and for loyalty!

368
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.870
God bless the prince from all the pack of you.

369
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.300
A knot you are of damned bloodsuckers!

370
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.470
You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter!

371
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.770
Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.

372
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.770
O Pomfret, Pomfret!

373
00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.600
O thou bloody prison,

374
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.930
fatal and ominous to noble peers.

375
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.600
Within the guilty closure of thy walls,

376
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.930
Richard II here was hacked to death.

377
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:49.130
And for more slander to thy dismal seat,

378
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:54.000
we give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.

379
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.630
Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon our heads

380
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.930
when she exclaimed on Hastings, you, and I,

381
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.000
for standing by when Richard stabbed her son.

382
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.570
Then cursed she Richard.

383
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.870
Then cursed she Buckingham.

384
00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.630
Then cursed she Hastings.

385
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.530
O, remember, God,

386
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.570
to hear her prayer for them as now for us

387
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.100
and for my sister and her princely sons.

388
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.470
Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,

389
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:34.900
which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.

390
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.330
Make haste.

391
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.500
The hour of death is expiate.

392
00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.530
Come, Grey.

393
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.230
Come, Vaughan.

394
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:03.400
Let us here embrace.

395
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.030
Farewell until we meet again in Heaven.

396
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.200
Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met

397
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.200
is to determine of the coronation.

398
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.870
In God's name, speak.

399
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.670
When is the royal day?

400
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.700
Is all things ready for the royal time?

401
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.570
It is, and wants but nomination.

402
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:31.100
Tomorrow, then, I judge the happy day.

403
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.900
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?

404
00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.470
Who is most inward with the noble duke?

405
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.530
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

406
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.230
We know each other's faces.

407
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.530
For our hearts,

408
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.830
he knows no more of mine than I of yours

409
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.000
or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.

410
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.870
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

411
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.070
I thank his grace. I know he loves me well.

412
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.800
But for his purpose in the coronation,

413
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.400
I have not sounded him,

414
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.600
nor he delivered his gracious pleasure any way therein.

415
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.170
But you, my honorable lords, may name the time,

416
00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.800
and in the duke's behalf, I'll give my voice,

417
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.700
which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

418
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.930
Ah, in happy time, here comes the duke himself.

419
00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.370
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.

420
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.600
I have been long a sleeper.

421
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.870
But I trust my absence doth neglect no great design

422
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.030
which by my presence might have been concluded.

423
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:32.130
Had not you come upon your cue, my lord,

424
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.470
William, Lord Hastings, had pronounced your part--

425
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.500
I mean, your voice-- for crowning of the king.

426
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:44.170
Than my lord Hastings, no man might be bolder.

427
00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.030
His lordship knows me well and loves me well.

428
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.570
My lord of Ely.

429
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.830
When I was last in Holborn,

430
00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.470
I saw good strawberries in your garden there.

431
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.370
I do beseech you send for some of them.

432
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.170
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

433
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.870
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.

434
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.970
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business

435
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.400
and finds the testy gentleman so hot

436
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.930
that he will lose his head ere give consent

437
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.430
his master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,

438
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.100
shall lose the royalty of England's throne.

439
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.170
Withdraw yourself awhile.

440
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.500
I'll go with you.

441
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.100
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.

442
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.770
Tomorrow, in my judgment, is too sudden,

443
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.500
for I myself am not so well provided

444
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.800
as else I would be were the day prolonged.

445
00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.870
Where is my lord, the duke of Gloucester?

446
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.030
I have sent for these strawberries.

447
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.770
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth today.

448
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:16.900
There's some conceit or other likes him well

449
00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.900
when that he bids good morrow with such spirit.

450
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.700
I think there's never a man in Christendom

451
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.170
can lesser hide his love or hate than he,

452
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.600
for by his face, straight shall you know his heart.

453
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.100
What of his heart perceive you in his face

454
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.070
by any livelihood he showed today?

455
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.200
Marry, that with no man here he is offended.

456
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.070
For were he, he had shown it in his looks.

457
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.700
I pray God he be not, I say.

458
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.970
I pray you all,

459
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.930
tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death

460
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.630
with devilish plots of damned witchcraft

461
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.600
and that have prevailed upon my body

462
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.330
with their hellish charms.

463
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.730
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,

464
00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.430
makes me most forward in this princely presence

465
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.900
to doom the offenders, whatsoe'er they be.

466
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.400
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

467
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.970
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.

468
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:33.270
See how I am bewitched.

469
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.330
Behold.

470
00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.700
Mine arm is, like a blasted sapling, withered up.

471
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.800
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,

472
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.470
consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,

473
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.530
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

474
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.800
If they have done this deed, my noble lord--

475
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.870
If! Thou protector of this damned strumpet!

476
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.900
Talk'st thou to me of "ifs"?

477
00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.200
Thou art a traitor.

478
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.570
Off with his head!

479
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.030
Now by Saint Paul, I swear,

480
00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:03.970
I will not dine until I see the same.

481
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.800
Lovel and Ratcliffe, look that it be done.

482
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.870
The rest that love me, rise and follow me.

483
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.500
O woe.

484
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:48.870
Woe for England.

485
00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.430
Not a whit for me.

486
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.030
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.

487
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:00.270
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm.

488
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.870
And I did scorn it and distained to fly.

489
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.670
Three times today, my foot-cloth horse did stumble

490
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:14.030
and started when he looked upon the Tower,

491
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.570
as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse.

492
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.070
Oh, now I need the priest that spake to me.

493
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.570
I now repent I told the pursuivant as too triumphing

494
00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.430
how mine enemies today at Pomfret bloodily were butchered

495
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.630
and I myself secure in grace and favor.

496
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.600
Oh, Margaret, Margaret.

497
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:51.530
Now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head.

498
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.000
Come, come, dispatch.

499
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.270
The duke would be at dinner.

500
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.330
Make a short shrift.

501
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:58.030
He longs to see your head.

502
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:05.630
O momentary grace of mortal men,

503
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:10.300
which we more hunt for than the grace of God.

504
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.930
Who builds his hope in air of your good looks

505
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.900
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,

506
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.930
ready with every nod to tumble down

507
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.500
into the fatal bowels of the deep.

508
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.300
Come, come, dispatch.

509
00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.930
'Tis bootless to exclaim.

510
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.300
Bloody Richard!

511
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.200
Miserable England.

512
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.500
I prophesy the fearfulest time to thee

513
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.630
that ever wretched age hath looked upon.

514
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.470
Come.

515
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.970
Lead me to the block.

516
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.970
Bear him my head.

517
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.400
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.

518
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.130
Come, cousin.

519
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.330
Canst thou quake and change thy color,

520
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.430
murder thy breath in the middle of a word,

521
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.200
and then again begin and stop again

522
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.800
as if thou were distraught and mad with terror?

523
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.570
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian.

524
00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.870
Speak and look back.

525
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.200
Pry on every side,

526
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.500
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,

527
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.330
intending deep suspicion.

528
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.170
Ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles.

529
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.430
And both are ready in their offices at any time

530
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.300
to grace my stratagems.

531
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.100
What, is Catesby gone?

532
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.170
He is.

533
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:04.900
And see, he brings the mayor along.

534
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.030
Lord mayor!

535
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.330
Look to the drawbridge there!

536
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.370
Hark, a drum!

537
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:10.700
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.

538
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:11.700
Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--

539
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.870
Look back! Defend thee!

540
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.870
Here are enemies!

541
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.400
O God and our innocence, defend and guard us.

542
00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.730
Be patient; they are friends, Ratcliffe and Lovel.

543
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.400
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,

544
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.700
the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

545
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.070
So dear I loved the man that I must weep.

546
00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.230
I took him for the plainest harmless creature

547
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.670
that breathed upon the earth a Christian,

548
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.570
made him my book wherein my soul recorded

549
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.500
the history of all her secret thoughts.

550
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.030
So smooth he daubed his vice with show of virtue

551
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.900
that his apparent open guilt omitted--

552
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.570
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife--

553
00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.330
he lived from all attainder of suspects.

554
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.100
Well, well.

555
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:12.300
He was the covertest sheltered traitor!

556
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.930
Would you imagine or almost believe,

557
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.770
were't not that by great preservation

558
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:17.800
we live to tell it,

559
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.000
that the subtle traitor this day

560
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.400
had plotted in the council house

561
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.100
to murder me and my good lord of Gloucester?

562
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.570
Had he done so?

563
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:25.570
What?

564
00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:27.800
Think you we are Turks or infidels?

565
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.030
Or that we would against the form of law

566
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.600
proceed thus rashly in the villain's death,

567
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.670
but that the extreme peril of the case--

568
00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.600
the peace of England and our persons' safety--

569
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.330
enforced us to this execution?

570
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:42.230
Now, fair befall you, he deserved his death.

571
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.700
And your good graces both have well proceeded

572
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:49.670
to warn false traitors from the like attempts.

573
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.530
I never looked for better at his hands

574
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.470
after he once fell in with Mistress Shore.

575
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.330
Yet had we not determined he should die

576
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.530
until your lordship came to see his end,

577
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:01.570
which now the loving haste of these our friends,

578
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:04.200
something against our meaning have prevented

579
00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.470
because, my lord,

580
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:06.730
we would have had you heard the traitor speak

581
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.130
and timorously confess

582
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.000
the manner and the purpose of his treason,

583
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.100
that you might well have signified

584
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.370
the same unto the citizens,

585
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.070
who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death.

586
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.970
But, my good lord, your graces' word shall serve

587
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:24.470
as well as I had seen and heard him speak.

588
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.470
And do not doubt, right noble princes both,

589
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.470
but I'll acquaint our duteous citizens

590
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.970
with all your just proceedings in this cause.

591
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.430
And to that end, we wished your lordship here:

592
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.500
to avoid the censures of the carping world.

593
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.330
Which, since you came too late of our intent,

594
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.770
yet witness what you hear we did intend.

595
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:53.500
So, my good lord mayor,

596
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.300
we bid farewell.

597
00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.070
Go after, after, cousin Buckingham!

598
00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.630
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him all in post.

599
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.630
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,

600
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.830
infer the bastardy of Edward's children.

601
00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.100
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury

602
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.530
and bestial appetite in change of lust,

603
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.600
which stretched unto their servants, daughters, wives,

604
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.270
even where his raging eye and savage heart

605
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:42.200
without control lusted to make a prey.

606
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.530
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person.

607
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.830
Tell them when that my mother went of child

608
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.330
of that insatiate Edward,

609
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.830
noble York, my princely father, then had wars in France

610
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.770
and by true computation of the time

611
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.830
found that the issue was not his begot,

612
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:57.570
which well appeared in his lineaments,

613
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.100
being nothing like the noble duke my father.

614
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.030
Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,

615
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.270
because, my lord, you know my mother lives.

616
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.830
Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator

617
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.830
as if the golden fee for which I plead were for myself.

618
00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.530
And so, my lord, adieu.

619
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.170
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle,

620
00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.530
where you will find me well accompanied

621
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.530
with reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

622
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.130
I go, and towards three or four o'clock,

623
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.530
look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

624
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.770
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.

625
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.130
Go thou to Friar Penker.

626
00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:32.270
Bid them both meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.

627
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.830
Now will I go to take some privy order

628
00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.000
to draw the brats of Clarence out of sight

629
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
and to give notice that no manner person have any time

630
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.630
recourse unto the princes.

631
00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.700
Ratcliffe.

632
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:16.230
Here is the indictment of the good lord Hastings,

633
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:23.470
which in a set hand fairly is engrossed

634
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:27.800
that it may be today read o'er in Paul's.

635
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.870
And mark how well the sequel hangs together.

636
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.230
Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,

637
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.430
for yesternight by Catesby was it sent me.

638
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.100
The precedent was full as long a-doing.

639
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:55.830
And yet within these five hours, Hastings lived,

640
00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.170
untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty.

641
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:03.600
Here's a good world the while.

642
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.270
Who is so gross that cannot see this palpable device?

643
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:15.770
Yet who is so bold but says he sees it not?

644
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:23.570
Bad is the world, and all will come to naught

645
00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:27.430
when such ill dealing must be seen in thought.

646
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.200
How now? How now? What say the citizens?

647
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.000
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,

648
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.300
the citizens are mum, say not a word.

649
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.670
Touched you the bastardy of Edward's children?

650
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.730
I did.

651
00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.100
With his contract with Lady Lucy

652
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.070
and his contract by deputy in France,

653
00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.370
the insatiate greediness of his desire

654
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.370
and his enforcement of the city wives,

655
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.000
his tyranny for trifle,

656
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.530
his own bastardy, as being got, your father then in France,

657
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.430
and his resemblance being not like the duke.

658
00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.630
Withal, I did infer your lineaments

659
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.770
being the right idea of your father

660
00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.830
both in your form and nobleness of mind.

661
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.900
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,

662
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.070
your discipline in war, your wisdom in peace,

663
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:15.230
your bounty, virtue, fair humility.

664
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.000
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose untouched

665
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.600
or slightly handled in discourse.

666
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.270
And when mine oratory drew to an end,

667
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.070
I bid them that did love their country's good

668
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.430
cry "God save Richard, England's royal king."

669
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.670
And did they so?

670
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.770
No.

671
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:30.570
God help me, they spake not a word

672
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.630
but like dumb statues or breathing stones,

673
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.300
stared each on other and looked deadly pale,

674
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.770
which, when I saw, I reprehended them

675
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.170
and asked the mayor what meant this willful silence.

676
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.470
His answer was,

677
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.430
the people were not used to being spoke to

678
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.800
but by the recorder.

679
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.730
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,

680
00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.330
"Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferred,"

681
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:49.630
but nothing spake in warrant from himself.

682
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.870
When he had done,

683
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:53.170
some followers of mine own at the lower end of the hall

684
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:54.570
hurled up their caps,

685
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.130
and some ten voices cried, "God save King Richard."

686
00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.900
Thus I took the vantage of those few.

687
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:03.070
"Thanks, gentle citizens and friends," quoth I.

688
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.900
"This general applause and cheerful shout

689
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.600
argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard"

690
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.730
and even here brake off and came away.

691
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:13.470
What tongueless blocks were they!

692
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:14.470
Would they not speak?

693
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:15.630
No.

694
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.000
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?

695
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.730
The mayor is here at hand.

696
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.300
Intend some fear.

697
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.970
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit.

698
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.100
And look you get a prayer book in your hand

699
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.900
and stand between two churchmen, good my lord.

700
00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:36.030
For on that ground, I'll build a holy descant

701
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.130
and be not easily won to our request.

702
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.030
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.

703
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:43.730
I go.

704
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.270
And if you plead as well for them

705
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.370
as I can say nay to thee for myself,

706
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.470
no doubt we bring it to a happy issue.

707
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:52.170
Go; go up to the leads.

708
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.370
The lord mayor knocks.

709
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.530
Oh, welcome, my lord.

710
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:08.270
I dance attendance here.

711
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.100
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.

712
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.370
Oh, now, Catesby.

713
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.270
What says your lord to my request?

714
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.200
He doth entreat your grace, my noble lord,

715
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.800
to visit him tomorrow or next day.

716
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.870
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,

717
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:23.500
divinely bent to meditation,

718
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.300
and in no worldly suits would he be moved

719
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.800
to draw him from his holy exercise.

720
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.930
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke.

721
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.470
Tell him myself, the mayor, and aldermen

722
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.670
in deep designs and matter of great moment,

723
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:40.330
no less importing than our general good,

724
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.830
are come to have some conference with his grace.

725
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.170
I'll signify so much unto him straight.

726
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:54.530
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward.

727
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.530
He is not lolling on a lewd love bed

728
00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.730
but on his knees at meditation,

729
00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.370
not dallying with a brace of courtesans

730
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.230
but meditating with two deep divines,

731
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:11.930
not sleeping to engross his idle body,

732
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:16.200
but praying to enrich his watchful soul.

733
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.170
Happy were England would this virtuous prince

734
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.200
take on his grace the sovereignty thereof.

735
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.730
But sure, I fear, we shall not win him to it.

736
00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:32.500
Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay.

737
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.230
I fear he will.

738
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.200
Here Catesby comes again.

739
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.630
Now, Catesby, what says his grace?

740
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.970
He wonders to what end you have assembled

741
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.500
such troops of citizens to come to him,

742
00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.930
his grace not being warned thereof before.

743
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.530
He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.

744
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:54.800
Sorry I am my noble cousin should suspect me,

745
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.400
that I mean no good to him.

746
00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.370
By Heaven, we come to him in perfect love.

747
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.830
And so return and tell his grace.

748
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.300
When holy and devout religious men are at their beads,

749
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.300
'tis much to draw them thence,

750
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.730
so sweet is zealous contemplation.

751
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:36.170
See where his grace stands: tween two clergymen.

752
00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:39.930
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,

753
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.100
to stay him from the fall of vanity.

754
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.070
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,

755
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.600
true ornaments to know a holy man.

756
00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:57.600
Famous Plantagenet,

757
00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.430
most gracious prince,

758
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.200
lend favorable ear to our request

759
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.600
and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion

760
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.330
and right Christian zeal.

761
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:09.370
My lord, there needs no such apology.

762
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.400
I do beseech your grace to pardon me,

763
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.070
who, earnest in the service of my God,

764
00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.100
deferred the visitation of my friends.

765
00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.000
But leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

766
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:25.900
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above

767
00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.900
and all good men of this ungoverned isle.

768
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.100
I do suspect I have done some offense

769
00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.330
that seems disgracious in the city's eye

770
00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.500
and that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

771
00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.730
You have, my lord!

772
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.070
Would it might please your grace

773
00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.730
on our entreaties to amend that fault?

774
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.830
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

775
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:50.730
Know then it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat,

776
00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.470
the throne majestical,

777
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.830
the sceptered office of your ancestors

778
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.970
to the corruption of a blemished stock.

779
00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.530
Whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,

780
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:03.130
which here we waken to our country's good,

781
00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.430
the noble isle doth want her proper limbs.

782
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.270
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,

783
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:11.270
her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,

784
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.500
which to recure, we heartily solicit your gracious self

785
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.330
to take on you the charge and kingly government

786
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.130
of this your land,

787
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.500
not as protector, steward, substitute,

788
00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.400
or lowly factor for another's gain,

789
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.900
but as successively from blood to blood,

790
00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:32.000
your right of birth, your empery, your own.

791
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.530
For this, consorted with the citizens,

792
00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:36.030
your very worshipful and loving friends,

793
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.130
and by their vehement instigation,

794
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:45.070
in this just cause come I to move your grace.

795
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.100
I cannot tell if to depart in silence

796
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.070
or bitterly to speak in your reproof

797
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.400
best fitteth my degree or your condition.

798
00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.400
If not to answer, you might haply think

799
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.530
tongue-tied ambition, not replying,

800
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.400
yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty

801
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.130
which fondly you would here impose on me.

802
00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.230
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,

803
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.900
so seasoned with your faithful love to me,

804
00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:17.070
then, on the other side, I checked my friends.

805
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.700
Therefore, to speak and to avoid the first

806
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:23.330
and then, in speaking, not to incur the last,

807
00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.870
definitively thus I answer you.

808
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:28.930
Your love deserves my thanks,

809
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:33.100
but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request.

810
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.630
First, if all obstacles were cut away

811
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.600
and that my path were even to the crown,

812
00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.170
as the ripe revenue and due of birth,

813
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.930
yet so much is my poverty of spirit,

814
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.300
so mighty and so many my defects,

815
00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.100
that I would rather hide me from my greatness,

816
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.400
being a bark to brook no mighty sea,

817
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.170
than in my greatness covet to be hid

818
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.930
and in the vapor of my glory smothered.

819
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.570
But, God be thanked, there is no need of me,

820
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:05.830
and much I need to help you, were there need.

821
00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.630
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,

822
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:12.030
which, mellowed by the stealing hours of time,

823
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:14.200
will well become the seat of majesty

824
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.830
and make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.

825
00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:20.470
On him I lay that you would lay on me,

826
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.830
the right and fortune of his happy stars,

827
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.130
which God defend that I should wring from him.

828
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:31.630
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace,

829
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:34.200
but the respects thereof are nice and trivial,

830
00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.170
all circumstances well considered.

831
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:40.700
You say that Edward is your brother's son.

832
00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.570
So say we too...

833
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.730
but not by Edward's wife!

834
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:47.930
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy--

835
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.070
your mother lives a witness to his vow--

836
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.030
and afterwards by substitute betroth'd to Bona,

837
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.570
sister to the king of France.

838
00:46:56.570 --> 00:47:01.000
These both put off a poor petitioner,

839
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.600
a care-crazed mother to many sons,

840
00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.100
a beauty-waning and distressed widow,

841
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.300
even in the afternoon of her best days

842
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:15.000
made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,

843
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.870
seduced the pitch and the height of his degree

844
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:25.130
to base declension and loathed bigamy.

845
00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.230
By her in his unlawful bed, he got this Edward,

846
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.930
whom our manners call the prince.

847
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:32.470
More bitterly could I expostulate,

848
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.800
save that for reverence to some alive,

849
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.200
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.

850
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:41.800
Therefore, good my lord, take to your royal self

851
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.930
this proffered benefit of dignity,

852
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.270
if not to bless us and the land withal,

853
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.730
yet to draw forth your noble ancestry

854
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.000
from the corruption of abusing times

855
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.970
unto a lineal, true-derived course.

856
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:58.630
Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.

857
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.700
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffered love.

858
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.830
O, make them joyful; grant their lawful suit.

859
00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.130
Alas, why would you heap this care on me?

860
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.530
I am unfit for state and majesty.

861
00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:13.300
I do beseech you, take it not amiss.

862
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.100
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

863
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.830
If you refuse it-- as in love and zeal,

864
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.570
loath to depose the child, your brother's son,

865
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.300
as well we know your tenderness of heart

866
00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.670
and gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,

867
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.100
which we have noted in you to your kindred

868
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.170
and equally indeed to all estates--

869
00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.200
yet know, whether you accept our suit or no,

870
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.470
your brother's son shall never reign our king.

871
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.770
But we shall plant some other in the throne,

872
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:41.570
to the disgrace and downfall of your house.

873
00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:46.370
And with this resolution, here we leave you.

874
00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:55.200
Come, citizens.

875
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.870
'Zounds!

876
00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.700
I'll entreat no more.

877
00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.330
O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.

878
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.530
Call them again, sweet prince.

879
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.470
Accept their suit.

880
00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:12.400
If you deny them, all the land will rue it!

881
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.530
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?

882
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.100
Call them again.

883
00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:18.670
I am not made of stones

884
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:21.570
but penetrable to your kind entreaties,

885
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:24.830
albeit against my conscience and my soul.

886
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.130
Cousin of Buckingham

887
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:34.770
and sage, grave men...

888
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.730
since you will buckle fortune on my back,

889
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:43.530
to bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,

890
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:47.430
I must have patience to endure the load.

891
00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:53.870
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach

892
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.970
attend the sequel of your imposition,

893
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.930
your mere enforcement shall acquittance me

894
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.730
from all the impure blots and stains thereof.

895
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.330
For God doth know and you may partly see

896
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.500
how far I am from the desire of this.

897
00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.670
God bless your grace.

898
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.100
We see it and will say it.

899
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.270
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.

900
00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:22.270
Then I salute you with this royal title.

901
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:30.600
Long live Richard, England's worthy king!

902
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.730
Amen.

903
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.470
Tomorrow may it please you to be crowned?

904
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:37.800
Even when you please, for you will have it so.

905
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.030
Tomorrow, then, we will attend your grace.

906
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:45.470
And so most joyfully, we take our leave.

907
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:48.800
Come, let us to our holy work again.

908
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.770
Farewell, my cousin.

909
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.930
Farewell, gentle friends.

910
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:07.230
