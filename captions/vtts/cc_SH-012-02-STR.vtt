00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.170


2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.270
Beseech you, sir, be merry; youhave cause,

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.370
So have we all, of joy;for our escape

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.630
Is much beyond our loss.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.000
Our hint of woe

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.430
Is common; every day somesailor's wife,

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.930
The masters of somemerchant and the merchant

8
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.930
Have just our theme ofwoe; but for the miracle,

9
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.530
I mean our preservation,few in millions

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.500
Can speak like us: thenwisely, good sir, weigh

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200
Our sorrow with ourcomfort.

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.300
Prithee, peace.

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.230
He receives comfort likecold porridge.

14
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.000
The visitor will not givehim o'er so.

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.930
Look he's winding up thewatch of his wit;

16
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.500
by and by it will strike.

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.600
Sir--

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.770
One: tell.

19
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.630
When every grief isentertain'd that's offer'd,

20
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.930
Comes to the entertainer--

21
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.030
A dollar.

22
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.670
Dolour comes to him,indeed:

23
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.070
you have spoken truer thanyou purposed.

24
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.400
You have taken it wiselierthan I meant you should.

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.030
Therefore, my lord--

26
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.470
Fie, what a spendthrift ishe of his tongue.

27
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.170
I prithee, spare.

28
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
Well, I have done: butyet--

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.730
He will be talking.

30
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.200
Which, of he or Adrian,for a good wager,

31
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.300
first begins to crow?

32
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.770
-The old cock. -Thecockerel.

33
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.870
Done.

34
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.100
-The wager? -A laughter.

35
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.200
A match.

36
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.030
Though this island seem tobe desert--

37
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.130
Ha, ha, ha!

38
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.230
So, you're paid.

39
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.330
Uninhabitable and almostinaccessible--

40
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.430
Yet...

41
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.530
Yet--

42
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.830
He could not miss't.

43
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.400
It must needs be ofsubtle, tender anddelicate temperance.

44
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.970
Temperance was a delicatewench.

45
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270
Ay, and a subtle; as hemost learnedly delivered.

46
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.530
The air breathes upon ushere most sweetly.

47
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.370
As if it had lungs androtten ones.

48
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.230
Or as 'twere perfumed by afen.

49
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.400
Here is everythingadvantageous to life.

50
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.500
True; save means to live.

51
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.000
Of that there's none, orlittle.

52
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.270
How lush and lusty thegrass looks.

53
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.470
How green.

54
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.770
The ground indeed istawny.

55
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.970
With an eye of green in't.

56
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.070
He misses not much.

57
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.030
No; he doth but mistakethe truth totally.

58
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.770
But the rarity of it is,

59
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.800
which is indeed almostbeyond credit--

60
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.500
As many vouched raritiesare.

61
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.870
That our garments, being,as they were,

62
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.330
drenched in the sea,

63
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.130
hold notwithstanding theirfreshness and glosses,

64
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.030
being rather new-dyed thanstained with salt water.

65
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.270
Is not, sir, my doublet asfresh as the first day Iwore it?

66
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.030
At Tunis at the marriageof your daughter,

67
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.200
who is now queen.

68
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.630
You cram these words intomy ears against

69
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.130
The stomach of my sense.

70
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.830
Would I had never

71
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.470
Married my daughter there!

72
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.970
For, coming thence,

73
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.630
My son is lost and, in myrate, she too,

74
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.400
Who is so far from Italyremoved I ne'er againshall see her.

75
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.700
O thou mine heir

76
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.600
Of Naples and of Milan,what strange fish

77
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.670
Hath made his meal onthee?

78
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.170
Sir, he may live: I saw himbeat the surges under him,

79
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.830
And ride upon their backs;he trod the water,

80
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.430
Whose enmity he flungaside, and breasted

81
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.330
The surge most swoln thatmet him; his bold head

82
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.570
'Bove the contentiouswaves he kept, and oar'd

83
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.870
Himself with his good armsin lusty stroke

84
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.070
To the shore, that o'erhis wave-worn basis bow'd,

85
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.030
As stooping to relievehim: I not doubt

86
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.170
He came alive to land.

87
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.770
No, no, he's gone.

88
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.000
Sir, you may thank yourselffor this great loss,

89
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.400
That would not bless ourEurope with your daughter,

90
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.000
But rather lose her to anAfrican;

91
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.070
Where she at least isbanish'd from your eye,

92
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.800
Who hath cause to wet thegrief on't.

93
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.900
Prithee, peace!

94
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.030
You were kneel'd to andimportuned otherwise

95
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.800
By all of us, and the fairsoul herself

96
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.930
Weigh'd between loathnessand obedience, at

97
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.500
Which end o' the beamshould bow.

98
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.030
We have lost your son,

99
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.030
I fear, for ever: Milanand Naples have

100
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.100
More widows in them ofthis business' making

101
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.830
Than we bring men tocomfort them:

102
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.030
The fault's your own!

103
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.700
So is the dear'st o' theloss!

104
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.200
My lord Sebastian,

105
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.500
The truth you speak dothlack some gentleness

106
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.130
And time to speak it in:you rub the sore,

107
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.670
When you should bring theplaster.

108
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.700
Very well.

109
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.330
And most chirurgeonly.

110
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.770
It is foul weather in usall, good sir,

111
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.600
When you are cloudy.

112
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.700
Foul weather?

113
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.200
Very fowl.

114
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.170
Had I plantation of thisisle, my lord--

115
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.630
He'd sow't withnettle-seed.

116
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.770
Or docks, or mallows.

117
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.570
And were the king on't,what would I do?

118
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.370
'Scape being drunk forwant of wine.

119
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.530
I' the commonwealth Iwould by contraries

120
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.770
Execute all things; for nokind of traffic

121
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.300
Would I admit; no name ofmagistrate;

122
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.570
Letters should not beknown; riches, poverty,

123
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.170
And use of service, none;contract, succession,

124
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.670
Bourn, bound of land,tilth, vineyard, none;

125
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.070
No use of metal, corn, orwine, or oil;

126
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.630
No occupation; all menidle, all;

127
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.130
And women too, butinnocent and pure;

128
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.600
No sovereignty--

129
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.930
Yet he would be king on't.

130
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.770
The latter end of hiscommonwealth forgets thebeginning.

131
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.130
All things in commonnature should produce

132
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.330
Without sweat or endeavour:treason, felony,

133
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.170
Sword, pike, knife, gun,or need of any engine,

134
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.070
Would I not have; butnature should bring forth,

135
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.470
Of its own kind, allfoison, all abundance,

136
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.030
To feed my innocentpeople.

137
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.530
No marrying 'mong hissubjects?

138
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.400
None, man; all idle:whores and knaves.

139
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.800
I would with suchperfection govern, sir,

140
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.070
To excel the golden age.

141
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.730
Save his majesty!

142
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.930
Long live Gonzalo!

143
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.570
And--do you mark me, sir?

144
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.300
Prithee, no more: thoudost talk nothing to me.

145
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.600
I do well believe yourhighness;

146
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.970
and did it to ministeroccasion to these gentlemen,

147
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.630
who are of such sensibleand nimble lungs

148
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.930
that they always use tolaugh at nothing.

149
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.130
'Twas you we laughed at.

150
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.000
Who in this kind of merryfooling

151
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.730
am nothing to you:

152
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.200
so you may continue andlaugh at nothing still.

153
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.800
Oh, what a blow was theregiven.

154
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.730
An it had not fallenflat-long.

155
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.170
You are gentlemen of bravemetal;

156
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.000
you would lift the moonout of her sphere,

157
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.100
if she would continue in itfive weeks without changing.

158
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.100
We would so, and then go abat-fowling.

159
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.900
Nay, good my lord, be notangry.

160
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.370
No, I warrant you;

161
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.530
I will not adventure mydiscretion so weakly.

162
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.600
Will you laugh me asleep,for I am very heavy?

163
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.570
Go sleep, and hear us.

164
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.870
What, all so soon asleep.

165
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.470
I wish my eyes

166
00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.430
Would, with themselves,shut up my thoughts: I find

167
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.030
They are inclined to doso.

168
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.230
Please you, sir,

169
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.970
Do not omit the heavyoffer of it:

170
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.800
It seldom visits sorrow;when it doth,

171
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.900
It is a comforter.

172
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.070
We two, my lord,

173
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.300
Will guard your personwhile you take your rest,

174
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.400
And watch your safety.

175
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.700
Thank you.

176
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.870
Wondrous heavy.

177
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.170
What a strange drowsinesspossesses them.

178
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.900
It is the quality o' theclimate.

179
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.730
Why Doth it not then oureyelids sink?

180
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:30.830
I find not

181
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.500
Myself disposed to sleep.

182
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.170
Nor I; my spirits arenimble.

183
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.070
They fell together all, asby consent;

184
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.170
They dropp'd, as by athunder-stroke.

185
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:48.600
What might, WorthySebastian?

186
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:53.030
O, what might?

187
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.170
No more:

188
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.830
And yet me thinks I see itin thy face,

189
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.670
What thou shouldst be: theoccasion speaks thee, and

190
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.830
My strong imagination seesa crown

191
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.430
Dropping upon thy head.

192
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.130
What, art thou waking?

193
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.430
Do you not hear me speak?

194
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.530
I do; and surely

195
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.470
It is a sleepy languageand thou speak'st

196
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.570
Out of thy sleep.

197
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.830
What is it thou didst say?

198
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.630
This is a strange repose,to be asleep

199
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.570
With eyes wide open;standing, speaking, moving,

200
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.100
And yet so fast asleep.

201
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.900
Noble Sebastian,

202
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.500
Thou let'st thy fortunesleep-- die, rather; wink'st

203
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.970
Whiles thou art waking.

204
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.100
Thou dost snoredistinctly; There'smeaning in thy snores.

205
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.870
I am more serious than mycustom: you

206
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.000
Must be so too, if heedme; which to do

207
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.370
Trebles thee o'er.

208
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.600
Well, I am standing water.

209
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.630
I'll teach you how toflow.

210
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.470
Do so: to ebb

211
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.270
Hereditary sloth instructsme.

212
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.400
O, If you but knew how youthe purpose cherish

213
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.930
Whiles thus you mock it.

214
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.100
How, in stripping it,

215
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.500
You more invest it.

216
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.700
Ebbing men, indeed,

217
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.870
Most often do so near thebottom run

218
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.070
By their own fear orsloth.

219
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.630
Prithee, say on:

220
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.770
The setting of thine eyeand cheek proclaims

221
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.530
A matter from thee, and abirth indeed

222
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.200
Which throes thee much toyield.

223
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.770
Thus, sir:

224
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.430
Although this lord of weakremembrance, this,

225
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:13.900
Who shall be of as littlememory

226
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.630
When he is earth'd, hathhere almost persuaded--

227
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.500
For he's a spirit ofpersuasion, only

228
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.130
Professes to persuade--the king his son's alive,

229
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.000
'Tis as impossible thathe's undrown'd

230
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.400
As he that sleeps hereswims.

231
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.500
I have no hope

232
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.670
That he's undrown'd.

233
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.700
O, out of that "no hope"

234
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.270
What great hope have you.

235
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.630
No hope that way is

236
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.070
Another way so high a hopethat even

237
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.030
Ambition cannot pierce awink beyond,

238
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.800
But doubt discovery there.

239
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.900
Will you grant with me

240
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.600
That Ferdinand is drown'd?

241
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.270
He's gone.

242
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.700
Then, tell me,

243
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.170
Who's the next heir ofNaples?

244
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.000
Claribel.

245
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.400
She that is queen ofTunis; she that dwells

246
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.530
Ten leagues beyond man'slife; she that from Naples

247
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.830
Can have no note, unlessthe sun were post--

248
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.730
The man i' the moon's tooslow-- till new-born chins

249
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.130
Be rough and razorable;she that from whom

250
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:09.830
We all were sea-swallow'd,though some cast again,

251
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.570
And by that destiny toperform an act

252
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.700
Whereof what's past isprologue, what to come

253
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.370
In yours and my discharge.

254
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.470
What stuff is this.

255
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.700
How say you?

256
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.970
'Tis true, my brother'sdaughter's queen of Tunis;

257
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.100
So is she heir of Naples;'twixt which regions

258
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.400
There is some space.

259
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.170
A space whose every cubit

260
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.600
Seems to cry out, "Howshall that Claribel

261
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.270
"Measure us back toNaples?

262
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.430
"Keep in Tunis,

263
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.470
And let Sebastian wake."

264
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.630
Say, this were death

265
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.130
That now hath seized them;why, they were no worse

266
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.330
Than now they are.

267
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.070
There be that can ruleNaples

268
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.330
As well as he that sleeps;lords that can prate

269
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.800
As amply and unnecessarily

270
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.530
As this Gonzalo; I myselfcould make

271
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.000
A chough of as deep chat.

272
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.370
O, that you bore

273
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.470
A mind that I do.

274
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.630
What a sleep were this

275
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:01.870
For your advancement.

276
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.130
Do you understand me?

277
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.230
Methinks I do.

278
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.430
And how does your content

279
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.830
Tender your own goodfortune?

280
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.970
I remember you did supplantyour brother Prospero.

281
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.730
True: And look how well mygarments sit upon me;

282
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.730
Much feater than before:my brother's servants

283
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.200
Were then my fellows; nowthey are my men.

284
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.830
But, for your conscience?

285
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.570
Ay, sir; where lies that?

286
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.200
If 'twere a kibe,

287
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.970
'Twould put me to myslipper: but I feel not

288
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.700
This deity in my bosom:twenty consciences,

289
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.900
That stand 'twixt me andMilan, candied be they

290
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.870
And melt ere they molest.

291
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.570
Here lies your brother,

292
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.400
No better than the earthhe lies upon,

293
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.630
If he were that which nowhe's like, that's dead;

294
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.770
Whom I, with this obedientsteel,

295
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.700
three inches of it,

296
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.230
Can lay to bed for ever;whiles you, doing thus,

297
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.130
To the perpetual wink foraye might put

298
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.200
This ancient morsel, thisSir Prudence, who

299
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.270
Should not upbraid ourcourse.

300
00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.430
For all the rest,

301
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:01.900
They'll take suggestion asa cat laps milk;

302
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.200
They'll tell the clock toany business that

303
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.030
We say befits the hour.

304
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.400
Thy case, dear friend,

305
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.470
Shall be my precedent; asthou got'st Milan,

306
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.800
I'll come by Naples.

307
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.700
Draw thy sword: one stroke

308
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.170
Shall free thee from thetribute which thou payest;

309
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.470
And I the king shall lovethee.

310
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.070
Draw together;

311
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.900
And when I rear my hand,do you the like,

312
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.130
To fall it on Gonzalo.

313
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.730
O, but one word.

314
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.770
My master through his artforesees the danger

315
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.370
That you, his friend, arein; and sends me forth--

316
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.400
For else his project dies--to keep them living.

317
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.470
While you here do snoringlie,

318
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.730
Open-eyed conspiracy Histime doth take.

319
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.430
If of life you keep acare,

320
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.500
Shake off slumber, andbeware:

321
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.100
Awake, awake!

322
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.570
Let us both be sudden.

323
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.670
Now, good angels

324
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.770
Preserve the king.

325
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.870
Why, how now?

326
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.970
Ho, awake!

327
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.170
Why are you drawn?

328
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.200
Wherefore this ghastlylooking?

329
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.430
What's the matter?

330
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.300
Whiles we stood heresecuring your repose,

331
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.670
Even now, we heard ahollow burst of bellowing

332
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.970
Like bulls, or ratherlions: did't not wake you?

333
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.570
It struck mine ear mostterribly.

334
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.830
I heard nothing.

335
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.700
O, 'twas a din to fright amonster's ear,

336
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.800
To make an earthquake.

337
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.900
Sure, it was the roar

338
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.070
Of a whole herd of lions.

339
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.270
Heard you this, Gonzalo?

340
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.470
Upon mine honour, sir, Iheard a humming,

341
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.500
And that a strange onetoo, which did awake me:

342
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.500
I shaked you, sir, andcried: as mine eyes open'd,

343
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.070
I saw their weapons drawn:there was a noise,

344
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.230
That's verily.

345
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.530
'Tis best we stand uponour guard,

346
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.330
Or that we quit this place;let's draw our weapons.

347
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.670
Lead off this ground; andlet's make further search

348
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.330
For my poor son.

349
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.130
Heavens keep him fromthese beasts.

350
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.900
For he is, sure, i' theisland.

351
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.070
Lead away.

352
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.670
Prospero my lord shallknow what I have done:

353
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.000
So, king, go safely on toseek thy son.

354
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.800
All the infections thatthe sun sucks up

355
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.070
From bogs, fens, flats, onProsper fall and make him

356
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.030
By inch-meal a disease!

357
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.770
His spirits hear me

358
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.570
And yet I needs mustcurse.

359
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.300
But they'll nor pinch,

360
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.430
Fright me withurchin-shows, pitch me i'the mire,

361
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.570
Nor lead me, like afirebrand, in the dark

362
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.730
Out of my way, unless hebid 'em;

363
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.770
but for every trifle arethey set upon me;

364
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:59.870
Sometime like apes thatmow and chatter at me

365
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.570
And after bite me, thenlike hedgehogs which

366
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.130
Lie tumbling in mybarefoot way and mount

367
00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:14.600
Their pricks at myfootfall; sometime am I

368
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.170
All wound with adders whowith cloven tongues

369
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.770
Do hiss me into madness.

370
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.570
Lo, now, lo!

371
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.770
Here comes a spirit ofhis, and to torment me

372
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.270
For bringing wood inslowly.

373
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.430
I'll fall flat;

374
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.370
Perchance he will not mindme.

375
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.170
Here's neither bush norshrub, to bear off anyweather at all,

376
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.700
and another storm brewing;I hear it sing i' the wind:

377
00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.230
yond same black cloud,yond huge one,

378
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.400
looks like a foul bombardthat would shed his liquor.

379
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.770
If it should thunder as itdid before,

380
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.530
I know not where to hidemy head:

381
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.870
yond same cloud cannotchoose but fall bypailfuls.

382
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.070
What have we here?

383
00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.230
A man or a fish?

384
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.930
Dead or alive?

385
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.270
A fish: he smells like afish;

386
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.800
a very ancient andfish-like smell;

387
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.170
a kind of not of thenewest Poor-John.

388
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.170
A strange fish.

389
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.000
Were I in England now, asonce I was,

390
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.070
and had but this fish painted,not a holiday fool there

391
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.870
but would give a piece ofsilver:

392
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.130
there would this monstermake a man;

393
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.170
any strange beast theremakes a man:

394
00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.670
when they will not give a doitto relieve a lame beggar,

395
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.530
they'll lay out ten to seea dead Indian.

396
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.100
Legged like a man.

397
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.800
His fins like arms.

398
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.970
Warm o' my troth.

399
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.800
I do now let loose myopinion; hold it no longer:

400
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.170
this is no fish, but anislander,

401
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.200
that hath lately sufferedby a thunderbolt.

402
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.330
Oh, alas, the storm iscome again.

403
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.030
My best way is to creepunder his gaberdine;

404
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.670
there's no other shelterhereabout:

405
00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.130
misery acquaints a manwith strange bed-fellows.

406
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.630
I will here shroud

407
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:14.930
till the dregs of thestorm be past.

408
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.570
I shall no more to sea, tosea,

409
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:23.670
Here shall I die ashore--

410
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:28.900
This is a very scurvy tuneto sing at a man's funeral:

411
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.900
well, here's my comfort.

412
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:35.700
The master, the swabber,the boatswain and I,

413
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.670
The gunner and his mateLoved Mall,

414
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.100
Meg and Marian andMargery,

415
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.500
But none of us cared forKate;

416
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.630
For she had a tongue witha tang,

417
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:55.800
Would cry to a sailor, "Gohang!"

418
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.530
She loved not the savourof tar nor of pitch,

419
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.800
Yet a tailor might scratchher where'er she did itch:

420
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:11.900
Then to sea, boys, to sea,boys, to see

421
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.330
and let her go hang.

422
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.000
This is a scurvy tune too:but here's my comfort.

423
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.400
Do not torment me: Oh!

424
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.300
What's the matter?

425
00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:23.630
Have we devils here?

426
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.130
Do you put tricks upon'swith savages and men of Ind?

427
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.900
Ha.

428
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.600
I have not 'scapeddrowning to be afeard now

429
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.900
of your four legs; for ithath been said,

430
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.500
As proper a man as everwent on four legs

431
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.600
cannot make him giveground; it shall be saidso again

432
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.530
while Stephano breathesat's nostrils.

433
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.830
The spirit torments me;Oh!

434
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:53.700
This is some monster ofthe isle with four legs,

435
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.970
who hath, as I take it, anague.

436
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.370
Where the devil should helearn our language?

437
00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.870
I will give him some relief,if it be but for that.

438
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:07.130
If I can recover him andkeep him tame

439
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.270
and get to Naples withhim, he's a present forany emperor

440
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.800
that ever trod on neat'sleather.

441
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.570
Do not torment me,prithee; I'll bring mywood home faster.

442
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:18.830
He's in his fit now

443
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.130
and does not talk afterthe wisest.

444
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.130
He shall taste of mybottle:

445
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.300
if he have never drunkwine afore,

446
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.030
it will go near to removehis fit.

447
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.900
If I can recover him andkeep him tame,

448
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.230
I will not take too muchfor him;

449
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.830
he shall pay for him thathath him,

450
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.200
and that soundly.

451
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.270
Thou dost me yet butlittle hurt;

452
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.030
thou wilt anon, I know itby thy trembling:

453
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.630
now Prosper works uponthee.

454
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.770
Come on your ways; openyour mouth;

455
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:49.500
here is that which willgive language to you, cat:

456
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.370
open your mouth; this willshake your shaking,

457
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.030
I can tell you, and thatsoundly:

458
00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.100
you cannot tell who's yourfriend:

459
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.400
open your chaps again.

460
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.170
I should know that voice:it should be--

461
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.030
but he is drowned; andthese are devils:

462
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.270
O defend me!

463
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.370
Four legs and two voices:a most delicate monster.

464
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.670
His forward voice is tospeak well of his friend;

465
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.030
his backward voice is toutter foul speeches

466
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.400
and to detract.

467
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.800
If all the wine in mybottle will recover him,

468
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.030
I will help his ague.

469
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.130
Come.

470
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.500
Amen.

471
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.270
I will pour some in thyother mouth.

472
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.730
Stephano!

473
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.200
Doth thy other mouth callme?

474
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.330
Mercy, mercy.

475
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:38.400
This is a devil, and nomonster: I will leave him;

476
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.800
I have no long spoon.

477
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.370
If thou beest Stephano,touch me and speak to me:

478
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:47.200
for I am Trinculo, thygood friend Trinculo!

479
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.900
If thou beest Trinculo,come forth:

480
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.930
I will pull thee by thelesser legs:

481
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.630
if any be Trinculo's legs,these are they.

482
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:05.330
Thou art very Trinculoindeed!

483
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.700
How camest thou to be thesiege of this moon-calf?

484
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.670
Can he vent Trinculos?

485
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.600
I took him to be killedwith a thunder-stroke.

486
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.470
But art thou not drowned,Stephano?

487
00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.870
I hope now thou art notdrowned.

488
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.830
Is the storm overblown?

489
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.270
I hid me under the deadmoon-calf's gaberdine

490
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.630
for fear of the storm.

491
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.530
And art thou living,Stephano?

492
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:36.200
O Stephano, twoNeapolitans 'scaped!

493
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.730
Prithee, do not turn meabout; my stomach is notconstant.

494
00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.200
These be fine things, anif they be not sprites.

495
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.200
That's a brave god andbears celestial liquor.

496
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.130
I will kneel to him.

497
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.270
How didst thou 'scape?

498
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.700
How camest thou hither?

499
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.700
Swear by this bottle howthou camest hither.

500
00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.630
I escaped upon a butt ofsack which the sailors

501
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.500
heaved o'erboard, by thisbottle;

502
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.870
which I made of the barkof a tree

503
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.970
with my own hands since Iwas cast ashore.

504
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.230
I'll swear upon that bottleto be thy true subject;

505
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.130
for the liquor is notearthly.

506
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.970
Here; swear how thouescapedst.

507
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.170
Swum ashore, man, like aduck:

508
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.170
I can swim like a duck,I'll be sworn.

509
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.270
Here, kiss the book.

510
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.930
Though thou canst swimlike a duck,

511
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.270
thou art made like agoose.

512
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.500
O Stephano.

513
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.700
Hast any more of this?

514
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.130
The whole butt, man: mycellar is in a rock

515
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.570
by the sea-side where mywine is hid.

516
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.800
How now, moon-calf.

517
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.100
How does thine ague?

518
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.730
Hast thou not dropp'd fromheaven?

519
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.900
Out o' the moon, I doassure thee:

520
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.370
I was the man i' the moonwhen time was.

521
00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:50.000
I have seen thee in herand I do adore thee:

522
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.030
My mistress show'd me theeand thy dog and thy bush.

523
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.700
Come, swear to that; kissthe book:

524
00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.100
I'll furnish it anon withnew contents, swear.

525
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.200
By this good light, thisis a very shallow monster.

526
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.730
I afeard of him?

527
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.270
A very weak monster.

528
00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.230
The man i' the moon.

529
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.270
A most poor credulousmonster.

530
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.270
Well drawn, monster, ingood sooth.

531
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.670
I'll show thee everyfertile inch o' th' island;

532
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.500
And I will kiss thy foot:I prithee, be my god.

533
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:23.030
By this light, this is a mostperfidious drunken monster.

534
00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.070
When 's god's asleep,he'll rob his bottle.

535
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.230
I'll kiss thy foot; I'llswear myself thy subject.

536
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.170
Come on then; down, andswear.

537
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.930
I shall laugh myself to deathat this puppy-headed monster.

538
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.200
A most scurvy monster.

539
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.070
I could find in my heartto beat him...

540
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.230
Come, kiss.

541
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.870

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:01.970
A most ridiculous monster,to make a wonder of a poordrunkard.

To clustering filberts andsometimes I'll get thee

554
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.370
Young scamels from therock.

A howling, drunkenmonster.
