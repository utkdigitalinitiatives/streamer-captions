00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900


2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.100
My lord,

3
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.700
you told me you would tellthe rest,

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.300
when weeping made youbreak the story off,

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.370
of our two cousins cominginto London.

6
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.370
Where did I leave?

7
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.700
At that sad stop, my lord,

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.070
where rude, misgovernedhands from windows' tops

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.200
threw dust and rubbish onKing Richard's head.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.500
Then, as I said, the duke,great Bolingbroke,

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130
mounted upon a hot andfiery steed,

12
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.900
which his aspiring riderseemed to know,

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.670
with slow but stately pacekept on his course,

14
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.700
whilst all tongues cried "Godsave thee, Bolingbroke."

15
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.130
You would have thought thevery windows spake,

16
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.730
so many greedy looks ofyoung and old

17
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.970
through casements dartedtheir desiring eyes

18
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.300
upon his visage,

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.530
and that all the wallswith painted imagery

20
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.600
had said at once "Jesupreserve thee.

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.500
Welcome, Bolingbroke."

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.770
Whilst he, from the oneside to the other turning,

23
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.270
bareheaded,

24
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.870
lower than his proudsteed's neck,

25
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.700
bespake them thus:

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.670
"I thank thee,countrymen."

27
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.200
And thus still doing, thushe passed along.

28
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.200
Alack, poor Richard.

29
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
Where rode he the whilst?

30
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800
As in a theatre, the eyesof men,

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.530
after a well-graced actorleaves the stage,

32
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.800
are idly bent on him thatenters next,

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.500
thinking his prattle to betedious.

34
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.870
Even so, but with muchmore contempt,

35
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.800
did men's eyes scowl ongentle Richard.

36
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.600
No man cried, "God savehim."

37
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.530
No joyful tongue gave himhis welcome home.

38
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.000
But dust was thrown uponhis sacred head,

39
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.670
which with such gentlesorrow he shook off,

40
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.000
his face still combatingwith tears and smiles,

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.270
the badges of his griefand patience,

42
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.470
that had not God, for somestrong purpose,

43
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.730
steeled the hearts of men,they must perforce havemelted,

44
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.200
and barbarism itself havepitied him.

45
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.000
But heaven hath a hand inthese events,

46
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.270
to whose high will webound our calm contents.

47
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.830
To Bolingbroke we aresworn subjects now,

48
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.970
whose state and honor Ifor aye allow.

49
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.300
Here comes my son Aumerle.

50
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.530
Aumerle that was.

51
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.270
But that is lost for beingRichard's friend.

52
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.100
And, madam, you must callhim Rutland now.

53
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.770
I am in parliament pledgefor his truth

54
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.730
and lasting fealty to thenew made king.

55
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.200
Welcome, my son.

56
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.930
Who are the violets now

57
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.970
that strew the green lapof the new come spring?

58
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.370
Madam, I know not, nor Igreatly care not.

59
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.930
God knows I had as lief benone as one.

60
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.470
Well, bear you well inthis new spring of time,

61
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.100
lest you be cropped beforeyou come to prime.

62
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.800
What news from Oxford?

63
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.900
Those jousts and triumphshold?

64
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.370
For aught I know, my lord,they do.

65
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.670
You will be there, I know.

66
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.230
If God prevent not, Ipurpose so.

67
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.500
What seal is that, thathangs without thy bosom?

68
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.330
Yea, look'st thou pale?

69
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.730
Let me see the writing.

70
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.630
My lord, 'tis nothing.

71
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.470
No matter, then, who seeit.

72
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.970
I will be satisfied.

73
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.570
Let me see the writing.

74
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.030
I do beseech Your Grace topardon me.

75
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.570
It is a matter of smallconsequence,

76
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.430
which for some reasons Iwould not have seen.

77
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.400
Which for some reasons,sir, I mean to see.

78
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.430
I fear--I fear--

79
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.030
What should you fear?

80
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.970
'Tis nothing but some bond

81
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.170
that he is entered intofor gay apparel againstthe triumph day.

82
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.300
Bound to himself.

83
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.670
What doth he with a bondthat he is bound to?

84
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.670
Wife, thou art a fool.

85
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.270
Boy, boy, let me see thewriting.

86
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.770
I do beseech you, pardonme.

87
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:09.800
I may not show it.

88
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.070
I will be satisfied.

89
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.100
Let me see it, I say.

90
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.430
Treason.

91
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.770
Foul treason.

92
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.600
Villain.

93
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.930
Traitor.

94
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.070
Slave.

95
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.070
My lord, what is thematter?

96
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.070
Ho.

97
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.300
Who is within there?

98
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.730
Saddle my horse.

99
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.970
God for his mercy, whattreachery is here.

100
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.030
Why, what is it, my lord?

101
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.170
Bring me my boots, I say.

102
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.900
Saddle my horse.

103
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.300
Now, upon mine honor, bymy life, my troth,

104
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.930
I will appeach thevillain.

105
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.930
What is the matter?

106
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.930
Peace, foolish woman.

107
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.600
I will not peace.

108
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.700
What is the matter,Aumerle?

109
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.000
Good Mother, be content.

110
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.600
It is no more than my poorlife must answer.

111
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.030
Thy life answer.

112
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.500
Bring me my boots.

113
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.170
I will unto the king.

114
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.170
Strike him, Aumerle.

115
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.200
Poor boy, thou art amazed.

116
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.130
Hence, villain.

117
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.870
Never more come in mysight.

118
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.870
Give me my boots, I say.

119
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.700
Why, York, what wilt thoudo?

120
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.700
Wilt thou not hide thetrespass of thine own?

121
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.670
Have we more sons or arewe like to have?

122
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.030
Is not my teeming datedrunk up with time?

123
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.630
And wilt thou pluck myfair son from mine age

124
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.570
and rob me of a happymother's name?

125
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.870
Is he not like thee?

126
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.400
Is he not thine own?

127
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.900
Thou fond, mad woman,

128
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.930
wilt thou conceal thisdark conspiracy?

129
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.500
A dozen of them here haveta'en the sacrament

130
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.470
and interchangeably setdown their hands

131
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.630
to kill the king atOxford.

132
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.700
He shall be none.

133
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.700
We will keep him here.

134
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.400
Then what is that to him?

135
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.870
Away, fond woman.

136
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.700
Were he 20 times my son, Iwould appeach him.

137
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.870
Hadst thou groaned for himas I have done,

138
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.170
thou wouldst be morepitiful.

139
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.900
But now I know thy mind.

140
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.800
Thou dost suspect that I havebeen disloyal to thy bed

141
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.070
and that he is a bastard,not thy son.

142
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.470
Sweet York, sweet husband,be not of that mind.

143
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.770
He is as like thee as aman may be,

144
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.300
not like to me, or any ofmy kin, and yet I love him.

145
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.130
Make way, unruly woman.

146
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.870
After, Aumerle.

147
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.730
Mount thee upon his horse.

148
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.670
Spur post and get beforehim to the king.

149
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.400
I'll not be long behind.

150
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.230
Though I be old, I doubt notbut to ride as fast as York.

151
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.070
And never will I rise upfrom the ground

152
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.730
till Bolingbroke havepardoned thee.

153
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.770
Away.

154
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.800
Be gone.

155
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.830
What means our cousin that hestares and looks so wildly?

156
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.430
God save Your Grace.

157
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.930
I do beseech Your Majesty

158
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.900
to have some conferencewith Your Grace alone.

159
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.900
Withdraw yourselves andleave us here alone.

160
00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.970
My lord!

161
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.100
What is the matter withour cousin now?

162
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.930
Forever may my knees growto the earth,

163
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.900
my tongue cleave to myroof within my mouth

164
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.700
unless a pardon ere I riseor speak.

165
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.800
Intended or committed wasthis fault?

166
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.100
If on the first, howheinous e'er it be

167
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.600
to win thy after love Ipardon thee.

168
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.900
Then give me leave that Imay turn the key

169
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.900
that no man enter till mytale be done.

170
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.900
Have thy desire.

171
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.270
My liege, look to thyself.

172
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.300
Beware.

173
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.170
Thou hast a traitor in thypresence there.

174
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.530
Villain, I'll make theesafe.

175
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.300
Stay thy revengeful hand.

176
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.000
Thou hast not cause tofear.

177
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Open the door, or I willbreak it open.

178
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.170
What is the matter?

179
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.200
Uncle, speak.

180
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.570
Recover breath.

181
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.030
Tell us how near is dangerthat we may arm us toencounter it.

182
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.330
Peruse this writing

183
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.030
and thou shalt know thetreason that my hasteforbids me show.

184
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.070
Remember as thou read'stthy promise passed.

185
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.200
I do repent me.

186
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.330
Read not my name there.

187
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.670
My heart is notconfederate with my hand.

188
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.200
It was, villain, ere thyhand did set it down.

189
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.670
I tore it from thetraitor's bosom, king.

190
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.400
Fear, and not love, begetshis penitence.

191
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.630
Forget to pity him, lestthy pity prove

192
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.230
a serpent that will stingthee to the heart.

193
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:44.130
Oh, heinous, strong, andbold conspiracy.

194
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.700
Oh, loyal father of atreacherous son,

195
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.830
thou sheer, immaculate,and silver fountain

196
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.870
from whence this streamthrough muddy passages

197
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.200
hath held his current anddefiled himself,

198
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.330
thy overflow of goodconverts to bad,

199
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.230
and thy abundant goodnessshall excuse

200
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.970
this deadly blot in thydigressing son.

201
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.600
So shall my virtue be hisvice's bawd.

202
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.700
And he shall spend minehonor with his shame

203
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.870
as thriftless sons theirscraping fathers' gold.

204
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.030
Mine honor lives when hisdishonor dies,

205
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.970
or my shamed life in hisdishonor lies.

206
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.630
Thou kill'st me in hislife, giving him breath.

207
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.630
The traitor lives.

208
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.830
The true man's put todeath.

209
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.530
What ho, my liege.

210
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.730
For God's sake, let me in.

211
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.830
What shrill-voiced suppliantmakes this eager cry?

212
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.270
A woman, and thy aunt,great king.

213
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.570
'Tis I.

214
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.700
Speak with me.

215
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.830
Pity me.

216
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.700
Open the door.

217
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.170
A beggar begs that neverbegged before.

218
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.270
Our scene is altered froma serious thing

219
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.530
and now changed to "TheBeggar and the King."

220
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.470
My dangerous cousin, letyour mother in.

221
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.170
I know she's come to prayfor your foul sin.

222
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.600
If thou do pardonwhosoever pray,

223
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.530
more sins for thisforgiveness prosper may.

224
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.530
This festered joint cutoff, the rest rest sound.

225
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.930
This let alone will allthe rest confound.

226
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.600
Oh, king, believe not thishardhearted man.

227
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.970
Love loving not itselfnone other can.

228
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.600
Thou frantic woman, whatdost thou make here?

229
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.270
Shall thy old dugs oncemore a traitor rear?

230
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.900
Sweet York, be patient.

231
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.030
Hear me, gentle liege.

232
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.670
Rise up, good Aunt.

233
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.400
Not yet, I thee beseech.

234
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.530
Forever will I walk uponmy knees

235
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.570
and never see day that thehappy sees

236
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.300
till thou give joy,

237
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.470
until thou bid me joy,

238
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.370
by pardoning Rutland, mytransgressing boy.

239
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.070
Unto my mother's prayers Ibend my knee.

240
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:58.430
Against them both my truejoints bended be.

241
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.700
Ill mayst thou thrive, ifthou grant any grace.

242
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.030
Pleads he in earnest?

243
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.230
Look upon his face.

244
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.630
His eyes do drop no tears.

245
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.500
His prayers are in jest.

246
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.570
His words come from hismouth, ours from our breast.

247
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:14.400
He prays but faintly andwould be denied.

248
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.630
We pray with heart andsoul and all besides.

249
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.400
His weary joints wouldgladly rise, I know.

250
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.870
Our knees shall kneel tillto the ground they grow.

251
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.730
His prayers are full offalse hypocrisy,

252
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.030
ours of true zeal and deepintegrity.

253
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.970
Our prayers do outprayhis.

254
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.370
Then let them have thatmercy that true prayerought to have.

255
00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.970
Good Aunt, stand up.

256
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.230
Nay, do not say, "standup."

257
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.800
Say, "pardon" first, andafterwards "stand up."

258
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.070
And if I were thy nurse,thy tongue to teach,

259
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.300
"pardon" would be thefirst word of thy speech.

260
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.600
I never longed to hear theword till now.

261
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:58.700
Say "pardon," King.

262
00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.770
Let pity teach thee how.

263
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.200
The word is short, but notso short as sweet.

264
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.100
No word like "pardon" forkings' mouths so meet.

265
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.370
Speak it in French, king.

266
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.800
Say, "Pardonne moi."

267
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.330
Dost thou teach pardonpardon to destroy?

268
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.430
Oh, my sour husband, myhardhearted lord,

269
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.470
that sets the word itselfagainst the word.

270
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.830
Speak "pardon" as 'tiscurrent in our land.

271
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.200
The chopping French we donot understand.

272
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.130
Thine eye begins to speak.

273
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.830
Set thy tongue there.

274
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.100
Or in thy piteous heartplant thou thine ear

275
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.330
that hearing how our plaintsand prayers do pierce,

276
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.170
pity may move thee"pardon" to rehearse.

277
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.500
Good Aunt, stand up.

278
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.670
I do not sue to stand.

279
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.430
Pardon is all the suit Ihave in hand.

280
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.870
I pardon him,

281
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.370
as God shall pardon me.

282
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.130
Oh, happy vantage of akneeling knee.

283
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.530
Yet am I sick for fear.

284
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:01.200
Speak it again.

285
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.000
Twice saying "pardon" dothnot pardon twain,

286
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.970
but makes one pardonstrong.

287
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.300
With all my heart, Ipardon him.

288
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.430
A god on earth thou art.

289
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.330
But for our trustybrother-in-law and the abbot,

290
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:27.470
with all the rest of thatconsorted crew,

291
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.370
destruction straight shalldog them at the heels.

292
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.930
Good Uncle, help to orderseveral powers to Oxford

293
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.230
or where'er these traitorsare.

294
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.370
They shall not live withinthis world, I swear,

295
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.970
but I will have them, if Ionce know where.

296
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.470
Uncle, farewell.

297
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.070
And, cousin, adieu.

298
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:52.470
Your mother well hathprayed and prove you true.

299
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.170
Come, my old son.

300
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.670
I pray God make thee new.

301
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.500
Did thou not mark theking, what words he spake?

302
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.730
"Have I no friend will ridme of this living fear?"

303
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.170
Was it not so?

304
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.300
These were his very words.

305
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.730
"Have I no friend?" quothhe.

306
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.800
He spake it twice andurged it twice together,did he not?

307
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800
He did.

308
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.500
And speaking it, he wistlylooked on me

309
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.000
as who should say, "Iwould thou wert the man

310
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that would divorce thisterror from my heart,"

311
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.900
meaning the king atPomfret.

312
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.930
Come, let's go.

313
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:43.130
I am the king's friend andwill rid his foe.

314
00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.230
I have been studying how Imay compare

315
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.600
this prison where I liveunto the world.

316
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.400
And for because the worldis populous

317
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:15.030
and here is not a creaturebut myself, I cannot do it.

318
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.230
Yet I'll hammer it out.

319
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:28.000
My brain I'll prove thefemale to my soul,

320
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.770
my soul the father,

321
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:37.000
and these two beget ageneration of stillbreeding thoughts,

322
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.770
and these same thoughtspeople this little world

323
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.500
in humors like the peopleof this world,

324
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.930
for no thought iscontented.

325
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:56.500
The better sort, asthoughts of things divineare intermixed

326
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.770
with scruples and do setthe word itself againstthe word.

327
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.270
As thus, "Come, littleones."

328
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.270
And then again, "It is ashard to come as for a camel

329
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.400
to thread the postern of asmall needle's eye."

330
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.870
Thoughts tending toambition, they do plotunlikely wonders--

331
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.100
how these vain weak nails

332
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.330
may tear a passage throughthe flinty ribs

333
00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:34.270
of this hard world, myragged prison walls.

334
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.370
And, for they cannot, diein their own pride.

335
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.600
Thoughts tending tocontent flatter themselves

336
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.630
that they are not thefirst of fortune's slaves,

337
00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.730
nor shall not be the last.

338
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.770
Like silly beggars who,sitting in the stocks,

339
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.130
refuge their shame,

340
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.530
that many have and othersmust sit there.

341
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.970
And in this thought theyfind a kind of ease,

342
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.600
bearing their ownmisfortunes on the back

343
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.570
of such as have beforeendured the like.

344
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:25.970
Thus play I in one personmany people,

345
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.030
and none contented.

346
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.800
Sometimes am I king.

347
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.730
Then treasons make me wishmyself a beggar,

348
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.070
and so I am.

349
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.530
Then crushing penurypersuades me I was betterwhen a king.

350
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.800
Then am I kinged again,

351
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.300
and by and by think that Iam unkinged by Bolingbroke

352
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.600
and straight am nothing.

353
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.800
But whate'er I be,

354
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.630
nor I nor any man that butman is,

355
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.800
with nothing shall bepleased

356
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.030
till he be eased withbeing nothing.

357
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.800
Music do I hear?

358
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.130
Oh, keep time.

359
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:31.630
How sour sweet music is

360
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.770
when time is broke and noproportion kept.

361
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.300
So is it in the music ofmen's lives.

362
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.700
And here have I thedaintiness of ear

363
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.800
to cheque time broke in adisordered string,

364
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.500
but for the concord of mystate and time

365
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.200
had not an ear to hear mytrue time broke.

366
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:03.030
I wasted time, and nowdoth time waste me.

367
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:06.330
For now hath time made mehis numbering clock.

368
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.270
My thoughts are minutes.

369
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.230
And with sighs they jartheir watches on untomine eyes,

370
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.400
the outward watch,

371
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.700
whereto my finger, like adial's point,

372
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.600
is pointing still, incleansing them from tears.

373
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.300
Now, sir, the sound thattells what hour it is

374
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.330
are clamorous groans thatbeat upon my heart,

375
00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.070
which is the bell.

376
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:31.970
So sighs and tears andgroans show minutes,times, and hours.

377
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:41.230
But my time runs posting onin Bolingbroke's proud joy,

378
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.330
while I stand fooling here,his Jack o' the clock.

379
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.700
This music mads me!

380
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.230
Let it sound no more!

381
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.600
For though it have holpmadmen to their wits,

382
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.070
in me it seems it willmake wise men mad.

383
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.570
Yet blessing on his heartthat gives it me,

384
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.000
for 'tis a sign of love.

385
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:22.630
And love to Richard is astrange brooch in this allhating world.

386
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.870
Hail, royal prince.

387
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.670
Thanks, noble peer.

388
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.400
The cheapest of us is tengroats too dear.

389
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.500
What art thou?

390
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.570
And how comest thou hither

391
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.070
where no man never comesbut that sad dog

392
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.230
that brings me food tomake misfortune live?

393
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.130
I was a poor groom of thystable, king,

394
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.930
when thou wert king,

395
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.230
who, traveling towardsYork,

396
00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:57.530
with much ado at lengthhave gotten leave

397
00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.100
to look upon my sometimesroyal master's face.

398
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.270
Oh, how it yearned myheart

399
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.400
when I beheld in Londonstreets that coronation day

400
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.200
when Bolingbroke rode onroan Barbary,

401
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.770
that horse that thou sooften hast bestrid,

402
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.830
that horse that I socarefully have dressed.

403
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.830
Rode he on Barbary?

404
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.570
Tell me, gentle friend,how went he under him?

405
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.670
So proudly as if hedisdained the ground.

406
00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:27.270
So proud that Bolingbrokewas on his back.

407
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.530
That jade hath eat breadfrom my royal hand.

408
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.900
This hand hath made himproud with clapping him.

409
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.870
Would he not stumble?

410
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.970
Would he not falldown, since pride musthave a fall,

411
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:43.130
and break the neck of thatproud man that did usurphis back?

412
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.070
Forgiveness, horse.

413
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.300
Why do I rail on thee,

414
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.700
since thou, created to be awedby man, wast born to bear?

415
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.830
I was not made a horse,

416
00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.170
and yet I bear the burdenlike an ass,

417
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.730
spurred, galled, and tiredby jouncing Bolingbroke.

418
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.470
Fellow, give place.

419
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:12.800
Here is no longer stay.

420
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.730
If thou love me, 'tis timethou wert away.

421
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.870
What my tongue dares not,that my heart shall say.

422
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.530
My lord, will it pleaseyou to fall to?

423
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:54.130
Taste of it first, as thouart wont to do.

424
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.770
My lord, I dare not.

425
00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.430
Sir Pierce of Exton, wholately came from the king,

426
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:01.830
commands the contrary.

427
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.900
The devil take Henry ofLancaster and thee.

428
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.800
Patience is stale, and Iam weary of it.

429
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800
Help!

430
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.830
Help!

431
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.070
Help!

432
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.830
How now.

433
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:18.800
What means death in thisrude assault?

434
00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.800
Villain!

435
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.500
Thy own hand yields thydeath's instrument.

436
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.130
Go thou, and fill anotherroom in hell.

437
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.570
That hand shall burn innever quenching fire

438
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.100
that staggers thus myperson.

439
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.000
Exton, thy fierce hand

440
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.830
hath with the king's bloodstained the king's own land.

441
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.370
Mount; mount, my soul.

442
00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.600
Thy seat is up on high,

443
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:29.400
whilst my gross flesh sinksdownward, here to die.

444
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.270
Kind Uncle York, thelatest news we hear

445
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.200
is that the rebels haveconsumed with fire

446
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.500
our town of Cicester inGloucestershire.

447
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.100
Whether they be ta'en orslain we hear not.

448
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.270
The grand conspirator,abbot of Westminster,

449
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.100
with clog of conscienceand sour melancholy,

450
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.800
hath yielded up his bodyto the grave.

451
00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.770
But here is Carlisleliving

452
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.930
to abide thy kingly doomand sentence of his pride.

453
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.500
Carlisle, this is your doom.

454
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.400
Choose out some secretplace, some reverend room,

455
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.900
more than thou hast, andwith it joy thy life.

456
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.330
So as thou livest in peace,die free from strife.

457
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.300
For though mine enemy thouhast ever been,

458
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.670
high sparks of honor inthee have I seen.

459
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.830
Great king,

460
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.430
within this coffin Ipresent thy buried fear.

461
00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.930
Herein all breathless lies

462
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.070
the mightiest of thygreatest enemies,

463
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:07.570
Richard of Bordeaux,

464
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.070
by me hither brought.

465
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.500
Exton, I thank thee not,

466
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:35.770
for thou hast wrought a deedof slander with thy fatal hand

467
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.530
upon my head and all thisfamous land.

468
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.670
From your own mouth, mylord, did I this deed.

469
00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.670
They love not poison thatdo poison need,

470
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.270
nor do I thee.

471
00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.400
Though I did wish himdead,

472
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.970
I hate the murderer,

473
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.900
love him murdered.

474
00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:04.270
The guilt of consciencetake thou for thy labor,

475
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:09.230
but neither my good wordnor princely favor.

476
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.100
With Cain go wanderthrough shades of night,

477
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.900
and never show thy head byday nor light.

478
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:28.030
Lords, I protest my soulis full of woe

479
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.200
that blood should sprinkleme to make me grow.

480
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:40.200
Come, mourn with me forwhat I do lament,

481
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.130
and put on sullen, blackincontinent.

482
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.730
I'll make a voyage to theHoly Land

483
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.730
to wash this blood fromoff my guilty hand.

484
00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.170
March sadly after.

485
00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.900
Grace my mournings here

486
00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.670
in weeping after thisuntimely bier.

487
00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.270
