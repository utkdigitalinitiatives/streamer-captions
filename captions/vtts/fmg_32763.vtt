00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
No, probably not, it's not
   something I think about,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but and that's why I think that
maybe it's easy for someone to
  kind of get trapped

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in that kind of situation
 because no one expects it to
happen to them.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
"The verbal stuff started off
first.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
He could make me feel very
stupid.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
There was a combination of
  physical, mental, emotional
abuse.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I really became isolated at
 home.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
She lost control and she flew at
me and threw me against the wall

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and, um, and undid my pants, and
   then I told her to stop.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
My self worth was weighed on
what he had materially and what
I had,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so because he had more material
   assets than I did

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
automatically to him he thought
 he was a better person than I
 was."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Abuse in peer relationships can
   happen to anyone

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
regardless of age, race, class,
  or sexual orientation - it
 doesn't discriminate.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Recognizing the signs of abuse
   can be difficult

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
because they're often subtle and
can be mistaken as attention or
even affection.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The women you are about to hear
  from today are strong women

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and they are still dealing with
their own experiences of abuse.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They have decided to speak out
with their truths to help you 
discover yours.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"When I started going out with
him, first he was very sensitive

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and there was times when I would
 just become really depressed

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and he would be really sensitive
   about it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But then he would also have, it
was almost like, well,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
'I can't cater to you because I
have problems too ok, so excuse
  me if I let it out on you.'

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
That was his philosophy."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
"Initially when we first got
 together things were amazing,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I never felt so cared for so
loved, you know she was
  incredible,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I can't ever remember being that
happy."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
"I really liked him and he fit
 like a lot of qualifications
that women want for men, like:

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
he's got a car, and he's really
smart and he's in a good school

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and he's got a good job and he's
 really understanding and he's
pro-feminist sometimes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and what more could I ask for,
   you know?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And so all those things kind of
  made me not want to see the
   messed up stuff."

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"He had girlfriends, or other
  girls he was involved with,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and I saw how he was treating
 them and I would tell him you
 know,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
you can't talk to her like that
you can't, you know, why are you
treating her like that?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I would never be with somebody
  like that, never,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but by hanging around him he
drew me right in and I ended up
   with him

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and I ended up getting treated
 just like those other girls."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"It was hard, because you're
just scared that he might just
   blow up at you, I guess,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and do something and hit you or
   just yell at you,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
because his words were enough to
  just be like "ok".

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There are many different forms
   of abuse such as:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Financial, spiritual, physical,
 sexual, social, and emotional
  and verbal.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It doesn't progress from one
  form to the other,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
rather it can occur at any point
within a relationship and each
form can be equally as damaging.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
"Well there was the verbal
abuse:

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I'm a fat pig, I'm a loser, I'm
no good, no body else would want
  me, I'm lucky to have him.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Just the basic name-calling.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Then there was the physical
abuse:

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
punched, slapped, he actually
stabbed me with a fork.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The name calling was worse, um,
I didn't like that, it made me
  feel really, I don't know,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
sad all the time."

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
".And the physical, sometimes
 the physical stuff would come
 first

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and then the verbal and then
sometimes the other way around,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and sometimes both at the same
 time,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but a lot of times the words
were irrational unless they were
you know, brief sentences like,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
you know, nobody else would go
out with you, who would go out
with you, um, you know,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
no one else is gonna find you
  attractive,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
no one else would put up with
you - that's one I really - no
one else would put up with you."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
"It was usually over money, you
 know, he wasn't working or he
  would find a bit of a job,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and he would just go drinking
and so there would be a lot of
   shouting and uh, pushing.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Then eventually punching,
   kicking.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
One time he just nailed me
square right in the face and I
   went down

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and I just went like this to
 cover myself

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
because I thought if I fight
back he's stronger than me it's
   gonna get worse."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
"There was a lot of emotional
abuse

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because he knew about every
 relationship I had beforehand

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and every form of abuse I
experienced and he kind of used
  it to his advantage

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and he liked to say things that
 would make me just feel bad,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
make me feel like those things
were just, you know, I deserved
 those things,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and he would push me or put his
fist up to me and all kinds of
things of that nature.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But I remember the one time he
  kicked me.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
He convinced me, he convinced
himself and he convinced me so
 well that it never happened."

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
"From the verbal, from the
cutting down to your nothing, to
  um,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and when I defended myself
that's when the physical stuff
   came into play."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
"It wasn't like he got angry at
 any switch and turn,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
but we were very hot-tempered
when we did get angry.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I'm a very emotional, passionate
person so I yell and scream too,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but he always had to outdo me so
it was more yelling and
  screaming.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Then, for him, it would turn
into throwing something and then
it would just escalate

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
into pushing me against the wall
 he pushed me against, uh, we
were in his parents house once

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and he pushed me against the
 wall and it made a huge hole
 in the wall,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
like from here to the bottom, a
huge hole in the wall."

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000
"You know the whole, the
  jealousy thing, the
possessiveness.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Basically telling me how to
dress telling me how to... what
looks, who to hang around even.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Finding fault with my family all
over the place.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I just felt so vulnerable, she
also on numerous occasions, kept
 me very isolated too,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
by threatening to tell people -
I hadn't come out to everyone at
  that time.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There were a few people that
 knew.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And that was one thing that she
was constantly using to sort of
   keep me away from people;

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
threatening that if I broke up
 with her, you know, that she
  would tell people."

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:26.000
"When he drinks he can get very
violent and I wasn't allowed to
 go anywhere, talk to anybody.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I just felt alone.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
He could take off for two weeks
 three weeks and I couldn't go
   anywhere.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I had two kids to take care of
and it was just, I mean, it was
  just like emotional abuse."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
"Oh ya, the isolation part with
 the phone, who you talking to
and um,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
if I said hello to a guy
automatically I'm sleeping with
 him.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Even if I look at a guy, it
 became a big problem with the
   physical

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
with the strangling and the
   choking.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You know, you're a piece of shit
no decent woman would be looking
at another man.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
When I wasn't making my own
money anymore, he sort of had me
in his corner,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and even to go grocery shopping
it would be like five dollars to
   get something for dinner.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And I would be so ashamed
   sometimes to ask for more

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because I knew what I was prior
to meeting him

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and I'm like I can't let him see
  me like this on my,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but he's the one who put me
 there so he knew I was there,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but by me asking him for money
  would be admitting that I'm
  actually on my knees here."

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
"Whenever we had a fight,
 whenever something happened,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
whenever something went wrong it
   was like my fault that it
   happened.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And he always made me feel like
I was to blame for it,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
so I always felt really guilty
   for it."

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
"There were times when I left
the relationship and had a week
or a few weeks of time to myself

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and she would always come after
  me.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
She would show up at my house
usually late at night after she
  had been out somewhere else

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and she'd end up banging at my
door and yelling for me to open
the door to let her in

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and I was always afraid to let
her in,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
there were times I did let her
in because I wanted the yelling
   to stop."

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
"My husband was a very
aggressive man.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
It was an arranged marriage and
 after a few months they start
  abusing me

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
like they start beating, verbal
  abuse, emotionally.
   I was so much disturbed.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I was assaulted so badly and
   beaten so badly.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Although I am a well educated
lady I was not allowed to talk
  to any other my neighbours

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
or my friends because it was a
   matter of honour,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
they said no you are not allowed
to talk and I always remained at
home -

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
they kept me in a basement."

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"He would call me a whore.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
As a joke sometimes, which I
didn't think was funny,
  obviously,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I mean I'm someone that was
   raped before and molested

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and he knew these things he knew
  that my confidence was low

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
when it came to how I felt about
   myself and he would just,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
it's almost like he played on it
because it made me weaker than
 he was and he was just like,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
he would make fun of me, like,
the way I look and he'd make me
 feel really conscious

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
about the way I looked and
   really cautious and just

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I don't know.  He made me feel
 like a whore,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
more so than almost anybody."

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
If we look closely at abusive
 relationships a general cycle
   emerges.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
After an episode of abuse, the
   abuser generally:

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
gives excuses or expresses guilt
  and promises to never do it
again.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
That's followed by a period
where everything might seem like
  things are getting better.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Well, once the routine returns
  to a relationship, tensions
build

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and the smallest little thing
   might trigger more abuse.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Every abusive relationship has
  its own pattern  -

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a pattern that can repeat itself
within the span of weeks, days
or even hours.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
While the cycle of abuse might
 be different in every
 relationship,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
its effects are the same.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
"It's so hard to actually walk
away from someone you feel like
there's no other person for you.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
That's what they do they make
 you feel like they only love
 you,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
you know what I mean, no one
else is gonna love you and you
 actually believe it.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
You tend to actually believe
what they say, and that's how it
  starts and they have you."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
"We used to fight, I don't know,
I guess we used to fight a lot.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But it wouldn't always end up in
   a physical violent thing,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
sometimes it would just be
  manipulative like,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
he's gonna pretend to leave he
  throws back the key to the
   apartment

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and doesn't talk to me for two
days and is such a drama queen
   about it

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and totally cuts me off, totally
doesn't give me and himself, any
room to communicate, you know?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So it was like, it was emotional
torture at that time because I
   thought,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
"Oh my God, it's over, I love
  him so much I'm so sorry."

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And it just kinda it was like he
 knew that I would in that two
   days be so self-loathing,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
that I would want to do anything
I could to get him back, to be
  with him, you know?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So sometimes he wouldn't even
 have to use violence.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I mean, it varied.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
The violence in our relationship
  it went up and down

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it was always there from the
very beginning, it was there, in
an extreme way;

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to the very end it was there, in
   an extreme way."

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
"You know everything would be
  going along what felt like
  everything was fine

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and the next thing I knew, you
  know, I'd get a call from a
   friend or someone would,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
you know, come by and uh, that
   would trigger a reaction.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Um, sometimes you know, when I'd
talk to her about this she says
oh no you don't see your friends
enough,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and she would do the total
   reverse.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It seemed like she was
  encouraging it so I'd have
 friends over

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and she would make a huge scene,
 my friends would get
   uncomfortable and leave.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
We were in a very remote area,
 and there wasn't even police
that I could call when I needed
 them.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Very often they'd only be in
  town for a couple of days a
 week,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
um, so it was really quite a
frightening situation."

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
"It's usually after I get hurt
and if there's blood or
  something.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000
That's when like if I get cut,
 that's when I see the tender
 side of him because,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I don't know why that always
   happened.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And it's usually ok until the
wound starts to heal up and the
  cycle would repeat,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
it would start all over again."

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
"He would go away and I wouldn't
see him and expect to come back

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and  everything's ok and I never
had a life, I didn't go
  anywhere.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I couldn't do anything.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And I said at that time it
doesn't make any sense to stay
 in the relationship,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
there is nothing, there's no
   communication there's no
   anything.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And those are signs that if I
stay with this man it's going to
be hell after."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
"There were times when he could
build my confidence, like to the
highest point,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and I'd appreciate it and give
us 10 minutes, and apparently my
  big mouth,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and I would just lose it, if it
gets really bad, like and if I'm
  standing too close,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
then he'll like push me and I
 remember when he pushed me he
was just like,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
"it's just a reflex, you know, 
 you can't go up in someone's
 face

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and expect them to be happy with
  you there."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And I was like, "ya but, have we
met, like why would you push me"

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and then afterwards I was just
 really, really uncomfortable

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and scared and of course that's
 the time when he's an angel."

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Being trapped in a cycle of
abuse creates fear, and feelings
   of hopelessness -

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
feelings that you can't leave
   the relationship,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
that there is nowhere else to
  go,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
that nobody will understand and
that you don't deserve better.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
"Fear definitely kept me there,
 fear of being outed,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
fear of having my private life
  turn into something public;

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
fear of having the police
  involved, fear of having my
family find out

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.000
fear for my life, really."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:04.000
"My first son, his first child.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I was going to get a job, I had
  a job interview and he was
 supposed to baby sit the baby

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and he didn't show up to baby
  sit and he knew I had a job
  interview.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
However, after I ended up taking
   my son to the interview

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and after the interview I went
 looking for him at one of his
houses.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
However, I found him and I went
 inside and I started pointing
   out what he did,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
telling him what he did.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
You know like, you had, you told
me you were gonna look after the
 baby,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
where were you I ended up having
 to take him with me.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
He dragged me outside on the
 lawn and started choking me.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
He punched me in the stomach,
like he punched the wind out of
  me.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
But it was the choking, and he
choked me several times before
 to the point of passing out,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
but this time my son was
 standing there and he was two
  years old,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
like standing on the step
 looking at what was happening
  outside on the lawn

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
in front of the house and what
   went through my head was

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
if I'm gonna die I can't die in
   front of my son.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000
You know, that would be the last
thing he saw the last image he
  had of me.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And after six years of putting
  up with the verbal and the
physical stuff

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
just that look on my son's face
at that point in time,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I just said no I can't, i can't,
I cannot live like this anymore
 it's just not right.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And it's not me alone now in
this cycle, my son is in it now

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and I got up and ran next door
 and I called the police from
  next door."

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
"He continued to drink and he
 got violent,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
and he tried to strangle me on
  the kitchen floor.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And actually I think the thing
 that saved me that day was my
daughter screaming in the next
 room.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000
We had the baby gate up but it
was her shrill that he released
his hands around from my throat.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So I ran to get her and I left.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
I was living here at the time in
  Toronto and I went back to
  Manitoba."

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
"So, the last time she sexually
assaulted me, she lost control

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and she flew at me and threw me
against a wall and um, undid my
 pants

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and then I told her to stop, and
threw me on the bed and then she
   had sex with me.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And then I ended up crying and
 she ended up acting

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
like she didn't think that there
   was any big deal,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
except she did point out that I
 seemed to be more upset than
usual,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
which was kind of crazy and
silly.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000
But I was really frightened
because I had never seen her get
 that violent before."

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
There are many early signs that
   can indicate whether your
partner will be abusive or not,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
it doesn't just happen
  overnight.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
The most telling indicator is
that feeling that you get when
 something isn't quite right -

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and if it doesn't feel right, it
probably isn't.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Setting boundaries for yourself
   early in a relationship

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
can let you know if something
isn't right -

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
knowing what you want in a
 relationship,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
how you want to be treated and
 that you deserve dignity and
   respect.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Remember, being abused is
   never your fault.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:36.000
It was when he started
threatening me,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
and just calling me, and yelling
at me on my answering machine,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
and calling me names on my
  answering machine.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:55.000
It's when I felt real fear, is
 when I said 'ok, you gotta do
  something.'

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
"You really need to hear you
  don't deserve this.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
You really need to hear that you
didn't do anything to make this
happen

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
because you really think that if
you just changed that one thing

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
that things would have been
different but they wouldn't have

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
because that's unfortunately,
sadly, that's who he is.  That's
how he deals with situations."

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
"It's hard because you can't
tell someone to get out, it has
to be,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
um, it has to be their decision.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I mean, you can talk to them and
  tell them that they don't 
deserve that treatment,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
there is ways out of it if
they're ready to leave.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I know it's a hard situation
 when you don't have nothing,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
but, I mean, there's shelter's
 like this that offer you the
   support you need

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
and a safe place to go for
   yourself and if you have
  children."

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
If you find yourself at any
stage of an abusive relationship

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
there are ways to break the
cycle:

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
First, acknowledge the abuse,
name it for what it is;

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:06.000
look at your options, evaluate
your resources; choose the one
 that's right for you.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Once you've made the choice,
   make a plan and follow it
   through.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Eventually it will bring you one
step closer to the healing you
 need

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
and further away from the abuse.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
"My roommate at the time had
 witnessed our entire
 relationship,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
almost our entire relationship
 especially the fights, right,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
'cause that was the private the
   only private times in our
  apartment

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
and stuff when my roommate was
   there and she knew about
  everything

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
so I couldn't lie to her, I
   couldn't hide it.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
I couldn't hide me crying, I
   couldn't hide bruises...

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
because she was there, you know,
and she saw it and she helped me
realize just talking and talking

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
and talking about it, making me
talk about it -

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
because she saw it, she had to
 ask me what happened,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
"what was the real reason, what
were you fighting about I didn't
hear everything, what went on."

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
You know, and then having to
out-loud say it to her,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
it was like I couldn't lie
anymore to myself about it, you
know?"

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
"I'd been thinking about it for
   a while,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
and I'd looked into ways of
 trying to get out of it like,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
without him knowing where I was
 because I have his child and
what not - him hunting me down.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I spoke with a worker and he
  gave me a book on shelters

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
if I absolutely needed to
get up and go."

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:49.000
"In the city that I moved into
 it wasn't something that was
  welcomed as conversation -

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
violence amongst women - a lot
 of women felt that women who
 turned women into the police

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
were traitors, a lot of women
  really focussed on the fact

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
that society views lesbian
relationships, some of society,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000
views lesbian relationships as
 dysfunctional and this would
just add to their view of that.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
It was my reality and I wasn't
just hurt by it, I was feeling
   some anger around it too.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Ya, eventually I did, I had to
travel quite far for it
geographically,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
but I was able to find a group,
 a six week support group for
 lesbian women

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
which was really helpful, um, it
made a huge difference.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I ended up for safety reasons,
   having to relocate anyway

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
but emotionally in terms of
self-esteem, it really helped."

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:45.000
"I was carrying a lot of pain
from the past, and I was still
  drinking from time to time

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
and abusing other substances.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So I went to seek help, actually
 I went to a treatment centre.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:02.000
From there I met some other
people that were native and who
 began to inform me about uh,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000
our culture and teachings, our
  family, our values

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Anishnawbe Health has been a
  really great help they have
 traditional counselors there,

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000
uh, traditional healers and
   elders that come through.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Not to mention all the other
people that they have,

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
that attend the ceremonies, and
all the people in the community.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
It's a really good meeting point
 and connection point

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
where you meet friends who then
become like an extended family."

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
"I had a fight with him the day
  before and he was drinking

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
and I thought ok I'm leaving
this situation, I've had it now.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I guess tomorrow's gonna be the
day he goes out, I'm gonna go.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
So I phoned the shelter and they
had space, and I came.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
He went out with the boys and I
 packed what I could and came
 here.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000
That was a week and a day ago."

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
"One of my friends that I called
happened to come out with me one
 night

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
and that night he, um, he just
  pushed me.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Like, he threatened me and then
he pushed me and it was in front
of my friends.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000
And I felt really, really bad
 that they saw that and I felt
  that I had to do something

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and I knew it wasn't right
anymore, I was scared out of my
 mind.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
No one likes to call the police,
 because everyone thinks it'll
 make it worse

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
and I thought it would make it
worse.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
All I really wanted was a
   restraining order and um.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I got more than that because of
 my testimony and my friend's
  testimony.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
It wasn't necessarily what I
 wanted because he was charged
and I was still scared,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000
that scared me more and my
friends were just like "no, ok,
you have to stop this somehow -

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
no one's asking you to, no one's
 asking you to be a pioneer or
   anything

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
people have stopped these
people,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
why don't you want to stop it,
 what is your self-worth," and
   they threw it back at me.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I mean, as much as I thought
 that it was the worst thing I
   could do for me,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:22.000
it was actually the best thing I
  could do, I guess because I
 stopped it."

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
"I need to remember myself and
 how I was before and how I'm
   gonna be.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
If I stayed where I was I would
 have never, It would just be
  continuing and get worse."

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
"Two days later I started
talking about it I told a friend

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I wanted to tell her what
   happened to me.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And I realized that I needed to
   break the cycle of abuse

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
by communicating what had
  happened because up to that
 point

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
I kept most of these things to
   myself."

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
"Be true to yourself, the little
 voice you have in your head,
listen to it. "

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
"I'm at the point where I tell
 the truth to myself and I can
 live with it

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
and I don't feel like I'm the
one to blame anymore for any of
this business,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
that this is not something just
between us like what happens to
   a lot of people."

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
"I am thankful too that I am
 here.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I am very happy that I am in
 Canada because in a shelter,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:39.000
all people all workers they are
very cooperative, very helpful
 and god bless them."

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:47.000
"I've had, uh, for the most part
  healthy relationships since
 then.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I did actually end up with
  another abusive woman very
briefly

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
but I was able to recognize the
signs and got out very quickly.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I mean, because of what I
   learned,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
it didn't stop me from running
 into someone who was abusive
again it just sort of,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:11.000
I was just more aware of how to
handle myself and more informed
as to the choices that i had."

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:21.000
"Just sit in a group for abused
women and listen you know just
   get some education on it,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
you know, maybe you don't think
 you're being abused when you
 are."

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
"And I am happy and I know it
will make him more mad,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
but I don't care because this is
 my life and I have a right to
   live it.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I have been tested time and time
again and I'm not going to let
   anyone bring me down, not
   anymore.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
There's too much offered in
  life, there's too many good
things I've been given

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
to just pass up because someone
 tried to hurt me - there's no
reason.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Ya, so what if someone tried to
hurt you, it doesn't mean that
you can't fulfill your dreams.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
It means that it just makes you
 stronger and you realize that
you should fulfill your dreams."

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
The road to healing can be a
 long one, but it doesn't have
 to be lonely.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Finding support in choosing your
 own path can help you

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
break the cycle of abuse and
begin healing.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.000
No one deserves to be abused and
 recognizing that is the first
  step to building healthier
relationships.
