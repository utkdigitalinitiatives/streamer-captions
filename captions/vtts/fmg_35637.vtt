WEBVTT

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
AS MANY AS 40,000
AUSTRALIANS

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
DON'T HAVE STANDARD
SEX CHROMOSOMES.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
THE SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLE
USED FOR DECADES -

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
THAT ALL GIRLS
HAD XX CHROMOSOMES

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
AND ALL BOYS, XY
- ISN'T RELIABLE.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
ARE WE JUST ON THE
 CUSP OF LEARNING

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
WHAT DETERMINES GENDER?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
WE REALLY ARE.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
WE'RE JUST BEGINNING
TO UNDERSTAND THIS,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
AND I THINK THE MORE WE
GO INTO IT, THE MORE

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
WE UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLEX
THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
IT'S A VERY COMPLEX
NETWORK OF GENES

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
THAT OPERATE IN
SPACE AND TIME.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
CHRISTIE NORTH HAS
ALWAYS FELT FEMALE.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
BUT WHEN SHE WAS 15 SHE
FOUND OUT SHE WAS BORN

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
WITH MALE CHROMOSOMES
AND INTERNAL TESTES.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
THERE WAS NO MENTION
DURING SCHOOL,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
DURING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,
THAT THERE CAN BE

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
MIX-UPS WITH
YOUR CHROMOSOMES.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
THE SCIENTIFIC WORLD IS ON
THE VERGE OF DISCOVERING

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
WHAT REALLY DETERMINES
GENDER, AND IN MANY CASES

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
HOW LITTLE IT HAS TO DO
WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I JUST SORT OF GREW UP
WITH SCARRING AND THINGS

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
AND THINKING, "WELL,
OKAY, WHAT WAS THIS FOR?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
WHY DID I HAVE THIS?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
BUT I'M BEING TOLD
THESE PARTICULAR THINGS,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'M BEING TOLD THAT FOR
THIS STAGE IN MY LIFE

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I'M A BOY, THEREFORE
I MUST BE ONE".

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
WHY DID THEY
 MAKE YOU A BOY?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
UM, I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
IDEA WHY THEY DID IT.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
AUSTRALIAN LAW, TOO, IS
GRAPPLING WITH THE LATEST

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
SCIENCE ON WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE MALE OR FEMALE.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
TRIED TO PROVE THIS PERSON

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
WAS A WOMAN.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
THE LAST THING YOU WANT
TO BE DOING IS TRYING TO

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
PROVE THAT YOU ARE THE
PERSON YOU ARE TO SOMEONE

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
THAT DOESN'T KNOW YOU,
SOMEONE THAT HAS NO IDEA

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
ABOUT YOUR LIFE, NEVER
INTERACTS WITH YOU AT ALL,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
HAS NEVER MET YOU.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I KNOW WHAT A MAN IS, AND
I KNOW WHAT A HUSBAND IS,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
AND I KNOW WHAT A FATHER IS
AND HE'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
TONIGHT ON FOUR CORNERS,
NEW AND CHALLENGING

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
SCIENCE ON THE
QUESTION OF GENDER.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
WHAT MAKES A BOY AND
WHAT MAKES A GIRL?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
IF WE RELIED ON THE COMMON
SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION OF

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
A MALE - THAT BEING SOMEONE
WITH XY CHROMOSOMES

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
- THEN CHRISTIE NORTH
WOULD BE A MAN.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
AS AN UNBORN BABY SHE WAS
UNABLE TO PROCESS MALE

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
HORMONES SO SHE DEVELOPED
INSTEAD INTO A FEMALE.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
THE MELBOURNE WOMAN HAS AN
INTERSEX CONDITION CALLED

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
"COMPLETE ANDROGEN
INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME".

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
THIS IS ONE OF MORE
THAN A DOZEN DIFFERENT

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
TYPES OF
INTERSEX CONDITIONS

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
AFFECTING THOUSANDS
OF AUSTRALIANS.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
SO THERE WAS NOTHING THAT
 MADE YOU ANY DIFFERENT

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
FROM ANY OF THE
 OTHER GIRLS?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
NO, NOT AT ALL.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
EVEN WHEN I TOLD MY
FRIENDS - I ONLY TOLD

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
A FEW FRIENDS - BUT
THEY HAD NO IDEA.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
MY WAY OF THINKING IS THAT
SHE WAS ALWAYS INTENDED TO

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
BE A GIRL BUT SHE JUST GOT
THERE BY A DIFFERENT PATH.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
THAT, I THINK, IS A
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
WAY OF THINKING.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
INSTEAD OF THE NEGATIVE
WAY WHICH SAYS THIS IS A

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
BOY WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT,
THIS IS A GIRL WHO DID

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
MAKE IT AND WAS MEANT
TO MAKE IT THIS WAY,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
BUT LIFE WAS JUST MEANT TO
BE ALSO A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
MANY OF THESE XY WOMEN
ARE TALL AND BEAUTIFUL.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
THERE ARE RUMORS THAT
SOME ACTORS AND MODELS

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
HAVE THE CONDITION.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IT OFTEN PRODUCES WOMEN
WITH LITTLE BODY HAIR

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
AND CLEAR SKIN.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I HAVE.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I THINK
ABOUT ON A DAILY BASIS.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I THINK ABOUT IT
OCCASIONALLY AND IF

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I MENTION IT TO FRIENDS OR
A PROSPECTIVE BOYFRIEND

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
IT EVER GETS MENTIONED
OR BROUGHT UP.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
WHAT HAS IT
 MEANT FOR CHRISTIE

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
TO HAVE XY CHROMOSOMES?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
OH, SHE'S HAPPY.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I THINK SHE'S HAPPY.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I DON'T THINK IT'S
WORRIED HER AT ALL.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
SHE'S NEVER REALLY
COMPLAINED OR...

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
SHE'S JUST A NORMAL GIRL,
YOU KNOW, INTO THE HAIR,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
COLORED HAIR,
MAKE-UP, YOU NAME IT.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
SHE'S INTO THE
LATEST FASHIONS.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
WHEN CHRISTIE NORTH
WAS TWO YEARS OLD,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
SHE WENT INTO HOSPITAL
FOR A HERNIA OPERATION.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
INTERNAL TESTES
WERE DISCOVERED

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
AND CHRISTIE WAS
LATER DIAGNOSED WITH

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY
SYNDROME.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
SHE WAS BORN WITH TESTES
THAT ARE CAPABLE OF

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
MAKING THE MALE SEX
HORMONE, TESTOSTERONE.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
HER BODY IS UNABLE TO
RESPOND IN ANY WAY TO THAT

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
HORMONE BECAUSE THE
RECEPTORS IN EVERY CELL IN

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THE BODY FOR TESTOSTERONE
ARE ABSENT, AND THE REASON

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
FOR THAT IS A
GENETIC ALTERATION.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
WHEN I WAS IN GRADE
SIX, PROFESSOR WARNE,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
OR DR. WARNE THEN, SAT
ME DOWN WITH MY PARENTS

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
AND MY SISTER AND WE
DISCUSSED THAT I WAS

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
UNABLE TO HAVE KIDS
AND MENSTRUATE AND

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH
ALL THAT WAS SAID THEN.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
IT WASN'T UNTIL CHRISTIE
NORTH WAS 15 THAT SHE

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
WAS TOLD THAT SHE
HAD MALE CHROMOSOMES

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
AND WAS BORN WITH TESTES.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IN ANY
 WAY EASIER FOR YOU IF YOU

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
HAD BEEN TOLD EVERYTHING
 AT THE BEGINNING?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
YEAH, IT WOULD'VE.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
GROWING UP THINKING THAT
YOU HAD A HYSTERECTOMY

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
IT'S NOT THE CASE WHEN
YOU FIND OUT LATER ON,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
SO IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LOT EASIER

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
IF YOU'D KNEW
STRAIGHT AWAY.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
YOU ACTUALLY DIDN'T KNOW
 WHY YOU WERE INFERTILE?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
NO, NO.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
EVERY YEAR CHRISTIE NORTH
RECEIVES AN IMPLANT OF THE

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
FEMALE HORMONE ESTROGEN
TO HELP FEMINIZE HER BODY.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE
WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
THERE'S MORE THAN WHAT
YOU THINK THERE IS.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
WHEN YOU KNEW PEOPLE THAT
DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
YOU THINK, "OH, WHY DIDN'T
THEY HAVE CHILDREN?"

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
SO NOW WE KNOW WHY A
LOT OF OLDER PEOPLE

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
DIDN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
IT'S BECAUSE THEY
HAD THIS PROBLEM

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
AND IT WAS NEVER
SPOKEN ABOUT.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
LIKE CHRISTIE, TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF AUSTRALIANS

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
DON'T HAVE STANDARD
SEX CHROMOSOMES.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AS WELL AS GIRLS
WITH XY CHROMOSOMES,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
ONE IN 500 BOYS
ARE BORN WITH

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
A DOUBLE XX AS
WELL AS A Y.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
MOST HAVE STANDARD
GENITALIA AND ARE UNAWARE

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
OF THEIR CHROMOSOMAL
MAKE-UP UNTIL THEY TRY TO

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
FATHER CHILDREN AND
DISCOVER THEY'RE INFERTILE.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
SO WHAT DOES A SITUATION
 LIKE YOURS, HAVING XY

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
CHROMOSOMES, SAY ABOUT
 THE GENDER SPECTRUM?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
WELL, IT'S NEVER ALL
ONE OR THE OTHER.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
ONE IN 500 PEOPLE HAS
A CHROMOSOME VARIATION

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
OF SOME SORT.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
SO IT'S NOT UNCOMMON.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
MOST SCIENTISTS BELIEVE
WE'RE JUST ON THE VERGE

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
OF LEARNING WHAT MAKES
US MALE AND FEMALE,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
AND THEY BELIEVE ONE WAY
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
IS THROUGH THE STUDY OF THOSE
ON THE GENDER EXTREMES.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I THINK THROUGHOUT HISTORY
HUMANS HAVE BEEN REALLY

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
INTERESTED IN WHAT
MAKES US MALE OR FEMALE,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
AND UNDERLYING THAT IS
WHETHER OR NOT A TESTIS

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
OR AN OVARY DEVELOPS
IN THE EMBRYO.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
UNTIL THE 1990'S, GENDER
WAS THOUGHT TO BE

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
LARGELY ABOUT
CHROMOSOMES.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
BUT THIS PRINCIPLE
WAS CHALLENGED WHEN A

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH
WAS MADE DURING THE STUDY

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
OF PEOPLE WITH
INTERSEX CONDITIONS.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
A NEW GENE AND ITS IMPACT
ON THE DEVELOPMENT

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
OF MALE GENITALIA
WAS DISCOVERED.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
A TEAM OF SCIENTISTS,
INCLUDING ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
ANDREW SINCLAIR,
DISCOVERED SRY,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
THE GENE NEEDED TO START
THE PROCESS OF 'MALENESS'.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
THE RATIONALE FOR FINDING
THAT GENE WAS THAT WE

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
COULD UNRAVEL THE WHOLE
PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
HOW YOU BUILD SOMETHING
AS COMPLEX AS A TESTIS,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
AND BY KNOWING ALL THE
DIFFERENT COMPONENT PARTS

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
- A LITTLE BIT LIKE
PUTTING A CAR TOGETHER -

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
IF YOU KNOW ALL THE BITS,
WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
YOU CAN PINPOINT THAT AND
CORRECT THAT IF NEED BE.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
IT'S RECENTLY BEEN
DISCOVERED THAT THE

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
SRY GENE IS ALSO PRESENT
IN THE MALE BRAIN REGION

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS,
THE SAME AREA WHERE

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
GENDER BRAIN IDENTITY
IS DEVELOPED.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
WE'VE HAD SOME SUCCESS
IN UNDERSTANDING SRY

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
AND HOW IT
MAKES A TESTIS.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
WE'RE NOW TRYING TO LOOK
AT WHAT SRY MIGHT BE DOING

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
IN THE BRAIN.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE
FROM OUR STUDIES

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
THAT THERE ARE GENES
ON THE Y CHROMOSOME,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
WHICH MALES HAVE
AND FEMALES DON'T,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
THAT MAKE AT LEAST
RATS MORE AGGRESSIVE;

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
AND SO IT COULD
BE THAT THERE ARE

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
MALE-SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS
THAT ARE CARRIED

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
BY GENES ON THE Y
CHROMOSOME, SUCH AS SRY.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR
VINCENT HARLEY

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
IS NOW LOOKING AT
A FURTHER 54 GENES

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
THAT HAVE BEEN
DISCOVERED SINCE SRY.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
THESE GENES IN THE EMBRYO
ARE TURNED ON DIFFERENTLY

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
IN MALE AND FEMALE BRAINS
EVEN BEFORE THE ORGANS

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
THAT SECRETE
HORMONES HAVE FORMED.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
THEY MAY HELP SCIENTISTS
TO EXPLAIN WHY SOME PEOPLE

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
IDENTIFY AS ONE
GENDER OR THE OTHER,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
INDEPENDENTLY
OF CHROMOSOMES.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
IS HARD-WIRED DIFFERENTLY
BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
OUR GENDER - HOW WE SEE
OURSELVES - IS DETERMINED

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
BY OUR BRAINS AS MUCH
AS ANYTHING ELSE.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
SO IT'S QUITE LIKELY,
ONE COULD IMAGINE,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
THAT THERE'LL BE
RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
WHICH WILL RESPOND TO
SOME OF THOSE HORMONES.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
SO, IF THE GENE OR THOSE
RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
ARE NOT FUNCTIONING
AND NOT GOING TO RECEIVE

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THE MALE HORMONE,
THEN THAT PERSON

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
MAY WELL HAVE A
FEMININE OUTLOOK.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
SO THE BRAIN WILL
INFLUENCE GENDER

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
AS MUCH AS THE GONADS.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
SCIENCE IS STARTING TO
REDEFINE THE GENDER DEBATE.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
FOR YEARS IT WAS THOUGHT
TO BE ALL ABOUT NURTURE -

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
THE WAY A CHILD
WAS RAISED.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
FEMINIST THEORY
HELPED THE IDEA ALONG.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
WOMEN LIMITED THEMSELVES
BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
STEREOTYPED AND
SOCIALIZED THAT WAY.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
IT'S A REALITY OF TWISTED
AND THWARTED PEOPLE,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
PEOPLE WHO ARE
TWISTED AND THWARTED

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
'CAUSE THEY'RE PUSHED
INTO ROLES.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
GIRLS TRAIN THEMSELVES
FOR THEIR FUTURE.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
THEY TAKE THEIR
DOLLS TO THE PARK...

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
MOST OF THE
THEORIES OF THE TIME

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
SPOKE ABOUT SOCIALIZATION,
SPOKE ABOUT THE WAY

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
PARENTS TRAIN US INTO
PARTICULAR GENDER ROLES,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
AND THAT WAS THE
PREVAILING MODEL.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
IN THE '60'S AND '70'S
DOCTORS BELIEVED THE POWER

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
OF NURTURE WAS SO STRONG
IT COULD BE APPLIED

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
TO CHILDREN WHERE THEIR
SEX WAS AMBIGUOUS.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
THE PRACTICE WAS TO ASSIGN
A BABY WHO OFTEN HAD

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
BOTH MALE AND FEMALE
GENITALIA A GENDER.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
THE CHILD WOULD THEN
UNDERGO GENITAL SURGERY

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
AND BE RAISED IN
ITS ASSIGNED SEX.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
THE THEORY WAS THE CHILD
WOULD GROW UP HAPPY

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
AND WELL ADJUSTED.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
THIS PHILOSOPHY WAS
BASED ON THE WORK OF

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
A FAMOUS NEW ZEALAND
PSYCHIATRIST, JOHN MONEY.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
UNFORTUNATELY HE WAS VERY
POWERFUL AND INFLUENTIAL

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
AT THE TIME AND PEOPLE
TOOK THIS THEORY AS GOSPEL.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
 OF THAT THEORY NOW?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
WELL, I THINK A TOTAL
RELIANCE ON NURTURE

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
AS FAR AS DETERMINING
SEX IS COMPLETE RUBBISH.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I THINK IT JUST
DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
ANDIE HIDER IS AN
EXAMPLE OF THE FAILURE

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
OF JOHN MONEY'S
NURTURE THEORY.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
SHE WAS BORN WITH AMBIGUOUS,
OR ATYPICAL, GENITALIA.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
DOCTORS DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SEX SHE WAS,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
SO THEY TOOK A PUNT AND
DECIDED SHE'D BE A BOY.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I GUESS WE'D BEEN BROUGHT
UP IN THAT GENERATION

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
TO THINK THAT DOCTORS
WERE SOMEWHAT GOD-LIKE.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
IF YOU WERE TOLD
SOMETHING, YOU BELIEVED IT.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
ANDREW HIDER WAS A QUIET,
GENTLE LITTLE BOY

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
WHO ALWAYS FELT NOT
QUITE RIGHT ABOUT

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
HIS PLACE IN THE WORLD
AND DIDN'T KNOW WHY.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
HE WAS CERTAINLY
NOT A TYPICAL BOY,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
NOT OUT KICKING FOOTBALLS
AND ROUGH-HOUSING.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
HE WAS GREAT AT FIDDLING
AROUND MAKING THINGS,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
CREATING THINGS - VERY GOOD
WITH HIS HANDS ALWAYS.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
ANDIE WAS NEVER REALLY
TERRIBLY MALE OR FEMALE,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
ALWAYS SLIGHTLY AMBIGUOUS.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I GUESS LOOKING BACK,
I THINK ANDIE PROBABLY

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
HAD A REALLY
DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
ANDIE HIDER DID A LOT OF
THE THINGS THAT MEN DO.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
SHE WAS INTO CARS
AND MECHANICS.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
BUT, DESPITE THE
MASCULINE PURSUITS,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
PEOPLE OFTEN MISTOOK
ANDIE FOR FEMALE.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
AS A MAN, SHE STARTED
TO QUESTION HER GENDER.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
I SORT OF THOUGHT,
WELL, IF I'M NOT MALE,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
THEN I MUST BE
SOMETHING ELSE,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
AND THE ONLY OTHER
THING IS FEMALE.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
SO, FOR ME, THAT WAS THE
THING THAT MADE ME REALIZE,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
"WELL, THAT'S
PROBABLY WHO I AM".

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
ANDIE HIDER DECIDED TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
SHE APPLIED FOR HER
MEDICAL RECORDS

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
UNDER THE FREEDOM
OF INFORMATION ACT.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
WHAT SHE FOUND
SHOCKED HER.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
SHE WAS BORN WITH A RARE BUT
EXTREME INTERSEX CONDITION

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
- PARTIAL ANDROGEN
INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
ANDIE HIDER HAS MALE
CHROMOSOMES BUT HER BODY

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
COULDN'T PROCESS ENOUGH
MASCULINE HORMONES,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
LEAVING HER WITH MANY
FEMININE ATTRIBUTES

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
AND AMBIGUOUS OR
ATYPICAL GENITALIA.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW AT
THE TIME WHAT THEY WERE

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
DEALING WITH, BUT THEY
DIDN'T TELL MY PARENTS

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
BECAUSE IT WASN'T
THE CULTURE TO DO SO.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
YOUR PARENTS
 HAD NO IDEA?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
NO.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I WAS OUTRAGED, I
SUPPOSE, THAT IN

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
COMPARATIVELY MODERN
TIMES ANYBODY WOULD

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT
MY CHILD AND, YOU KNOW,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
HER FUTURE WITHOUT EVEN
TELLING ME ABOUT IT.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AFTER
I GOT MY MEDICAL RECORDS,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
WHEN I WAS ABOUT
30 YEARS OLD,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
AND WENT AND
TOLD MY MOTHER.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I KNOW NOW THAT THIS
WAS ACCEPTED PRACTICE

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
THAT YOU DON'T TELL
PEOPLE ABOUT THIS.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
IT'S, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
THAT MUST BE KEPT QUIET

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
AND OUT OF SIGHT AND
OUT OF MIND, BUT...

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
SO ANDIE'S CASE
 WASN'T A ONE-OFF?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
OH, NO. NO, NO.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
ANDIE HIDER, A FEDERAL
POLICE OFFICER,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
TURNED HER
ANGER INTO ACTION.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
IN HER SPARE TIME SHE
BECAME AN ADVOCATE

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
FOR PEOPLE WITH
INTERSEX CONDITIONS.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
ANDIE SAYS THE CULTURE HAS
BEEN NOT TO TELL PARENTS,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
AND PARTICULARLY CHILDREN,
OF THEIR CONDITIONS.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
SHE WANTS THAT CHANGED
AND IS CALLING FOR

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
FULL MEDICAL
DISCLOSURE.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
ANDIE HIDER CLAIMS NO
AMOUNT OF NURTURE WILL

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
MAKE SOMEONE A BOY OR A
GIRL IF THEY AREN'T ONE.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
WHAT I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH
NOW IS THE FACT THAT THE

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
MEDICAL PROFESSION SHOULD
HAVE LEARNED FROM STORIES

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
LIKE MINE AND FROM
STORIES OF OTHER PEOPLE

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
AND SAID, "WELL,
HANG ON, THIS ISN'T

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
NECESSARILY WORKING,
AND THERE ARE OPTIONS.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
OF TREATING THIS."

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
AND THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
 HAVEN'T LEARNED?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE,
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I THINK ANDIE'S LIFE WOULD
HAVE BEEN A LOT EASIER

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
IF SHE HAD KNOWN
FROM THE OUTSET THAT,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
"YOU HAVE A CHOICE
HERE", YOU KNOW,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
"YOU ARE THIS TYPE OF PERSON
- NOT MALE, NOT FEMALE -

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
YOU FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF",

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
RATHER THAN HAVING
SOMETHING IMPOSED ON YOU

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
THAT MAY NOT BE
THE RIGHT THING.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
PROFESSOR GARRY WARNE
IS AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
WHO'S BEEN WORKING
WITH INTERSEX CHILDREN

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
FOR ALMOST 30 YEARS.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION
FELT THEY WERE IN A

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
PRIVILEGED POSITION OF
HAVING THE INFORMATION

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
AND THAT THE PATIENTS
DIDN'T NEED TO BE BOTHERED

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
BY SOME OF THOSE
PAINFUL FACTS.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
HE DID ACTUALLY START THE
MOVEMENT TO TELL THE TRUTH.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
A LOT OF DOCTORS SAID,
"YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
YOU KNOW, "WHAT GIVES YOU
THE RIGHT TO TURN AROUND

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND RUIN THESE
PEOPLE'S LIVES?"

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
AND, AS HE SAID, "IT'S
NOT RUINING THEIR LIVES".

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
AND HE WAS QUITE RIGHT.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
IN 2002 GARRY WARNE
WAS MADE AN HONORARY

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
LIFE MEMBER OF THE
ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
SUPPORT GROUP FOR
HIS EFFORTS TO HAVE

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
INTERSEX CONDITIONS
DISCLOSED.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
BUT HE IS A
CONTROVERSIAL FIGURE.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
LIKE JOHN MONEY BEFORE
HIM, HE STILL BELIEVES

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
IN SURGICALLY ASSIGNING
A GENDER TO BABIES

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
WITH AMBIGUOUS OR
ATYPICAL GENITALIA.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
HE BELIEVES FAILURE TO DO
THIS COULD DAMAGE THE CHILD.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I THINK THAT IT EXPOSES
THE CHILD TO THE

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
POSSIBILITY OF RIDICULE
AND EMBARRASSMENT.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT
WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
VERY DIFFERENT FROM
OTHER CHILDREN.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
NOW IT'S JUST LUDICROUS
TO TURN AROUND AND SAY,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
"WELL, LET'S TRY
AND ALLEVIATE SOME

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
SOCIAL EMBARRASSMENT
BY SURGICALLY ALTERING

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
A CHILD AT THAT
STAGE OF THEIR LIFE.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
MANY DOCTORS AND
ADVOCATES BELIEVE

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
IT'S WRONG TO SURGICALLY
CHANGE GENITALIA

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
UNTIL A CHILD
CAN HAVE ITS SAY.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
BUT PROFESSOR WARNE SAYS
HIS POLICY, WHEN IN DOUBT,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
IS TO MAKE
A CHILD A BOY.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
IT PROVIDES MORE CHOICE.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
IT GIVES THE PERSON
THE GREATEST OPTION

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
WHEN THEY GROW UP.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
THEY CAN EASILY REVERSE
THAT AND GO BACK

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
TO FEMALE IF THEY WISH,
BUT IT'S VERY HARD

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
TO GO THE OTHER WAY.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
SO PRESERVING OPTIONS I
THINK IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
CLINICAL SITUATION

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
TO BE FACED WITH.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
ASSESSMENT TO MAKE, AND,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
AS I SAID, THE CURRENT
PARADIGM WOULD BE TO WAIT

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
AND SEE AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE, WHEREAS THE OLD

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
PARADIGM WOULD HAVE BEEN
TO INTERVENE, SURGICALLY

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
RE-ASSIGN AND TO RAISE
THE CHILD UNAMBIGUOUSLY.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
SOME INTERNATIONAL
STUDIES

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
CHALLENGE PROFESSOR
WARNE'S VIEW.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
IN THE US, 94 PEOPLE WITH
AN INTERSEX CONDITION

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
WHO HAD ATYPICAL
GENITALIA WERE SURVEYED.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
MORE THAN HALF WERE
UNHAPPY WITH THE SEX

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
THEY'D BEEN ASSIGNED.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
DESPITE BEING RAISED
AS GIRLS AND HAVING

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
GENITAL SURGERY,
THEY BECAME BOYS.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
IT'S A HOT POINT, BUT WE'VE
ALSO RECENTLY COMPLETED

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
OUR LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP
STUDY AT THIS HOSPITAL

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
AND WE GOT IT RIGHT
96% OF THE TIME.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
IN OUR SERIES THERE
WERE ONLY TWO OUT OF 50

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
WHO WANTED TO BE
THE OTHER SEX.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
SO WHAT IS THE AIS SUPPORT
 GROUP GOING ON ABOUT WHEN

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
THEY SAY HOW BADLY THEY'VE
 BEEN TREATED BY DOCTORS

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
AND HOW UNHAPPY PEOPLE
 ARE WITH SURGERY?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
WHERE ARE THEY
 COMING FROM?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
WELL, I THINK THAT
THEY'RE, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO
HAVE HAD BAD EXPERIENCES

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
AND WHO FEEL EMPOWERED
BY BELONGING TO A GROUP

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
AND MAKING THEIR
PRESENCE KNOWN.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
WHY DOESN'T THEIR BAD
 EXPERIENCES, THEN,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
CORRELATE WITH
 YOUR STUDY?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE
PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD GOOD

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
EXPERIENCES DON'T BOTHER
JOINING SUCH GROUPS.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
WE'RE NOT A GROUP
OF MALCONTENTS.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
WE'RE NOT A GROUP OF
PEOPLE WHO GET TOGETHER

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
AND GRIND AXES
ABOUT DOCTORS.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME GOOD DOCTORS.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
WE GIVE AWARDS TO DOCTORS
WHO ARE FORWARD THINKING,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
WHO DO CHANGE THINGS.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
THERE IS A NUCLEUS IN
 THE HYPOTHALAMUS THAT IS

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
DIFFERENTLY SIZED
 IN MALE AND FEMALES.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
ANDIE HIDER'S STORY
FOCUSES ATTENTION

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
ON WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN
CHROMOSOMES DON'T MATCH

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
GENDER IDENTITY.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
THE BIOLOGY OF GENDER,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
SCIENTISTS ARE
RESEARCHING ANOTHER GROUP

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
ON THE GENDER EXTREME
- TRANSSEXUALS.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
THEY HAVE THE BODY TO
MATCH THEIR CHROMOSOMES

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
BUT BELIEVE THEIR BRAIN
HAS BEEN HARD-WIRED

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
TO GO IN THE
OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
PEOPLE, SINCE THE DAWN OF
HUMANITY, HAVE WONDERED

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
WHY WE FEEL THE SEX WE
FEEL AND I THINK NATURE

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
HAS KIND OF THROWN UP
THESE VARIATIONS WHICH ARE

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
WONDERFUL AND WE SHOULD
CELEBRATE THESE VARIATIONS

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
IN GENDER IDENTITY.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
WHY SHOULD WE
 CELEBRATE THEM?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
BECAUSE I THINK IT TELLS
US A LOT ABOUT HOW WE

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
- HOW YOU AND I -

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
PERCEIVE OURSELVES
AS THE SEX WE ARE.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
HERE IN FEMALES IT'S
 ABOUT HALF THE SIZE...

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
TRANSSEXUALS ARE
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
TO SCIENTISTS WHO WANT
TO MAP OUT THE PATTERN

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
OF HUMAN SEXUAL
DEVELOPMENT.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
THEY PROVIDE A UNIQUE
SAMPLE THAT ANIMAL STUDIES

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
CAN'T REPLICATE.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
THERE IS A SMALL BUT
GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
THAT TRANSSEXUAL BRAINS
ARE HARD-WIRED IN UTERO

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
TO BE EITHER
MALE OR FEMALE.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
PROFESSOR HARLEY HOPES
TO PROVE IN HIS STUDY

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
THAT BRAIN SEX
IS RESPONSIBLE

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
FOR THE TRANSSEXUAL
CONDITION.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A
PUBLIC PERCEPTION THAT,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
YOU KNOW, TRANSSEXUALISM
IS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
AND I THINK TO REAFFIRM
A BIOLOGICAL BASIS

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
WOULD BE QUITE
EMPOWERING FOR THEM.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
PROFESSOR HARLEY IS
RESEARCHING A VARIANCE

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
IN THE SEQUENCE OF GENES
THOUGHT TO BE FOUND

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
IN MALE-TO-FEMALE
TRANSSEXUALS.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
HE IS STUDYING THE
DNA OF 50 PEOPLE.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
HIS WORK MAY ALSO
HELP TO EXPLAIN WHY,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
AS MALES OR FEMALES, WE
BEHAVE THE WAY WE DO.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
WELL, I THINK ULTIMATELY
IT WOULD BE GREAT

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
TO FIND GENDER IDENTITY
GENES, AND IT MIGHT BE

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
THROUGH THE STUDIES
OF TRANSSEXUALS

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
THAT WE'LL GET
TO THOSE GENES.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
IN FACT, I THINK
IT'S THE ONLY WAY

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
WE'RE GOING TO GET
TO THOSE GENES.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
THE THEORY OF BRAIN SEX
IS NOT ONLY CHALLENGING

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
FOR SCIENCE BUT
ALSO FOR THE LAW.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
IT WAS RELIED ON FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN AUSTRALIA

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
IN A LANDMARK CASE
IN THE FAMILY COURT.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
"KEVIN", A TRANSSEXUAL,
WANTED TO MARRY

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
HIS PARTNER, "JENNIFER".

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
THE FEDERAL
ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
DEPARTMENT OPPOSED THE
MARRIAGE, ARGUING THAT

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
KEVIN, IN THE EYES OF
THE LAW, WAS FEMALE.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
TO BE A MAN, KEVIN MUST
HAVE BEEN BORN WITH

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
MALE CHROMOSOMES,
GENITALS AND GONADS.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
BUT, INSTEAD, HE WAS BORN
INTO THE BODY OF A FEMALE.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
WHY DID YOU DECIDE
 TO GET MARRIED?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
WELL, I'M A BIT
OF A TRADITIONALIST,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
FIRST OF ALL, AND I REALLY
WANTED TO MARRY JENNIFER.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
BUT THE ABSOLUTE CRUNCH
OF THE MATTER WAS

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR
HER AND ANY CHILDREN

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
WE CHOSE TO
HAVE LATER.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
THE FAMILY COURT FORBIDS
THE IDENTIFICATION

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
OF PARTIES TO
ITS PROCEEDINGS.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
FOR THE PURPOSE OF A
COURT CASE, THE COUPLE

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
WERE KNOWN AS "KEVIN"
AND "JENNIFER".

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME THEY'VE EVER

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
SPOKEN PUBLICLY.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
THEY HAVE BEEN
DISGUISED.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I REMEMBER GOING TO
BED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
WISHING THAT WHEN I
WAKE UP THAT I'D BE LIKE

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
ALL THE OTHER BOYS INSTEAD
OF BEING DIFFERENT.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
FOR AS LONG AS
KEVIN CAN REMEMBER

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
HE PERCEIVED
HIMSELF TO BE MALE.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG,
HIS MOTHER TRIED TO

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
PERSUADE HIM
HE WAS A GIRL.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
SHE HAD HER HUSBAND
AND CHILD STAND NAKED

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
I JUST CONTINUED TO
SAY, "I'M A LITTLE BOY".

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
SHE KEPT SAYING,
"YOU'RE NOT".

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
AND I THINK OUT OF
DESPERATION SHE EVENTUALLY

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
MADE ME STAND IN FRONT OF
MY FATHER, WHO WAS NAKED,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
AND SAID TO ME, "LOOK,
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
YOUR FATHER;
YOU'RE NOT A BOY".

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
AND I SAID,
"BUT I AM".

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
KEVIN WAS THE OLDEST
OF FOUR CHILDREN.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
HE HAD THREE SISTERS.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
HIS ADOLESCENCE
WAS TRAUMATIC.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
AT SCHOOL HE WAS HARASSED
FOR WEARING BOYS' CLOTHES.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
HE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO
FIGHT TO PROTECT HIMSELF.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
SO KIDS USED TO TEASE ME
AND HARASS ME CONSTANTLY:

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
"YOU'RE A GIRL,
YOU'RE NOT A BOY."

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
"WHY DO YOU
DRESS LIKE THAT?"

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
"WHY DO YOU
LOOK LIKE THAT?"

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
"WHY DO YOU PLAY SOCCER
AND FOOTBALL AND CRICKET?"

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
"WHY CAN'T YOU BE
LIKE THE REST OF US?"

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
AND I'D JUST SAY,
"I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I CAN'T BE YOU.
I'M BEING MYSELF."

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
THEN PUBERTY KICKED IN.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
HE STARTED TO DEVELOP
BREASTS AND MENSTRUATE.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
OH, IT WAS DREADFUL.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY
DREADFUL.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
YOU KNOW, IT WAS LIKE
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
HOW COULD THIS
BE HAPPENING?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
YOU KNOW, EVERYONE
KEPT TELLING ME,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
"YOU'RE A GIRL,
YOU'RE A GIRL".

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
AND NOW MY BODY'S TELLING
ME I'M A GIRL WHEN I'M NOT.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
LIKE THIS IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
HOW COULD THIS
BE HAPPENING?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
TEN YEARS AGO, AT 29,
KEVIN HEARD FOR THE

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
FIRST TIME ABOUT GENDER
RE-ASSIGNMENT SURGERY.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
WHERE WOULD YOU BE NOW IF
 YOU HADN'T HAD SURGERY?

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
CERTAINLY NOT HERE.
CERTAINLY NOT HERE TODAY,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
CERTAINLY NOT
HAVING THE LIFE...

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
WITHOUT A DOUBT,
I WOULD BE DEAD.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
I WAS GETTING TO THE POINT
WHERE IT WAS BECOMING

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT
TO GET UP OUT OF BED

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
EVERY DAY AND PUT
ON THIS FACADE.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO
 PEOPLE WHO SAY, LOOK,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD
 JUST GET SOME THERAPY AND

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
BE CONTENT IN THE BODY
 THAT YOU WERE BORN WITH?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
THAT'S THE BIGGEST
JOKE OF ALL.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
THEY HAVE NO
UNDERSTANDING OF

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
THE CONCEPT OF
TRANSSEXUALISM.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
THEY HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
A MIND THAT'S NOT IN
SYNC WITH YOUR BODY.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
THEY HAVE NO IDEA AT ALL.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW,
COME AND WALK IN MY SHOES

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
FOR A DAY AND SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE".

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
KEVIN STARTED HORMONE
TREATMENT THAT LED TO

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
HAIR GROWTH ON HIS
FACE, CHEST AND LEGS.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
TWO YEARS LATER HE
HAD CHEST SURGERY

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
FOLLOWED BY A
HYSTERECTOMY.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
WHAT ABOUT WHEN YOU FOUND
 OUT ABOUT KEVIN'S HISTORY?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
DID THAT MAKE ANY
 DIFFERENCE TO YOU AT ALL?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
NO, EXCEPT TO SAY THAT
IT PROBABLY MADE ME

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
ADMIRE HIM MORE, CERTAINLY
NOT LESS, BECAUSE

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I COULD SEE WHAT A HUGE
JOURNEY HE'D BEEN ON.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I TOLD HER ON OUR SECOND
DATE, AND SHE WAS JUST

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
INCREDIBLE, SUPPORTIVE,
UNDERSTANDING, CARING AND

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
- WELL, HISTORY TELLS US
SHE CHOSE TO COME ALONG

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
ON THE JOURNEY BECAUSE
OF ME, WHO I AM,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
NOT ABOUT MY GENDER.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I HAD NEVER HAD ANY SENSE
OF HIM OTHER THAN THAT

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
HE WAS COMPLETELY MALE.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
HIS STORY ABOUT
HIS TRANSSEXUALISM

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
MADE NO DIFFERENCE.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
JENNIFER AND KEVIN STARTED
LIVING TOGETHER AND NOT

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
LONG AFTER DECIDED THEY
WANTED TO START A FAMILY.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
BECAUSE KEVIN WAS
AN INFERTILE MALE,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
THE COUPLE APPLIED TO
JOIN AN IVF PROGRAM

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
AND USE DONOR SPERM.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
I DO THINK IT WAS
SIGNIFICANT THAT IT WAS

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
A PUBLIC HOSPITAL CLINIC
WHICH ACCEPTED US

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
ONTO THEIR
FERTILITY PROGRAM.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
WE WERE THE FIRST SUCH
COUPLE THAT THEY HAD

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
ACCEPTED ONTO THEIR
PROGRAM EVER, AND SO

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
THEY NEEDED TO DISCUSS
THE ETHICS OF IT.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
AFTER JENNIFER CONCEIVED
WITH THEIR FIRST CHILD,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
THE COUPLE DECIDED
THEY SHOULD MARRY.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
JENNIFER WROTE TO THE
FEDERAL ATTORNEY-GENERAL

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
ASKING IF THAT
WAS POSSIBLE.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
WE WROTE MORE LETTERS
EXPLAINING THOROUGHLY

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
ALL ABOUT IT, THE
FACT THAT MY HUSBAND

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
HAD UNDERGONE THE
PROCESS OF TRANSITION.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
HE'D TAKEN ALL OF THE
AVAILABLE MEDICAL STEPS.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
HE'D MADE ALL OF THE
SOCIAL ADJUSTMENTS.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
HE'D MADE THE OTHER
LEGAL CHANGES

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
IN TERMS OF
DOCUMENTATION.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
HE HAD A MALE
BIRTH CERTIFICATE,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
A MALE PASSPORT ET
CETERA, AND EVERYBODY

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
WHOSE PATH HE CROSSED
REGARDED HIM AS MALE,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
FROM THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO
HIM SUCH AS HIS PARTNER,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT SAY,
OUR EXTENDED FAMILY,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
THE PEOPLE HE WORKED
WITH AND ANYBODY

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
THAT PASSED HIM IN
THE STREET, YOU KNOW.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
JENNIFER AND KEVIN
RECEIVED AN EMAIL

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
BACK FROM AN OFFICER
IN THE FEDERAL

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S
DEPARTMENT.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
IT WARNED IF THEY WENT
AHEAD AND GOT MARRIED

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
KEVIN WAS LIABLE FOR
A PENALTY OF UP TO

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
TWO YEARS JAIL.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
THE PUBLIC SERVANT ALSO
PREDICTED IF THE COUPLE

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
TOOK IT TO COURT
THEY WOULD LOSE;

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
AND SHE SUGGESTED THE
LAW PERHAPS WOULD CHANGE

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
ONE DAY BUT NOT IN
HER WORKING LIFE.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
SHE CONCLUDED
WITH THIS:

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
"BELIEVE ME, AS A
MARRIED MOTHER OF FOUR,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
MARRIAGE IS NOT ALL
IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE."

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I FELT VERY SHOCKED
WHEN I READ THAT.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I WAS ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY
SHAKING WHEN I READ IT.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
THE WOMAN THAT WROTE
THE LETTER, WHO WAS IN

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
QUITE A RESPONSIBLE
POSITION IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
ANSWERING MATTERS OF
FAMILY LAW AND SO ON,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
JUST MADE NO ATTEMPT TO
VEIL HER PERSONAL BIAS.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
SO THIS PUBLIC SERVANT
 OFFERED A WHOLE LOT OF

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
PERSONAL COMMENTS?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
OH, DEFINITELY,
OF WHICH I FOUND

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE TO
ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
TO JENNIFER AND
MYSELF AS A COUPLE.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
IT WAS JUST OUTRAGEOUS.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
THE COUPLE DECIDED TO
MARRY DESPITE THE EMAIL,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
PREFERRING INSTEAD TO
HAVE THE VALIDITY OF

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
THEIR MARRIAGE TESTED
IN THE FAMILY COURT.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
THEY HIRED LAWYER
RACHAEL WALLBANK,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
HERSELF A TRANSSEXUAL AND
EXPERT ON THE CONDITION.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
RACHAEL WALLBANK DECIDED
TO FIGHT THE CASE AGAINST

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S
DEPARTMENT

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
ON THE BASIS
OF SCIENCE.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE
COURT THROUGH A JOURNEY,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
REALLY, A SCIENTIFIC
JOURNEY THAT FIRSTLY DEALT

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
WITH THE KIND OF DIVERSITY
IN HUMAN SEXUAL FORMATION

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
ARISING FROM CHROMOSOMAL
DIVERSITY AS WELL AS

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
BODILY FORMATION DIVERSITY,
TO THE POINT WHERE

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
WE COULD DEAL WITH
EVIDENCE CONCERNING

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
BRAIN SEX DIFFERENTIATION
IN THE HUMAN BEING.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
THE COURT WAS PRESENTED
WITH SEVERAL SCIENTIFIC

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
STUDIES SUGGESTING
A BIOLOGICAL BASIS

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
TO TRANSSEXUALISM.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
A DUTCH STUDY LOOKING
AT THE HYPOTHALAMUS

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
OF SIX MALE-TO-FEMALE
TRANSSEXUALS FOUND

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
THEY HAD SIMILAR FEATURES
TO FEMALE BRAINS.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
THEY EXAMINED THE PART OF
THE BRAIN ESSENTIAL FOR

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND FOUND
IT WAS THE SAME SIZE

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
IN FEMALE TRANSSEXUALS
AS IT WAS IN OTHER WOMEN.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
IN MEN, THIS REGION OF
THE BRAIN KNOWN AS THE

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
BED NUCLEUS OF THE STRIA
TERMINALIS IS MUCH LARGER.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT
GENDER IDENTITY DEVELOPS

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
AS A RESULT OF AN
INTERACTION BETWEEN

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
THE DEVELOPING BRAIN
AND SEX HORMONES.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
OTHER STUDIES
SUPPORTED THIS THEORY.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
IN VIEW OF ALL THE
EVIDENCE THAT I HAD,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
THERE'S JUST NO
REASON TO SEE HOW

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
IT COULD POSSIBLY
HAVE BEEN NURTURE.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
THE THINGS THAT
CHARACTERIZE TRANSSEXUALS

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
ARE AS MUCH
BIOLOGICAL AS MENTAL

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
AND THAT'S TERRIBLY
IMPORTANT FOR THE LAW.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
SO THE POINT I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE IN THE JUDGMENT

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
IS THAT THE
BRAIN SEX THEORY,

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
THE BIOLOGICAL-BASED
THEORY, DOESN'T SEEM

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
TO HAVE ANY COMPETITORS
IN TERMS OF EXPLANATION.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
NOBODY ELSE IS SAYING,
"OH, THERE'S THIS OTHER

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION".

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
IN HIS JUDGMENT JUSTICE
CHISHOLM SAID, "IT WOULD

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
BE WRONG TO SUGGEST THAT
A PERSON'S SEX DEPENDS ON

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
ANY SINGLE FACTOR SUCH AS
CHROMOSOMES OR GENITALIA."

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
"EQUALLY", HE SAID, "IT
WOULD BE WRONG TO SAY

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
IT CAN BE DETERMINED
SOLELY BY A PERSON'S

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE
OR THEIR BRAIN SEX."

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
IT'S NOT A PREFERENCE BUT
IT'S A SENSE OF WHO THEY ARE

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
THAT FOR THEM SEEMS TO
BE SO FUNDAMENTAL THAT

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
IT'S NOT AN OPINION AND
THAT IT COULDN'T BE CHANGED.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
IT'S JUST AN ABSOLUTE
SENSE, LIKE A SENSE

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
PERHAPS THAT LIFE'S
WORTH LIVING OR THAT

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
ONE IS ALIVE OR THAT
YOU'RE SITTING ON A CHAIR.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
JUSTICE CHISHOLM ALSO
CONSIDERED KEVIN'S

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
SOCIAL STANDING, THE FACT
HE'D HAD GENDER SURGERY

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
AND HIS SUCCESS IN BEING
TREATED AS AN INFERTILE MAN

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
IN A SYDNEY HOSPITAL'S
IVF PROGRAM.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
JUSTICE CHISHOLM
DETERMINED THAT KEVIN

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
AT THE TIME OF HIS
MARRIAGE WAS A MAN

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
AND THEREFORE THE
MARRIAGE WAS LEGAL.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
HE SAID IN HIS JUDGMENT:

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE
HOW THERE COULD BE

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
A STRONGER CASE ON
THE FACTS FOR A PERSON

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
WITH FEMALE CHROMOSOMES,
BORN WITH FEMALE GENITALIA

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
AND CHROMOSOMES, TO
BE TREATED AS A MAN.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
I REFER TO THE EXTENSIVE
EVIDENCE RELATING TO

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
HIS SELF-PERCEPTION,
APPEARANCE,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
MEDICAL HISTORY AND
FUNCTIONING IN SOCIETY.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S
DEPARTMENT APPEALED

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
JUSTICE CHISHOLM'S
DECISION, AND THE CASE

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
WENT TO THE FULL BENCH
OF THE FAMILY COURT.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
IT ALSO DECIDED
IN KEVIN'S FAVOR.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
KEVIN AND JENNIFER ARE
NOW HAPPILY MARRIED,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
LIVING WITH THEIR TWO
CHILDREN IN SUBURBAN SYDNEY.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
THAT'S ALL WE WANT
IS TO BLEND IN

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
AND GET ON
WITH OUR LIVES.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
WE DON'T WANT TO
GO OUT SAYING,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
"HEY, WE'RE DIFFERENT.
HEY, LOOK AT US."

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
"HEY, TREAT US WITH
A SPECIAL KIND OF..."

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
WE'RE JUST LIKE
EVERYONE ELSE.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
WE JUST - WE WORK.
WE PAY OUR TAXES.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
WE CARE FOR OUR FAMILY.
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
FAR MORE CONTROVERSIAL
THAN ADULTS CHANGING GENDER

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
IS THE ISSUE OF
ADOLESCENTS WANTING TO.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
CHILDREN SEEKING MEDICAL
TREATMENT MUST GO THROUGH

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
THE FAMILY COURT.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
THIS FOLLOWS A
CONTROVERSIAL CASE

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
LAST YEAR IN MELBOURNE
WHERE ALEX, A 13-YEAR-OLD

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
BORN INTO A GIRL'S BODY,
WANTED TO BECOME A BOY.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
A TEENAGE GIRL HAS
BECOME THE FIRST CHILD

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
IN AUSTRALIA TO BE
GIVEN LEGAL APPROVAL

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
FOR A SEX CHANGE ON
PSYCHIATRIC GROUNDS.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
THE TEENAGER, KNOWN ONLY
AS "ALEX", WILL BE ALLOWED

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
TO START IRREVERSIBLE
HORMONE TREATMENT

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
WHEN SHE TURNS 16.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
BUT THE COURT DECISION HAS
DIVIDED MEDICAL AUTHORITIES.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
ALEX WAS A VERY DISTRESSED
ADOLESCENT WHO WAS

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
EXTREMELY DEPRESSED BECAUSE
OF HIS GENDER DYSPHORIA,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
WAS QUITE SUICIDAL, AND
CERTAINLY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
THAT HE IS MUCH HAPPIER NOW
HAVING COMMENCED TREATMENT.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
THE COURT DECIDED THE
TEENAGER COULD TAKE

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
THE CHOSEN NAME OF
"ALEX" AND SHOULD BE

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
REFERRED TO AS A MALE.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
IT ALSO AGREED TO THE
CONTRACEPTIVE PILL

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
TO SUPPRESS MENSTRUATION.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
ESSENTIALLY I
THINK WE SAW

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
A VERY CONSERVATIVE
JUDGMENT.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
THIS WAS A COMPLEX ISSUE.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
THIS IS A YOUNG
PERSON ALREADY LIVING

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
IN A MALE ROLE.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
I THINK WHAT WAS VERY
POSITIVE ABOUT IT IS THAT

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
IT RESPECTED THE YOUNG
PERSON'S DECISION TO DO THAT

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
AND SUPPORTED THAT CHOICE
WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN MADE.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
IN TERMS OF BIOLOGICAL
INTERVENTIONS,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
IT WAS A VERY
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:58.000
USING ONLY REVERSIBLE
INTERVENTIONS.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
AT 16, TESTOSTERONE
WILL BE CONSIDERED

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
TO BEGIN HIS
PHYSICAL TRANSITION.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
THE COURT FOUND THE
TEENAGER'S DESIRE

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
TO BE MALE WAS MOST
LIKELY DUE TO BIOLOGY

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
THE JUDGE REFERRED TO THE
EXPERT MEDICAL EVIDENCE

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
IN KEVIN'S CASE.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
NOBODY CHOOSES TO GO
THROUGH THIS ROUTE.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
WOULD CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
OR YOU'D WISH ON YOUR WORST
ENEMY TYPE OF ATTITUDE.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
IT'S NOT A WALK IN THE PARK,
IT'S NOT SIMPLE OR EASY,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
AND IT INVOLVES A LOT
OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
TELL ME WHAT THE GOOD THINGS
 ABOUT BEING A GIRL ARE.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
WHAT DO YOU LIKE
 ABOUT BEING A GIRL?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
DR. LOUISE NEWMAN
SPECIALIZES IN CHILD

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
AND ADOLESCENT
GENDER ISSUES.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
SHE CURRENTLY HAS
FOUR ADOLESCENTS

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
WANTING TREATMENT
TO CHANGE GENDER.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
TO DO SO, THEY WILL
HAVE TO GET PERMISSION

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
FROM THE FAMILY COURT.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
A 13-YEAR-OLD WHO SAYS
SHE IS A GIRL BORN INTO A

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
BOY'S BODY RECENTLY WENT
BEFORE THE FAMILY COURT

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
IN NEW SOUTH WALES SEEKING
THE FIRST STAGE OF TREATMENT.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
IN THIS CASE WE'RE SEEKING
TO USE PUBERTY-BLOCKING

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
HORMONES WHICH WILL
DELAY PUBERTAL CHANGE

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
IN THIS YOUNG PERSON
ON THE GROUNDS THAT

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
THEY'LL BE DISTRESSED BY
THAT AND PROBABLY NOT ABLE

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
TO TOLERATE THAT, AND THAT
IT'S VERY CLEAR FOR THEM

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
THAT THOSE CHANGES ARE NOT
GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
LAWYER RACHAEL WALLBANK
PRESENTED MEDICAL EVIDENCE

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
IN COURT THAT
PUBERTY-BLOCKERS WERE

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
REVERSIBLE AND COULD SAVE
THE CHILD FROM SELF-HARM

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
OR, WORSE, SUICIDE.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
NOT EVERYONE AGREES
WITH THE VIEW THAT

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
ADOLESCENTS SHOULD
RECEIVE PUBERTY-BLOCKERS

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000
FOR THIS CONDITION.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
MANY RELIGIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS ARE OPPOSED

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
TO ANY FORM OF
MEDICAL INTERVENTION,

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
AND SOME DOCTORS
QUESTION THE

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
LONG-TERM EFFECTS
OF PUBERTY-BLOCKERS.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I DON'T THINK WE REALLY
KNOW THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
ON BONE DENSITY OF MISSING
OUT ON A COUPLE OF YEARS

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
OF THE ACCUMULATION
OF BONE DENSITY.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
ALL THE MEDICAL EVIDENCE,
ALL THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
PEOPLE WITH TRANSSEXUALISM,
LIKE MYSELF, HOWEVER,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
AND ALL OF THE
POST-TREATMENT STUDIES

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
OF CHILDREN
INDICATE THAT THE EARLIER

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
THE CHILDREN WITH
TRANSSEXUALISM RECEIVE

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
THIS TREATMENT THE
BETTER THEIR LIVES ARE,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
THE HAPPIER THEY ARE,
AND THE MORE THEY CAN

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
ACTUALLY LIVE OUT A USEFUL
AND FULFILLING LIFE.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
WHAT ABOUT THE CRITICS WHO
 SAY "ADOLESCENCE IS A TIME

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
OF TURMOIL ANYWAY, THEY
 COULD GROW OUT OF IT,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
THEY COULD CHANGE
 THEIR MIND,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
THEY COULD IN FACT
 SIMPLY BE GAY."

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
WHAT DO YOU SAY
 TO THOSE CRITICS?

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
THE TREATMENT OF
TRANSSEXUALISM IN

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
CHILDHOOD IS A VERY
CONSERVATIVE PROCESS.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
USUALLY YEARS GO BY WITH THE
CHILD UNDER THE MICROSCOPE

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
BEFORE THE CHILD'S
EVEN ABLE TO COMMENCE

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
ON THE TOTALLY REVERSIBLE
STAGE ONE TREATMENT.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
WHAT I SAY TO
THOSE PEOPLE IS,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
"PLEASE KEEP AN
OPEN MIND HERE.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
IT'S NOT WITHIN
YOUR EXPERIENCE.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
TRANSSEXUALISM IS NOT
WITHIN YOUR EXPERIENCE.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
IT'S WITHIN MINE.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
IT'S WITHIN THE EXPERIENCE
OF THESE CHILDREN.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
IF THEY DON'T HAVE
THE TREATMENT,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
THEY'RE FACED WITH YEARS
AND YEARS OF AGONY."

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
PROFESSOR GARRY WARNE
RECENTLY RETURNED FROM

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
A LONDON WORKSHOP LOOKING
AT THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
OF TRANSSEXUAL CHILDREN.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
ADVOCATES ARGUE THAT
PUBERTY-BLOCKERS

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
MUST BE GIVEN TO A
CHILD BY 12 OR 13,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
BEFORE PUBERTY ARRIVES.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
BUT PROFESSOR WARNE
AND SOME OTHER DOCTORS

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
BELIEVE THEY SHOULDN'T
BE ADMINISTERED

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
TO ANY CHILD UNDER
THE AGE OF 16.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT
MAKING THE WRONG DECISION

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
AND THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT IT COMING BACK

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
TO BITE THEM LATER ON.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.000
AND CAN THAT HAPPEN?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
IT HAS HAPPENED.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
AT WHAT AGE SHOULD A YOUNG
 PERSON BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
THINGS LIKE HORMONES,
 FOR EXAMPLE?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
IT'S A DILEMMA BECAUSE
YOUNG PEOPLE - IT'S A

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
DILEMMA BECAUSE YOU'RE
WONDERING ALL THE TIME

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
WHETHER THE YOUNG PERSON
HAS A CORE GENDER

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
OF THE SEX THEY IDENTIFY
THEMSELVES TO BE,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
OR WHETHER THEY'VE
ACTUALLY GOT ENOUGH

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
LIFE EXPERIENCE TO
MAKE THAT JUDGMENT.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
CRAIG ANDREWS RUNS
A SUPPORT GROUP

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
FOR FEMALE-TO-MALE
TRANSSEXUALS.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
HE'S BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT
THE INCREASING NUMBER OF

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
TEENAGE GIRLS CONTACTING
HIS ORGANIZATION

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
WANTING TREATMENT
BECAUSE THEY THINK

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
THEIR LIVES WOULD
BE BETTER AS MEN.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE, FOR
A WHOLE RANGE OF REASONS,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:15.000
CAN GRAB HOLD OF ANSWERS
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ANSWERS.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
THREE WEEKS AGO, RACHAEL
WALLBANK'S CLIENT RECEIVED

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
PERMISSION TO HAVE THEIR
13-YEAR-OLD CHILD TREATED

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
WITH PUBERTY-BLOCKING
HORMONES.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
THE LAWYER WILL
SOON RETURN TO COURT

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
SEEKING AN ORDER SO THE
PARENTS DON'T HAVE TO

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
GO THROUGH THE FAMILY
COURT TO ACCESS FURTHER

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR
THEIR TRANSSEXUAL CHILD.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
THE NEXT STAGE WOULD
INCLUDE ESTROGEN

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
TO FEMINIZE THE TEENAGER.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
RACHAEL WALLBANK SAYS, IF
SUCCESSFUL, THIS WOULD BE

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
A PRECEDENT-SETTING
CASE, MAKING IT NO LONGER

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
MANDATORY FOR CHILDREN TO
GO BEFORE THE FAMILY COURT

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
FOR TREATMENT.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
IN MY VIEW, ONCE A COURT
HEARS MORE COMPLETE

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
EVIDENCE ABOUT
TRANSSEXUALISM, THE KIND

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
OF EVIDENCE THAT JUSTICE
CHISHOLM HEARD RE KEVIN,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
THEN THE COURT WILL BE
MORE COMFORTABLE ABOUT

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
ALLOWING THE TREATMENT
OF TRANSSEXUALISM

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
IN CHILDHOOD TO FOLLOW
A MEDICAL COURSE

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
RATHER THAN IMPOSING ON THE
PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN,
FINANCIAL AND MENTAL BURDEN,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
OF HAVING TO TAKE
THE CHILD THROUGH

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
A LEGAL PROCESS TO ENABLE
THAT CHILD TO RECEIVE

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
THE TREATMENT THAT
THE CHILD NEEDS.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
THE QUESTION WHETHER
PROCEDURES RELATING TO

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
TRANSSEXUALISM REQUIRE
COURT APPROVAL

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
I CAN WELL IMAGINE
MIGHT BE CONTROVERSIAL,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
AND I SUPPOSE THE
ARGUMENT FOR HAVING IT

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
APPROVED BY A COURT WOULD
BE STRONGER IN THE CASE

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
OF IRREVERSIBLE
STEPS LIKE SURGERY.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
WE THINK THAT THERE
MUST BE SOME COMPROMISE

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
THAT CAN BE REACHED
HERE WHEREBY THE COURT

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:05.000
PERHAPS AGREES TO
CERTAIN GUIDELINES.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
AS SCIENCE DISCOVERS MORE
ABOUT WHAT MAKES A BOY

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
AND WHAT MAKES A GIRL,
THESE DIFFICULT DECISIONS

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
MAY BE MADE A
LITTLE EASIER.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
TO UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLEX
THE BIOLOGY IS.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
IT CERTAINLY ISN'T AS
SIMPLE AS XX AND XY.
