as we are now glad to beholdyour eyes,

18
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.600
your eyes, which hitherto haveborne in them

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.570
against the French that met themin their bent

20
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.900
the fatal balls of murderingbasilisks.

21
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.000
The venom of such looks, wefairly hope,

22
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.530
have lost their quality

23
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.700
and that this day shall change

24
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.730
all griefs and quarrels intolove.

25
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.600
To cry amen to that, thus weappear.

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.030
You English princes all,

27
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730
I do salute you.

28
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.970
My duty to you both, on equallove,

29
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.570
great kings of France andEngland.

30
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.830
That I have labored

31
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.830
with all my wits, my pains, andstrong endeavors

32
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.100
to bring Your Most ImperialMajesties

33
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.730
unto this barand royalinterview,

34
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.370
your mightiness on both partsbest can witness.

35
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.670
Since then, my office hath sofar prevailed

36
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.870
that, face to face and royal eyeto eye,

37
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.530
you have congreeted,

38
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.130
let it not disgrace me

39
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.700
if I demand, before this royalview,

40
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.530
what rub or what impedimentthere is,

41
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.830
why that the naked, poor, andmangled peace--

42
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.670
dear nurse of arts, plenties,and joyful births--

43
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.400
should not in this best gardenof the world,

44
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.700
our fertile France,

45
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.970
put up her lovely visage?

46
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.930
Alas, from France, she hath toolong been chased,

47
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.400
and all her husbandry doth lieon heaps,

48
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.870
corrupting in its own fertility.

49
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.300
Her vine, the merry cheerer ofthe heart,

50
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.630
unpruned dies.

51
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.100
Her hedges even-pleached,

52
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.330
like prisoners wildly overgrownwith hair,

53
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.300
put forth disordered twigs.

54
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.900
Her fallow leas,

55
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.600
the darnel, hemlock, and rankfumitory

56
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.870
doth root upon,

57
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.170
while that the coulter rusts

58
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.130
that should deracinate suchsavagery.

59
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.100
The even mead

60
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.470
that erst brought sweetly forth

61
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.270
the freckled cowslip, burnet,and green clover,

62
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.370
wanting the scythe, alluncorrected, rank,

63
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.300
conceives by idleness,

64
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.700
and nothing teems but hatefuldocks,

65
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.270
rough thistles, kexes, burs,

66
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.330
losing both beauty and utility.

67
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.700
And as our vineyards, fallows,meads, and hedges,

68
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.030
defective in their natures, growto wildness,

69
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.030
even so our houses and ourselvesand children have lost

70
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.200
or do not learn for want of time

71
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.030
the sciences that should becomeour country

72
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.830
but grow like savages--

73
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.430
as soldiers will that nothing dobut meditate on blood--

74
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.200
to swearing and stern looks,diffused attire,

75
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.500
and everything that seemsunnatural,

76
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.130
which to reduce into our formerfavor

77
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.200
you are assembled.

78
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.900
And my speech entreats that Imay know the let,

79
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.170
why gentle peace

80
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.330
should not expel theseinconveniences

81
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.600
and bless us

82
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.230
with her former qualities.

83
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.070
If, Duke of Burgundy, you wouldthe peace,

84
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.300
whose want gives growth

85
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.400
to the imperfections which youhave cited,

86
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.800
you must buy that peace

87
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.730
with full accord to all our justdemands,

88
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.400
whose tenors and particulareffects

89
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.500
you have enscheduled briefly inyour hands.

90
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.500
The king hath heard them.

91
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.870
To the which, as yet, there isno answer made.

92
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.100
Well, then, the peace,

93
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.130
which you before so urged,

94
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.670
lies in his answer.

95
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.900
I have but with a cursorary eyeo'erglanced the articles.

96
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.670
Pleaseth Your Grace

97
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.100
to appoint some of your council

98
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.970
presently to sit with us oncemore,

99
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.270
with better heed to re-surveythem,

100
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.600
and we will suddenly pass

101
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.170
our accept and peremptoryanswer.

102
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.270
Brother, we shall.

103
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.600
Go, Uncle Exeter and BrotherClarence

104
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.630
and you, Brother Gloucester andWarwick too.

105
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.030
Go with the king,

106
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.300
and take with you free power toratify, augment, or alter

107
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.700
as your wisdoms best shall seeadvantagable for our dignity,

108
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.170
anything in or out of ourdemands,

109
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.530
and we'll consign thereto.

110
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.030
Will you,

111
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.670
fair sister,

112
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.030
go with the princes or stay herewith us?

113
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.600
Our gracious brother, I will gowith them.

114
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.270
Haply, a woman's voice may dosome good

115
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.630
when articles too nicely urgedbe stood on.

116
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.130
Yet leave our cousin Katharinehere with us.

117
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.530
She is our capital demand,

118
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.770
comprised within the fore-rankof our articles.

119
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.730
She hath good leave.

120
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.930
Fair Katharine, and most fair,

121
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:56.100
will you vouchsafe to teach asoldier

122
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.800
terms such as will enter at alady's ear

123
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800
and plead his love suit

124
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.830
to her gentle heart?

125
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.030
Your Majesty shall at mock me.

126
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.070
I cannot speak your England.

127
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:13.330
Oh, fair Katharine,

128
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.370
if you will love me soundly withyour French heart,

129
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.100
I will be glad to hear youconfess it brokenly

130
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.100
with your English tongue.

131
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.830
Do you like me, Kate?

132
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.330
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tellwhat is "like me."

133
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.200
An angel is like you, Kate,

134
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.330
and you are like an angel.

135
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.800
Que dit-il?

136
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.570
Que je suis semblable a lesanges?

137
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.570
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace,ainsi dit-il.

138
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.600
I said so, dear Katharine,

139
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.970
and I must not blush to affirmit.

140
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.130
Oh, bon Dieu.

141
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.570
Les langues des hommes sontpleines de tromperies.

142
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.230
What says she, fair one?

143
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.700
That the tongues of men are fullof deceits?

144
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.100
Oui, dat de tongues of de mansis be full of deceit.

145
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.400
That is the princess.

146
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.700
The princess is the betterEnglishwoman.

147
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.430
I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fitfor thy understanding.

148
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.400
I'm glad thou canst speak nobetter English,

149
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.500
for if thou couldst,

150
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.170
thou would find me such a plainking

151
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:17.630
thou would think I'd sold myfarm

152
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.630
to buy my crown.

153
00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.730
I know no ways to mince it inlove

154
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.770
but directly to say, "I loveyou."

155
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.770
Then if you urge me farther thanto say, "Do you i' faith?"

156
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.030
I wear out my suit.

157
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.030
Give me your answer.

158
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.030
I' faith, do.

159
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.330
And so clap hands and a bargain.

160
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.330
How say you, lady?

161
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.000
Sauf votre honneur, meunderstand well.

162
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.200
Marry, if you would put me toverses

163
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.970
or to dance for your sake, Kate,

164
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.500
why, you undid me.

165
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.470
For the one, I have neitherwords nor measure.

166
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.100
For the other, I have nostrength in measure,

167
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.830
yet a reasonable measure instrength.

168
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.300
If I could win a lady atleapfrog

169
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.900
or by vaulting into my saddlewith my armor on my back,

170
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.930
under the correction of braggingbe it spoke,

171
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.570
I should quickly leap into awife.

172
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.130
Or if I might buffet for my love

173
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.900
or bound my horse for herfavors,

174
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.030
I could lay on like a butcher,

175
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.400
sit like a jackanapes, neveroff.

176
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.600
But, before God, Kate,

177
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600
I cannot look greenly

178
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.570
nor gasp out my eloquence,

179
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.300
nor I have no cunning inprotestation,

180
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.400
only downright oaths,

181
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.700
which I never use till urged

182
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.400
nor never break for urging.

183
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.200
If thou canst love a fellow ofthis temper, Kate,

184
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.830
whose face is not worthsunburning,

185
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.030
who never looks in his glass

186
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.800
for love of anything he seesthere,

187
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.200
let thine eye be thy cook.

188
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800
I speak to thee plain soldier.

189
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.900
If thou canst love me for this,take me.

190
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:04.770
If not, to say to thee that Ishall die is true.

191
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.970
But for thy love, by the Lord,no.

192
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.000
And yet I love thee too.

193
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.970
Whilst thou livest, dear Kate,

194
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.370
take a fellow of plain anduncoined constancy,

195
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.670
for he perforce must do theeright,

196
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.570
because he hath not the gift towoo in other places.

197
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.070
These fellows of infinite tongue

198
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.200
that can rhyme themselves intoladies' favors,

199
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.970
they do always reason themselvesout again.

200
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.630
What?

201
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.870
A speaker is but a prater.

202
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:33.630
A rhyme is but a ballad.

203
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.630
A good leg will fall.

204
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.730
A straight back will stoop.

205
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.470
A black beard will turn white.

206
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.830
A curled pate will grow bald.

207
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.500
A fair face will wither

208
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.270
and a full eye wax hollow,

209
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.100
but a good heart, Kate,

210
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.430
is the sun and moon--

211
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.730
or rather the sun and not themoon,

212
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.700
for it shines bright

213
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.600
and never changes

214
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.170
but keeps his course truly.

215
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.670
If thou would have such a one,

216
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.400
take me.

217
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.200
And take me, take a soldier.

218
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.530
Take a soldier, take a king.

219
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.100
What sayest thou, then, to mylove?

220
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.030
Speak, my fair, and fairly, Ipray thee.

221
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.670
Is it possible dat I should lovede enemy of France?

222
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.900
No, it is not possible

223
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.000
that you should love the enemyof France, Kate.

224
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.030
But in loving me,

225
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.700
you should love the friend ofFrance,

226
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.130
for I love France so well,

227
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.700
I will not part with a villageof it.

228
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.930
I will have it all mine.

229
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:49.070
Kate, when France is mine

230
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.770
and I am yours,

231
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.530
then yours is France, and youare mine.

232
00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.630
I cannot tell what is dat.

233
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.100
No, Kate.

234
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.070
I will tell thee in French,

235
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.800
which I am sure will hang uponmy tongue

236
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.070
as a newly married wife abouther husband's neck,

237
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.130
hardly to be shook off.

238
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.130
Je...

239
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.670
quand sur le possession deFrance...

240
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.100
et quand vous avez le possessionde moi--

241
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.800
Let me see, what then?

242
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.700
Saint Denis be my speed.

243
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.470
Donc votre est France et vousetes mienne.

244
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.230
It is as easy for me, Kate, toconquer the kingdom

245
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.600
as to speak so much more French.

246
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.370
I shall never move thee inFrench, Kate,

247
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.330
unless it be to laugh at me.

248
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.700
But dost thou understand thusmuch English?

249
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.570
Canst thou love me?

250
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.030
I cannot tell.

251
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.400
Can any of your neighbors tell,Kate?

252
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.400
I'll ask them.

253
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.000
Come, I know thou lovest me.

254
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.970
And at night, when you come intoyour closet,

255
00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.930
you'll question this gentlewomanabout me.

256
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.230
And I know, Kate, you will toher dispraise

257
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.470
those parts in me you love withyour heart.

258
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.370
But, good Kate, mock memercifully.

259
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.400
The rather, gentle princess,because I love thee cruelly.

260
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.030
If ever thou beest mine,

261
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.430
as I have a saving faith withinme tells me thou shalt,

262
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.000
I get thee with scambling,

263
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.430
and thou must therefore needsprove

264
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.700
a good soldier breeder.

265
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.000
Shall not thou and I,

266
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.800
between Saint Denis and SaintGeorge,

267
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.670
compound a boy, half French,half English,

268
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.270
who'll go to Constantinople andtake the Turk by the beard?

269
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.800
Shall we not?

270
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.170
What sayest thou, my fairflower-de-luce?

271
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.700
I do not know dat.

272
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:48.570
No, 'tis hereafter to know butnow to promise.

273
00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.600
Do but now promise, Kate, youwill endeavor

274
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.100
for your French part of such aboy.

275
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.630
And for my English moiety,

276
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.400
take the word of a king and abachelor.

277
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.470
How answer you,

278
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.900

Now, fie upon my false French.

284
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.230
By mine honor, in true English,I love thee, Kate.

285

By which honor I dare not swearthou lovest me,

286
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.500

Therefore tell me, most fairKatharine,

288
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.470
will you have me?

289
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.830
Put off your maiden blushes.

290
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.570
Avouch the thoughts of yourheart

291
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.270
with the looks of an empress.

292
00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:45.430
Take me by the hand,

293
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.070
and say, "Harry of England, I amthine,"

294
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.030
which word thou shalt no soonerbless mine ear withal,

295
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.730
but I shall tell thee aloud,

296
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.770
"England is thine,

297
00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.900
"Ireland is thine,

298
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.400
"France is thine,

299
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.300
and Henry Plantagenet is thine."

300
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.130
Though I speak it before hisface,

301
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.130
if he be not fellow with thebest king,

302
00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.470
thou shalt find the best king ofgood fellows.

303
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.470
Come, your answer in brokenmusic,

304
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.330
for thy voice is music and thyEnglish broken.

305
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.270
Therefore, queen of all,Katharine,

306
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.630
break thy mind to me in brokenEnglish.

307
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.400
Wilt thou have me?

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.370
That is as it shall please deroi mon pere.

309
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.500
Nay, it will please him well,Kate.

310
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.300
It shall please him, Kate.

311
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.830
Den it shall also content me.

312
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.870
Upon that, I kiss your hand andcall you my queen.

313
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.200
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez,laissez!

314
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.600
Ma foi, je ne veux point

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.470

mon tres-puissant seigneur.

320
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.400
Then I will kiss your lips,Kate.

321
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.500
Les dames et demoiselles

322
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.170
pour etre baisees devant leurnoces,

323
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.670
il n'est pas la coutume deFrance.

324
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.730
Madame my interpreter, what saysshe?

325
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.600
Dat it is not be de fashion pourles ladies of France--

326
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.800
I cannot tell what is baiser enAnglish.

327
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.900
To kiss.

328
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.400
Your Majestee entendre bettreque moi.

329
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.070
It is not a fashion for themaids in France

330
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.970
to kiss before they are married,would she say?

331
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.830
Oui, vraiment.

332
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:45.970
Oh, Kate, nice customs curtsy togreat kings.

333
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.070
Dear Kate, you and I

334
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.830
cannot be confined within theweak list

335
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.770
of a country's fashion.

336
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:53.700
We are the makers of manners,Kate.

337
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.400
The liberty that follows ourplaces

338
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.630
stops the mouth of allfindfaults...

339
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.000
as I will do yours

340
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.600
for upholding the nice fashionof your country

341
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.370
in denying me a kiss.

342
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.500
Therefore, patiently andyielding.

343
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.630
You have witchcraft in yourlips, Kate.

344
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.900
There is more eloquence in asugar touch of them

345
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.370
than in the tongues of theFrench council.

346
00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.570
And they should sooner persuadeHenry of England

347
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.070
than a general petition ofmonarchs.

348
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.730
Here comes your father.

349
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.500
God save Your Majesty.

350
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.270
My royal cousin, teach you ourprincess English?

351
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.600
I would have her learn, my faircousin,

352
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.870
how perfectly I love her.

353
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.870
And that is good English.

354
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.100
We have consented to all termsof reason.

355
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.770
Is't so, my lords of England?

356
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.400
The king hath granted everyarticle.

357
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.830
His daughter first and then insequel all

358
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.130
according to their firm proposednatures.

359
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.630
Take her, fair son,

360
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.900
and from her blood,

361
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.100
raise up issue to me

362
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.200
that the contending kingdoms ofFrance and England,

363
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.830
whose very shores look pale withenvy

364
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.500

in little room confining mightymen,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.270
most greatly lived this star ofEngland.

whose state so many had themanaging

409
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.400
that they lost France and madehis England bleed,

410
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.430
which oft our stage hath shown,

411
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.270
