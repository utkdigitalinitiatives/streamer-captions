BETTER THAN YOUR GOD.

THEN WE GO TO WAR TO DEFEND IT.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:54.360
BECAUSE RELIGION SEEKS TO
GIVE MEANING TO OUR LIVES,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.830
IT'S BOUND UP WITH
ALL THE COMPONENTS

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.900
OF OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF WHO WE ARE

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.360
AS INDIVIDUALS, AS
MEMBERS OF FAMILIES,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.760
AS COMMUNITIES, AS
NATIONS, PEOPLES,

THE WHOLE COSMOS.

THE SOURCES OF PEOPLE'S
VIOLENT BEHAVIOR

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.530
ARE ALWAYS SOME
FORM OF ALIENATION.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.630
IN SOME SENSE, THAT
SOCIETY LOOKS DOWN ON YOU

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.060
OR EVEN HUMILIATES YOU.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.360
YOU OFTEN SEE
RELIGION BEING USED

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.800
TO STRENGTHEN THE
SENSE OF IDENTITY

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.160
OF THOSE WHO FEEL THAT
THEY'RE BEING ATTACKED.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.460
MOST OF THE SO-CALLED
FUNDAMENTALIST MOVEMENTS

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.060
IN RELIGIOUS TERMS SPRING FROM

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.760
THIS KIND OF FEAR
OF ANNIHILATION

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.160
OR THE DESIRE TO ASSERT
A CLEAR IDENTITY.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.630
AND THEREFORE TO SEE YOURSELF AS
THE GODLY AGAINST THE GODLESS

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.560
AND TO SEE YOURSELF
IN AN INEXORABLE WAR

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.530
BETWEEN THE GOOD
AGAINST THE EVIL.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.060
WHEN THE CRUSADERS
WENT INTO BATTLE

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.430
TO KILL JEWS AND MUSLIMS,
THEY CRIED, GOD WILLS IT!

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.930
THAT WAS THEIR BATTLE CRY.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.360
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DANGER OF USING GOD

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:19.230
TO ENDORSE SOME OF OUR WORST
FEARS, HATREDS, AND PREJUDICES.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:24.930
BECAUSE ONCE YOU TOUCH
RELIGION, FAITH,

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.600
IT'S FILLED WITH EMOTION.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.760
SO EASY MANIPULATED.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.030
WHEN PEOPLE HURT
IN THE NAME OF GOD,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.400
I CAN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE IN MY OPINION,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.030
GOD IS LOVE.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.560
PROBABLY...IF YOU
ARE FIGHTING FOR GOD,

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.830

HIM- OR HERSELF

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.400
THAT IT'S RIGHT TO KILL
IN THE NAME OF GOD,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.860
YOU HAVE LOST THE PLOT
IN RELIGIOUS TERMS.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.400
ALL THE RELIGIONS TEACH

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.600
THAT STOPPING VIOLENCE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.500
IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL
AND THAT HUMAN LIFE,

EVEN THE HUMAN LIFE
OF OUR ENEMIES,

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.500
IS ABSOLUTELY SACRED
AND INVALUABLE.

TO SAY THAT IT'S RIGHT TO
KILL IN THE NAME OF GOD

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.860
IS A HERESY.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.660

DONE TO THE WORLD.

THEY PREVENTED GIRLS
FROM GOING TO SCHOOL.

THEY BARRED WOMEN FROM WORKING

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.600

APPEARING IN PUBLIC

THE TALIBAN,

BUT WITH ALL
THESE TOUGH RULES,

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.230
THEY PUNISHED ME
BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:01.530
NO MALE MEMBER OF
MY FAMILY WITH ME.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.260

WHEN YOU ARE NOT FREE.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.230

RIGHTS TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

THIS PUNISHMENT,

WAS UNDERGROUND,

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.160
IN OTHER WORDS, ANY
ACT OF DISRESPECT,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.030
OF DISREGARD, OF HUMILIATION

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:20.060
TOWARDS ANOTHER HUMAN BEING IS,
IN FACT, AN ACT OF DISRESPECT

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.600
AND AS IT WERE OF HUMILIATION

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.330
TOWARDS GOD HIMSELF.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:42.460
[SIREN]

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.600
Jones: MY VIEW IS THAT THERE
IS NO AUTHENTIC SPIRITUALITY

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.800
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A
POWERFUL ENGAGEMENT

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.830
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
SUFFERING THE MOST.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.900
Narrator: VAN JONES
PUTS HIS FAITH TO WORK

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.800
BY DEFENDING OUTCASTS.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.760
HE'S AN ATTORNEY AND AN ADVOCATE

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.730
FOR THE ADDICTED, THE
ACCUSED, AND THE CONVICTED.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.030
FOR ME, IT WAS VERY NATURAL

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.160
AS I, YOU KNOW,
GOT MY LAW DEGREE,

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.030
TO BEGIN TO LOOK FOR WAYS--
HOW CAN I MAKE A DIFFERENCE?

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.660
HOW CAN I REACH
OUT TO THE PEOPLE

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.060
WHO HAVE BEEN,
YOU KNOW, EXCLUDED,
ABANDONED, MISTREATED?

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.600
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO
ARE INCARCERATED,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.030
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN
CONDEMNED TO DEATH.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.000
FOR ME, THAT WAS
THE WORST THING--

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.530
THAT SOMEBODY WOULD
BE EXCLUDED FROM

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.600
THE CIRCLE OF FORGIVENESS
AND REDEMPTION,

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.200
TO ME, THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS ALL
ABOUT, YOU KNOW--REDEMPTION.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.230
I THOUGHT A REAL
EXTENSION OF MY OWN FAITH

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.760
WAS TO DO THIS WORK
OF HELPING THE PEOPLE

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.700
WHO HAVE BEEN PUT BEHIND BARS.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.030
WHAT IF THE SOCIETY
REALLY RECOGNIZED

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.330
THAT THE REAL
POWER OF, YOU KNOW,

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.560
WHEN PEOPLE DO HIT BOTTOM,

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.860
THAT THAT'S THE BEST
POSSIBLE MOMENT IN SOME WAYS

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.630
TO HELP THAT PERSON TO
REBOUND, TO RECOVER,

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.330
AND TO THINK ABOUT
THE GIFTS TO SOCIETY

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.700
OF THAT KIND OF AN OUTCOME?

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.660
INSTEAD WE SAY, THAT
WORST POSSIBLE MOMENT

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.330
IS JUST THE BEGINNING
OF BAD MOMENTS FOR YOU,

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.360
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE IT WORSE FOR YOU

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:10.160
AND WORSE FOR YOU
AND WORSE FOR YOU.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.000
I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE
ANY THROWAWAY CHILDREN

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.330
OR ANY THROWAWAY NEIGHBORHOODS

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.630
OR ANY THROWAWAY NATIONS
OR CONTINENTS OR SPECIES.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.000
I THINK IT'S ALL PRECIOUS,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.460
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR ME, THAT'S
THE GROUNDING OF MY FAITH,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:24.660
THAT IT'S ALL SACRED.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.930
YOU KNOW, THE CREATOR
MADE ALL OF THIS,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.500
AND OUR CHALLENGE IS TO
SEE THE CREATOR'S FACE,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.000
EVEN IN THE FACE OF THE PERSON

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.530
WHO WE WANT TO LABEL
AS THE WRONGDOER.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:40.400
I HAD A DAUGHTER THAT WAS BORN
2 DAYS BEFORE I WAS ARRESTED,

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.830
AND I'M FACING
THE DEATH PENALTY.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.060
AND THERE'S A LITTLE BABY

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.900
THAT'S SITTING THERE
KISSING MY FINGERS.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.300
AND IT JUST...
I'M WATCHING HER,

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:55.000
AND I'M... AND I'M
THINKING, LIKE,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.500
ALL THIS THAT I'VE
DONE WAS FOR ME.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.060
NEVER ONCE HAVE I EVER THOUGHT

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.560
THAT THIS LIFE THAT I'D
BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.830
WOULD HAVE TO GROW UP AND
EXPLAIN WHERE HER DADDY'S BEEN

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.000
OR WHERE HER DADDY
IS GOING TO GO.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.160
AND WHEN I SEEN
THAT, IT WAS LIKE

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.130
GOD JUST SOCKED ME ALL
IN THE...IN THE GUT,

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.200
AND IT JUST WOKE ME UP
TO WHERE I'M SAYING,

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.660
HEY, IF THERE IS A
GOD, IF THERE IS A GOD,

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.900
SHOW ME. SHOW ME.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.460
AND, UM...I WALKED INTO COURT,

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.900
AND MY LAWYER HAD
RECEIVED A LETTER

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.100
THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER
SEEKING THE DEATH PENALTY.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.500
AND IT JUST STARTED
THE BALL TURNING.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:47.530
I GUESS COMPASSION COMES FROM
FINDING A PURPOSE FOR YOURSELF.

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.430
FOR ME, THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.430
IT WAS SEEING THESE
KIDS ON THE STREETS

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.400
GOING THROUGH THE SAME
THING THAT I WENT THROUGH

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.960
FOR MY JOURNEY HERE IN PRISON.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.760
WE TRY TO REACH OUT
AND STOP THOSE KIDS

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.560
FROM TRYING TO BECOME US.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.930
Man: THE PERSONAL
TRANSFORMATION THAT I MADE

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.800
ISN'T SO MUCH IMPORTANT TO ME

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.730
AS THE TRANSFORMATION
THAT WE COLLECTIVELY

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.000
ARE GOING TO MAKE.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.730
GOD CAN USE A LIFE, NO
MATTER WHERE THAT LIFE IS.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.130
THE CREATOR HAS A
BETTER PLAN THAN WE DO.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.860
AND NELSON MANDELA
CHANGED THE WORLD

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.700
FROM INSIDE A PRISON CELL.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.060
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S REAL IMPORTANT

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.760
TO UNDERSTAND THE
AMOUNT OF POWER.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.360
WE DON'T KNOW WHO
WE'RE TOUCHING.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.030
AND SO I JUST FEEL
LIKE, IN SOME WAYS,

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:39.260
YOU GUYS ARE REALLY
ON THE LEADING EDGE

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.360
OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.660
BECAUSE TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE
WHAT YOU'RE ACHIEVING,

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.330
THAT SPIRITUAL DOMAIN,

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.700
WHEN SOCIETY WOULD SAY, WELL,
THIS WOULD BE THE WORST PLACE.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.760
THEY COULDN'T DO IT HERE.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.300
BUT FOR YOU GUYS TO
BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IT,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300
I THINK IT REALLY OPENS A DOOR

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.030
AND SHOWS A GOOD WAY FORWARD.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:04.630
WHEN YOU SPEND A LOT OF
YOUR LIFE GOING TO FUNERALS

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.960
FOR PEOPLE WHO
HAVE DIED IN PRISON

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.660
OR WHO HAVE DIED AT THE
HANDS OF EACH OTHER,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.330
YOU KNOW, YOU BEGIN
TO REALLY GET A SENSE

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.630
OF HOW PRECIOUS LIFE IS.

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.000
IF PEOPLE OUTSIDE
COULD SEE THIS,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.660
I THINK WE MIGHT BE A LITTLE
BIT MORE WILLING TO FORGIVE,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:26.760
TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT
MAKE A BRIDGE BACK HOME.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:35.430
[CHANTING]

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.830
[JINGLING]

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.300
Armstrong: WHEN THE GREAT WORLD
FAITHS WERE COMING INTO BEING,

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:47.500
ALL OF THEM BEGAN INITIALLY
WITH REVULSION FROM VIOLENCE.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.460
THEY TRIED TO FIND NEW
WAYS OF CONTROLLING

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.500
THE RAGE AND HATRED
IN OUR HEARTS.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.330
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF
SPIRITUALITY, I THINK,

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:34.430
THAT IS NEEDED IN OUR
BITTERLY DIVIDED WORLD.

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:37.700
Narrator: ALL RELIGIONS
TEACH THE BASIC PRINCIPLES

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.060
OF LOVE AND COMPASSION.

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.960
THESE ARE SIMPLE IDEAS,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.130
BUT THEY HAVE SHAPED THE
MOST REVOLUTIONARY EVENTS

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:51.730
OF OUR TIME.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.830
IN THE 1920's, A
DEEPLY RELIGIOUS MAN,

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.560
MOHANDAS GANDHI, EMERGED
AS THE STRONGEST VOICE

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.130
FOR INDIAN INDEPENDENCE
FROM BRITISH RULE.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.060
YET GANDHI DID NOT CALL
FOR AN ARMED REVOLUTION.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:10.260
INSTEAD, HE URGED INDIANS
TO USE NONVIOLENT PROTEST

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:16.830
AND PEACEFUL RESISTANCE.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:22.160
MAHATMA GANDHI SAID,
IF YOU WANT TO SEE
CHANGE IN THE WORLD,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.230
YOU HAVE TO BE THE CHANGE.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:33.160
Ela Gandhi: GANDHI'S ENTIRE
PHILOSOPHY WAS BASED ON LOVE,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.100
LOVE FOR YOUR ENTIRE UNIVERSE,

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:41.360
FOR ALL LIFE, FOR ALL PEOPLE.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.300
SO HE NEVER SAW
PEOPLE AS ENEMIES.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.760
FOR HIM, THE MINUTE
YOU USE VIOLENCE,

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.030
THEN IT'S A SPIRAL.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.200
VIOLENCE RAISES
BITTERNESS IN YOUR HEART,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.160
AND THEN YOU WANT
TO TAKE REVENGE.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.630
YOU CONTINUE TO KILL PEOPLE...

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.130
UNTIL EVERYBODY
IS DEAD, YOU KNOW,

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:13.160
BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE VIOLENCE

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.530
AND NOT HAVE BITTERNESS.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:22.430
HE SAID THAT HIS
LIFE WAS HIS MESSAGE.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:37.560
AND I THINK THAT'S THE
GREATNESS OF GUJARATI.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.100
ONCE THEY ASKED
MAHATMA GANDHI,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.330
WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUALITY IN SPIRITUALITY?

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:50.600
AND MAHATMA GANDHI
SAID, NOT BE COWARD.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.330
I THINK THE MOST
IMPORTANT QUALITY

00:31:53.330 --> 00:32:00.130
THAT A MAN OR A WOMAN
SHOULD HAVE IS TO BE BRAVE.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.060
Narrator: THE REVEREND
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.330
BASED THE AMERICAN
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:08.860
ON THE TEACHINGS OF THE
HINDU MAHATMA GANDHI.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.030
THE BAPTIST MINISTER
FROM ATLANTA, GEORGIA,

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:15.630
SAW THAT LOVE AND RESPECT COULD
SET BLACK AND WHITE AMERICANS

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.230
FREE OF THEIR RACIST HISTORY.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.830
Young: GANDHI'S
UNDERSTANDING OF CHRISTIANITY

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:25.560
WAS MORE RELEVANT TO ME

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.430
THAN THE UNDERSTANDING
OF CHRISTIANITY

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:30.700
THAT I GOT FROM MOST
U.S. CHRISTIANS,

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.900
AND PARTICULARLY THE IDEA
OF LOVING YOUR ENEMY.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:38.160
I'D NEVER HEARD
ANYBODY IN THE U.S.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.860
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY HARDLY.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.330
LOVE YOUR ENEMY AND BLESS
THOSE THAT PERSECUTE YOU.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:47.560
THERE WEREN'T MANY
PEOPLE THAT WERE TALKING

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.330
NONVIOLENT SOCIAL CHANGE.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:55.130
AND THERE WAS STILL A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DOUBT,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.500
I DIDN'T THINK NONVIOLENCE
WOULD WORK IN THE SOUTH,

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.000
THAT AMERICA WAS TOO
VIOLENT AND TOO MILITARIST

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.960
TO RESPOND TO THIS.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.730
FREDERICK DOUGLASS SAID THAT
THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:12.730
IS A STRUGGLE TO SAVE
BLACK MEN'S BODIES

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:16.630
AND WHITE MEN'S SOULS.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.360
RACISM IS A SICKNESS,

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.000
AND YOU DON'T GET
ANGRY WITH SICK PEOPLE.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.760
YOU HELP THEM AND HEAL THEM.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.600
AND HEALING WAS SPIRITUAL.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.960
AND NONVIOLENCE
THEN SEEMED TO BE

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.960
A SPIRITUAL METHOD OF HEALING.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.330
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I

FIND IT IS LIKE A TRIP

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.300
FOR FINDING THE TRUTH.

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.760
I WAS ONCE IN A CELL, YOU
KNOW, A CELL, ISOLATION.

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.660
I HAVE NO BOOKS. I HAVE NOTHING.

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:04.530
I JUST COMING AND
GOING, COMING AND GOING.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.760
AND THERE'S A SOLDIER,
ALSO THE SAME,

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.900
COMING AND GOING, COMING
AND GOING, A JEWISH.

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.700
AND I LOOKED AT THE
SOLDIER OUTSIDE.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.160
I LOOKED AT HIM. I
TRIED TO LOOK AT HIM.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.530
WOW. HE IS A HUMAN
BEING LIKE ME.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.260
HE HAS EYES, HE HAS NOSE,
HE HAS MOUTH, HE HAS...

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.030
SO WHY HE'S OUT AND I'M IN?

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:30.600
WHY HE IS JEWISH
AND I'M PALESTINIAN?

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.330
WHY I'M HATING HIM?
WHY HE'S HATE ME?

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.030
HE NEVER MET ME.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.260
SO WHO'S DECIDING
ALL THESE THINGS?

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.360
I SAID, WHY I HAVE
TO HATE THE JEWISH?

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.800
WHY I HAVE TO HATE
THE ISRAELIS?

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:54.800
FOR ME, I DON'T HATE THEM.
I FIND I DON'T HATE ANYONE.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.930

BETWEEN POLITICIANS,

A RECONCILIATION

BETWEEN PALESTINIANS, ISRAELIS,
AND THE TWO LIVE TOGETHER,

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.860
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
GOD CREATES HUMAN BEINGS

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.130
TO LIVE IN PEACE.

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:51.900
WHEN WE MEET SOME ISRAELIS
WHO NEVER MET PALESTINIANS,

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:57.860
THEY SAY, WE NEVER THOUGHT
THAT YOU ARE LIKE THAT.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:02.730
YOU HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:05.700
AT LEAST TO KNOW EACH
OTHER AS HUMAN BEINGS,

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.500
AND AFTER THAT, WORK
WITH EACH OTHER,

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.230
AS GOD WANTED.

Sadhguru: UNFORTUNATELY,
THE RELIGIOUS PROCESS

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.200
HAS ALWAYS GOTTEN
ENTWINED DEEPLY

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.000
WITH THE POLITICAL PROCESS,
AND BOTH THE FORCES

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.630
ARE USING EACH OTHER
FOR THEIR OWN ENDS,

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.300
WHICH BECOMES A COMPLEX
AND DEADLY MIX...

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:30.260
THE PAIN OF WHICH THE HUMANITY
HAS SEEN CONTINUOUSLY.

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.000
IF YOU LOOK BACK ON THE
HISTORY OF CONFLICT,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.030
IT IS ALWAYS BETWEEN
ONE MAN'S BELIEF

VERSUS ANOTHER MAN'S BELIEF,
RELIGIOUS OR OTHERWISE.

WHEN I BELIEVE MY
WAY IS THE ONLY WAY,

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.700
CONFLICT IS INEVITABLE.

ELEMENT IN HUMAN NATURE

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:56.530
THAT REVEALS ITSELF.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:01.130
THAT SORT OF CONNECTION
IS ULTIMATELY LIKE WATER,

AROUND GOVERNMENTS,

HAVE A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.700
AND YOU BEGIN TO FEEL PEACEFUL,
YOU BEGIN TO THINK PEACEFULLY,

YOU BEGIN TO SPEAK PEACEFULLY,
YOU BEGIN TO BEHAVE PEACEFULLY,

YOU BEGIN TO SHARE
YOUR PEACE WITH OTHERS,

YOU BEGIN TO CELEBRATE
THE EXPERIENCE OF PEACE.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:51.900

REFLECTS THAT.

FOR IT IS IN GIVING
THAT WE RECEIVE.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.900

THAT WE ARE PARDONED.

LOVE OF ISRAEL AND LOVE
OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE.

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:52.660
THE FACT THAT IT WAS GOING
TO BE AT THE EXPENSE OF ARABS

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.630
DIDN'T MAKE ONE
BIT OF DIFFERENCE

00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:01.560
BECAUSE JEWISH PEOPLE
WERE IN DISTRESS.

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.160
BUT I THEN BECAME A MOTHER,

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.800

TRANSFORMATION FOR ME.

ALEXANDRA WAS BORN,

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.060
I COULD NO LONGER JUSTIFY THAT
THERE WOULD BE A CORRECTION

OR THAT ANYTHING
WOULD MOVE FORWARD

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:22.060

THAT THE LACK OF SELF

IS NOT ONLY THE TEST
OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE,

WHAT IS BEING CALLED GOD,

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:24.830

AND PUT ANOTHER THERE.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:32.600

INTO THAT SELFISHNESS

THAT MAKES US
ENVY OTHER PEOPLE,

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:39.160

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.900
WE TURN TO GOD AS A
SOURCE FOR RENEWING

OUR COMPASSION IN THE WORLD
SO THAT WE MIGHT MANIFEST

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:54.530
A DIMENSION OF GOD'S
COMPASSION THROUGH OUR LIVES.

IT...IT'S A SHIFT THAT SAYS

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:05.560
THE PERSON THAT I DON'T KNOW
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.700
IS INTIMATELY WOVEN INTO
THE QUALITY OF MY LIFE.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:16.100
Sadhguru: SOME TIME AGO,
I MET A RICKSHAW PULLER,

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.800
WHO PEDALS AND TAKES PEOPLE
AROUND, AND THAT'S HIS LIVING.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.960
MAYBE IN A DAY HE
EARNS 25 RUPEES.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:27.460
25 RUPEES WOULD
BE ABOUT 55 CENTS.

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.360
A DOLLAR HE MAY
EARN AT THE MOST.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.800
AND IN THAT PARTICULAR CITY,

00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:38.330
THEY DECIDED TO BRING
IN MOTORIZED RICKSHAWS,

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.230
AND A LOT OF THEM
WERE COMING SHORTLY,

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.300
AND HE ALSO KNEW,
AND HE HAS NO MEANS

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.600
TO BUY A MOTORIZED RICKSHAW

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.700
NOR IS HE LICENSED
TO DRIVE HIS OLD,

00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.660
AND THIS WAS HIS
FATHER'S RICKSHAW.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.860
HIS FATHER WAS ALSO
DOING THE SAME THING,

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:53.030
AND HE IS DOING THE SAME THING

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:56.800
SO I ASKED HIM, I SAID THESE
MOTORIZED RICKSHAWS ARE COMING,

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.160
AND THE ROADS ARE
GETTING BIGGER,

00:56:58.160 --> 00:56:59.930
AND THEY'RE GOING TO BAN
THESE CYCLE RICKSHAWS

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:03.760
BECAUSE THEY'RE A BARRIER TO
THE FASTER MOVEMENT OF TRAFFIC.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.160
SO YOUR LIVELIHOOD
IS GOING TO GO AWAY.

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.500
ARE YOU CONCERNED?

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.360
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE
THINKING OF DOING?

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.300
HE SAID, YES, I AM DEFINITELY
CONCERNED ABOUT MY LIFE,

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.560
MY WIFE, MY CHILDREN,

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.130
BUT I THINK IT'S GOING
TO BE GOOD TO PEOPLE.

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.230
I THINK THE PEOPLE
WILL BE BETTER OFF

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:25.160
WITH A FASTER
MODE OF TRANSPORT

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.560
AND EVERYTHING
BETTER IN THE TOWN.

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.930
HIS OWN LIVELIHOOD
IS BEING THREATENED.

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.460
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE TO DO WITH HIS LIFE.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:32.730
THIS IS ALL HE KNOWS.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:34.700
NOW HIS LIFE IS
BEING THREATENED,

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.360
BUT HE'S THINKING IN TERMS OF

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.630
IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD
TO EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:48.100
THAT IS REALLY LOVE
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:51.330
Narrator: ALL THE RELIGIONS
OF THE WORLD TEACH US,

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:56.730
EVEN COMMAND US, TO TAKE
CARE OF ONE ANOTHER,

00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:58.930
TO FEED THE HUNGRY,

00:57:58.930 --> 00:58:00.800
CARE FOR THE SICK,

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:13.900
AND LIFT UP THE POOR.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:15.960
Marshall: WE HAVE A CHANCE

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.300
THAT NO GENERATION
HAS EVER HAD,

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:22.630
TO CREATE A WORLD WHERE
EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:27.500
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY
TO LEAD A DECENT LIFE.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.330
BUT WE ARE VERY FAR FROM THAT.

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:31.960
YOU HAVE THIS VERY
SMALL POPULATION,

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.730
10% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION
THAT CONSUMES SOMETHING LIKE

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:38.860
70%, 80% OF THE WORLD'S
NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.300
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE RELIGIOUS TO KNOW

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.700
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT PICTURE.

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:45.900

IS THAT ALL OF HIS CREATURES

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:55.000
ENJOY THE BENEFITS
OF DIGNITY AND LIFE.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.330
Caldwell: WE HAVE SO
MUCH WEALTH AT OUR HANDS.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:58:59.600
WE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.730
TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO
FEED AND CLOTHE AND HOUSE

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:07.830
THE POPULATION ON THIS PLANET.

00:59:07.830 --> 00:59:11.530
AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE A
PREREQUISITE TO THE PEACE

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:16.030
THAT WE ALL CLAIM WE ASPIRE TO.

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.400
Lord Carey: IF I
SAY TO SOMEONE,

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.860
WELL, WHY DO YOU SAY
YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN?

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:22.760
WELL, I GO TO ST. MARK'S
CHURCH BURNHAM-ON-SEA.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:24.700
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
YOU A CHRISTIAN

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:28.530
ANY MORE THAN, YOU KNOW, IF
YOU WERE BORN IN A GARAGE

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:29.900
MAKES YOU A CAR.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.930
IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR LIFE.

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:36.600
IT'S PUTTING YOUR FAITH TO WORK.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.960
Marshall: THE RELIGIOUS
INSTITUTIONS,

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.600
EVERY TRADITION
THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:47.900
HAS A DEEP PREOCCUPATION
WITH POVERTY AND MISERY

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:54.830
AND A COMPELLING MISSION
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

00:59:54.830 --> 01:00:01.760
Bond: WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE
GOD, THEY FIND THEMSELVES.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.730
THEY FEEL NOT
ONLY FULLY ALIVE,

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:09.160
THEY FEEL FULLY THEMSELVES,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:13.330
THAT DISCOVERY TAKES
THEM BEYOND THEMSELVES.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:18.560
AND SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT
THEY WANT TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.160
THEY HAVE TO.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.030
OH, YOU'RE SO NICE.

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:26.960
BECAUSE THE SACREDNESS OF
GOD IS IN EVERY HUMAN BEING,

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:39.230
AND THERE'S NOTHING WE
CAN DO TO REMOVE THAT.

Habash: WE HAVE TO REALLY
START TRANSLATING FAITH

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:48.160
AND SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGION
INTO PRACTICAL ACTIONS.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.660
WE CANNOT CONTINUE
PRAYING TO GOD

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.000
AND THEN NOT DOING ANYTHING.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.630
Vahedi: IF I TRY TO PUT INTO
PRACTICE WHAT I BELIEVE,

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:01.560
THAT IS GOING TO BRING
ABOUT A POSITIVE CHANGE,

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.430
MAKE THIS WORLD
A BETTER WORLD,

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:06.530
NO MATTER WHERE I AM,
AND I THINK THAT IS

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.630
THE GREATEST THING THAT
CAN HAPPEN IN OUR LIFE,

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:21.200
AND IT IS HAPPENING IN THE
LIFE OF SO MANY PEOPLE.

Narrator: FATHER
KIERAN CREAGH,

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.560
A MISSIONARY PRIEST
FROM NORTHERN IRELAND,

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.330
MINISTERS TO THE PEOPLE OF
ATTERIDGEVILLE, SOUTH AFRICA.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.630
IT WAS THERE HE FIRST
SAW THE HARSH REALITY

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.130
OF THE A.I.D.S. EPIDEMIC

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:37.560
AND FELT COMPELLED TO ACT.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.360
Creagh: I WAS
WORKING AS A PRIEST

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.760
HERE IN THE TOWNSHIP AT
ATTERIDGEVILLE FOR A FEW YEARS.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.860
AND AS A PRIEST,
YOU'D BE CALLED OUT

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.560
WHEN PEOPLE WOULD
BE AT THEIR WORST,

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.830
WHEN THE DOCTORS
COULD DO NO MORE,

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:51.730
THE SANGOMAS COULD DO NO
MORE THAN MAYBE TO SAY,

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:55.400
WELL, AT LEAST CALL THE
PRIEST TO DO THE LAST PRAYERS

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.900
OR MAYBE A BIT OF HEALING.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:00.830
AND ONE DAY I WAS CALLED
OUT TO A GUY CALLED RONALD,

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.600
A 50-YEAR-OLD MAN, AND
I WAS JUST APPALLED

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.000
AT THE CONDITION HE WAS IN.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.930
HE WAS DYING OF A.I.D.S.,
AND HIS WIFE WAS

01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:10.000
THE ONLY ONE ABLE
TO LOOK AFTER HIM,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.030
AND SHE ALSO HAD A.I.D.S.,

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.160
AND THEY HAD NO RUNNING
WATER, NO ELECTRICITY,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:18.060
AND THE HEAT AND THE SMELL
IN THE SHACK WAS DREADFUL.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.700
AND I JUST THOUGHT,

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.930
WHERE'S MOTHER TERESA
WHEN YOU NEED HER?

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.060
SHE SHOULD BE HERE.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.330
OR SOMEBODY SHOULD BE HERE.

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:27.460
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:29.630
AND I JUST GOT A
VOICE BACK SAYING,

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:31.030
WELL, YOU DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:36.160
SO I DECIDED, WELL,
MAYBE THAT'S A CALL
THAT I NEED TO ANSWER.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:47.060
AND I THOUGHT, WELL,
LET'S TRY IT OUT.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:51.460
WE OPENED OUR DOORS ON
THE FIRST OF JULY, 2004.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:57.060
AND SINCE THEN, WE'VE
TAKEN IN 306 PATIENTS,

01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:02.200
MAINLY H.I.V. AND A.I.D.S.
RELATED ILLNESSES.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.060
THE NAME OF OUR HOSPICE
IS CALLED LERATONG,

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:09.760
AND LERATONG IS A
SESOTHO WORD THAT MEANS
THE PLACE OF LOVE.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.130
MY BELIEF IS THAT GOD IS LOVE,

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.160
SO THIS IS THE PLACE OF GOD.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.460
YOU'RE DOING WELL?

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.160
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT
PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:21.760
I MEAN, THEY COME HERE, THEY
COME TO A SPIRITUAL PLACE,

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.930
A GOOD PLACE, A LOVING PLACE.

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:24.830
OK.

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:26.500
[SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE]

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.500
I LOVE YOU, TOO. HA HA HA!

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.360
HELLO. WHAT KIND OF
PLACE IS THIS WITH CAKE?

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.800
WHERE PEOPLE COME TOGETHER,
THAT'S WHERE GOD IS.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.330
OK, LISTEN, ENJOY YOUR CAKE.

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:39.160
I'LL SEE YOU LATER ON.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:50.330
THANK YOU.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:53.500
Narrator: IN 2003,
FATHER CREAGH WAS

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.100
THE FIRST PERSON IN AFRICA

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.860
TO BE INJECTED WITH
THE A.I.D.S. VACCINE.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.130
Creagh: I HAVE BEEN WORKING
WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE HERE

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.030
IN THE TOWNSHIP TO HELP THEM
CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIORS,

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.460
TO GET THEM TO STOP
SLEEPING AROUND

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:08.600
OR TO HAVING SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.330
SO THEY WOULDN'T
BE GETTING A.I.D.S.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.630
FOR SOME REASON, THE MESSAGE
WASN'T GETTING THROUGH.

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:18.800
SO I THOUGHT, WELL, IF IT
MAKES SOME PEOPLE THINK,

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.800
WELL, IF THAT
CHAP CAN DO THAT,

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.460
THEN MAYBE I CAN ABSTAIN,

01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.030
OR I CAN CHANGE MY BEHAVIOR.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:29.500
IF THIS WILL STOP PEOPLE FROM
GETTING H.I.V. AND A.I.D.S.,

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.460
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING TO DO.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:34.700
I THINK GOD IS GREATER AND
BIGGER AND MORE WONDERFUL

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.400
AND MORE FANTASTIC THAN
ANY OF US WILL EVER KNOW.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.560
I THINK SOMETIMES
RELIGIOUS PRACTICE

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.400
CAN GET IN THE WAY.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.260
PEOPLE WILL TELL
YOU HOW TO FIND GOD

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.130
OR WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO TO GET GOD.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.760
IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE TO WIN GOD.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.830
RELIGIOUS PRACTICE IS GREAT IF
IT'S DONE FROM A GOOD HEART.

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:58.630
BUT ANYTHING ELSE, ANY LESS,
IS JUST LIKE ST. PAUL SAYS,

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:02.330
A BOOM CLASHING,
A GONG BANGING.

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:03.600
IT'S NO PROBLEM?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.760
I NEVER FIND GOD IN A CHURCH.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.830
IN OUR LANGUAGE, IN
THE IRISH LANGUAGE,

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:09.730
THE WORD FOR A CHURCH IS
TEACH AN PHOBAIL,

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:13.230
WHICH TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH
MEANS HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE.

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:15.960
AND IN CELTIC SPIRITUALITY,
THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVE--

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.730
THAT GOD DOESN'T NEED A HOUSE.

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:20.530
GOD IS EVERYWHERE. HE'S
IN THE AIR WE BREATHE.

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:22.330
IT'S LIKE THE PRAYER
OF ST. PATRICK.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.630
YOU KNOW, CHRIST BESIDE
ME, CHRIST ABOVE ME,

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:27.360
CHRIST BELOW ME,
CHRIST AROUND ME.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.530
IF CHRIST IS YOUR
SAVIOR AND YOUR REDEEMER

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:34.200
AND IF YOU CAN SEE CHRIST
IN EACH AND EVERY PERSON,

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:42.100
THAT WOULD BE A
LOVELY WAY TO LIVE.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.660
Narrator: IN FEBRUARY 2007,

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.600
8 MEN BROKE INTO
LERATONG HOSPICE,

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.530
SHOT FATHER CREAGH TWICE,
AND LEFT HIM FOR DEAD.

01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:56.200
THE CALLOUS VIOLENCE
OF THE ROBBERS

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.230
STUNNED HIM AND SHOOK HIS FAITH.

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:01.330
BUT HE CHOSE NOT TO
SURRENDER TO HATRED.

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:08.230
HE RETURNED TO LERATONG
AND CONTINUES HIS WORK.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.130
SOMETIMES YOU GET SO
ANGRY AT THE INJUSTICE,

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:13.660
THAT YOU START BECOMING
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING.

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.030
THAT'S WHEN YOU NEED YOUR FAITH.

01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:18.760
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING
THAT'S DEEPER THAN YOUR ISSUE

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:22.830
OR YOUR CAUSE OR YOUR
CAREER OR YOUR ENEMY

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:24.660
THAT YOU COME BACK TO.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:29.560
[CHOIR SINGING]

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.900
Armstrong: IN EVERY CASE,
RELIGION ISSUES A COMMAND--

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:41.030
BE BETTER, BE MORE HUMANE,
BE MORE KIND, BE MORE JUST.

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:45.260
RELIGIOUS TRUTH IS
A SUMMONS TO ACTION.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:50.500
AS THE BUDDHA PUT IT, ONCE A
MAN HAS ACHIEVED ENLIGHTENMENT,

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.500
HE MUST COME DOWN
FROM THE MOUNTAINTOP

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:55.100
AND RETURN TO THE MARKETPLACE

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:59.200
AND THERE PRACTICE COMPASSION
FOR ALL LIVING BEINGS.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.800
SO INHERENT IN
RELIGION AT ITS BEST

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:46.400
IS A COMMITMENT TO
DOING GOOD IN THE WORLD.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.260
EACH HUMAN BEING HAS A SENSE

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:51.260
THAT THERE ARE
THINGS THAT ARE RIGHT

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.100
AND THERE ARE THINGS
THAT ARE WRONG.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.430
Rauf: WE ALL HAVE
A SENSE OF DECENCY,

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:58.300
A SENSE OF JUSTICE,
A SENSE OF RIGHTNESS,

01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.960
OF HOW PEOPLE WANT
TO BE TREATED,

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:02.460
OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS
AND THE HUMAN DIGNITY

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.660
OF EVERY HUMAN BEING.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.030
THIS IS ALL THAT EVERYBODY
IN THE WORLD WANTS.

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:08.300
Chopra: WHEN WE GO
BEYOND RACISM AND BIGOTRY

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:12.100
AND HATRED AND PREJUDICE
AND NARROW NATIONALISM,

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:14.400
THESE ARE THE WAYS
TO HEAL OURSELVES.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.930
Armstrong: THE CHALLENGE
TODAY IS FOR US TO IMPLEMENT

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:22.260
THIS GLOBALLY SO WE
TREAT OTHER NATIONS

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.830
AS WE WOULD WISH TO
BE TREATED OURSELVES.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:27.800
ALL OF HUMANITY NOW
IS BEING CHALLENGED

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.160
TO TAKE A KIND OF
QUANTUM LEAP FORWARD

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.400
INTO A NEW WAY OF THINKING.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.460
AND FROM THAT OTHER
WAY OF THINKING

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.000
AND THE IMPERATIVE, THE MORAL
IMPERATIVE OF OUR GENERATION

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.600
IS TO TURN THE SHIP OF
HUMAN HISTORY AROUND

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.260
RADICALLY AND QUICKLY.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.330
Tutu: GOD SAYS, O
MY DEAR CHILDREN,

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:54.330
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
TO LEARN TO APPRECIATE,

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:57.300
IN FACT, TO CELEBRATE
YOUR DIVERSITY?

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.830
Rosen: IF YOU LOOK
AT THE QUR'AN,

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:01.160
IT HAS A VERY IMPORTANT TEXT,

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.460
AND IT SAYS, O HUMANKIND,

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:06.060
WE HAVE CREATED YOU FROM
ONE PAIR, A MAN AND A WOMAN,

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.960
AND MADE YOU INTO
TRIBES AND NATIONS

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:15.430
SO THAT YOU MAY
KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:20.100
Tutu: YOU HAVE GIFTS
THAT I DO NOT HAVE,

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.600
AND I HAVE GIFTS
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.230
AND YOU CAN ALMOST IMAGINE
GOD RUBBING GOD'S HANDS

01:09:26.230 --> 01:09:28.400
AND SAYING, VOILA!

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:40.730
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I
WANTED YOU TO KNOW!

01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:47.230
Dalai Lama: SO THEREFORE,
ACCORDING TO THE NEW REALITY,

01:09:47.230 --> 01:10:16.860
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE WHOLE WORLD LIKE
ONE ENTITY, ONE BODY.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:23.000
RESTLESS TONIGHT 'CAUSE
I WASTED THE LIGHT

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.800
BETWEEN BOTH THESE TIMES
I DREW A REALLY THIN LINE

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.930
IT'S NOTHING I PLANNED

01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:36.200
AND NOT THAT I CAN

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:39.460
BUT YOU SHOULD BE MINE

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.430
ACROSS THAT LINE

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:45.100
IF I TRADED IT ALL

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:51.100
IF I GAVE IT ALL
AWAY FOR ONE THING

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.930
JUST FOR ONE THING

01:10:54.930 --> 01:10:58.060
IF I SORTED IT OUT

01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:01.560
IF I KNEW ALL ABOUT

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.430
THIS ONE THING

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:07.660
WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING?

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.060
I PROMISE I MIGHT

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.200
NOT WALK ON BY

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.330
MAYBE NEXT TIME

01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:21.000
BUT NOT THIS TIME

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.030
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:27.300
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.530
YEAH, I GUESS I KNOW

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:33.000
I JUST HATE HOW IT SOUNDS

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.660
IF I TRADED IT ALL

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:41.500
IF I GAVE IT ALL
AWAY FOR ONE THING

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.760
JUST FOR ONE THING

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:52.060
IF I SORTED IT OUT,
IF I KNEW ALL ABOUT

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.100
THIS ONE THING

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.000
WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.060
IF I TRADED IT ALL

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:07.230
IF I GAVE IT ALL
AWAY FOR ONE THING

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:11.060
JUST FOR ONE THING

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:13.730
IF I SORTED IT OUT

01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:19.000
IF I KNEW ALL ABOUT
THIS ONE THING

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.900
WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING?

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.500
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.700
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:32.600
YEAH, I GUESS I KNOW

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.730
I JUST HATE HOW IT SOUNDS

01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:39.930
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

01:12:39.930 --> 01:12:43.200
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:45.100
YEAH, I GUESS I KNOW

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:45.100
I JUST HATE HOW IT SOUNDS
