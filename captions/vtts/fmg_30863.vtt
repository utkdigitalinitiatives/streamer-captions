THIS PROGRAM IS MADE POSSIBLE
BY THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
AND BY GRANTS FROM:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
CAPTIONING OF THIS PROGRAM
IS MADE POSSIBLE

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
BY THE JOHN D. AND CATHERINE T.
MacARTHUR FOUNDATION

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
( flute solo
 of "Amazing Grace" )

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
( flute continues )

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Woman:
* AMAZING GRACE *

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
* HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:15.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME. *

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Woman:
THAT'S ONE SONG THAT GET
TO MOST EVERYBODY

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
IF YOU NOTICED IT.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
IT'S A SONG THAT GET
TO THE HEART OF MEN.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:41.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST
AND NOW I'M FOUND *

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:56.000
* I WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Woman:
I THINK IT'S THE WORDS REALLY.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
A LOT OF THE TIME
THE MUSIC IS NICE

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
BUT THE WORDS GET MORE
WITH THE PEOPLE THAN ANYTHING.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
( Judy Collins singing
 "Amazing Grace" )

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Collins:
I KNEW THIS SONG,
"AMAZING GRACE"

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
FROM PROBABLY BEFORE I CAN
REMEMBER HAVING KNOWN IT.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
ONE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT HITS
IN THOSE DAYS

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
EVEN THOUGH I'M SURE
THERE WERE PEOPLE

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
WHO HAD TO THINK ABOUT
THAT SORT OF THING.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I DIDN'T THINK OF IT
AS SOMETHING WITH MASS APPEAL.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
AND AS IT TURNED OUT

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
THAT WAS THE SONG
THAT PEOPLE STARTED TO PLAY.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
IT WAS IN 1970, PEOPLE
STARTED TO REQUEST IT.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
DISC JOCKEYS STARTED TO PLAY IT,
BECOMING VERY, VERY POPULAR

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
AND PEOPLE, I THINK,
TURNED TO IT

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
AS THOUGH IT WAS SOMETHING

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
THAT THEY'D ALREADY KNOWN

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
AND AS THOUGH THEIR MEMORIES

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
THEIR INNER MEMORY
WAS BEING REFRESHED

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
SO THAT THEY KNEW IT.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"AH, YES, I KNOW THAT."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME *

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:36.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
* WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
( playing "Amazing Grace" )

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Ritchie:
I HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY WHEN
I GET UP TO SING A FOLK SONG

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
AN OLD SONG FROM THE FAMILY

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
"THAT'S A QUAINT OLD THING.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
THESE THINGS ARE
REALLY ALL DEAD."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I'D SAY THEY'RE NOT DEAD
OR THEY WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
THEY'VE LIVED ALL THESE YEARS.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO OFFER TO PEOPLE

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
AND SO HAVE OUR FAMILY MEMORIES.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
SEE THIS?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I WONDER WHO
THAT IS?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Man:
WE WERE ALL BOYS IN THE FAMILY
EXCEPT TEN.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
THERE WAS MAY, OLLIE, MATTIE,
UNA, RAYMOND, KITTY, TRUMAN

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
PATTY, EDNA, JEWEL, PAULINE,
WILMER AND JEAN

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
AND I'M WILBUR.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
THIS IS THE TENTH REUNION
THAT WE'VE HAD

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
AND WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
THERE ARE SO MANY LEFT

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THAT WE CAN SEE
ALL THESE GRANDCHILDREN.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Group:
* THE SUN REFUSED TO SHINE *

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Woman:
THE LORD WHO SENT ME HERE BELOW.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Group:
* THE LORD WHO SENT ME... *

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Wilbur:
WE USED TO SET ON THE FRONT
PORCH OF THIS OLD HOUSE

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
BEFORE IT WAS REMODELED.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
WE HAD A SWING OUT THERE.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
IN THE EVENINGS,
THEY WOULD SET AND SING

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
AND USUALLY THAT
WAS THE LAST SONG

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
THAT THEY SUNG--
"AMAZING GRACE."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
MY MOTHER SANG IT, I REMEMBER
EVEN MY FATHER SINGING.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
MY MOTHER BELONGED TO THE
OLD REGULAR BAPTIST CHURCH

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
AT JEFF, KENTUCKY

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
AND I REMEMBER WHEN
I WAS A LITTLE BOY

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I WOULD GO WITH HER DOWN THERE

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AND THEY WOULD
LINE OFF THE SONGS

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
AND I CAN REMEMBER SO WELL
THE PREACHER WOULD GET UP THERE

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
AND HE'D SAY, "AMAZING GRACE,
HOW SWEET ITS SOUND."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
AND EVERYBODY WOULD SING

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
"THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
AND THEN THEY'D ALL COME OUT,
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME. *

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
"ONCE I WAS LOST
BUT NOW I'M FOUND," AND SO ON.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
IT WENT ON THROUGH THE WHOLE
THING LIKE THAT.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
IT WAS REALLY TOUCHING
FOR A YOUNG BOY.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
IT MADE THE SHIVERS
RUN OVER YOU.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
WE SANG IT EVERY TIME
WE WOULD SING HYMNS.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
IN FACT, I REMEMBER AS A CHILD

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
MY COUSIN AND I TALKED
ABOUT THIS ONE TIME.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
SHE TOLD ME,
"I USED TO HIDE IN THE CLOSET

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
WHEN THEY SANG THE HYMNS
BECAUSE I'D BE CRYING SO HARD."

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I DO THE SAME THING.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
EVERY TIME THEY START
SINGING THESE HYMNS

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
TEARS JUST START
COMING OUT OF MY EYES

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
IT JUST REALLY
AFFECTS ME SOME WAY.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
IT'S LIKE ROOTS
JUST REACHING SO FAR DOWN.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
* ...LIKE ME *

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST *

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
* BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:10.000
* WAS BLIND BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THE RITCHIES CAME OVER TO THIS
COUNTRY FROM SCOTLAND IN 1768.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I IMAGINE THIS SONG...
WAS IT WRITTEN AFTER THAT?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Moyers:
IT WAS WRITTEN
ABOUT THAT TIME.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
YOU KNOW
WHO WROTE IT?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
ISAAC NEWTON.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
JOHN NEWTON.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I KNEW IT WAS A NEWTON.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
NO, I JUST SEEN
HIS NAME ON THE SONG.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
( organ playing
 "Amazing Grace" )

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Choir:
* AMAZING GRACE
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME *

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:11.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
* WAS BLIND... *

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Man:
JOHN NEWTON WAS IN HIS OWN WORDS
"AN INFIDEL AND A LIBERTINE"

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
IN THE EARLY PART OF HIS LIFE

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
BUT LATER ON HE WAS
A REFORMED CHARACTER

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
AND BECAME A CHRISTIAN MINISTER
IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
HE WAS BORN IN 1725

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
AND HE DIED IN 1807,
SO HE HAD A GOOD LIFE.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
THE EARLY PART
OF HIS LIFE, THOUGH

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
WAS CLOUDED WITH
SHAME AND DISGRACE

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
ACCORDING TO HIS LATER THOUGHTS.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
BUT HE WROTE THE HYMN
"AMAZING GRACE"

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
WHEN HE TOOK HIS FIRST CURE

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
IN THE PARISH OF OLNEY IN
THE COUNTY OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
HE PROBABLY WROTE IT IN
THE YEARS ABOUT 1760 TO 1770.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Man:
JOHN NEWTON WAS THE CURATE
HERE IN OLNEY.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
HE WAS APPOINTED IN 1764

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
AND STARTED A VERY LIVELY
SORT OF PREACHING

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
ABOUT HIMSELF
AND HIS OWN EXPERIENCE

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
AND THE WORK OF GRACE
IN HIS LIFE.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
IN ADDITION TO
THE CHURCH SERVICES

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
HE STARTED A WEEKLY
PRAYER MEETING.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
AND HE PERSUADED
HIS FRIEND WILLIAM COWPER

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
WHO LATER BECAME
QUITE FAMOUS AS A POET

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
TO WRITE HYMNS TOGETHER WITH HIM

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
SO THEY WOULD TAKE TURNS
TO WRITE A NEW HYMN

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
FOR EACH OF THESE
WEEKLY MEETINGS.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
"AMAZING GRACE"
WAS ONE OF THOSE.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
AS FAR AS WE KNOW

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
IT WAS WRITTEN IN HIS STUDY
RIGHT AT THE TOP THERE

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
THE TOP RIGHT-HAND ROOM
OF THE VICARAGE.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
John Newton:
 OCTOBER 27, 1778.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
HOW INDUSTRIOUSLY
 IS SATAN SERVED.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I WAS FORMERLY ONE
 OF HIS ACTIVE UNDERTEMPTERS

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
AND HAD MY INFLUENCE
 BEEN EQUAL TO MY WISHES

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I WOULD HAVE CARRIED
 ALL THE HUMAN RACE WITH ME.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
A COMMON DRUNKARD
 OR PROFLIGATE

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
IS A PETTY SINNER
 TO WHAT I WAS.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I HAD THE AMBITION OF A CAESAR
 OR AN ALEXANDER

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
AND WANTED TO RANK
 IN WICKEDNESS

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
AMONG THE FOREMOST
 OF THE HUMAN RACE.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
OH, TO GRACE,
 HOW GREAT A DEBTOR.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
"THOU SHALT REMEMBER

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
"THAT THOU WAST A BOND-MAN
 IN THE LAND OF EGYPT

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
AND THE LORD THY GOD
 REDEEMED THEE."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
NEWTON'S BACKGROUND WAS
PRETTY ROUGH, REALLY.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
HE CAME FROM A SEAFARING FAMILY.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
HE LOST HIS MOTHER
AT AN EARLY AGE.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
HE DIDN'T DO MUCH
AT SCHOOL AT ALL

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
BUT HIS FATHER EVENTUALLY
MANAGED TO GET HIM A JOB AT SEA

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
BUT HE RAN AWAY

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
AND THEN HE GOT PRESS-GANGED
INTO THE NAVY

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
AND THEN HE MUTINIED
FROM ANOTHER SHIP--

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
HE HAD A VERY ROUGH TIME--

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
AND THEN HE ENDED UP
IN THE SLAVE TRADE.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Cooke:
ONE OF HIS MAIN EXPERIENCES

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
WHEN HE WAS GIVEN THE COMMAND
OF A SHIP OUT OF LIVERPOOL

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
WAS TO TAKE MANUFACTURED ITEMS
FROM GREAT BRITAIN

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
AND EXPORT THEM TO WEST AFRICA

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AND THERE HE WOULD EXCHANGE THEM
WITH THE TRADERS ON THE COAST

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
FOR SLAVES.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
MONDAY NOVEMBER 12, 1750.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
THIS MORNING MR. CLOUGH
 SHOWED ME SEVEN SLAVES

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
OUT OF WHICH I PICKED FOUR,
 THREE MEN, ONE WOMAN

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
PAID WHAT GOODS I HAD
 IN THE BOAT THAT WERE SUITABLE

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
AND I'M TO SEND THE REST.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
IN THE AFTERNOON,
 WEIGHED WITH THE SEA BREEZE

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
AND RAN HALFWAY TO THE BANANAS,
 THEN IT FELL CALM.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
HE WAS A PROLIFIC WRITER

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
AND THAT'S MADE
ALL THE DIFFERENCE

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HIM.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
HE KEPT NOT ONLY A DAILY JOURNAL

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
WHICH HE WROTE EXTENSIVELY

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
BUT ALSO HIS WHOLE
VOLUME OF LETTERS

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AND HISTORIANS TELL ME

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
THAT JOHN NEWTON'S
JOURNAL AND LETTERS

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
WERE THE FIRST REALLY
IMPORTANT ACCOUNT

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
OF WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE AT SEA
IN THE SLAVE TRADE BUSINESS.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
MONDAY JANUARY 7, 1751.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
THIS MORNING, WENT ON BOARD
 CAPTAIN COBURN

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
HE HAVING TOLD ME
 HE HAD EIGHT SLAVES

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
TO CHANGE WITH ME
 FOR TEETH AND WOOD

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
ACCORDING TO OUR AGREEMENT
 OF THE BANANAS

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
BUT COULD NOT TAKE THEM
 UPON HIS TERMS

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
WHICH WAS 60 BARS
 PER HEAD ROUND

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
THOUGH THERE WERE
 BUT THREE SIZEABLE

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
AND TWO OF THE REMAINING FIVE
 UNDER THREE FOOT, SIX INCHES.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
SENT THE STEWARD
 TO SHORE AGAIN

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
TO PURCHASE THE WOMAN SLAVE

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
AND BROUGHT HER OFF
 IN THE EVENING, NUMBER 46.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
SHE COST 63 BARS, THOUGH SHE
 HAD A VERY BAD MOUTH.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Cooke:
HE OF COURSE HAD A FINANCIAL
INTEREST IN THE VOYAGE.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
IF THE TRIP WAS SUCCESSFUL
AND HE MADE MONEY

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THEN HE COULD TAKE
A SHARE OF IT.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
THIS WAS PARTICULARLY
IMPORTANT TO HIM

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
BECAUSE HIS SWEETHEART'S PARENTS

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
WERE KEEN THAT HE BE
ESTABLISHED IN LIFE WITH MONEY

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
IN ORDER TO MARRY
THEIR ELDEST DAUGHTER

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
AND WITHOUT THAT MONEY
HE WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
USUALLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS
 OF A CARGO OF SLAVES ARE MALES.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
WHEN 150 OR 200 STOUT MEN
 TORN FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
AND WHO OFTEN BRING
 WITH THEM AN APPREHENSION

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
THEY ARE BOUGHT TO BE EATEN

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
WHEN THUS CIRCUMSTANCED,
 IT IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
THAT THEY WILL TAMELY RESIGN
 THEMSELVES TO THEIR SITUATION.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
IT IS ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
THAT THEY WILL ATTEMPT
 TO GAIN THEIR LIBERTY.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
ACCORDINGLY, AS WE DARE
 NOT TRUST THEM

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
WE RECEIVE THEM ON BOARD
 FROM THE FIRST AS ENEMIES.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Burdon:
HE SAW HIMSELF VERY MUCH
AS A FREE THINKER

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
WHO WAS NOTORIOUS AMONG
THE SAILORS APPARENTLY--

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
WHO WERE A FAIRLY
ROUGH LOT THEN--

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
FOR THE TERRIBLE OATHS
THAT HE USED

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
AND THIS QUITE ALARMED THEM.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
ONE DAY HE WAS IN THE ATLANTIC
IN A STORM AT SEA

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH
THE SHIP WAS SINKING

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE LOST

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
AND HE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED,
"WELL, IF NOTHING CAN BE DONE

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US."

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
HE WENT BACK TO HIS CABIN AND
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SAID

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
AND WHAT DID THIS MEAN,
"LORD HAVE MERCY UPON US"?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
THIS WASN'T THE SORT OF THING
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE IN.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
SOMEHOW HE REALIZED THAT THERE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
GOD HAD ADDRESSED HIM,
THAT HE BELIEVED IN GOD

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
AND GOD'S GRACE WAS WORKING
ACTUALLY IN HIM AND FOR HIM

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
AND GRADUALLY HIS LIFE CHANGED.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Jessye Norman:
* AMAZING GRACE *

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.000
* HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:04.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME *

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:23.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:41.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:59.000
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT
MY HEART TO FEAR *

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:17.000
* AND GRACE MY FEARS RELIEVED *

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:35.000
* HOW PRECIOUS DID
THAT GRACE APPEAR *

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:48.000
* THE HOUR I FIRST BELIEVED. *

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Norman:
THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT
MUST HAVE BEEN IN CHURCH.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
THIS WAS WHAT CHURCH
MEANT TO ME-- THE MUSIC.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
AND I'M SURE THAT IT
WAS DONE A CAPPELLA

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
AND IT WAS PROBABLY
DONE IN THE WAY

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
THAT WE REFER TO
IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
THAT THE HYMN WAS "RAISED"

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THAT SOME DEACON STOOD UP

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
JUST AS THEY WOULD

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
IN AN AFRICAN TRIBE

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
AND SAID, "I WANT TO SING
'AMAZING GRACE'

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
A HYMN IN COMMON METER."

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
AND HE STARTS TO SING

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
AND THEN THE CHURCH
JOINS IN.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
DOES IT SURPRISE YOU
THAT THIS SONG

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
HAS NOW BECOME SO
UNIVERSALLY POPULAR?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.000
YES.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
AND RECOGNIZED AND RECEIVED?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
YES, I AM
SURPRISED
BY THAT

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
AND I WAS SURPRISED
AT THE POPULARITY

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
THAT THE SONG SEEMED
TO GAIN IN THE '60s.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY THAT.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
UNTIL THEN IT WAS
PRETTY WELL IN THE PROVINCE

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
OF RELIGIOUS FOLKS.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
SOMEHOW THE GENIE GOT
OUT OF THE BOTTLE.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
YEAH, IT REALLY DID,
AND IT STAYED THERE.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Collins:
FOR ME, IT WAS ALWAYS
THE SONG THAT GAVE ME

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
AN INNER EXPERIENCE
OF AN OTHER DIMENSION.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
WHEN I SING THIS SONG
WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I ALWAYS FEEL THAT
THERE'S A MYSTICAL TERRITORY

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
BETWEEN THE SINGER
AND THE AUDIENCE.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
IT'S NOT JUST ME SINGING

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
IT'S SOMETHING ELSE
THAT'S SINGING

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
AND IT'S ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE
AND THEIR SPIRITS

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
SO SOMEWHERE OR OTHER THERE IS
SOME EXPERIENCE GOING ON

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
WHICH GIVES SOMETHING TO THEM
AND GIVES SOMETHING TO ME

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THAT'S MORE THAN THE SUM
OF ANY OF US.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
* ...HOW SWEET THE SOUND *
THAT SAVED THE...

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I HAD HEARD THAT THE SONG
WAS WRITTEN BY A MAN

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
WHO HAD HAD A WRETCHED LIFE
AND BEEN A SLAVE TRADER.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
WHAT AN EXPRESSION OF...
YES, OF GRATITUDE AND OF JOY

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS...
IS THE OTHER SIDE TO THAT

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
WHICH CAN ONLY BE GIVEN
BY SUCH A PROFOUND

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
AND I WOULD CALL
SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
"AMAZING GRACE" REALLY SAYS
THIS CHOICE IS WRETCHED

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
AND THIS OTHER ONE
IS WORLDS APART.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
INDESCRIBABLE.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
DID YOU EVER FEEL
LIKE A WRETCH?

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
OH, YES, ENOUGH SO
THAT IT ALWAYS REMINDS ME

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THOSE VERY,
VERY DARK TIMES IN MY OWN LIFE

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
SOME OF WHICH, DURING SOME
OF WHICH, THIS SONG I THINK

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
REALLY CARRIED ME THROUGH.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
"AMAZING GRACE" IS ALMOST
LIKE A TALISMAN.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE DEEPEST
OR DARKEST DANGERS

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
THAT YOU EXPERIENCED

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
WHEN THIS
ILLUMINATION
WAS IMPORTANT?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
I THINK IT WAS ALCOHOL
PERHAPS MOST OF ALL

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
BECAUSE DURING THOSE TIMES
PARTICULARLY

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I THINK THAT SONG WAS THE THING

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
THAT WAS ABLE
TO PULL ME THROUGH.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
IT HEALS.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:01.000
* ...BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
BEAUTIFUL.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I REMEMBER BEING IN MISSISSIPPI
WITH FANNIE LOU HAMER

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
AND GOING ON THE VOTER
REGISTRATION DRIVES

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
IN THE SUMMER OF '64

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
AND WE'D GET TO THE TOWN

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
WHERE WE WERE TO DO A RALLY
FOR VOTER REGISTRATION

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
DREW, MISSISSIPPI
OR RULEVILLE, MISSISSIPPI

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
LITTLE TINY TOWNS

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
WHERE PEOPLE WERE REALLY
RISKING THEIR LIVES TO COME OUT

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
AND THEY WOULD COME.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
THE THING THAT BROUGHT THEM OUT
WAS THE SINGING.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
FANNIE LOU HAMER
WAS A GREAT SINGER

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
AND WHEN SHE WOULD SING
"AMAZING GRACE"

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
YOU COULDN'T HELP BUT SING

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
AND YOU COULDN'T HELP
BUT FEEL MOVED

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
AND YOU COULD EVEN SEE
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
TO PERHAPS PREVENT
WHAT WAS GOING ON

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
EVEN THEY WERE INVOLVED.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
IT'S TERRIBLY IMPORTANT
TO HEAR YOUR OWN HEART

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
REFLECT THE HEARTS
OF OTHER PEOPLE

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
AND THE SONG I THINK FITS
ALMOST EVERY SITUATION

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
YOU WOULD PUT IT IN.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Marchers:
* BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Norman:
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE MELODY

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
THAT WE KNOW IS AN
AMERICAN FOLK MELODY.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS CAME TO BE.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
BUT IT'S INTERESTING--
THE LIFE OF JOHN NEWTON.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I FIND THIS QUITE UNBELIEVABLE,
THAT HE'D BEEN ABOARD SHIPS

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
WHERE SLAVES WERE TRANSPORTED

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
FROM WEST AFRICA TO ENGLAND
OR TO THE UNITED STATES

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
AND THAT HE FOUND GRACE
AND CHANGED HIS WAYS.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
I MEAN, THIS IS AMAZING.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
THE THING THAT I WAS
THINKING ABOUT

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
READING THE MATERIAL

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
IS THAT WOULDN'T IT BE
QUITE UNBELIEVABLE

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
IF THIS MELODY WERE
ORIGINALLY A SLAVE MELODY

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
AND THESE WORDS WERE
WRITTEN BY JOHN NEWTON?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
WOULDN'T THAT BE AN
INCREDIBLE COINCIDENCE?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
YOU'VE SUNG IT IN MANY PLACES.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I'VE SUNG IT WITH ORCHESTRA.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
LAST SUMMER I SANG IT QUITE
A LOT AT THE END OF RECITALS.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
THERE WAS A WONDERFUL CONCERT

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
IT WAS REALLY A ROCK CONCERT

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
FOR THE 70th BIRTHDAY
OF NELSON MANDELA

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
IN LONDON LAST JUNE

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
AND AT THE END OF THIS CONCERT

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
WHICH WENT ON FOR HOURS--

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
12 HOURS OF ROCK MUSIC--

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
THERE I WAS STANDING
IN A WHITE SPOTLIGHT AT THE END

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
WITH 70,000 ROCK FANS

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
THAT REALLY WANTED THE DIRE
STRAITS TO GO ON ONE MORE SONG

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
AND OUT I CAME TO SING
"AMAZING GRACE."

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Moyers:
WAS THAT SPONTANEOUS?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Norman:
NO, I WAS ASKED TO DO IT.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I WASN'T SURE THAT
WAS A GOOD IDEA

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
AND A LOT OF THE ROCK FANS
DID NOT UNDERSTAND.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
BUT AFTER A WHILE THEY FINALLY
QUIETED DOWN TO LISTEN

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
AND SOME OF THEM SANG WITH ME

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
AND THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE
FORCED TO REMEMBER

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
WHY THEY'D BEEN THERE

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
THAT IT WAS NOT
ONLY A ROCK CONCERT

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
IT WAS A REMEMBRANCE OF SOMEBODY
THAT WAS IN PRISON

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
FOR THE WRONG REASON.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:23.000
* ...AND GRACE
MY FEARS RELIEVED *

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
* HOW PRECIOUS... *

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
THERE IS A POWER
OF RECONCILIATION

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
THAT TAKES PLACE WHEN I HEAR IT.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER
IT'S THE TEXT

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
WHETHER WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE LYRICS

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
WHEN WE SAY THAT
IT TOUCHES SO MANY PEOPLE

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
OR WHETHER IT'S THAT TUNE
THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
AND EVEN THE MELODY
HAS CHANGED A LITTLE BIT.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
WHEN I SING IT, I TRY TO SING IT

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
THE WAY IT WAS PUBLISHED
ABOUT 1900

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
BUT THE MELODY ITSELF HAS HAD
SOME VARIATIONS AS WELL.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
THE WAY IT WAS
WRITTEN WE HAVE

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
* THAT SAVED... *

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
ALL OF THAT IS REALLY
QUITE STRAIGHT

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
BUT I THINK BY THE TIME,
IN THE '60s

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
WHEN JUDY COLLINS WAS DOING IT

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
IT TOOK ON AN EVEN MORE
LYRICAL QUALITY.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME. *

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
ALL OF THESE LOVELY MOVING NOTES
IN BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL MELODY.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
ANY SHAPE NOTE SINGERS SING IT?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
IT'S REALLY QUITE SOMETHING.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I CAN'T IMITATE THAT.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
IT'S SOMETHING PRIMAL.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
IT BECOMES SOMETHING
THAT'S REALLY COMING

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
FROM THE CENTER OF THE EARTH.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
( Churchmembers singing )

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
( harmonized singing )

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:33.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME. *

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Man:
I WOULD THINK THAT WHEN THEY
FIRST INTRODUCED "AMAZING GRACE"

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
THEY'D SING JUST LIKE
WE SING IT TODAY.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
WE SING IT JUST LIKE IT WAS SUNG

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
WHEN IT WAS FIRST PUT
IN THE BOOK 150 YEARS AGO.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
* ...BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
100 YEARS AGO,
JUST ABOUT ALL YOU HAD

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
THROUGH THIS WHOLE COUNTRY HERE

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
WAS SHAPE NOTES.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
DOWN IN RURAL SECTIONS OF
THE COUNTRY 150 YEARS AGO

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
AND WHEN YOU HAD
AN ALL-DAY SINGING

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
YOU'D JUST ABOUT GET THE WHOLE
TOWN AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
"AMAZING GRACE" HAS BEEN
JUST ABOUT USED THE SAME WAY

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
SINCE THE START
OF PUTTING IT IN BOOKS.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
THE SHAPES WASN'T INVENTED
UNTIL 1798 BY SMITH AND LITTLE.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
THEY WROTE A BOOK AND THEY SAID
"FA" WILL BE TRIANGULAR

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
"SO" WILL BE ROUND,
"LA" WILL BE SQUARE

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
AND "ME" WILL BE DIAMOND SHAPED.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
AND THEN THEY STARTED
SINGING SHAPED NOTES

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
IN SINGING SCHOOLS

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
BECAUSE IT WAS THE EASIEST
METHOD IN THE WORLD

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
FOR BEGINNERS TO LEARN TO SING.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
IF YOU PUT SEVEN ROUND
NOTES ON A SCALE

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
IT'S HARD TO GET
THE SOUND OF THEM

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
WITHOUT SOME KIND
OF INSTRUMENT TO HELP YOU.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
HERE, YOU CAN START OUT
WITH YOUR FA-SO-LA-ME

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
YOU GO UP AND YOU'D FIND OUT
THE SOUND OF IT

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
AND TODAY WE STILL SING
THE SHAPES FIRST

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME
A TRADITION WITH US.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
( group finishes singing )

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
EVERYBODY IS INVITED OUT
TO DINNER ON THE TABLE

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
AND IF YOU'VE GOT DINNER
THAT YOU WANT TO SPREAD WITH US

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
BE SURE TO SPREAD IT OUT WITH US

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
AND WE'LL HELP YOU EAT IT UP.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
EVERYBODY DISMISSED
FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
THAT WAS A REAL GOOD APPROPRIATE
TIME FOR YOU TO SING THAT.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
IT WAS REAL GOOD.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
IT SURE WAS GOOD.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
MY FAMILY ALWAYS SANG
IN SACRED HARP

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
AND I JUST GREW UP SINGING
SACRED HARP

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
AND I'VE BEEN COMING HERE SINCE
I CAN REMEMBER AS A SMALL CHILD.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
WE COME TWICE A YEAR UP HERE.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
WE HAVE ONE IN JUNE
AND THEN ONE IN NOVEMBER

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
BUT THEY'RE ALL OVER.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
WE GO ABOUT EVERY SUNDAY.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
I THINK IT'S THE FEELING
THAT YOU HAVE, THE TRADITION

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
AND IT'S TIED IN
WITH YOUR FAMILIES.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
BUT THEN, WE WORSHIP THE LORD
IN SONG, AND I LIKE THAT.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
THEY SING "AMAZING GRACE"
A LOT IN THIS SINGING

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
AND ALL SINGINGS.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL EVERYWHERE.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Man:
IT'S JUST A GOOD SONG.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
IT'S WROTE LIKE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WROTE.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
McGraw:
"AMAZING GRACE" IS NOT THE NAME
OF THE SONG IN OUR BOOK.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
IT'S NAMED "NEW BRITAIN."

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE TUNE COME FROM.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT IT WAS A BALLAD

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
THAT WAS SUNG MANY,
MANY YEARS AGO

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
IN SOME OF THE OLD COUNTRIES

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
AND SOMEBODY HAS
TAKEN THE BALLAD

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
AND PUT THE WORDS OF
"AMAZING GRACE" TO IT.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
IT'S MORE THAN JUST A SOUND,
IT'S THE FELLOWSHIP AND THE LOVE

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
THAT WE HAVE FOR ONE ANOTHER

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
THAT MAKES US SING OUR HEARTS
OUT FOR ONE ANOTHER.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.000
( people singing
 "Amazing Grace" )

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
McGraw:
THEY'S ANOTHER GROUP
THAT SINGS SHAPE NOTES

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
DOWN IN SOUTH ALABAMA

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
CALLED BLACK SACRED HEART.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
THEY ACTLLY CALL THEIRSELF
THE "WIREGRASS SINGERS"

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
AND DEWEY WILLIAMS,
HE LEADS THE SINGING.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Man:
* WAS BLIND... BUT NOW... *

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:07.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
AND WHEN YOU WANT
TO SING IT ANOTHER WAY.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:19.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:26.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME *

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
THAT'S JUST AS TRUE AS THE DAY.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
* THROUGH MANY DANGERS,
TOILS AND SNARES *

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
* I HAVE ALREADY COME *

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
* AH, AH, AH *

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT BROUGHT
ME SAFE THUS FAR... *

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Williams:
I FEEL GOOD, AND
I CAN'T HELP IT.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
WHEN I KEEP SINGING
"AMAZING GRACE"

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
IT JUST DO SOMETHING TO ME.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
WE HERE
ON THE 91st

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
BIRTHDAY
OF DEWEY.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
91 YEARS AGO, I DIDN'T
KNOW NOTHING

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
BUT I WAS HERE, THANK GOD,
AND I'M STILL HERE.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I'M GLAD TO BE HERE.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
GLAD TO SEE
MY FRIENDS.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I'M GLAD
TO SEE ALL OF YOU.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
DON'T YOU ALL FEEL PRETTY GOOD?

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
ALL OF YOU FEEL PRETTY GOOD

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
HOLD UP YOUR HAND.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
AMEN, I SURE FEEL
PRETTY GOOD.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
* IT'S TAKING JUST
A LITTLE MORE TIME *

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
* LORD, GIVE ME JUST
A LITTLE MORE TIME *

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
* SO MANY WRETCHED SOULS
ARE LOST IN SIN *

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
* SO MANY, MANY LEFT BEHIND *

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
* I GOT A LOT OF THINGS
THAT I NEED TO DO *

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
* BEFORE I LEAVE
THIS EARTH BEHIND *

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
* I'M READY WHEN YOU
CALL ME, LORD *

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
* GIVE ME JUST
A LITTLE MORE TIME. *

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Williams:
I WAS BORN IN 1898,
MARCH THE 5th, ACROSS THE FIELD.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
WHEN I WAS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
LIVING IN COFFEY COUNTY,
THEY'D HAVE NIGHT SINGINGS.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.000
MY DADDY AND MY NEIGHBORS--
THEY WOULD SING

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
AND MY GRANDFATHER
WAS A SONGSTER

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
AND DADDY WAS A SONGSTER.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
HE COULDN'T SING A LOT
OF SONGS LIKE I COULD

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
BUT THEY WERE SINGERS.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
NOW THEY COULD RAISE ANY
KIND OF HYMN--

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
MY GRANDDADDY COULD--
COMMON ONES, LONG, SHORT.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
HE'LL SING THEM ANY WAY
YOU WANT TO FIX IT

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
AND HE JUST SANG
THE SACRED HARP NOTE.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
BUT HE REALLY COULDN'T
SING THEM LIKE I DO.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
YOUR
GRANDDADDY?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
WASN'T HE
A SLAVE?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
YES, HE WAS.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I REMEMBER HIM.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
HE DIED IN '28.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
1928?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
THAT'S WHEN HE DIED.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
AND HE'D BEEN
A SLAVE?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
YES, HE WAS A YOUNG BOY,
BUT HE COULD REMEMBER IT.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000

AIN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Moyers:
HOW DOES A MAN LIVE
A LIFE OF JOY?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Williams:
WELL, YOU GOT TO BE
BETWEEN POOR AND RICH.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
THAT'S RIGHT--
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
YOU CAN LIVE A HAPPY LIFE.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Moyers:
BETWEEN POOR AND RICH?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Williams:
YES.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
IF YOU'RE TOO POOR,
YOU CAN'T LIVE HAPPY

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
AND IF YOU'RE TOO RICH,
YOU WON'T LIVE HAPPY.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
NEITHER ONE OF THEM
IS EVER THAT CHEERY

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
* BUT NOW... *

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
* BLIND BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
IT'S A SONG THAT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SUNG

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
BY BLACK PEOPLE IN CHURCH.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED
TO SING "AMAZING GRACE"

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
AND THEN BEING
AROUND MY GRANDFATHER.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
"AMAZING GRACE" IS
LIKE THE THEME SONG

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
OF THE WIREGRASS
SACRED HARP SINGERS.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
IT'S A SONG IN THE SOUTH
THAT YOU ALWAYS HEAR.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Moyers:
YOUR GRANDFATHER
IS DEWEY WILLIAMS?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
YES.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
AND HIS
GRANDPARENTS
WERE SLAVES?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
UM-HMM.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Moyers:
WHAT DOES GRACE
MEAN TO YOU?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
WELL, GRACE IS--
I'D SAY FORGIVEN.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Moyers:
HAS IT MADE

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
A DIFFERENCE
IN YOUR LIFE?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
OH, YES-- ME, AND
MANY OTHER PEOPLE.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
PROBABLY EVERYBODY ON EARTH,
BECAUSE WE ALL HUMAN

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.000
AND WE ALL DO DO THINGS
THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
I REMEMBER ONE DAY
MY BROTHER GOT VERY ANGRY

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
ABOUT WORKING SO HARD
IN THE FIELD

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
AND HE'D SAY HE WAS
QUITTING-- HE WAS LEAVING.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
HE WAS NOT GOING
TO WORK ANYMORE.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
HE WAS NOT GOING
TO PLOW ANY MORE MULE.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
"I'M LEAVING HERE."

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
AND HE WENT ON UP
ACROSS THE FIELD

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
LIKE HE WAS GOING

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
AND MY FATHER SAY,
"HERE HE COME BACK

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
BECAUSE BETTER DAYS
ARE COMING BY AND BY."

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
HE GOT ALMOST TO THE ROAD,
TURNED AROUND AND CAME BACK

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
AND WENT TO WORKING AGAIN,
AND THAT'S WHAT GRACE...

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
MY FATHER KNEW THERE
WOULD BE A BETTER DAY

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
BECAUSE THE GRACE WOULD HELP US.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
IF WE COULD JUST HAVE PATIENCE,
WE WOULD SEE A BETTER DAY.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
ARE YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY
SINGING IT

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
CARRYING ON THE TRADITION?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Moyers:
THIS LITTLE GIRL?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
YES.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
LET'S HEAR HER
SING IT.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Woman:
RUTHENA, COME BACK.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Moyers:
CAN YOU SING
IT FOR US?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
YOUR MOTHER SAYS YOU HAVE
A DIFFERENT RENDITION OF IT.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:27.000
* AMAZING GRACE SHALL ALWAYS BE
MY, MY SONG OF PRAISE *

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:39.000
* FOR IT WAS GRACE
THAT BROUGHT MY LIBERTY *

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:50.000
* I DO NOT KNOW JUST
HOW HE CAME TO LOVE ME SO *

00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:04.000
* HE LOOKED BEYOND ALL OF
MY FAULTS AND HE SAW MY NEEDS. *

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
DO YOU REMEMBER
SINGING TO YOUR
GRANDCHILDREN?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
MANY TIMES.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
YOU REMEMBER
HIM SINGING
"AMAZING GRACE?"

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
YES, THE OLD WAY.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I'D COME UP HERE
EVERY YEAR AND SIT DOWN

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
AND LISTEN TO HIM
SING THE NOTES.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
WHAT WAS YOUR
FAVORITE VERSION
OF IT?

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
THE OLD WAY.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:34.000
* WE'LL KNOW LESS DAYS
TO SING GOD'S PRAISE *

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:41.000
* THAN WHEN WE FIRST BEGUN *

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
( bebops to close )

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH, AIN'T IT?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Johnny Cash:
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME *

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST, *
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:14.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE *

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:21.000
* IT WAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT
MY HEART TO FEAR *

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
* AND GRACE MY FEARS
RELIEVED... *

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Cash:
THAT SONG HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
PERSONAL MEANING TO ME,
IN THAT MY BROTHER, JACK--

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I RECORDED AN ALBUM
CALLED PRECIOUS MEMORIES

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
AND DEDICATED THE ALBUM TO HIM--

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
MY BROTHER JACK WAS KILLED
IN AN ACCIDENT IN 1944.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
I LIVED IN DYESS, ARKANSAS--
D-Y-E-S-S.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
IT WAS ONE OF PRESIDENT
ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL FARMS.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
THE 14,00 ACRES WAS CUT UP
INTO 20-ACRE TRACKS

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
EACH WITH A HOUSE
AND A BARN AND A MULE.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I THINK PROBABLY
DURING THAT TIME

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
WHY THAT SONG DUG SO DEEP
WITHIN MY SOUL

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
WAS THAT MY MOTHER AND I,
AND MY SISTERS

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
SANG THAT SONG IN THE COTTON
FIELDS AFTER MY BROTHER DIED

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
AS WE WORKED.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
DAVID ALLEN COE--

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
"JUST A FRIEND" HE SIGNS
HIMSELF, EX-CONVICT--

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
SAYS ON THE JACKET OF JOHNNY
 CASH SINGS PRECIOUS MEMORIES.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
"IT'S BEEN SAID HE"--

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
JOHNNY CASH-- "HAS
NEVER BEEN IN PRISON

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
"BUT IT'S AS IF
HE'S DONE MORE
TIME THAN I.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
"EACH MAN HAS
HIS OWN PRISONS.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
"PERHAPS HIS PRISONS
WEREN'T LIKE MINE

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
"BUT THEY LEFT
THEIR MARK ON HIM

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
"AS THE 20 YEARS
I SPENT LEFT MORE
MARKS ON ME

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
THAN THE TATOOS
ON MY BODY."

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
SO WE ALL HAVE
OUR PRISONS?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
YEAH, WE DO.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
WE CAN GET OURSELF
INTO A LITTLE PRISON

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
OF DRUGS, ALCOHOL,
A RELATIONSHIP, OR A HABIT

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
OR A SITUATION
THAT WE WEAVE OURSELVES INTO

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
THAT CAN BE LIKE A PRISON

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
WITH BARS THAT YOU CAN'T
BREAK OUT OF.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
* AMAZING GRACE!
HOW SWEET... *

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Moyers:
DO YOU REFLECT ON
THAT FIRST TIME YOU SANG

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
AT THE HUNTSVILLE PRISON IN '57?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Cash:
OH, YEAH, I SURE DO.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
THAT WAS MY FIRST PRISON
CONCERT AT HUNTSVILLE.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND... *

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Cash:
FOR THAT THREE MINUTES
THAT SONG IS GOING ON

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
EVERYBODY IS FREE,
AND IT JUST FREES THE SPIRIT.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Prisoner:
* ...LIKE ME... *

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:40.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:46.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Man:
I'VE BEEN LOCKED UP
HALF MY LIFE.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
I'VE SEEN AND DONE JUST ABOUT
ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I CAME IN HERE FOR THAT.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE YOU GOING
TO BE HERE?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
WHO KNOWS?-- THAT'S IRRELEVANT
RIGHT NOW, ANYWAY.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
I'M DEALING WITH DAY TO DAY.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I DON'T WORRY ABOUT
NEXT WEEK OR NEXT YEAR.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
WHAT ARE YOU
IN HERE FOR?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
MURDER, DRUGS, ARMED ROBBERY,
BURGLARY OF A HOUSE AT NIGHT

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
AND...

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I WAS A REAL IDIOT.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
ONCE IT STARTED,
IT WAS JUST

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
ONE THING
AFTER ANOTHER.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I ENDED UP IN A LOCKUP--
IN THAT SOLITARY OVER THERE

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
AND I WAS THINKING,
"BOY, YOU IDIOT," YOU KNOW.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
SO SMART, YOU KNOW.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
ALL THESE YEARS, MAN, YOU'VE
BEEN PLAYING IT SO CLEVER

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
LOOK WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
YOU'RE NEVER
GETTING OUT OF HERE.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
AND ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
THE WORDS TO "AMAZING GRACE"
BECAME REAL TO ME.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
I COULDN'T HARDLY
SING THAT SONG

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
AND GET THROUGH
FOUR VERSES OF IT
WITHOUT CHOKING UP.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
I COULD GET THROUGH
ABOUT THE SECOND VERSE

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
AND I WOULD START
KIND OF LOCKING UP

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
AND A LOT OF TIMES,
ALL I COULD DO

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
IS JUST BE HUMMING AND CRYING

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
BECAUSE IT'S A REAL SONG
EVEN NOW TO ME.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
IT HAS TO BE TAKEN
IN AN OVERALL VIEW

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
BUT PROBABLY THE MOST
FAVORITE LINES TO ME

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME NOW
ARE THE SECOND VERSE

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
WHERE IT'S TALKING ABOUT
THAT GRACE CAUSED YOU TO FEAR

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
AND AT FIRST YOU THINK
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
BUT WHEN YOU COME IN HERE AND
YOU TAKE A LOOK, YOU DO FEAR.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
YOU GET SO AFRAID
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
TO GET YOUR LIFE
IN ORDER IN TIME.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
IT'S A FEAR THAT IS HARD
TO PUT INTO WORDS

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
OF BEING ALONE

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
OF BEING LOCKED IN
WHEN YOU'RE USED TO BEING FREE.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Moyers:
IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES,
AMAZING GRACE IS NO WAY OUT.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
IT WON'T UNLOCK THOSE BARS.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Man:
NO, BUT THAT'S YOUR ONLY CHANCE.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
THE ONLY WAY OUT IS UP.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Moyers:
SOME PEOPLE WILL
FIND IT DIFFICULT

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
TO BELIEVE THAT
HARDENED MEN

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
WOULD BE AFFECTED
BY SUCH A SONG

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
AND THEY'LL BE
VERY SKEPTICAL.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
THEY'LL SAY,
"IT'S A RELIGIOUS SPASM.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
IT'S NOTHING BUT PIETY,
NOTHING BUT SENTIMENT."

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
YOU KNOW, BILL, WE HAVE HAD
AN OPPORTUNITY AND A CHANCE

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
TO FACE OUR TRANSGRESSIONS.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
WE HAVE A LOT OF TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
WE'VE BEEN
RECONCILED.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
WE HAVE
A PEACE INSIDE.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
WH ARE YOU
IN HERE FOR?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
I'M HERE FOR SOLICITATION
OF CAPITAL MURDER--

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
TRYING TO ARRANGE
FOR HAVING MY WIFE KILLED.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
WHEN DID YOU
FIRST UNDERSTAND

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
THE MEANING OF
"AMAZING GRACE"?

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
THAT WAS IN NOVEMBER OF 1987
WHEN I GOT HERE.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
( Moyers
 laughs )

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
THIS IS WHY I CAN SPEAK

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
BECAUSE I WAS ONE
OF THESE CHURCH CROWDS

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
WHO'D NEVER REALIZED THE
TRUE MEANING OF "AMAZING GRACE."

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I WAS HIDING
BEHIND IT.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I WAS
VERY INVOLVED
IN THE CHURCH.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I WAS A DEACON
IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
I SANG IN THE CHOIR...

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
AND YOU TRIED
TO HAVE YOUR
WIFE KILLED?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
YES, I DID.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
SO WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE VERSE?

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
"THROUGH MANY TRIALS
AND TOILS AND SNARES

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
IT'S GRACE THAT'S BEEN VERY..."
THE THIRD VERSE.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
THOSE WORDS IN THEMSELF
HOLD A STORY

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
FOR A GENERATION OF PEOPLE,
IF THEY'LL JUST LISTEN.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
* ...HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:33.000
* THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME *

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:43.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST, *
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:51.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE *

00:47:51.000 --> 00:48:01.000
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT
MY HEART TO FEAR *

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:10.000
* AND GRACE MY FEARS RELIEVED *

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:19.000
* HOW PRECIOUS DID
THAT GRACE APPEAR *

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:30.000
* THE HOUR I FIRST BELIEVED. *

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
AS A SONGWRITER, YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK ABOUT THAT SONG--

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
AS A SONGWRITER, OBJECTIVELY--
THERE IS A SONG WITH NO GUILE.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
THOSE LYRICS ARE STRAIGHT AHEAD

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
HONEST, GUT LEVEL,
AND HEART LEVEL.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
* ...BRIGHT SHINING AS THE SUN *

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:57.000
* WE'VE NO LESS DAYS
TO SING GOD'S PRAISE *

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:03.000
* THAN WHEN WE FIRST BEGUN. *

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
WHEN I SING THAT SONG
I COULD BE IN A DUNGEON

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
OR HAVE
CHAINS ALL OVER ME

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
BUT I'D BE FREE AS A BREEZE.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
THERE ARE SOME SONGS THAT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIFE

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
AND THAT SONG MAKES
A DIFFERENCE.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
( boys humming the scale )

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Man:
IF YOU SEE ANY CHILD
WHO IS JUST PASSING TIME

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
MOST WOULD LIKE TO SING
OR LISTEN TO MUSIC

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
OR IN THIS DAY AND AGE,
RAP, SO THERE IS A...

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:56.000
THERE'S A CERTAIN MEANS OF
EXPRESSION THAT'S GOOD FOR THEM

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
AND THEY FEEL VERY GOOD
ABOUT THAT.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000
( humming continues )

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:11.000
IT'S A WAY TO EXPRESS,
TO COME FROM THE INNER SOUL

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S
VERY IMPORTANT.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Turnbull:
ALL THE WAY
FROM THE TOP.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
SIT UP, IF YOU'RE
SITTING, OKAY?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
( piano introduction )

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.000
( boys humming "Amazing Grace" )

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
IT'S STILL GOT TO BE ON PITCH,
TREBLES, WHEN YOU COME BACK

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
SO KEEP
THE SUPPORT UP
UNDER IT.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
EVERYBODY, JUST
GENERALLY WARMER.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
ALL RIGHT, SAME THING, PLEASE.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
VERY LEGATO.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:15.000
I'M THINKING CALM,
SMOOTH... MEDITIVE.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
YOU KNOW?

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
READY, AND...

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Turnbull:
IT SORT OF GOES BACK TO, I THINK

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
TO MY EXPERIENCES
AS A CHILD IN MISSISSIPPI--

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
I GREW UP IN GREENVILLE,
MISSISSIPPI.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
I GOT A CHOIR SCHOLARSHIP
TO GO TO COLLEGE

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
WHICH WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO GO TO COLLEGE

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
AND I SANG MY WAY
THROUGH COLLEGE.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
BEING INVOLVED IN THE CHURCH

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.000
BEING INVOLVED IN CHOIR
ALL MY LIFE

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
I DECIDED TO GET
A GROUP OF KIDS TOGETHER.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000
BY THAT TIME,
I HAD BEGUN TO TEACH

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
IN THE NEW YORK CITY
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS WELL

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
AND IT SORT OF ALL CAME TOGETHER

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
BECAUSE I FOUND THAT WORKING
WITH CHILDREN IN TERMS OF CHOIR

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
AND THEM FEELING GOOD
ABOUT THEMSELVES

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
REALLY MADE THEM DO
EXCITING THINGS OTHERWISE.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:17.000
* ...I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND *

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
* WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE. *

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Turnbull:
THERE'S NO
BREATH, PLEASE!

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000
THAT'S NOT IT,
COME ON, THAT'S
NOT IT!

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Boy:
WELL, THEY AUDITIONED
ME AT MY SCHOOL

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
AND OUT OF A LOT OF BOYS

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
IT WAS ONLY A GROUP
OF US THAT MADE IT

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
AND OUT OF THAT GROUP,
THEY CAME TO THE CHOIR EVERY DAY

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
AND SOME DAYS THEY PICKED US UP

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
BUT MOST OF THE BOYS
THAT CAME IN WITH ME QUIT.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
I'M THE ONLY ONE
FROM MY SCHOOL THAT STAYED.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
I WAS A LITTLE
TRAINING TROUBLE

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
BECAUSE I STILL WASN'T
INTO THE CHOIR THAT MUCH.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
SO I WAS LIKE "AMAZING GRACE"--

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.000
I HEARD OF IT BUT I DIDN'T
REALLY UNDERSTAND IT

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
AT THE BEGINNING
OF "AMAZING GRACE"

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
THERE'S A LOT OF "OOHS"

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000
AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT
OF BREATH SUPPORT-- KEEP IT UP

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
AND WHEN YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH
IN THIS KIND OF POSITION

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
IT KIND OF HURTS
AROUND YOUR MOUTH

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
SO THAT'S WHY I SAY IT'S HARD.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000
WE USUALLY SING EVERY YEAR
AT AARON DAVIS HALL

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
AND THE FIRST TIME THE CHOIR
HAD JUST CAME IN FROM OFF A TOUR

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:28.000
AND WE WAS GOING TO MEET
THE PARENTS AT AARON DAVIS HALL

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000
AND WHEN WE GOT INTO
THE POP SHOW AFTER THE CLASSICAL

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
WE CAME OUT AND WE STARTED
SINGING "AMAZING GRACE"

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
AND MY MOTHER STARTED
CRYING AFTER

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
AND I WAS LIKE, I SAID,
"MA, WHY ARE YOU CRYING?" RIGHT.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
AND SHE SAID, "I'M NOT CRYING
BECAUSE NOTHING BAD HAPPENED."

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000
SHE WAS CRYING BECAUSE
SHE WAS HAPPY AND JOYFUL

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000
AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT,
BECAUSE SHE SAID TO ME

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
THAT IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES
FROM A LONG, LONG TIME AGO

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
SO I WAS HAPPY
TO SING IT FOR HER

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
AND ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE AUDIENCE.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Turnbull:
"AMAZING GRACE" IS ONE
OF THE VERY POPULAR SONGS

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
IN OUR REPERTOIRE

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
AND WE'LL BE DOING IT IN JAPAN,
SINGING IT IN JAPAN.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
NO-- CARRY THROUGH
"LORD," PLEASE!

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
PITCHES, AGAIN, PLEASE.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
( piano plays )

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
ONE, TWO!

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
( boys resume singing )

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Turnbull:
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
THAT IT PLAYS A ROLE IN THEIR
LIVES OTHER THAN JUST SINGING

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
BECAUSE THE SINGING IS
THE DISCIPLINE.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
THE MUSIC IS THE DISCIPLINE
WHEREBY THE COMMON GOAL

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
THAT WE HAVE FOR THE KIDS

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
AND THEN FROM THAT,
THEY LEARN ALL KINDS OF THINGS

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
WHICH HELPS THEM IN THEIR LIFE.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
WE HAVE SOME BOYS, MEN NOW,
WHO HAVE BECOME DOCTORS

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
LAWYERS, STOCKBROKERS,
TEACHERS, PREACHERS

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
AND THE COMMONNESS THROUGH THAT
IS THE DISCIPLINE

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
THE STICK-TO-IT-IVENESS

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
THE ABILITY TO SET A GOAL
AND REACH IT.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000
( boys shouting )

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Boy:
I FEEL DIFFERENT FROM
THE REGULAR KIDS ON THE BLOCK

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
BECAUSE I'M GOING AWAY;
I'M GETTING TO SEE THINGS

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
THAT KIDS DON'T GET A CHANCE
TO SEE-- NOT MOST OF THEM.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
I DON'T REALLY GET TO PLAY A LOT

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
BECAUSE I'M MOSTLY WITH
THE CHOIR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000
TRAVELING SOMEWHERE.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000
AND I JUST THINK I HAVE A
DIFFERENT LIFE THAN REGULAR KIDS

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
EXCEPT FOR THE KIDS
IN THE CHOIR.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I THINK WE ALL HAVE
THE SAME LIFE

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
BUT THE KIDS OUT ON THE STREET

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
DON'T THINK WE DO
HAVE THE SAME LIFE.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
( plays a wrong note )

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
IF YOU WROTE THIS

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
FOR AN ORCHESTRA

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
WHAT INSTRUMENT
MIGHT PLAY THIS?

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
IT'S AN
INTRODUCTION, RIGHT?

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
PROBABLY TRUMPETS?

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
YEAH, SURE--
LIKE A FANFARE.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000
( mimics a trumpet )

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
OKAY, CAN YOU MAKE THE PIANO

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000
SOUND MORE LIKE A TRUMPET
AT THE BEGINNING?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
OKAY, I'LL TRY.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
( short, rhythmic notes )

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Boy:
THERE WAS ONE PERIOD OF TIME
WHEN I USED TO NOT COME.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
I USED TO TELL MY MOTHER
I WAS GOING TO THE CHOIR

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
BUT I WOULD GO HOME AND SIT ON
THE STAIRS AND DO MY HOMEWORK.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
THEN LIKE, AFTER THEY GOT
OUT OF REHEARSAL

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
THEN I'LL WAIT A WHILE,
AND THEN I'LL GO HOME.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
I JUST-- WELL,
THEY GOT ON MY CASE.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
I HAD TO TALK TO ONE
OF THE COUNSELORS.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
THEY KNEW I WAS LYING,
KIND OF, LIKE

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000
AND SO I CLEANED UP MY ACT
AND I STARTED COMING

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
AND I STARTED LIKING IT.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Woman:
HE MIGHT CALL IT PECULIAR.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000
HE MIGHT SAY THAT HE'S PECULIAR,
HE'S DIFFERENT THAN OTHER KIDS.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
HE'S ALWAYS SAID THAT.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
HE NEVER USED THE WORD "GRACE"
BECAUSE I GUESS AT TEN

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
HE CAN'T DEFINE THE FEELING,
BUT HE SAYS HE'S PECULIAR

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
AND I TELL HIM HE'S SPECIAL.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Boys Choir:
* THROUGH MANY DANGERS,
TOILS AND SNARES *

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
* TOILS AND SNARES *

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:31.000
* I HAVE ALREADY COME... *

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Turnbull:
THEY HAVE TO BE PREPARED

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
TO TAKE THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE
IN THE SOCIETY.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
IT'S A COMBINATION
OF BEING IN TOUCH

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
WITH THEMSELVES SPIRITUALLY

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
AND IN TERMS OF FEELING
WHO THEY ARE

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.000
AND MUSIC CAN HELP US
TO DO THAT.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000
* ...WILL LEAD ME HOME. *

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
YOU'LL HAVE A SERIOUS
COLLECTION, JOSE.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000
MY MOTHER SAYS

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
SHE WANTS
TO SEE JAPAN...

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Older Boy:
SHE WANTS
TO SEE JAPAN

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000
THROUGH YOUR EYES?

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:26.000
SAY B.C.H... ONE, TWO, THREE.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
B.C.H!!

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT
BROUGHT ME SAFE... *

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
WHY YOU LOOKING THAT WAY?

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
FOCUS THAT WAY!

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Turnbull:
IN OTHER COUNTRIES

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
THEY USUALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE ORIGINS OF THE SONG

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
BUT IT HAS SUCH
A UNIVERSAL FLAVOR

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.000
AND JUST THE MELODY ITSELF
IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.000
THAT'S WHAT REALLY
CAPTURES PEOPLE.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
GOT IT, GUYS?

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Man:
GO DIRECTLY TO
THE DRESSING ROOM.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
DO NOT STOP,
DO NOT PASS GO--

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
DIRECTLY TO
THE DRESSING ROOM.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
PUT ON YOUR
BURGUNDY AND BLACK.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000
MEET UPSTAIRS BY 2:20.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
NOT 2:25-- 2:20.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
GOT IT?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Man:
THE ONLY STOP
THAT MAKES SENSE

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
IS TO STOP AND
GET YOUR BLAZER.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Turnbull:
THERE'S A DICHOTOMY
BETWEEN A BUNCH OF BLACK KIDS

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
SINGING "AMAZING GRACE"

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
OR LET'S SAY A BLACK CHURCH
SINGING "AMAZING GRACE"

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
GIVEN THE FACT
THAT THE PERSON WHO WROTE IT

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:32.000
WAS A HANDLER OF SLAVES,
AND WAS A CAPTAIN OF A SHIP

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
THAT CARRIED SLAVES
BACK AND FORTH.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
BUT IT HAS SOME VERY DEEP
AND IMPORTANT WORDS

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
AND IMPORTANT MEANING
TO THOSE WORDS

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
THAT WE CAN ALL RELATE TO.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT MAKE IT UNIVERSAL

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
AS OPPOSED TO WHO
IT WAS WRITTEN BY.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
DO YOU THINK GRACE IS REAL
TO THESE KIDS?--

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
THIS TRANSFORMING
POWER THAT CAN

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
CHANGE A LIFE.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I DON'T THINK THAT MOST KIDS
RECOGNIZE THAT YET.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.000
BUT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME,
THEY WILL REMEMBER.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000
* AMAZING GRACE... *

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Boy:
IT FEELS LIKE WALKING
ON A BEACH

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
AND LIKE WIND IS HITTING ME
AND STUFF LIKE THAT--

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
NOT LIKE A ROUGH WIND,
LIKE A SOFT WIND

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
JUST COMING BY LIKE A BREEZE--

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
THAT'S WHAT I THINK
GRACE MEANS TO ME.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
* ...TOILS AND SNARES *

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:49.000
* I HAVE ALREADY COME *

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:59.000
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT BROUGHT ME
SAFE THUS FAR *

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:13.000
* AND GRACE WILL LEAD ME HOME. *

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000
THOUGHTS UPON THE AFRICAN
 SLAVE TRADE, 1788.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
I HOPE IT WILL ALWAYS BE

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
A SUBJECT OF HUMILIATING
 REFLECTION TO ME

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
THAT I WAS ONCE
 AN ACTIVE INSTRUMENT

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
IN A BUSINESS AT WHICH
 MY HEART NOW SHUDDERS.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I FIRST SAW THE COAST OF GUINEA
 IN THE YEAR 1745

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
AND TOOK MY LAST
 LEAVE OF IT IN 1754.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I FITTED OUT
 FOR A FOURTH VOYAGE

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
AND WAS UPON
 THE POINT OF SAILING

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
WHEN I WAS ARRESTED
 BY A SUDDEN ILLNESS

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
AND I RESIGNED THE SHIP
 TO ANOTHER CAPTAIN.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
THUS I WAS UNEXPECTEDLY FREED
 FROM THIS DISAGREEABLE SERVICE.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
DISAGREEABLE
 I HAD LONG FOUND IT

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
BUT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE
 QUITTED IT SOONER

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
HAD I CONSIDERED IT AS I DO
 NOW TO BE UNLAWFUL AND WRONG.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000
BUT I NEVER HAD A SCRUPLE
 UPON THIS HEAD AT THE TIME

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
NOR WAS SUCH A THOUGHT ONCE
 SUGGESTED TO ME BY ANY FRIEND.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
WHAT I DID, I DID IGNORANTLY

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
CONSIDERING IT
 AS A LINE OF LIFE

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
WHICH DIVINE PROVIDENCE
 HAD ALLOTTED ME

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
AND HAVING NO CONCERN
 IN POINT OF CONSCIENCE

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
BUT TO TREAT THE SLAVES
 WHILE UNDER MY CARE

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
WITH AS MUCH HUMANITY

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
AS A REGARD TO MY OWN
 SAFETY WOULD ADMIT.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Burdon:
IT'S VERY HARD FOR US, I THINK,
TO UNDERSTAND THIS TODAY.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
FOR SOME TIME AFTER HIS
CONVERSION TO CHRISTIANITY

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000
HE CONTINUED IN THE SLAVE TRADE.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WITH IT

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
AND IT WAS ONLY LATER IN LIFE

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
WHEN HE WAS IN CONTACT
WITH WILLIAM WILBURFORCE

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
THAT HE CAME OUT AS AN ADVOCATE
FOR ABOLISHING THE SLAVE TRADE

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
AND GAVE A GREAT DEAL OF
INFORMATION AND AMMUNITION

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
TO WILBURFORCE AND TO THE ROYAL
COMMISSION ON THE SLAVE TRADE.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
AND IT WAS JUST BEFORE HE DIED

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
THAT THE ACT WENT
THROUGH PARLIAMENT.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
WILLIAM WILBURFORCE, WHO WAS
LOOKING FOR A PURPOSE IN LIFE

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
LATCHED ONTO THIS CAUSE

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
AND HE TOOK IT UP
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
AND FOUGHT FOR LEGISLATION
AGAINST SLAVERY

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
FOR MANY YEARS THEREAFTER.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
BUT IT WAS MAINLY
THROUGH JOHN NEWTON

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
TALKING ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCE
OF THE SLAVE TRADE

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
THAT THE IMPORTANT AND
INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE IN LONDON

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
CAME TO REALIZE
THAT IT WAS NOT GOOD.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
WITH OUR SHIPS, THE GREAT
 OBJECT IS TO BE FULL.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.000
THE CARGO OF A VESSEL OF
 100 TONS OR A LITTLE MORE

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
IS CALCULATED TO PURCHASE
 FROM 220 TO 250 SLAVES

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
FOR THE SLAVES LIE IN TWO ROWS,
 ONE ABOVE THE OTHER

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
ON EACH SIDE OF THE SHIP

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
CLOSE TO EACH OTHER,
 LIKE BOOKS UPON A SHELF.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I HAVE KNOWN THEM SO CLOSE

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
THAT THE SHELF WOULD NOT
 EASILY CONTAIN ONE MORE

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
AND I HAVE KNOWN A WHITE MAN
 SENT DOWN AMONG THE MEN

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
TO LAY THEM IN THESE ROWS
 TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
SO THAT AS LITTLE SPACE
 AS POSSIBLE MIGHT BE LOST.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I WRITE FROM MEMORY, AFTER AN
 INTERVAL OF MORE THAN 30 YEARS.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I BELIEVE

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000
MANY THINGS WHICH I SAW,
 HEARD AND FELT

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
UPON THE COAST OF AFRICA

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000
ARE SO DEEPLY
 ENGRAVEN IN MY MEMORY

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
THAT I CAN HARDLY FORGET,
 OR GREATLY MISTAKE THEM.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Cooke:
I ALWAYS THINK THAT THE LINE,
"SAV'D A WRETCH LIKE ME"

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
WAS NOT ONLY VERY TRUE
TO THE 18th CENTURY

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
WHEN THAT SORT OF LANGUAGE
WOULD HAVE BEEN USED

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
BUT HE REALLY SAW
HIMSELF AS A WRETCH.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
THE WAY HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF
AS BEING "VILER THAN ANYTHING"

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
TIES IN WITH FEELINGS ABOUT
HIMSELF AS BEING A SINNER.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
TO BE INSCRIBED UPON MY DEATH:

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
JOHN NEWTON, CLERK, ONCE
 AN INFIDEL AND LIBERTINE

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
A SERVANT OF SLAVES IN AFRICA

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:35.000
WAS, BY THE RICH MERCY OF OUR
 LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS CHRIST

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
PRESERVED, RESTORED, PARDONED

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
AND APPOINTED
 TO PREACH THE FAITH

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
HE HAD LONG LABORED TO DESTROY.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:04.000
( piano playing
 "Amazing Grace" )

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Marion Williams:
AMAZING GRACE WAS NOT WRITTEN
TO GAIN MONEY.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
IT WAS WRITTEN FROM THE SOUL.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
YOU CAN SING THIS SONG
ANY STYLE.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:36.000
* I WAS YOUNG *

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
* BUT I RECALL... *

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
THIS IS THE BLACK WAY
OF SINGING IT.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.000
* SINGING SONGS... *

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
BLACK GOSPEL.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:58.000
* WAS MY MOTHER'S JOY *

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:16.000
* AS THE SHADOWS GATHERED
AT THE CLOSE OF DAY *

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:30.000
* AS I SAT UPON HER KNEES *

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
* IN THOSE DAYS-- *

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
THERE WERE SOME GOOD DAYS--

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
* THAT USED TO BE *

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:58.000
* AS SHE SANG OF GOD'S
MERCY AND GRACE *

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:12.000
* A-A-AMA... *

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
* ...ZING *

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000
* GRACE *

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:29.000
* HOW... HOW SWEET... *

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:38.000
* HOW SWEET,
HOW SWEET THE SOUND *

01:08:38.000 --> 01:09:01.000
* THAT SAVED
A WRETCH LIKE ME. *

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:16.000
* I ONCE WAS LOST, HALLELUJAH *

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:30.000
* BUT RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW,
RIGHT NOW, YEA, I'M FOUND *

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:52.000
* I... I WAS BLIND
BUT NOW I SEE. *

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Ritchie:
WHEN I ASKED MY MOTHER

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:13.000
WHY THESE OLD SONGS WERE SO
SAD AND MOURNFUL SOUNDING--

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
THIS WAS WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL--

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
SHE SAID, "WELL, HONEY, THEY'RE
NOT SAD, THEY'RE REVERENT."

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
SHE SAID, "YOU GET SO MUCH
MORE JOY OUT OF A SONG

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
WHEN YOU RELISH THE NOTES
AND SAVOR THE TUNE."

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Moyers:
WHAT IS IT

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
THAT HOLDS A FAMILY
LIKE THIS TOGETHER?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:39.000
WELL, THAT'S HARD TO SAY.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
IT'S MEMORIES, I THINK,
IT'S SHARED MEMORIES

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:46.000
SHARED REALITY, SHARED VALUES.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
AND FOR US, IT'S THE SHARED
SONGS AND THE MUSIC

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
THAT REALLY DO STRIKE THOSE
CHORDS INSIDE OF EACH OF US.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Many voices:
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT
MY HEART TO FEAR... *

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Woman:
EVERY YEAR DURING THE REUNION

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
WE GO UP ON THE LITTLE
COMMUNITY GRAVEYARD

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
WHICH IS ABOVE OUR HOUSE
AROUND A HILLSIDE.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000
AND KIND OF SHARE THE REUNION
WITH THE ONES THAT HAVE GONE ON.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
MY SISTER UNA, WHO WAS BORN
IN 1900, DIED LAST YEAR

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
AND SHE IS BURIED UP THERE.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
WE HAVEN'T HAD A MEMORIAL
SERVICE FOR HER YET.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
* ...I FIRST BELIEVED. *

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Woman:
THROUGH MANY DANGERS,
TOILS AND SNARES...

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:43.000
All:
* THROUGH MANY DANGERS,
TOILS AND SNARES *

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I HAVE ALREADY COME...

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:51.000
* I HAVE ALREADY COME *

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
'TWAS GRACE THAT
LED ME SAFE THUS FAR...

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:02.000
* 'TWAS GRACE THAT
LED ME SAFE THUS FAR *

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:10.000
* AND GRACE WILL LEAD... *

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Norman:
THERE'S A KIND OF WONDERFUL CALM
THAT I FEEL WHEN I SING THIS...

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
A KIND OF UNCOMPLICATED
FEELING.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
I MEAN, THE WAY
ONE FELT AS A CHILD.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE VERSE?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000
IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE,
I SUPPOSE I WOULD CHOOSE

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
"THROUGH MANY DANGERS,
TOILS AND SNARES"

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
BECAUSE IT HAS SUCH HOPE
AT THE END.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I'VE GOTTEN THIS FAR,
BECAUSE OF GRACE

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
AND GRACE WILL TAKE ME
THE REST OF THE WAY

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
HOWEVER LONG, OR THROUGH
WHATEVER DANGER...

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000
WHATEVER COMPLEXITIES
I'LL HAVE TO GET THROUGH.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
THE SAME THING THAT HAS
BROUGHT ME THIS FAR

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
IS GOING TO CARRY ME
THE REST OF THE WAY.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
I LIKE THAT.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
YOUR LIFE

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SO BLESSED

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
THAT IT'S HARD TO THINK
OF DANGERS, SNARES AND TOILS...

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000
OH, BUT I'M AFRAID THOSE
THINGS ARE IN EVERY LIFE

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
WHATEVER IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN IT IS
VERY DIFFICULT, I THINK

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
FOR MOST PEOPLE,
FOR WHATEVER REASONS

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
FOR REASONS OF OUR OWN CREATION,
IMAGINED THINGS, I DON'T KNOW--

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
BUT NOT EVERY MOMENT IS ONE OF
LIGHT AND ENERGY AND HAPPINESS.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:44.000
* THROUGH MANY DANGERS,
TOILS AND SNARES *

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:58.000
* I HAVE ALREADY COME *

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:15.000
* 'TIS GRACE HATH BROUGHT ME
SAFE THUS FAR *

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:29.000
* AND GRACE WILL LEAD ME HOME. *

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Moyers:
THERE'S A VERSE I HAD
NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE:

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
"WE LAY OUR GARMENTS BY...

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
UPON OUR BEDS
TO REST."
...BEDS TO REST."

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:38.000
YOU REMEMBER
THAT ONE?

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
MM-HMM.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I LOVE THAT LINE--

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
"THOUGH DEATH MAY SOON
DISROBE US ALL"

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
"OF WHAT WE NOW POSSESS."

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
YOU'D HEARD
THAT BEFORE?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
OH, YES.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
THOSE ARE NOT NEWTON'S VERSES.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
NO.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
A HYMN TAKES ON
A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
OH, IT DOES.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
IT SHOWS WHAT A WONDERFUL
THING THIS IS.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
IT IS SOMEHOW,
IT'S MORE THAN A SONG--

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.000
THAT PEOPLE WOULD STILL
GO ON WRITING VERSES

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
FOR THIS MELODY.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000
IT'S KIND OF AMAZING.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
OUT OF THEIR LIFE.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
EXACTLY.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.000
AMAZING GRACE!
 HOW SWEET THE SOUND

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
THAT SAVED A WRETCH LIKE ME.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.000
I ONCE WAS LOST,
 BUT NOW AM FOUND

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
'TWAS GRACE THAT TAUGHT
