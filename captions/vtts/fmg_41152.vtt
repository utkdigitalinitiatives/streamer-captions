FIRST OYSTER?

- I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD,
ON A BEACH IN PORTUGAL.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:18.430
MY DAD MANAGED TO GET ONE
OFF A FISHERMAN FOR ME.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.930
IT SCARED THE HELL OUT
OF ME, BUT ONCE I ATE IT,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.330
IT CHANGED MY LIFE.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.300

ORGY FOR THE FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.900
IT WAS INCREDIBLE!
COULDN'T STOP EATING.

TO HIS VERY GREAT CREDIT
THE TEACHER WENT ALONG

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.360
AND ATE IT WITH ME.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.630
EVER SINCE I'VE LOVED
THE CRUNCH OF TINY,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.460
LITTLE BIRD BONES
IN MY MOUTH.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.230

ALL ABOUT TASTE, SMELL -

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.530
IT IS, BUT IT'S NOT.
IT'S ALSO ABOUT SOUND.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:13.600
SO YOU'RE THE REASON SPARROWS
ARE DYING OUT IN ENGLAND?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.460

TELLY THE OTHER NIGHT.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.400

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.860
RABBIT STUFFED WITH BLACK
PUDDING, WRAPPED WITH PARMA HAM.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.530
THAT'S MINE.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.360
THEY'RE ALWAYS YOURS,
JOE. JEALOUS?

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.630
ACTUALLY, I GOT THAT DISH
FROM A MAD OLD CRONE

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.200
HALF-WAY UP A MOUNTAIN
IN CAMBRIA, SO...

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.000
IT'S NOT MY IDEA.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
DID I ASK FOR ICE? I
DIDN'T ASK FOR ICE.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.260
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.360
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.430
IT WAS LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN
- AND TO MEET YOU.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.300
ARE THEY HERE?

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.200
DUNCAN! I WAS JUST SAYING
GOOD NIGHT TO THOSE PEOPLE.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.930
BILLY AND JOE HAVE GONE FOR A
WIND-DOWN VODKA, BUT THERE IS A

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.960
CUSTOMER WHO'D LIKE TO THANK THE
CHEF FOR HIS COOKING TONIGHT.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.130
WHO?

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.200
A REGULAR WHO REGULARLY
BUYS $400 BOTTLES OF WINE.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.730
I LOVE HIM ALREADY.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.630
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.060
WHAT?

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.000
JOE SHOULD BE
THE FIRST TO HEAR.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.760
OH, DUNCAN,
COME ON. TELL ME.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.000
I'LL SETTLE FOR NOTHING
LESS THAN MARRIAGE.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.230
ACTUALLY, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT SQUID?

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.230
WHAT DO YOU LOVE
ABOUT SQUID?

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.230
THE NAME. NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.500
IT JUST APPEARED ONE DAY
IN THE 17TH CENTURY.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:46.460
IT'S LIKE GOD, RIGHT, PARTED
THE HEAVENS, REACHED DOWN

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.800
AND SAID "HERE YOU
ARE, PEOPLE. SQUID."

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.230
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.930
SQUID.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.460
(LAUGHTER)

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:19.300
(LOUD BEEPING)

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:25.060
JUMP!

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:29.960
BILLY! BILLY? YOU
ALRIGHT, BILLY?

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.000
YEAH.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU
COULD HAVE KILLED US!

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.960
YOU'RE JOE MACBETH.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.800
HOW DID YOU
KNOW MY NAME?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.630
WE KNOW EVERYTHING.
WE'RE BINMEN.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.260
NOTHING WE
DON'T KNOW.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.030
TWINKLE, TWINKLE
LITTLE STAR

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.430
HOW I WONDER
WHAT YOU'S ARE

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.830
THREE OF THEM, JOE.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.260
THREE MICHELIN STARS
COMING YOUR WAY.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.130
AND THAT'S NOT
ALL. OH, NO.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.330
THE RESTAURANT, THE
WHOLE CABOODLE.

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.160
IT'S GONNA BE
YOURS, JOE.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.330
OH, YEAH. WHAT
ABOUT ME?

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.900
LESS HAPPY
THAN HIM.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.560
AND YET MORE
HAPPY.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.630
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.460
JOE GETS EVERYTHING
AND YOU DON'T.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.660
BUT YOUR SON DOES.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:12.200
AND HIS SON...

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.360
AND HIS SON

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.160
AND HIS SON

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:21.130
♪ AND HIS SON, AND HIS
SON, AND HIS SON ♪

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.200
(SINGING)

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.330
DUNCAN?

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.630
LOOK AT YOU TWO.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.360
A PAIR OF WILD BOYS.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.200
YOU'RE LIKE SONS TO
ME, YOU KNOW THAT.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.230
WE ARE ON
HALLOWED GROUND.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.660
ONLY THREE RESTAURANTS IN
BRITAIN HAVE WHAT WE HAVE.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.630
NO.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.900
OH, YES.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.500
MY GOD, HAVE WE...?

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.200
THEY CALLED ME
THIS EVENING.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.900
WE ARE STANDING IN A
THREE-STAR RESTAURANT.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.400
THREE BIG BEAUTIFUL
MICHELIN STARS.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.300
MY MA WOKE ME UP
TWICE IN MY CHILDHOOD

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.000
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.300
ONCE TO SEE NEIL ARMSTRONG STEP
OUT ONTO THE SURFACE OF THE MOON

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.300
AND ONCE TO WATCH MY FATHER
SLIP INTO THE PIG SHED AT DAWN

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.630
AND PUT A KNIFE INTO
A SLEEPING TAMWORTH.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.630
I SAID "DOES THE KILLING OF
THE PIG WHILE IT'S ASLEEP

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.060
MAKE IT AN EASIER
DEATH, MA?"

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.900
SHE KNEW THE ANSWER
I WANTED TO HEAR

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.800
BUT SHE DIDN'T
GIVE IT TO ME.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:39.100
"THE MEAT TASTES BETTER IF THE
DEATH IS LESS STRESSFUL".

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.700
IT WAS A RITE
OF PASSAGE.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.430
I KNEW THEN HOW
IMPORTANT FOOD WAS

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.460
AND HOW YOU HAVE TO
BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT IT.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.900
I SAID TO MY FATHER AFTERWARDS
"CAN I GO INTO LONG TROUSERS?"

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.930
AND HE LAUGHED AND
PUNCHED ME ON THE ARM.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.000
I'VE BEEN OUT OF
SHORTS EVER SINCE.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.630
THAT'S A VERY
BEAUTIFUL STORY.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.060
I OWE A LOT TO
MY OLD MAN.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.300
AND TO YOU, JOE.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.160
MY FATHER TAUGHT ME
AND I TAUGHT YOU.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.030
IT'LL BE A GREAT LEGACY
TO LEAVE TO MALCOLM

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.160
WHEN THE RESTAURANT
BECOMES HIS.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.000
YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE KNOWN
THIS YORK? FIFTEEN YEARS.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.230
FIFTEEN YEARS
ON MONDAY.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.900
THERE'S ONE WORD TO
DESCRIBE HIM AS A WAITER.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.230
IT'S UNHEARD OF
AMONGST ENGLISHMEN.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.030
HE'S FRENCH.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.160
ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER,
ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS,

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.930
AND HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW
THE NAMES OF MY CHILDREN.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.060
CHILDREN? YOU
HAVE CHILDREN?

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.460
THE CHILDREN YOU'RE
GODFATHER TO.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.230
A WORD, JOE...

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.500
WE'LL CELEBRATE
TOMORROW NIGHT.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.300
HAVE A GUEST ROOM
MADE UP FOR ME.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.600
IF IT'S HALF THE NIGHT
I THINK IT'LL BE...

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.400
I WON'T SEE ANYTHING
OF THE FOLLOWING DAY.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.560
HOW'S HE GETTING
ON - MALCOLM?

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.100
FINE, FINE, FINE.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.060
YOU WOULDN'T
LIE TO ME?

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:07.260
WOULD I LIE TO YOU?

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.630
HE DOESN'T HAVE IT
IN HIS BLOOD, JOE.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:11.660
HE WAS A VEGETARIAN
FOR A YEAR.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.400
GOD FORGIVE HIM, A SON
OF MINE, CAN YOU IMAGINE?

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.730
I'M TRUSTING YOU
WITH MY SON.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.560
HE NEEDS A
TRANSFUSION.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.660
GIVE HIM THAT, WILL YOU?

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.960
MAKE HIM FEEL
HOW YOU FEEL.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.430
I KNOW I CAN
RELY ON YOU.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.000
OF COURSE, IF I GO
UNDER A BUS TONIGHT

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.500
THE BOY WON'T BE READY AND
THE PLACE WILL BE YOURS.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.960
I'M ON MY WAY, ELLA.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.730
YOU DON'T GO ANYWHERE
BUT IN YOUR MERCEDES.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:45.500
CHANCES OF YOU BEING RUN
OVER BY A BUS ARE ZERO.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.200
TOMORROW NIGHT.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.760
COOK ME A FEAST.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.630
BILLY.

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:00.130
WEIRD NIGHT.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.400
AYE.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.760
STILL 48 HOURS
AND NO SLEEP.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.260
NO WONDER THINGS
ARE A BIT WEIRD.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:14.130
YOU SHOULD
GO HOME.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.900
HE'S MORE LIKE A
HAIRDRESSER THAN A CHEF.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.260
EVERYTHING WE'VE BUILT HERE
IS GONNA GO TO A HAIRDRESSER.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.530
WHAT DOES MALCOLM
CARE ABOUT FOOD?

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.630
I HATE THE INJUSTICE.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.230
ONE STAR TO THREE
IN TWO YEARS

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.360
AND HOW MANY SHIFTS HAS
DUNCAN DONE IN THAT TIME?

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.530
NOT MANY.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:40.960
YOU'VE WORKED SO, SO HARD TO
MAKE THIS PLACE WHAT IT IS

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.830
AND WHO'S FACE IS GONNA BE IN
THE PAPERS TOMORROW, JOE?

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.230
NOT YOURS.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.000
THREE-STAR
DUNCAN DOCHERTY.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.960
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU GONNA LET IT GO?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:05.160
THEY SAID... THEY SAID
WE'D GET THREE STARS.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.530
THAT'S AMAZING.
ANYTHING ELSE?

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.030
YES.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.860
WHAT, JOE?

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.430
THEY SAID IT
WOULD ALL BE MINE.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.630
WAS BILLY THERE?

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.730
YEAH.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.330
WHAT TIME IS IT?

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.760
IT'S ALMOST 3:00. DUNCAN'S
STAYING HERE TONIGHT.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.900
TONIGHT? YOU MEAN
TOMORROW, DON'T YOU?

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.800
NO, IT'S FRIDAY NOW. IT'S EASY
TO FORGET WHICH NIGHT'S WHICH

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.030
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING BACK TO
BACK 18-HOUR SHIFTS, ISN'T IT?

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.400
CHEFS DON'T SLEEP,
THAT'S PART OF IT.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.560
HE MILKS YOU FOR
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.300
AND HE PAYS YOU IN
CHARM AND BLARNEY.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.200
HE PAYS ME
GOOD MONEY!

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.100
JOE, HE KNOWS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY
COVERS WHAT YOU DO FOR HIM

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.130
SO HE BULLSHITS YOU WITH
ALL HIS BACKSLAPPING

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.200
AND HIS SENTIMENT
- AND YOU BUY IT.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.360
ELLA, DON'T.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.160
YOU'RE TOO FULL OF THE MILK
OF HUMAN KINDNESS, JOE.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.760
"THANK YOU, DUNCAN,
FOR THE SLAP ON THE BACK.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.500
I'M SO VERY,
VERY GRATEFUL".

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.400
IS IT SHAMING TO
HEAR THE TRUTH, JOE?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:20.430
WHAT KIND OF MAN IS IT WHO
DOESN'T FEEL HUMILIATED

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.030
IN THE POSITION
YOU'RE IN?

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.330
WHAT MAN IS THAT?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.800
JOE?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.260
STOP!

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.430
HE'LL BE DRUNK.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.430
HE'LL BE DRUNK ON
HIS OWN SUCCESS.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:03.900
HE'LL BE IN ONE OF THE
GUEST ROOMS, ASLEEP.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.200
DON'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.800
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM ABOUT
YOUR BINMEN, DID YOU?

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.330
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
BECAUSE YOU'RE THINKING

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.100
WHAT I'M THINKING.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.930
I CAN READ YOUR
FACE LIKE A BOOK.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.600
MEN DON'T GET RUN
OVER BY BUSES.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.030
NO.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.260
MORNING, ELLA!

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.160
HI BOYS!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.500
SACK THEM.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.760
WHAT FOR?

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.130
I DON'T KNOW - BEING
BAD AT WASHING UP?

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.360
JOE?

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.500
GOOD. BILLY, TASTE THAT.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.330
WHAT ABOUT LUNCH?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.960
WHO THE HELL ARE THEY?

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.530
ELLA: TOP CLASS
WASHER UPPERS.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.460
WHERE ARE
THEY FROM?

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.700
THE 11TH CENTURY.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.260
ALSO KNOWN AS THE
FORMER YUGOSLAVIA.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:04.000
YOU ALRIGHT, CHAPS?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.660
RIGHT, UH... YOU TWO
ARE ON YOUR BIKES.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.930
WHY?

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.530
YOU JUST ARE.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.200
WHAT'D WE
DO WRONG?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.660
I NEED WASHING UPPERS
WITH AMBITION, SO...

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.160
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.600
DO YOU WANT TO BE A
GREAT CHEF ONE DAY?

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.830
NO.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.660
I WANT TO BE A POET.

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.160
I WANT TO SEE
THE WORLD.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.800
EXACTLY. GO WORK IN
A SANDWICH BAR.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:37.930
GO WORK IN A
SANDWICH BAR IN NEPAL

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.330
AND YOU WRITE POETRY.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.360
TAKE IT BEFORE I
CHANGE MY MIND.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.830
THANKS CHEF!

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:49.230
ALRIGHT, GO ON.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.130
I THOUGHT YOU
LIKED POETRY.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.930
IT'S A RESTAURANT, BILLY.
PEOPLE GET SACKED.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.360
AH!

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.360
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.360
GET THIS CLEANED UP.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.460
...AND THEY GO ON THE MAGNETIC
STRIP IN THE KITCHEN.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:51.760
THIS IS IT, JOE.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.030
TONIGHT'S AS
GOOD AS IT GETS.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.530
DON'T FORGET
TO ENJOY.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.760
THE OLD MAN'S
ON HIS WAY.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.300
ALRIGHT, ONE MULLET,
TABLE FOUR!

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.160
THREE WILD SALMON,
TABLE SIX!

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.530
CAN I BORROW ONE
OF THE NEW BOYS?

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:17.830
YEAH.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:22.430
SLOBODAN,
YOU'RE WITH ELLA.

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.630
NOT MUCH POETRY
IN THOSE TWO.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.960
THEY'RE CHEAP, BILLY.
THEY'RE CHEAP.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.000
ALRIGHT, BOYS, LISTEN UP!

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.530
CHOPPED LIVER ON TOAST, BONE
MARROW, CHOCOLATE SAUCE.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.400
EVERYTHING WE DO BEST,
EVERYTHING WE DO SIMPLY.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.800
CHEF!

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.730
I WANT DUNCAN DOCHERTY TO
EAT THE MEAL OF HIS LIFE.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:44.300
THE DOG'S BOLLOCKS,
LET'S GO!

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.500
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING AT?

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.700
YOU COOK THE
BOLLOCKS OF DOGS?

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.530
UH, PIGS, YES. DOGS, NO.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.100
NOT A BAD
IDEA THOUGH.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.160
PRIVATE DINING ROOM'S
ALL SET UP FOR YOU.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.500
THAT'S GRAND.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.730
YOU KNOW WHAT I
HATE ABOUT THESE?

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.000
THE HAVOC THEY PLAY WITH
THE LINE OF YOUR SUIT.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.560
THAT'S WHY ITALIAN MEN ARE
OUT THERE CARRYING HANDBAGS:

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.200
NO BULGES IN
THEIR ARMANI.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:35.230
WELL, IN YOU
GO, FOLKS.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.830
MY GOD, I'VE COME A LONG
WAY FROM THE TURF BOG

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.000
AND THE POTATO.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.060
WHAT WOULD MY
MA SAY, ELLA?

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.860
SHE'D BE VERY,
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.830
I THINK SHE WOULD.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:56.730
YOU SEND YOUR HUSBAND
IN TO SEE ME.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.260
HOLD THESE A MINUTE.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.500
TAKE THIS UP TO
THE GUEST ROOM.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.330
GREEN DOOR, TOP
OF THE STAIRS.

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:09.930
HE LIKES A DRAM
BEFORE LIGHTS OUT.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.600
TWO RABBIT, ONE MARROW,
TABLE 7, WHAT'S MY NAME?

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.500
CHEF!

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.930
TWO MINUTES.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.560
YOU SAID "TWO MINUTES" TWO
MINUTES AGO. COME ON!

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.330
NO, NO, NO, MOVE!

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.760
THERE, GO!

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.630
DAD'S GONNA LOVE IT.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.430
ISN'T IT YOUR NIGHT OFF?

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.500
FIRST NIGHT AS A
THREE-STAR MICHELIN

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.300
I THOUGHT I SHOULD
BE HERE BASICALLY.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.800
DUNCAN WANTS
TO SEE YOU.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.300
GET THOSE READY
FOR TABLE FIVE.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.030
JOE?

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.260
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.830
I CAN'T SEE HIM! OKAY?

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.730
WON'T BE DOING ALL THAT
LATER ON, WILL YA?

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.130
NO, NO, RODDY STOP.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.130
IF IT GETS UPSET BEFORE YOU PUT
HIM IN THE PAN, WHAT HAPPENS?

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.200
IT DOESN'T TASTE RIGHT.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.260
RESPECT, RODDY.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.300
KEEP HIM CALM.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:48.260
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
GONNA BE JUST FINE.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.000
YOU ALRIGHT?

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.230
AYE. I AM FINE.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.200
WHERE IS HE?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.460
HE WANTS TO STAY
DOWNSTAIRS.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.200
YOU KNOW WHAT
HE'S LIKE.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.660
BECAUSE IT'S YOU HE WANTS TO
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S PERFECT.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.260
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ARE
ENJOYING A CULINARY EXPERIENCE

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.360
SECOND TO ONLY ONE.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.230
WHAT IS IT?

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.300
PEOPLE ARE ASKING
TO SEE THE CHEF.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.460
DO I HAVE TIME BEFORE
THE MAIN COURSE?

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.760
I'LL CHECK.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.660
NOBODY BUT NOBODY COMES
BETWEEN ME AND MY BONE MARROW.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.730
CHEF?

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:34.130
EXCELLENT. VERY GOOD.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.060
TEN MINUTES.
PLENTY OF TIME.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.400
ARE YOU SURE NOW?

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.060
FROM THE
HORSE'S MOUTH.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.960
YOU'VE EARNED
THIS MOMENT.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.700
I HAVE, HAVEN'T I?

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.800
ABSOLUTELY.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.500
WAIT!

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.760
WHAT?

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.100
COME HERE.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.130
WHAT?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.560
THERE. NOW YOU'RE
THE REAL THING.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:24.200
HOT AND BLOODY AND
STRAIGHT FROM THE STOVE.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.130
EVERYTHING THAT
PEOPLE WANT IN A CHEF.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:29.900
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THIS WOMAN?

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:37.400
SHE HAS MASSIVE
BOLLOCKS.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.760
THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.600
SERVICE!

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.060
GOOD BOY, JOHNNY.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.730
ALL HE DOES IS GO UP AND
DOWN STAIRS WITH A TRAY.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.560
IT'S A SKILL HE
LEARNED IN FELTHAM.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.400
CALM YOURSELF.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.960
TAKE THIS MARROW FOR
DUNCAN'S PARTY, ON YOU GO.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.600
DUNCAN'S ON
WALKABOUT.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.260
WHERE HAS HE GONE?

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.630
OUT ON THE FLOOR. TEN
MINUTES AT LEAST.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.260
UNDER THE LIGHTS,
JOHNNY BOY.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.600
NO!

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.900
YOU CAN'T KEEP PERFECTION UNDER
THE LIGHT FOR TEN MINUTES.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.760
THESE ARE READY
NOW. START AGAIN!

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.230
IS HE SERIOUS?

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.560
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
FIRST STARTED

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.330
YOU'D COME HOME WITH
YOUR HANDS ALL PUFFED UP?

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.400
I WAS HANDLING LANGOUSTINE
WITH OPEN CUTS.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.660
DO YOU REMEMBER I
WOKE UP ONE MORNING

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.100
AND MY HANDS WERE IN
BUCKETS OF ANTISEPTIC?

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:30.100
YOU WERE SO TIRED I COULD PUT
YOUR HANDS IN BUCKETS OF ICE

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.730
AND YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE NOTICED.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.730
YOU WERE GENTLE.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.330
YOU'VE DONE THIS.

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.530
YOU'RE A KNIFE MAN, JOE.
YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.930
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE A THING
LIKE THIS. HOW CAN YOU?

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.430
IT'S ALL SET UP.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:31:01.060
YOU DO THIS AND WE
WIN EVERYTHING.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.330
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS
TO LOVE A BABY, JOE.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.630
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO HAVE
A BABY FEED AT MY BREAST.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.700
ELLA...

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.660
THERE WAS A SMILE,
WASN'T THERE?

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:19.030
WELL, WE SAID
THERE WAS.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:26.600
HIS ONE MOMENT OF REAL LIFE
BEFORE HE WENT AWAY.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.800
I GAVE HIM THAT.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.030
VERY GOOD BOYS, FINISH UP!

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.660
BEAUTIFUL.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:22.760
HUSH. LISTEN.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:30.860
IN ANOTHER LIFE I'D
MAKE A PASS AT YOU.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.830
IN ANOTHER LIFE
I'LL LET YOU.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.430
BEWITCHING WOMAN.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.800
SLEEP WELL, CHEF.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.500
RODDY!

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.800
YES, CHEF?

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.560
GO HOME.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.760
YES, CHEF.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.160
MALCOLM, YOU WORKED
WELL TONIGHT. GO HOME.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.160
WE COOKED LIKE THREE-STAR
CHEFS TONIGHT.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.760
DOESN'T MATTER THAT NO ONE
KNOWS IT'S US AND NOT HIM.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.900
WE KNOW, THAT'S
WHAT COUNTS.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.400
ABSOLUTELY.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.600
DRINK OR SLEEP?

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:27.860
(PHONE ALARM)

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.360
IS THAT YOUR
LITTLE CODE?

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.660
SHE'S SUMMONING YOU
TO THE BEDROOM?

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.700
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.960
SO NEITHER THEN?

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.500
NEITHER WHAT, BILLY?

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.260
DRINK OR SLEEP.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.730
WHATEVER. BLUE
ROOM'S FREE, YEAH?

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:45.830
DUNCAN'S SLEEPING
IN THE GREEN ROOM.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.360
NIGHT THEN, JOE.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.430
NIGHT, BILLY.

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:52.330
YOU TWO GO
HOME AS WELL.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.030
THANK YOU.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.800
BRIGHT AND EARLY
TOMORROW MORNING THOUGH.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:29.900
<i>HELLO? HELLO?</i>

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:37.060
<i>GORAN? GORAN?</i>

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.430
HI, DO YOU HAVE ANYONE BY
THE NAME OF DRAGAN ANCOVIC

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.100
OR GORAN BOBEC
LIVING WITH YOU?

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.530
I'M FROM
IMMIGRATION.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:30.230
(CHANTING)

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:45.400
(CHANTING)

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:56.360
(HOWLING)

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.030
HE OPENED HIS EYES AND
TOOK HOLD OF MY HAND

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:00.660
AS IF I WAS GOING
TO HELP HIM.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:02.830
HE THOUGHT THAT
I COULD HELP HIM.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.660
HE THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO HELP HIM.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.930
MY HAND IS
BLEEDING AGAIN.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.760
HE GRABBED ONTO ME
SO TIGHT THAT...

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.560
IS YOUR BLOOD
ON THE KNIFE?

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.930
JOE, IS YOUR BLOOD
ON THE KNIFE?

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.060
I DON'T KNOW!

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.900
OKAY. OKAY, THIS
IS WHAT YOU DO.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.730
YOU GO
DOWNSTAIRS.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.830
YOU PUT THE GLOVES AND THE
KNIFE INTO THE BINS OUTSIDE.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.260
DO YOU HEAR?
YOU DO IT NOW.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.860
IT HAS TO BE BEFORE
THE BINMEN COME.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:32.030
THEN YOU GET THE OTHER
PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.260
AND A SECOND KNIFE
FROM THE KITCHEN

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.500
AND BRING THEM
UP HERE. GO.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.030
GO, LET'S GO.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.100
(LAUGHTER)

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.860
I CAN'T GO BACK
IN THERE.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.130
ELLA, I CAN'T!

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:31.760
THE FIRST KNIFE KILLED HIM BUT
THEY'LL FIND THE SECOND KNIFE.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.530
WITH HIS
BLOOD ON IT.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.030
THEY CAN TELL.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.200
THEY'LL KNOW THAT
THAT KNIFE DIDN'T...

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:42.160
DIDN'T GO INTO...

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:49.230
OH, MY GOD. YOU...

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:53.330
I TOLD YOU. WE'RE
IN THIS TOGETHER.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:55.730
HE WAS DEAD.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:42:00.330
SO IT WAS
EASIER FOR ME.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:25.330
ELLA: A LITTLE WATER
AND WE'RE CLEAN.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.130
(DOOR SLAMMING)

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.530
WHAT
WAS THAT?

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:33.460
WHAT?

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.900
SOMEONE COMING
IN DOWNSTAIRS.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.030
WHAT TIME
IS IT?

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.430
IT'S MORNING.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:46.330
ALREADY?

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.930
YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:53.100
I'LL NEVER
SLEEP AGAIN.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.960
LISTEN TO ME.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.330
YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP, AND NOW
IT'S JUST AN ORDINARY MORNING.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.100
NOTHING'S HAPPENED.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:09.630
GO DOWNSTAIRS AND
TALK TO WHOEVER IT IS.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:14.300
GOOD. GO.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.760
IS HE AWAKE?

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.200
WHAT TIME IS IT?

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.430
SIX.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.000
I SLEPT IN.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.530
BEATS A HANGOVER.

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.500
IS THE OLD MAN OFF?

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.160
NO, HE'S...

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.830
WHERE IS HE?

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.530
MAYBE WE SHOULD
LEAVE HIM.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.700
DOES HE EVEN NEED
TO BE AWAKE YET?

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.260
HE ASKED ME
TO WAKE HIM.

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:34.030
HE WANTS TO DISCUSS
THE WINE LIST

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.800
BEFORE HE DOES HIS
PRESS INTERVIEWS.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.100
THEY CAN'T GET
ENOUGH OF HIM.

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.500
PEASANT IRISH BOY, TOAST OF THE
CULINARY WORLD AND ALL THAT.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.060
SO, WHICH
ROOM IS HE IN?

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:46.560
DARLING, WHICH
ROOM IS DUNCAN IN?

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.660
UH, GREEN ROOM.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:52.830
WHAT A NIGHT.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:56.300
DID YOU HEAR THE
HOWLING MAN?

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.500
I DID.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:58.930
MY GOD.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.330
HOWLING AT WHAT?

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.530
HOWLING, THAT'S
WHAT HE DOES.

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:10.200
COFFEE ANYONE?

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.600
PETER? YOU ALRIGHT?

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:19.030
PETER?

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:23.300
HE'S DEAD.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.960
STABBED.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.160
WHAT?

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.260
MURDERED?

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.230
HERE?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
THEY'LL SEE I'VE DONE
TIME FOR VIOLENCE

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.960
AND THEN THEY'LL
COME FOR ME.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.330
YOU'LL BE FINE.

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.200
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:50.860
THEY'LL MAKE THE FACTS FIT WITH
IT BEING ME. IT'S WHAT THEY DO.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.530
I'M TELLING YOU IT'S
GOING TO BE FINE.

00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.560
I PUT MY KNIFE
IN A MAN.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.900
YOU'VE PAID FOR IT.
IT'S OVER.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.860
YOU THINK THEY
EVER THINK THAT?

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:05.930
YOU'VE DONE YOUR TIME IN
JAIL. YOUR SLATE'S CLEAN.

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:10.730
THAT'S THE WAY IT
WORKS, ISN'T IT?

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:15.330
ISN'T IT?

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:19.100
IT NEVER
LEAVES YOU.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.130
THERE HE IS.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.760
THE LOCKER ROOM.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.200
YEAH.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.800
THE BOYS RULE
THE KITCHEN.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.460
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,
YOU COOKS AND US COPPERS.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.760
DO A LOT OF DRUGS?

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.760
SOME, YOU?

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.160
WHO DO YOU THINK
DID THE OLD MAN?

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.100
WOULD YOU STOP
CALLING HIM THAT?

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.560
I'M A GOOD LISTENER.
PICK THINGS UP QUICKLY.

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.430
YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:08.060
IF I'D HAVE DIED AN HOUR
BEFORE DUNCAN DOCHERTY

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:13.760
I'D HAVE DIED
A HAPPY MAN.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:25.560
NOW IT'S AS IF EVERYTHING THAT
WAS IMPORTANT IN LIFE IS GONE.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:31.960
NOTHING CAN EVER
BE SERIOUS AGAIN.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:38.000
(PHONE RINGING)

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.400
I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPRESS MY
SADNESS AT WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:52.430
THIS IS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE
TRAGEDY AND ANYONE...

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:57.360
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS UNSPEAKABLE CRIME

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.330
MUST COME FORWARD.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:05.630
<i>WHAT DOES THE DEATH OF DUNCAN
DOCHERTY MEAN TO YOU?</i>

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:11.630
IT'S AS THOUGH EVERYTHING THAT
WAS IMPORTANT HAS GONE...

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.330
OUT OF LIFE.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:18.060
AND NOTHING CAN EVER
BE SERIOUS AGAIN.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.400
<i>SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THE RESTAURANT?</i>

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:28.230
THIS RESTAURANT WAS
DUNCAN'S PRIDE AND JOY.

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:33.060
HE WAS EXTREMELY PROUD
OF WHAT HE ACHIEVED HERE.

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:40.560
AND WE WILL BE OPEN TONIGHT IN
HONOR OF DUNCAN DOCHERTY.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.530
IT'S WHAT HE WOULD
HAVE WANTED

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:46.900
AND WHAT HE WOULD
HAVE EXPECTED.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.660
AMAZING WOMAN.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:51.500
AMAZING.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.930
I'M SORRY.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:57.530
<i>JUST ONE MORE
QUESTION, PLEASE.</i>

00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.200
<i>THE FIRST MAN IS SIX FEET TALL,
LATE 20'S AND DARK BROWN HAIR.</i>

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.400
<i>HE SPEAKS WITH A
HEAVY SERBIAN ACCENT.</i>

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.900
<i>THE SECOND MAN WE WANT TO TALK
TO IS TWO OR THREE INCHES TALLER</i>

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.500
<i>WITH A SHAVED HEAD.</i>

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.360
<i>HE'S HEAVIER THAN THE FIRST
MAN, PROBABLY 14 STONE.</i>

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.200
<i>THE SECOND MAN WE ALSO KNOW HAS
GREEN EYES AND A SERBIAN ACCENT.</i>

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.630
<i>IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT THESE
TWO MEN ARE STILL TOGETHER.</i>

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:18.400
<i>BOTH MEN ARE DANGEROUS.</i>

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.930
<i>THEY SHOULD UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES BE APPROACHED.</i>

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.900
<i>IF YOU DO RECOGNIZE ANY OF THESE
MEN, PLEASE DO CONTACT US.</i>

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:26.660
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:31.260
<i>I CAN'T BEGIN TO EXPRESS MY
SADNESS AT WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.</i>

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.400
(KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.500
(LOUD KNOCKING)

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.300
ALRIGHT!

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.100
MICHELIN MAN,
GOOD AFTERNOON.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.530
YOU'VE BEEN EXPECTING ME,
I SHOULD WARRANT.

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.560
THIS WAY, IS IT?

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.530
HERE'S HOW IT IS.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:01.800
YOU CAN CONFESS NOW
AND WE CAN WORK IT OUT

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.400
VIS A VIS TO THE
SATISFACTION OF US BOTH.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.700
OR I CAN DO MY FOUR
HOURS OF SCRUNTING ABOUT

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.300
AND COME UP WITH
EVERYTHING YOU COULD HAVE

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:16.030
'FESSED UP TO FOUR
HOURS PREVIOUS.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:19.400
YOU CATCH MY DRIFT,
MICHELIN MAN?

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.900
IT'S ONLY PROPER THAT I ADMIT AT
THIS JUNCTURE THAT I'M MORE

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.400
LIKELY TO LOOK KINDLY ON THE
SINS OF A CONFESSEE THAN THE

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.630
SINS OF A BLOKE WHO HAS MADE ME
WORK FOR MY POUND OF FLESH.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.600
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE
MY SHAKESPEARE.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.260
WHAT'S THE
STORY HERE?

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:41.400
I CAN SEE YOU
WANT TO TELL ME.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.860
COME ON. BARE YOUR
SOUL, MICHELIN MAN.

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:52.730
HOW ABOUT I MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU
AND TELL YOU MY SUSPICIONS?

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:57.730
YOU STOP ME
IF I'M WRONG.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:05.930
COCKROACHES, MICE, FISH
ON THE TURN, A RAT OR TWO?

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.460
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:11.660
EXTERMINATING RATS IS
EMOTIONALLY VERY COSTLY.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.100
WAY MORE THAN THE
AVERAGE COCKROACH CALL

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.360
BECAUSE RATS ARE BRAINY,
SEE? AND FULL OF SPUNK.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.360
OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT
TO ADMIRE THE RODENT,

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:23.030
BUT THEY DON'T GET IT, SEE?
THEY NEVER LEAVE THE DRAINS.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.600
SO FOR ALL THEIR BRAINS
AND SPUNK AND FECUNDITY

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.030
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A RAT PROBLEM.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.660
IT'S A PIECE OF CAKE.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.600
IT'S THE SEWER
EVERY TIME.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.100
TRAGIC REALLY.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:43.160
I COULD HAVE YOU
CLOSED DOWN FOR THIS.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.160
MICHELIN STARS OR
NO MICHELIN STARS.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:51.030
BUT I WON'T. DO
YOU KNOW WHY?

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:57.530
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK INTO
YOUR EYES I SEE WHAT YOU ARE:

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.930
A MAN WHO IS COMMITTED TO
RUNNING A CLEAN KITCHEN.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.930
I'M NEVER WRONG.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:06.330

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:33.230
<i>DO WE GO FOR FARM OR
DO WE GO FOR WILD?</i>

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:39.230
TIME FOR THE
NIGHT SHIFT.

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:41.360
<i>...BUT IF YOU GET
IT RIGHT, BY GOD,</i>

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:44.100
<i>THE FLAVORS COME
FLOWING OUT BEAUTIFULLY.</i>

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.230
<i>TAKE THE RISK. GO WILD.</i>

00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:48.630
<i>SHOOT IT YOURSELF
IF YOU CAN.</i>

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:08.360
<i>AFTER POACHING IT LOOKS
SOMETHING LIKE THIS...</i>

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.930
<i>GORGEOUS.</i>

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.760
<i>DO YOURSELF

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.660
<i>BEFORE SLICING UP, SHOW YOUR

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.060
<i>VERY IMPORTANT, THIS:</i>

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.800
<i>WHEN FRYING,
USE OLIVE OIL.</i>

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:30.530
<i>OLIVE OIL IS BEST.</i>

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.860
<i>YOU'VE GOT...</i>

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:50.230
HEY, I ASKED HIM
TO DO THAT.

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:53.800
I CAN'T BEAR TO
LOOK AT HIM.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.560
I MISS HIM
TOO MUCH.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.700
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.230
NO.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:12.100
YOU'RE NOT
BEING YOURSELF.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.500
WHO IS THAT?

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.900
THE OLD JOE.

00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:22.660
THE GUY WHO PUTS
EVERYTHING HE HAS

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:26.160
INTO COOKING THE
BEST FOOD HE CAN...

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:35.400
OR THE MAN WHO STABS
PEOPLE IN THEIR SLEEP?

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:38.160
YOU SAID THIS
WOULD BE OKAY.

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.000
IT IS OKAY.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.960
THIS IS NOT OKAY!

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:53.500
MY HEAD IS FULL OF...

00:56:53.500 --> 00:57:06.230
I IMAGINE THINGS.
TERRIBLE THINGS.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.560
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.900
YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.630
OF COURSE.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:20.230
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU SLEEP
WITH THE LIGHTS OFF?

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.360
WHERE ARE
THE OTHERS?

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.900
WHAT OTHERS?

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:41.360
THE OTHER BINMEN.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.800
IT'S ONLY US.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:45.060
NO, IT ISN'T.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.730
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR,
MATE. GET SOME SLEEP.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:23.100
(BEEPING SOUND)

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.700
JOE MACBETH!

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.700
DON'T ASK.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.160
I HAVE TO KNOW.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.560
WATCH OUT FOR
THE BIG WAITER.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.000
MACDUFF?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.630
YEAH, THAT'S
THE ONE.

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:34.800
HOW DO YOU KNOW
THESE THINGS?

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.730
THE WHOLE
STORY IS HERE.

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:40.560
FROM BANANA FLAVORED
RUBBER RIGHT THROUGH

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:44.060
TO THE YELLOW, HACKED OUT
GOB OF ANCIENT DRUGS.

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.860
ALL OF LIFE.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.360
IN A SPECIAL ROOM.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.200
DRIPPING NEEDLES.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.730
ALL THE GREAT EXCITEMENTS THAT
GET US FROM CRADLE TO THE GRAVE.

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:53.630
THE SOUND AND THE FURY.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.000
IT ALL ENDS WITH US.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.360
INCINERATED.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.230
OBLITERATED.

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.030
YESTERDAY'S BREAKFAST,
YESTERDAY'S MEAT IS TODAY'S MEN.

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:02.500

STOP! WHAT ABOUT BILLY?

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:17.000
WE TOLD YOU.
WE TOLD HIM.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.900
LESS HAPPY THAN YOU,
AND YET MORE HAPPY.

00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:24.860
AND ME... WHAT
HAPPENS TO ME?

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.760
PIGS WILL FLY BEFORE
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO YOU.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:30.460
PIGS WILL DROP ON YOUR HEAD
BEFORE YOU'RE HARMED.

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:43.560
♪ PIGS WILL FLY, PIGS WILL
FLY, PIGS WILL FLY... ♪

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:01.900
THE OLD MAN USED
TO LOVE ALL THIS.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:04.100
OUT HERE,
CRACK OF DAWN.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:09.630
WE USED TO DO
THIS ALL THE TIME.

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:11.460
NOW THAT IS SOME
BEAUTIFUL LIVER, GUYS.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.960
YOU CAN SMELL
THE QUALITY.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.960
WHAT A POWERHOUSE. IT
STORES STUFF, IT PROCESSES,

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:20.030
SENDS OUT WHAT OTHER
PARTS OF THE BODY NEEDS,

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:21.800
CLEANS THE BLOOD.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.500
USES A LOT OF ENERGY WITH
ALL THE WORK IT DOES.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.560
THAT'S WHY YOU GET THAT
FANTASTIC DARK RED COLOR.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.160
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE WORK.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.660
YES, I KNOW, BILLY.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.660
YET IT'S SO DELICATE.

01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.160
TEN SECONDS TOO
LONG IN THE PAN

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.060
AND YOU'VE BLOWN
IT, HAVEN'T YOU?

01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:38.160
TOTALLY BLOWN IT.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.760
SO, DOES IT
PASS MUSTER?

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.560
WE'RE HAVING
ANOTHER BABY.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.100
THAT'S GREAT.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.360
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE AFTER?

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.660
A BOY SO FAR, SO ANOTHER
BOY WOULD BE GOOD.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.030
SERVICE!

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:21.100
WIPE AND GO.

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.660
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.460
DO PEOPLE WANT YOUR
SWEAT WITH THEIR PIG,

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.960
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT "SWEAT
OF JOHNNY BOY" ON THE MENU.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:31.430
HE ONLY WIPES HIS FOREHEAD
THEN USES THE SAME CLOTH

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:32.960
TO WIPE A PLATE.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.600
APPETIZERS ON THE TABLE WITHIN
THREE MINUTES, BUT WE CAN'T HAVE

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.130
JOHNNY BOY SWEATING OVER
EVERYTHING CAN WE, BILLY?

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.200
NO.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:41.760
YOU DON'T HAVE A
TOWEL, DO YOU?

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.300
NOPE.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.400
SO LICK IT.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.860
WHAT?

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.100
JOE.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.100
LICK HIS FOREHEAD.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:58.300
ARE YOU DEAF?

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.500
WHO'S THE HEAD
CHEF NOW?

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:09.560
IS IT YOU, BILLY?

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.460
YOU GO.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:21.230
I RUN THIS KITCHEN!

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:28.630
MINE IS THE ONLY VOICE.

01:02:28.630 --> 01:02:32.060
TOMORROW MORNING, EVERYONE,
THERE'S A BREAKFAST MEETING.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.100
JOE AND I WOULD LIKE
YOU ALL TO COME.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.100
AND IF YOU'RE NOT DOWN TO WORK
YOU'LL BE PAID FOR BEING THERE.

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.000
IT'S IMPORTANT. ALRIGHT?

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.960
WE'RE LIKE ACTORS,
AREN'T WE?

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:10.430
OUT THERE UNDER HOT LIGHTS,
STRUTTING OUR STUFF.

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:13.460
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.300
BILLY, SOMETIMES
IT DOES.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.500
FIRST RULE IN A
KITCHEN, JOE.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.760
RESPECT.

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.560
I'M SORRY.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.230
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
HEAR IT PUMPING AWAY?

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:37.630
THE MINUTE MY HEART
STOPS DOING THAT

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:39.930
I WANT YOU TO GET ME
OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:41.230
OKAY?

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.660
OKAY.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.100
MAD BOY.

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:48.000
YEAH, BUT YOU LOVE ME.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.600
YEAH.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:55.900
I'M SORRY.

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.130
IT'S OKAY.

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:00.330
I'M A BIT WIRED, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:01.800
YEAH.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.460
YOU KNOW WHAT
HELPS ME?

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.060
WHAT'S THAT, BILLY?

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:06.530
CYCLING.

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:08.360
IT CLEARS
YOUR HEAD?

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.100
SOMETIMES I GET
HOME I CAN'T SLEEP.

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.330
I WAIT FOR FREDDIE TO WAKE UP
AND WE GO OUT ON OUR BIKES.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.700
FATHER AND
SON THING.

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.500
UP IN THE HEATH?

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.960
YEAH, KITE WOODS.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:22.000
SOMETIMES AFTERWARDS I
ACTUALLY SLEEP PROPERLY.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.360
DO YOU EVER THINK
ABOUT THOSE BINMEN?

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.500
NO, NEVER.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.160
YOU GOING UP TO KITE
WOODS IN THE MORNING?

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.030
YEAH, THINK I WILL.

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:36.900
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T MISS
THE BREAKFAST, BILLY.

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.330
SEE YOU, JOE.

01:04:38.330 --> 01:04:40.500
SEE YOU, BILLY.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.330
BE THERE AT HALF
SEVEN IN THE MORNING.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:53.960
RIGHT, BYE.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.500
WHO WAS THAT?

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.730
A SUPPLIER.

01:04:57.730 --> 01:04:59.960
AT THIS TIME?

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.160
HE'S A BUTCHER, ELLA!

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.260
ALL GOOD BUTCHERS
ARE UP BY NOW.

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.000
COME ON, FREDDIE!

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:24.200
COMING, DAD.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:56.630
DAD? DAD?

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:08.200
IT'S DONE.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.800
IT HAD TOBE DONE.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.360
HE WAS GOING TO THE
POLICE ABOUT YOU.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.030
HIS BOY
WAS WITH HIM.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:20.130
DID YOU...?

01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:23.460
NO, I DIDN'T.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.130
I WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL ONE OF
THESE AS A GESTURE OF THANKS

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:45.100
FOR ALL THE BLOOD, SWEAT AND
TEARS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:50.560
IN THE SHOPS
THESE ARE $25.99.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.900
OBVIOUSLY, TO YOU
GUYS THEY'RE $22.50.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.630
HERE YOU GO.

01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:57.730
TO ALL OF YOU, CHEERS.

01:06:57.730 --> 01:07:00.800
CHEERS, GUYS,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.100
WHERE'S BILLY, JOE?
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.800
HAS HE NOT
CALLED IN?

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.800
BILLY DOESN'T CALL IN. HE HAS
A HOTLINE TO THE HEAD CHEF.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.260
YOU COULD CHECK
YOUR PHONE, JOE.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:13.530
HE HASN'T CALLED...

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:17.660
IT'S BILLY.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:21.700
<i>IT'S BEAUTIFUL UP
HERE... FRESH...</i>

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.300
HE'S UP IN THE HEATH.
HE GOES CYCLING.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:29.130
<i>I'LL SEE YOU AT BREAKFAST.
DON'T FALL ASLEEP.</i>

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:31.100
WHAT DID HE SAY?

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:33.430
"SEE YOU AT BREAKFAST".

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.530
CHEERS, RODDY.

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:42.630
THERE YOU ARE, JOE.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.900
(PHONE RINGING)

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.660
IT'S A VIDEO MESSAGE.

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.230
WHERE DO YOU GET
A VIDEO MESSAGE?

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:09.860
BILLY, THE BIKE...
LOOK AT THAT.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.660
DON'T!

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.160
UH, LISTEN EVERYONE.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:25.830
JOE'S BEEN A BIT...
HE'S NOT BEEN HIMSELF.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:38.400
LEAVE ME ALONE!

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.500
WHY WON'T YOU
LOOK AT ME?

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.930
YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF
IN THE MIRROR,

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:46.400
BUT YOU WON'T
LOOK AT ME.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.100
AM I WORSE THAN YOU?

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.630
AM I?

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.330
COME AND SIT
DOWN, CHEF.

01:08:52.330 --> 01:09:01.830
YEAH, I'M A BIT WIRED AND...
WHAT WAS IT? LACK OF SLEEP.

01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:08.500
OH NO...

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.960
I'M SORRY.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.300
GET HIM AWAY
FROM ME.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:18.160
GET AWAY FROM ME!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:20.600
WHY DON'T YOU ALL GO
AND SET UP FOR LUNCH.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.000
MAYBE HE'S...

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.630
I DON'T WANT YOUR OPINION,
RODDY. JUST DO IT.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:38.760
HE WAS THERE.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.460
WHO?

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:46.130
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR.

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.760
HE WAS ON TO US.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.500
WHO WAS, JOE?

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.630
BILLY.

01:09:53.630 --> 01:10:01.300
WHY, WHY CAN'T YOU
SEE WHAT I SEE?

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:05.960
WHY CAN'T YOU FEEL
THE THINGS THAT I FEEL?

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.330
ELLA?

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:15.760
WE WERE
TOGETHER ONCE.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.730
AND THEN YOU STOPPED
TALKING TO ME.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.660
SERVICE!

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.460
JOHNNY BOY'S
UPSTAIRS, CHEF.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:59.900
SHOULD I TAKE
IT UPSTAIRS, RODDY?

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.930
WOULD YOU LIKE
ME TO DO THAT?

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:05.700
AFTER ALL, I'M ONLY THE
HEAD CHEF. IS THAT MY JOB?

01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.460
NO, CHEF.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:10.030
MALCOLM!

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:11.600
THAT'S THE WRONG
SAUCE, CHEF.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.830
WHAT?

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:14.800
I THINK THAT'S THE
WRONG SAUCE.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.000
DO YOU?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.630
EVERYONE!

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:21.730
MALCOLM HERE, AGE 12, THINKS
I'M USING THE WRONG SAUCE!

01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:24.460
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ANYTHING?

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:26.660
LOOK AT THESE.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.660
WHERE'S THE PAIN?
WHERE ARE THE WOUNDS?

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.300
HAIRDRESSER!

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.700
I'M GONNA BE THE REAL
THING, LIKE MY DAD.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:37.260
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY?

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.100
GIVE ME THAT.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.000
YOU WANT TO BE
THE REAL THING?

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.530
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
YOUR FIRST REAL BURNS?

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:45.760
CHEF!

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.860
SHUT UP!

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.400
GET ELLA.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.630
GO AHEAD.

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:51.300
COME ON!

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.530
CUSTOMER ON TABLE 7 SAYS HIS
LAMB ISN'T COOKED PROPERLY.

01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:04.500
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.300
IS THERE A PROBLEM
WITH THE COOKING?

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:17.000
GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY RESTAURANT!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.530
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:22.900
EAT.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:36.160
GOOD NIGHT.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.660
WE LOVE IT WHEN
YOU'RE HERE.

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:56.730
WE LOVE IT WHEN
YOU'RE HERE.

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:58.760
SHUT UP, AMELIA.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.200
SHUT UP, AMELIA.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.000
I HAVE TO GO.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.030
YOU PROMISED
YOU'D DO BEDTIME.

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.900
I'LL BE BACK AS
SOON AS I CAN.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.900
BE BACK AS
SOON AS I CAN.

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.860
DON'T DO THAT -
COPY EVERYTHING.

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.530
STAY, DADDY.

01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:14.160
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.500
DON'T GO, DADDY.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.130
OFF, GET OFF!

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:19.960
BLOODY HELL, PETER.

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.160
ARE YOU GETTING
A DIVORCE?

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:24.060
NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.860
MOMMY'S JUST SAD THAT DADDY
ISN'T HERE FOR SUPPER.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.630
DADDY'S SAD TOO.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:33.400
WHAT'S A DIVORCE?

01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:38.230
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:39.860
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:42.330
YOUR FATHER WASN'T MURDERED
BY TWO ROUGHNECK SERBS

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.200
ON A BOTCHED ROBBERY.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.900
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.400
WHAT DID JOE MACBETH GAIN BY
THE DEATH OF YOUR FATHER?

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.700
I'LL TELL YOU
THE ANSWER...

01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:57.700
EVERYTHING HE'S
EVER WANTED.

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:14.960
I DON'T OWE YOU
ANYTHING MORE.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.130
HAVE A BEER.

01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:21.130
YOU KILLED BILLY.
ONCE YOU'VE STARTED...

01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:22.830
NO.

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:24.700
WHAT'S ONE MORE?

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.130
NO!

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:29.830
DO YOU SEE HOW VARLEY IS
VERY GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES?

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:31.760
HE'S A LISTENER.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.760
NOW, ONE WORD FROM
ME... A HINT, A WHISPER,

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.660
AND THEY'LL BE ALL
OVER YOU, JOHNNY BOY.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:43.300
I CAN'T GO
BACK INSIDE.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:48.100
THEN YOU TAKE CARE
OF PETER MACDUFF.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.760
THREE DAYS AND
TWO NIGHTS...

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.700
THEN THEY CUT ME OPEN
AND OUT HE POPPED.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.800
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:08.160
BUT TINY...

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.160
LIKE A BIRD...

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:15.500
WITH TINY LUNGS
AND A TINY HEART.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.260
THEN THREE MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS
JOE AND I SAT LOOKING AT HIM

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:27.600
IN HIS LITTLE BOX, ALL
HOOKED UP WITH TUBES.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.300
WE DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP.

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:35.130
I HELD HIM ONCE.

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:44.200
THEY KNEW IT WAS OVER, SO
THEY GAVE HIM TO US TO HOLD.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:53.660
HE PUT HIS LITTLE MOUTH
TO ME... AND THEN HE DIED.

01:15:53.660 --> 01:16:04.630
THE SIZE OF THE COFFIN
WAS SO SMALL...

01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:07.600
IT MADE ME LAUGH.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.800
(GUNSHOTS)

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.030
JESUS!

01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:14.460
CALL THE POLICE!

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.660
WHERE ARE YOU, JOE?

01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:55.000
ELLA!

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:06.200
(HOWLING)

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.560
ALL OF THEM?

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:25.930
BOTH MY GIRLS?

01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:31.060
AND MY WIFE?

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:46.160
CHEF!

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.930
ELLA...

01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:50.730
I'M SORRY.

01:20:50.730 --> 01:20:53.330
SAY IT.

01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:55.360
SHE'S DEAD.

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:00.160
DEAD.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.760
SORRY.

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:11.430
DON'T YOU SAY SORRY.

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:13.300
SHE WASMY WIFE.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.730
YES.

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:22.600
AM I SORRY, RODDY?

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:31.030
DO I STILL HAVE
THAT IN ME?

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:37.500
WHAT DO I FEEL ABOUT
THE DEATH OF MY WIFE?

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.760
NOTHING.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:44.860
I FEEL NOTHING.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:48.560
GO ON, LEAVE ME.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.960
JOE...

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.900
GO AWAY!

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.160
MACBETH!

01:22:52.230 --> 01:22:55.660
I WON'T FIGHT YOU, PETER.

01:22:55.660 --> 01:23:01.360
I'VE ALREADY GOT TOO MUCH
MACDUFF BLOOD ON MY HANDS.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.360
YOU DON'T WANT TO
FIGHT ME, MACDUFF.

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.260
NOBODY CAN HURT ME.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:16.600
NOBODY CAN HURT
ME, I'M IMMORTAL.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:22.200
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT WAS THAT?

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:25.660
A HELICOPTER?

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:31.630
IS IT LANDING ON
THIS BUILDING?

01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:40.330
PIGS WILL FLY!
PIGS WILL FLY!

01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:45.660
PIGS ARE LANDING
ON MY HEAD!

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.700
WELL, COME ON!

01:24:57.230 --> 01:25:00.300
COME ON, RODDY! I WANT
THESE NOW, NOT TOMORROW!

01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:02.800
YES, CHEF. SORRY, CHEF.

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.460
LET'S GO!

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:08.160
