00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:43.000
*

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
THAT NOISE.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
CAN YOU HEAR IT?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
IT'S COMING
 FROM THE EARTH.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
IT'S THE SOUND OF DESPAIR;
 DESPAIR AND ANGER.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
NORTH AND SOUTH, MILLIONS
 OF MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
LIVE IN APPALLING CONDITIONS
 IN EXTREME POVERTY,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
EXTREME VIOLENCE,
 EXTREME EXPLOITATION.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
THEY ARE THE ORPHANS OF
 THE TECHNOLOGICAL AGE;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
PARIAHS AT THE TABLE OF
 THE RICH AND POWERFUL.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
SOME ARE SHOCKING;
 OTHERS ALMOST TRIVIAL,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
BUT IN THEIR OWN RIGHT
 THEY ARE ALL EXTREME.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:59.000
(SIRENS)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
TODAY, IN WASHINGTON,
 DC, THE WORLD BANK

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
AND THE INTERNATIONAL
 MONETARY FUND

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
ARE HOLDING THEIR
 ANNUAL MEETING.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
THOUSANDS OF POLICE
 OFFICERS HAVE MOVED IN

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
TO PROTECT THE
 FINANCE MINISTERS

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
OF THE RICHEST
 COUNTRIES ON EARTH.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
PROTESTORS HAVE ALSO
 GATHERED IN WASHINGTON.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE HERE
 TO DENOUNCE THE POLICIES

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
AND PRACTISES OF THESE
 TWO INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES
 ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
THEY ARE ALSO HERE TO
 DEMAND JUSTICE FOR THE

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
MILLIONS OF VICTIMS OF
 EXPLOITATION AROUND THE WORLD.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
EVERY MORNING THE SUN
 RISES ON OVER 300 MILLION

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN
 WHO ARE FORCED TO WORK

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
IN CONDITIONS OF
 UTMOST SUBJUGATION.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN
 WHO HAVE LOST ALL CONTROL

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
OVER THEIR LIVES AND WHOSE
 SURVIVAL RESTS IN THE HANDS

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
OF ABUSIVE INDIVIDUALS
 AND CORPORATIONS.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
AND WHEN THEY ARE NO
 LONGER PRODUCTIVE,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
THEY ARE SIMPLY
 THROWN AWAY.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
BROKEN, DRAINED,
 HUMILIATED.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
AS POLICE OFFICERS AND
 PROTESTORS CLASH IN

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
WASHINGTON, OUT IN THE
 WORLD, INCREASING NUMBERS

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
OF THE OPPRESSED LIFT
 THEIR HEADS IN DEFIANCE.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
AS DAWN BREAKS, A CAR
 RACES TOWARD THE VILLAGE

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
OF DHAMKOT, SOME SIX
 HOURS FROM CHANDIGHAR -

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
THE CAPITAL OF
 PUNJAB PROVINCE.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
JYOTI AND JEEMAN KUMAR
 WILL TRY TO FREE THEIR

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
TWO CHILDREN WHO ARE
 BEING HELD IN BONDAGE.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
TRANSLATOR: MY MOTHER AND
BROTHER CAME TO VISIT.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
THE CHILDREN WANTED TO
SPEND THE HOLIDAYS WITH THEM.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
THEY SAID THEY WOULD
BRING THE CHILDREN HOME

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
THEY NEVER BROUGHT
THE CHILDREN BACK.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
THEY TOOK THEM TO
WORK FOR FARMERS.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
TRANSLATOR: MY MOTHER
BORROWED 1,500 RUPEES

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
AND GAVE VISHAL
AS SECURITY.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
THEN SHE BORROWED 600
RUPEES FROM ANOTHER FARMER

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
AND GAVE HIM
DEEPAK IN EXCHANGE.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
TRANSLATOR: NOBODY WANTED TO
HELP US BECAUSE WE ARE POOR.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I CLEAN HOUSES
FOR A LIVING.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
THREE YEARS, I DID
EVERYTHING I COULD.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I EVEN WENT TO SEE THE
FARMERS THEMSELVES.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD
COME TO GET MY CHILDREN.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
THEY ANSWERED THAT MY
MOTHER HAD GIVEN THEM

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
THE BOYS TO PAY
BACK HER DEBT.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
THEN THEY SAID THAT
GOING TO THE POLICE

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
WOULDN'T HELP EITHER
SINCE THEY ARE ON

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
VERY GOOD TERMS
WITH THE POLICE.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I TRIED BUT I JUST
COULDN'T SAVE ENOUGH MONEY

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
TO GET MY SONS BACK.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
THAT'S WHEN I HEARD
ABOUT JAI SINGH.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000
BONDAGE IS ONE OF THE
 OLDEST FORMS OF SLAVERY.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
SOMEONE BORROWS MONEY,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
TO GUARANTEE
 REIMBURSEMENT OF THE LOAN,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
THE BORROWER IS FORCED
 TO WORK FOR THE LENDER.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
THE BORROWER BECOMES
 COMPLETELY SUBSERVIENT

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
TO THE LENDER, WHO DECIDES
 WHERE THE BORROWER

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
WILL WORK, AND IN
 WHAT CONDITIONS.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
THE BORROWER OFTEN HANDS
 OVER A FAMILY MEMBER,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:09.000
OFTEN A CHILD, AS
 SURETY FOR THE LOAN.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
SINCE THERE IS USUALLY ONLY
 A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY OWED,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
BORROWERS EXPECT TO REIMBURSE
 THEIR DEBTS QUICKLY.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
BUT THEY SOON DISCOVER
 THAT BONDED LABORERS

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
CAN NEVER BUY BACK
 THEIR FREEDOM.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
LENDERS CHARGE SUCH
 USURIOUS INTEREST RATES

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
THAT DEBTS ACTUALLY INCREASE
 WITH EACH PASSING DAY.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
JAI SINGH ESCORTS JYOTI TO
 THE COMMISSIONER OF OATHS

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
TO SWEAR HER DEPOSITION
 AND TO AUTHORIZE

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO
 RESCUE THE CHILDREN.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
TODAY IS A CRUCIAL DAY FOR
 JYOTI AND JEEMAN KUMAR.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
AFTER MONTHS OF
 LEGAL MANEUVERING,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
JAI SINGH HAS OBTAINED
 AN ORDER FROM A JUDGE

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
OF THE SUPERIOR COURT
 OF PUNJAB PROVINCE

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
ORDERING THE LIBERATION
 OF THEIR TWO BOYS.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
FLANKED BY BAILIFFS OF THE
 COURT AND POLICE OFFICERS,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
THEY ARE ON THEIR
 WAY TO RAID THE FARM

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000
WHERE THEY EXPECT TO FIND
 DEEPAK, THEIR ELDEST SON.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
BUT THERE IS AN
 UNEXPECTED TURN OF EVENTS.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
TRANSLATOR: I
STARTED TO CRY.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
WE WERE AFRAID
THEY'D KILLED HIM.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
SINCE DEEPAK IS
 NO LONGER HERE,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THE BAILIFFS WANT TO
 CALL OFF THE SEARCH.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
ACCORDING TO INDIAN LAW,
 WHICH DATES BACK TO

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
THE BRITISH EMPIRE,
 IF A MISSING PERSON

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
CANNOT BE FOUND ON
 THE WORK PREMISES,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
HE OR SHE IS NOT
 CONSIDERED IN BONDAGE.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
BUT JAI SINGH DISAGREES.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
AFTER NEGOTIATING FOR MORE
 THAN 15 MINUTES, JAI SINGH

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
CONVINCES THE BAILIFFS
 TO CONTINUE THE SEARCH.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
JAI SINGH IS LUCKY.
 HIS THREAT WORKS.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
TRANSLATOR: WE WERE JUST
ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR HOME

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
WHEN MY BROTHER SHOWED
UP ON A SCOOTER

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
WITH DEEPAK,
MY ELDEST SON.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
HE WAS IN A
TERRIBLE STATE.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
DURING HIS FOUR
 YEARS IN BONDAGE,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
FROM THE AGE
 OF NINE TO 13,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
DEEPAK WORKED FOR SIX
 DIFFERENT EMPLOYERS.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
HE TENDED FARM ANIMALS,
 FEEDING AND WASHING THEM

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
AND CLEANING THE
 FARM BUILDINGS.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
HE WORKED SEVEN
 DAYS A WEEK,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
FROM DAYBREAK UNTIL
 LONG AFTER SUNSET.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
AFTER FREEING DEEPAK,
 THEY IMMEDIATELY HEAD OUT

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
TO SEARCH FOR VISHAL,
 THEIR YOUNGEST SON.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
THEY FIND HIM IN
 ANOTHER VILLAGE,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
ABOUT THIRTY
 KILOMETRES AWAY.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
HE IS LIVING
 WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
WHO HIRED HIM OUT AS A
 WAITER TO A SMALL TEA SHOP.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
TRANSLATOR: IF WE HAD
MONEY, NONE OF THIS

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
WE WERE TOO POOR TO
PAY OFF THE DEBTS,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
BUT THE FARMERS SHOULD HAVE
PAID THE BOYS THEIR DUE.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I WANT TO SEE THE
EXPLOITERS PUNISHED.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(SINGING)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
TODAY IS GOOD FRIDAY AND
 THE CATHOLIC FAITHFUL

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000
HAVE GATHERED TO MAKE THE
 STATIONS OF THE CROSS.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
IT IS A TIME TO REFLECT
 ON THEIR SITUATION,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
BUT ALSO A TIME TO DENOUNCE
 THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
THEY ARE DESCENDANTS OF
 SLAVES AND THEY HAVE

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
DECIDED TO TAKE CHARGE
 OF THEIR DESTINY.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000
(SINGING)

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
EASTER WEEK MARKS
 THE BEGINNING OF

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
THE SUGAR CANE HARVEST.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
FOR THESE WORKERS IT IS
 ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
TO CHALLENGE THE CONDITIONS
 OF SEVERE EXPLOITATION

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
IN WHICH THEY LIVE.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
MY NAME IS
ELIFAITE LAGUERRE.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I WAS BORN IN BELLE-ANSE
IN HAITI IN 1963.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:26.000
*

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000
TRANSLATOR: WORKING IN THE
CANE FIELDS IS HARD WORK.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
WE GET UP AT FOUR
IN THE MORNING.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
WE TAKE A BREAK FROM
TWELVE TO TWELVE THIRTY.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
THEN WE WORK UNTIL EIGHT
OR NINE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
WE HAVE TO WORK EVERY DAY.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
IF WE DON'T WORK EVERY
DAY, WE CAN'T SURVIVE.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
ELIFAITE LAGUERRE HAS
 BEEN CUTTING SUGAR CANE

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
SINCE THE AGE OF 14, WHEN
 HE FIRST CAME TO THE

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 WITH HIS FATHER.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
THEY FLED TO ESCAPE
 THE EXTREME POVERTY

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
AND THE DICTATORSHIP OF
 JEAN-CLAUDE DUVALIER

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
IN THEIR NATIVE HAITI.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
TRANSLATOR: WE DON'T MAKE
MUCH MONEY CUTTING CANE.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
YEAR AFTER YEAR WE ALWAYS
MAKE THE SAME AMOUNT.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
A TON OF CANE, FOR INSTANCE,
EARNS YOU 30 TO 35 PESOS.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
FOR THREE OR FOUR DAYS
OF WORK, WE'RE PAID

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
100 TO 150 PESOS AND IT
COSTS MONEY TO LIVE.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
SINCE NATIVE DOMINICANS
 HAVE ALWAYS REFUSED

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
TO ACCEPT SUCH POOR
 WORKING CONDITIONS,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
THE DOMINICAN GOVERNMENT
 AND SUGAR COMPANIES HAVE

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
TRADITIONALLY TURNED TO
 HAITI FOR THEIR CHEAP LABOR.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
 HAITIANS CROSS THE BORDER

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
IN HOPES OF FINDING
 A BETTER LIFE.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
SOME COME LEGALLY, BUT MOST,
 LIKE ELIFAITE LAGUERRE,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
ARE ILLEGAL ALIENS.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
TO KEEP THEM APART FROM
 THE LOCAL POPULATION

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
AND KEEP THEM
 UNDER TIGHTER REIN,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
HAITIAN WORKERS ARE
 HOUSED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
OF THE PLANTATIONS IN
 CAMPS CALLED "BATAYES".

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
A FORM OF APARTHEID.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.000
"NEGROS", AS THEY ARE
 CALLED, HAVE NO RIGHTS

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000
AND ARE VICTIMS OF
 THE WORST ABUSES.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
TRANSLATOR:
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
THIS IS NO WAY TO
LIVE, IT'S HORRIBLE.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
THIS LIFE IS FIT FOR
ANIMALS, NOT FOR PEOPLE.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
HUMAN BEINGS SHOULDN'T
LIVE IN THESE CONDITIONS.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
TRANSLATOR: THEY GIVE
THEM A FEW PESOS AND

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
THINK THEY CAN DO WHATEVER
THEY WANT WITH THEM.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
IT'S APPALLING.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
IT'S A PRODUCT OF
CAPITALISM, OF COURSE,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
BUT IT COMES VERY
CLOSE TO SLAVERY.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
PIERRE RUQUOY IS
CO-FOUNDER OF

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
CENTRO PUENTE,
AN NGO DEVOTED TO

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
HELPING HAITIAN
WORKERS IN THE BATEYES.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
BORN IN BELGIUM, RUQUOY
HAS BEEN LIVING IN

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
HE IS THE ONLY PRIEST WHO
LIVES WITH THE WORKERS

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
IN THE BATEYES.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
TRANSLATOR: THE BASIC PROBLEM
IS THAT THIS IS A GROUP

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
OF PEOPLE WHICH HAS BEEN
HUMILIATED, DESPISED,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
DEPRIVED EVEN OF THE RIGHT
TO SELF-DETERMINATION.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
IN FACT, NONE OF THE 30
ARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSAL

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
DECLARATION OF HUMAN
RIGHTS IS RESPECTED HERE.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
NOT ONE.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
IN THE 1990'S,
 UNDER PRESSURE

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
FROM INTERNATIONAL
 ORGANIZATIONS

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
LIKE THE WORLD
 BANK AND THE IMF,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
BEGAN TO PRIVATIZE ALL
 OF ITS SUGAR COMPANIES.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
FOREIGN INVESTORS, THROUGH
 DOMINICAN COMPANIES,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
TOOK OVER
 THE INDUSTRY.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000
IN BARAHONA, THE MAJOR
 INVESTORS ARE FROM GUATEMALA.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
TRANSLATOR: THE NEW OWNERS,
THE CAMPOLLO FAMILY,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
AL OWN A SUGAR
COMPANY IN GUATEMALA

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
CALLED MADRE-TIERRA.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I LOOKED INTO WHO
THESE PEOPLE ARE.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I DISCOVERED THAT
BISHOP GIRARDI,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
WHO WAS MURDERED IN
GUATEMALA, WROTE A REPORT

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
IN THE 80'S IN WHICH HE

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
DENOUNCED THE MADRE-TIERRA
SUGAR COMPANY.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
MADRE-TIERRA MEANS
"MOTHER EARTH".

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
BISHOP GERARDI'S REPORT
STATES THAT IN THE '80S,

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
SEVEN OR EIGHT UNION
WORKERS WERE MURDERED

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
AT THE MADRE-TIERRA
SUGAR COMPANY.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
A CRISIS IS BREWING
 FOR THE NEW OWNERS

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
WHO HAVE INTRODUCED
 NEW METHODS OF

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000
WEIGHING AND PAYING
 FOR THE SUGAR CANE.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
IT'S SATURDAY MORNING
 AND A UNION MEETING

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
HAS BEEN CALLED
 IN BATEYE #5.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.000
CANE CUTTERS FROM
 ALL BATEYES HAVE COME,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
ALONG WITH A
 COMPANY SPOKESMAN.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
(WORKERS BEGIN TALKING
AMONG THEMSELVES)

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
TRANSLATOR: THIS TYPE OF
GOVERNMENT ALWAYS DEFENDS

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
THE INTERESTS OF
BIG CORPORATIONS.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
THE DOMINICAN GOVERNMENT
APPOINTED AN ARMY COLONEL

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
TO HEAD THE CIVILIAN
SECURITY TEAM

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
AT THE SUGAR COMPANY.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
SO, IN FACT, IT'S A
PARAMILITARY GROUP.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I THINK, INEVITABLY,
IF PRESSURE FROM THE

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
WORKERS KEEPS MOUNTING,
THERE WILL BE REPRESSION.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
IT'S A DISGRACE FOR
HUMANITY THAT IN THIS

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
DAY AND AGE PEOPLE ARE
SUBJECTED TO THIS ABUSE

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
TO MAKE A PRODUCT THAT
GOES TO THE UNITED STATES

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
AND ALL OVER THE WORLD -
A PRODUCT THAT ENDS UP

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
ON THE TABLES OF MANY
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW
AND WHO HAVE NO IDEA

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
THAT THEIR SUGAR BOWL
IS BRIMMING WITH

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
THE SWEAT AND BLOOD
OF THEIR FELLOW MAN.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
MONDAY MORNING.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
AS IT DOES EVERY MORNING,
 SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:04.000
A BUS COMES TO DRIVE THE
 WORKERS TO THE FIELDS.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:17.000
THE CANE CUTTERS
 ARE ALL HERE.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
TRANSLATOR: WE CAN'T
STAND BY DOING NOTHING.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
WE HAVE TO FIGHT.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
LIVE OR DIE.
WE HAVE TO SPEAK UP.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
THINGS HAVE GOT TO CHANGE AND
WE HAVE TO DO IT TOGETHER.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
ONLY TWO WORKERS
 GET ON THE BUS.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
IT'S A STRIKE.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
HOW LONG WILL THEY HOLD
 OUT AGAINST THE COMPANY?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
AT THE CORNER OF UNION
 SQUARE AND 14TH STREET,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
A PROTEST MARCH LIKE
 ANY OF THE HUNDREDS

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
OF DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE
 AMERICAN METROPOLIS.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
BUT THESE PROTESTORS
 ARE DIFFERENT.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
THEY ARE TOMATO PICKERS
 WHO HAVE COME ALL THE WAY

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
FROM FLORIDA.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
THEY'RE HOLDING
 DEMONSTRATIONS IN ALL THE

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
MAJOR CITIES IN THE
 NORTH-EASTERN STATES

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
TO PROTEST THEIR
 EXPLOITATION

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
AT THE HANDS OF A
 MAJOR CORPORATION.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000
THAT CORPORATION IS THE
 FAST-FOOD GIANT, TACO BELL.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
TRANSLATOR: WE CAME
UP FROM IMMOKALEE

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
IN FLORIDA TO HOLD
THIS DEMONSTRATION;

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
TO PRESS OUR DEMAND
FOR A RAISE.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR THE SAME WAGES

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

THE UNITED STATES FOR
 MORE THAN 10 YEARS.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
EVERY MORNING HE COMES TO
 THIS PARKING LOT IN THE

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
HEART OF THE TOWN OF
 IMMOKALEE TO FIND WORK.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
THIS IS WHERE CONTRACTORS
 COME TO HIRE THE LABORERS

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
THEY NEED THAT DAY.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:00.000
IN THE IMMOKALEE AREA ALONE,
 THERE ARE OVER 20,000

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:11.000
DAY LABORERS OUT LOOKING
 FOR WORK EVERY MORNING.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
TRANSLATOR: ALL OF US
THOUGHT THAT AS SOON AS

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:22.000
WE GOT HERE, WE'D MAKE
LOTS OF EASY MONEY.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000
BUT INSTEAD WE'RE POOR.
DIRT POOR, BROKE.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
FELICIANO AND A FRIEND
 GO FROM BUS TO BUS.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
NOT ONLY DOES HE HAVE
 TO FIND WORK, BUT EVERY

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
SINGLE DAY HE ALSO HAS
 TO NEGOTIATE HIS WAGES.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
TRANSLATOR: SOME PAY 40
OR 45 CENTS A BUCKET.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
IT DEPENDS ON
THE CONTRACTORS.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
OTHERS ONLY PAY
30 CENTS A BUCKET.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
THE MEN IN CHARGE OF THE
PICKING SET THE PRICES

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
AND THEY VARY
ALL THE TIME.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000

IN THE TOMATO FIELDS,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
WORKING CONDITIONS
ARE THE SAME HERE

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
AS IN ANY THIRD
WORLD COUNTRY.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
WHEN I GOT HERE, I WAS
HIRED TO PICK TOMATOES.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
AT THE END OF MY FIRST
DAY, I COULDN'T EVEN

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
WALK OUT OF THE FIELD.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
LUCAS BENITEZ IS ONE OF THE

TRANSLATOR: IN THE UNITED
STATES, AGRICULTURAL

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
WORKERS ARE EXCLUDED
FROM LABOR LAWS.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
THERE ARE LAWS THAT
PROTECT WORKERS

IN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY
IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
AND THAT GIVE THEM
THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000

BY ANY OF THOSE LAWS.

TRANSLATOR: THIS BUCKET
HOLDS 33 POUNDS OF TOMATOES.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
WE HAVE TO HURRY OVER TO THE
TRUCKS TO EMPTY OUR BUCKETS.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
WE HAVE TO RUN
BECAUSE THE OVERSEERS

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
PUT A LOT OF
PRESSURE ON US.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:22.000
TO EARN A MINIMUM
AMOUNT, WE HAVE TO

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
FILL 100 BUCKETS A DAY.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
IT TAKES 100 BUCKETS TO EARN
40 TO 45 DOLLARS A DAY.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
BY THE END OF THE DAY,

 POUNDS OF TOMATOES.

40 TO 45 CENTS A BUCKET.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
LIVING CONDITIONS ARE
VERY BAD; THEY'RE AWFUL.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
JUST TO AFFORD A
PLACE TO SLEEP,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
WE HAVE TO PACK OURSELVES
IN LIKE SARDINES.

THREE OF US
SHARE THIS ROOM.

IT'S SMALL, RIGHT?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
IT'S REALLY CRAMPED
FOR THREE PEOPLE.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
HERE'S THE TABLE.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
THIS IS MY BED AND I
KEEP ALL OF MY THINGS

IN THIS SUITCASE.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
IT SITS ON THIS
BUCKET BECAUSE

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
THERE'S NOWHERE
ELSE TO PUT IT.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S
NOT MUCH ROOM.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
THE OTHER GUY WHO
SLEEPS HERE IS JUST AS

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
CRAMPED FOR SPACE AND HE
PILES HIS STUFF UP TOO.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
EVERYBODY KEEPS THEIR
STUFF IN A PILE

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST
NO ROOM FOR IT.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
THIS IS ALL I OWN. I
CAN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
I DON'T MAKE ENOUGH
TO BUY ANYTHING ELSE.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
IN PHILADELPHIA THE
 COALITION HAS GARNERED THE

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
SUPPORT OF THE KENSINGTON
 WELFARE RIGHTS UNION,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
THE LARGEST LOBBY
 FOR THE RIGHTS OF

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
THE UNDERPRIVILEGED
 IN PENNSYLVANIA.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
REACTION IN PHILADELPHIA
 IS OPEN AND FRANK.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
YOU PEOPLE ARE
SO PATHETIC.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
THEY CREATE
JOBS FOR PEOPLE.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE ON
THIS STREET, WHY DON'T

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
ALL OF YOU GO GET THEM?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
DID YOU JUST CALL
ME A "YUPPIE SLUT"?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
IS THAT WHAT YOU
JUST CALLED ME?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:27.000
DON'T CALL ME
A YUPPIE SLUT.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
THE BOYCOTT AGAINST TACO
 BELL BEGAN IN THE SPRING

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
OF 2001.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
IT CAME AFTER SEVERAL
 YEARS OF FRUITLESS

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
NEGOTIATIONS WITH
 PLANTATION OWNERS.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
INSPIRED BY A SIMILAR
 CAMPAIGN AGAINST

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
THE SPORTING GOODS
 MANUFACTURER NIKE,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
THE COALITION DECIDED TO
 TARGET TACO BELL,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
THE NUMBER ONE BUYER
 OF FLORIDA TOMATOES.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
TRANSLATOR: WHEN WE
BEGAN THE BOYCOTT,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000
TACO BELL SAID IT WOULD
NEVER INTERVENE IN ANY WAY

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
IN A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE
WORKERS AND THE RANCHEROS.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
"COMPANY POLICY", THEY SAID.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
WHO ARE THE RANCHEROS?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
TRANSLATOR: THEY'RE
AMERICANS, MOSTLY WHITES.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
BUT WHEN I SAY RANCHERO,
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
A SMALL LANDOWNER WITH
200 ACRES OF TOMATOES;

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
I'M TALKING
THOUSANDS OF ACRES.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
THESE ARE COMPANIES WITH
REPORTED EARNINGS

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
OF 79 MILLION
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
THE SMALLEST COMPANY
REPORTED AN ANNUAL PROFIT

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
OF 25 MILLION DOLLARS.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
SO, THEY'RE LARGE
CORPORATIONS.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
AMERICAN AGRICULTURE DEPENDS
 EXTENSIVELY ON ITS MANPOWER.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT OF
 ALL FRUITS AND VEGETABLES

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
ARE HAND PICKED.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
IT'S AN INDUSTRY
 THAT GENERATES OVER

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
35 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000
TRANSLATOR: CARRYING
BUCKETS FULL OF TOMATOES

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
ALL DAY WEARS YOU OUT SO
MCUH THAT WHEN YOU GET

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
OFF WORK, YOU DON'T
EVEN FEEL LIKE MOVING.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
WE HAVE HEADACHES
AND BACK ACHES.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
OUR SHOULDERS HURT
AND OUR LEGS AND FEET

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
AFTER ALL THAT BENDING
DOWN, STANDING UP,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
AND BENDING AGAIN
TO PICK THE TOMATOES.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
THEN THERE'S THE
SPRAY, THE PESTICIDES.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
WITHOUT THE SPRAY,
THERE'D BE NO HARVEST.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
BUT A LOT OF US ARE
ALLERGIC TO THE SPRAY.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
LOOK. SEE THESE MARKS.
AFTER 30 MINUTES OF WORK,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
WHAT YOU SEE HERE
WON'T GO AWAY.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
THAT'S WHAT THE PESTICIDES
LEAVE ON YOUR BODY.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
AND IT GOES RIGHT THROUGH
YOUR SKIN AND YOU FEEL IT

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:38.000
ALL OVER YOUR BODY.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:45.000
CONDITIONS ARE VERY
HARD FOR THE WORKERS

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:55.000
BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
YOU'VE GOTTA EAT.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:18.000
(SINGING)

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
TRANSLATOR: IT'S A REAL
MESS, NOT JUST FOR ME

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
BUT FOR EVERYONE
WHO COMES HERE.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
WE'RE EXHAUSTED,
COMPLAINING;

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
WE'RE AT THE END
OF OUR ROPE.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I FEEL...

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
HOW CAN I PUT IT?

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:16.000
SAD TO SEE THE
STATE WE'RE IN.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.000
(CROWD YELLING
JUSTICE NOW!)

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
IN WASHINGTON, FELICIANO
 MARTINEZ AND THE MEMBERS

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
OF THE COALITION HAVE
 JOINED THE PROTEST MARCH

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
AGAINST THE WORLD
 BANK AND THE IMF.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
THEY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE
 UP AGAINST INDUSTRY GIANTS.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000
AFTER 10 YEARS OF
 FIGHTING, REPEATED STRIKES

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000
INCLUDING TWO
 HUNGER STRIKES AND TWO

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
BOYCOTT CAMPAIGNS ALL
 OVER THE UNITED STATES,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
THEY HAVE WON NOTHING.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
(CROWD: JUSTICE NOW!)

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
TWO DAYS AFTER RESCUING
 DEEPAK AND VISHAL,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
JAI SINGH IS BACK
 ON THE ROAD.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
THIS TIME HE IS ON HIS
 WAY TO FREE FIVE FAMILIES

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
- 35 PEOPLE IN ALL - WHO
 ARE WORKING AS SLAVES

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000
IN A BRICK FACTORY.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
A FEW HOURS AFTER
 ELIFAITE LAGUERRE

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
AND THE OTHER CANE CUTTERS
 START THEIR STRIKE ACTION,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
FIRE BREAKS OUT IN A
 FIELD NEAR THE BATAYES.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
ARSON OR ACCIDENT,
 NO ONE KNOWS,

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.000
BUT TEMPERS ARE
 AT THE FLASHPOINT.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE
 EXTREME DESTITUTION

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
OF SOME AND THE EXTREME
 WEALTH OF OTHERS,

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000

 GROWING RESTLESS.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
THEIR STORY IS ONGOING.
