00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000



00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.160

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.100

        For six years, the University of
        Maryland's Business School
      

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.460

        has been sending its MBA
        students to prison for a
      

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.170

        scared straight field trip
        in white collar crime.
      

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.750

        Suppose your boss asks, "can't
        you fudge the financials?
      

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.630

        Can't you pick up a million
        dollars so we can do this?"
      

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.440

        And your answer should be
        unequivocally, absolutely, no.
      

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.470

        Just say no, advises former
        developer Daniel Colton or you
      

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.750

        may wind up like him, serving
        a three-year sentence for
      

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.900

        conspiracy.


00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.080

        His audience, students just
        days away from entering a
      

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.700

        business world where morals
        may be looser than ever.
      

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.330

        The big joke is that business
        ethics is an oxymoron, i.e.,
      

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.140

        you can't simply talk about
        ethics when you're talking
      

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.870

        about business.


00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.940

        There are none.


00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.370

        Barbara Toffler is a Professor
        of Business Ethics and thus
      

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.220

        thinks it isn't a contradiction
        in terms, though
      

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.440

        she admits stock scams like the
        ones that have made Enron
      

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.660

        a household name are as old
        as the market itself.
      

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.420

        Consider this poem.


00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.240

        Some in clandestine companies
        combine; Erect new stocks to
      

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.970

        trade beyond the line; With air
        and empty names beguile
      

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.420

        the town, And raise new credits
        first, then cry 'em
      

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.790

        down; Divide the empty nothing
        into shares, and set the crowd
      

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.980

        together by the ears.


00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.680

        That's Daniel Defoe, of Robinson
        Crusoe fame, writing
      

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.180

        in the early 1700's.


00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.300

        Here's the French artist Daumier
        in the mid-1800's
      

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.850

        depicting a speculator in the
        stock market planting false
      

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.290

        rumors to manipulate prices.


00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.160

        And we're all old enough to
        remember the insider trading
      

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.030

        and junk bond scandals of the
        late 1900's starring Ivan
      

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.590

        Boesky, Mike Milken
        and the like.
      

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.120

        But Barbara Toffler thinks
        ethics now are
      

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.440

        actually worse than ever.


00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.870

        At least in the 1980's,
        she says,
      

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.240

        "It was a big boy's game.


00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.670

        And in fact, much of the history
        of unethical behavior,
      

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.190

        if you will, in business has
        been kind of a big boy's
      

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.820

        game."


00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.460

        So in a sense, it was them
        against themselves.
      

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.300

        Exactly.


00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.700

        And obviously, stock prices
        were affected.
      

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.690

        Obviously, the stock market
        was affected.
      

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.610

        Obviously, the institutional
        and the individual investor
      

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.780

        were affected.


00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:48.190

        But we did not have the kind
        of impact on you and me and
      

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.220

        the general population
        that we now do.
      

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.950

        Where more vulnerable investors
        are the ones getting
      

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.370

        disproportionately hurt, like
        the blue collar phone workers
      

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.400

        we interviewed recently
        at Global Crossing.
      

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.020

        The modern business ethics
        industry was born in the late
      

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.470

        70's, part of the


00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.000

        post-Watergate reform movement.


00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.920

        Business ethics became so hot,
        a firm like Arthur Andersen--
      

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.840

        yes, that Arthur Andersen--


00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.680

        spent millions to be identified
        with the topic,
      

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.750

        making and distributing
        videotapes to explain why
      

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.250

        morality was vital to US
        corporate success.
      

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.580

        Here's one of their stars, Stew
        Leonard, Sr., CEO of a
      

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.910

        discount dairy chain.


00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.870

        The most important single
        fundamental thing of success
      

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.070

        in business is to build your
        house on a solid foundation of
      

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.580

        integrity, of a solid foundation
        of ethics.
      

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.770

        One hint that things
        were getting worse.
      

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.290

        Though Andersen hired Barbara
        Toffler in 1995, it was to
      

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.910

        help them make money, not
        clean up their act.
      

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.530

        They hired me to sell
        services to clients.
      

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.390

        They didn't hire me to do work
        with them internally.
      

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.240

        I was hired to set up a
        consulting practice in ethics
      

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.370

        and responsible business
        practices.
      

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.170

        I was not hired to do internal
        work at Arthur Andersen.
      

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.810

        Did you ever expect that Arthur
        Andersen's internal
      

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.570

        culture would be at odds with
        what you were trying to teach?
      

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.690

        I learned that as I was trying
        to sell services and found
      

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.770

        people asking me if Arthur
        Andersen was doing internally
      

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.140

        those things that I was trying
        to sell to them.
      

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.460

        And they weren't.


00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.260

        Meanwhile, the ethics of Arthur
        Andersen, once the
      

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.670

        purest of pure auditors,
        sank to new lows.
      

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.720

        Why?


00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.900

        Well perhaps we should use the
        famous words of Watergate.
      

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.460

        Follow the money.


00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.150

        Or as white-collar criminal
        Daniel Colton puts it,
      

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.360

        "Money is the hugest intoxicant
        there is. "
      

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.180

        Barbara Toffler says that
        intoxicant became the drink of
      

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.270

        choice, even for the top
        accounting firms.
      

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.750

        Everybody was making money.


00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.210

        They were jumping on
        the bandwagon.
      

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.480

        They forgot what they were
        supposed to be doing.
      

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.360

        They forgot that they
        were watchdogs.
      

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.500

        They forgot they were protectors
        of the investor.
      

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.280

        And they became hotshot firms.
        We're a big name, we can play
      

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.670

        with the big boys and we
        can make big money.
      

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.840

        And they did start
        making big money.
      

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.790

        So they too were seduced.


00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.600

        I'll honest with you.


00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.960

        I stayed at Arthur Andersen
        probably longer than I would
      

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.890

        have, because I liked the
        money that I was making.
      

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.180

        By the late 90's, Andersen's
        ethics consulting had petered
      

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.430

        out for lack of clients.


00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.260



00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.280

        And Anderson's ethics tapes,
        despite their lofty ambitions
      

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.730

        and earnest host, don't seem
        to have had much impact.
      

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.370

        Over the years, our family, our
        religion, our community
      

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.670

        and schools have helped
        to shape our values.
      

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:52.990

        Thou shalt not steal.


00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.980

        But maybe it's a good thing that
        these tapes never became
      

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.880

        best sellers, seeing as how the
        one with Stu Leonard might
      

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.910

        be a better guide to
        sin than sincerity.
      

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.110

        The people that look for the
        short cut, the prisons are
      

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.130

        filled with them.


00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.260

        But just two years after this
        tape was sent to schools all
      

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.910

        over the country, Stew Leonard,
        Sr. pleaded guilty to
      

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.970

        skimming $17 million in profits,
        much of which he
      

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.890

        carried, the government
        reported, on tens if not
      

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.280

        hundreds of trips to St. Martin
        in the Caribbean, in
      

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.390

        amounts ranging from $10,000
        to upwards of $250,000, in
      

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.750

        suitcases or even wrapped
        as baby gifts.
      

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.310

        It was the largest tax fraud
        in Connecticut history, and
      

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.370

        Leonard was sentenced to
        52 months in prison.
      

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.790

        Two brothers-in-law received
        sentences.
      

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.130

        Son Stew, Jr., the store's
        president, also admitted
      

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.920

        involvement but was granted
        immunity as part of his dad's
      

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.510

        plea bargain, which makes the
        ethical rule of thumb with
      

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.600

        which this tape ends
        almost surreal.
      

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.970

        Would the boy you were be proud
        of the man you are?
      

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.190

        And I would say that the boy I
        was would be proud of the man
      

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.590

        I am and I would wish
        that on anyone.
      

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:19.800

        If my dad were alive today, he
        would say, "Atta boy, Stew."
      

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.660

        Today, Leonard is out
        of jail and Stew
      

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.910

        Leonard's chain is expanding.


00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.070

        If any stigma remains,
        it hasn't
      

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.760

        seemed to hurt business.


00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.860

        But the biggest surprise may be
        that anyone did jail time
      

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.530

        at all, because according to
        Justice Department data US
      

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.240

        attorneys prosecuted only 187
        defendants over the last
      

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.820

        decade for white
        collar crimes.
      

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.160

        And while 142 were found
        guilty, a healthy 76%
      

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.900

        conviction rate, only 87 did
        time, usually at a minimum
      

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.610

        security so called "Club Fed.
        " Attorney Jake Szymanski
      

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.140

        believes lenient sentencing
        has helped
      

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.000

        create the current climate.


00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.520

        There needs to be some serious
        jail time for analysts who are
      

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.620

        caught committing fraud,
        CEOs that are
      

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.090

        looting their companies.


00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.440

        until.


00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.880

        We send somebody away for a long
        period of time in a real
      

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.700

        prison, nothing is
        going to change.
      

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.080

        Now Szymanski used to represent
        defendants.
      

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.970

        I was revolted by my clients.


00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.760

        I didn't like going to work and
        doing what I was doing,
      

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.280

        getting brokerage firms
        away with murder.
      

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.940

        And it got to me.


00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.540

        So in 1998, Szymanski
        switched sides.
      

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.610

        I am now representing public
        customers in claims against
      

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.260

        major Wall Street firms,
        like Merrill
      

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.750

        Lynch and Smith Barney.


00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.700

        And unfortunately, I have seen
        at major Wall Street firms the
      

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.390

        same type of boiler room tactics
        that I saw in the '90s
      

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.020

        at these other firms.


00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.950

        This is a Business Ethics class
        for MBA students at
      

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.330

        Babson College in Wellesley,
        Massachusetts.
      

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.590

        If they're committing fraud,
        that's a crime.
      

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.390

        And that's punishable
        by five years, ten
      

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.340

        years, fifteen years.


00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.890

        If you go and you punish people
        just because the stock
      

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.600

        ended up tanking and the
        market ended up not
      

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.600

        performing, then you
        go punishing
      

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.770

        people for taking risks.


00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.210

        But I think where we get into
        trouble and firms should pay
      

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.050

        the price are when there's
        ulterior motives and there's
      

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:10.870

        other funding going
        on by the company.
      

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.360

        After several hours of heated,
        knowledgeable debate, I asked
      

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.190

        whether they would have touted
        stocks they didn't believe in.
      

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.610

        How many would have knuckled
        under, essentially?
      

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.830

        Not a single hand went up.


00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.250

        But then one student suggested
        pushing the
      

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.990

        hypothetical a bit further.


00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.190

        So if you ask this question
        again, how many people would
      

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:35.280

        put that buy if it got them
        $20 million in the bank, I
      

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.140

        think you'd see a lot
        of hands go up.
      

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.730

        $20 million for one buy
        recommendation.
      

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.280

        How many people?


00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.080

        Honestly, now.


00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.530

        Honest answer.


00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.270

        The class' professor had been
        there for the vote.
      

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.490

        The Reverend Tom Sullivan is
        a Presbyterian minister.
      

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.730

        What would Jesus have
        thought of it?
      

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.750

        [LAUGHTER]


00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.960

        Jesus would have said, "oh come
        on, you can't do that.
      

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.920

        And you know you can't do it."
        He would have been a good Jew
      

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.860

        in saying that.


00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.600

        He'd be a good Christian
        in saying that.
      

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.920

        He'd be a good Hindu, he'd be
        a good Buddhist. Nobody who
      

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.890

        takes any kind of spiritual
        values seriously is going to
      

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.390

        say, oh yeah, that's fine.


00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.220

        Indeed, spiritual values
        may explain the
      

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.300

        results of one last vote.


00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.770

        How many of you would imagine
        that your parents think that
      

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.800

        your generation is less
        ethical than theirs?
      

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.980



00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.160

        Every single one of you.


00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.050

        Now not everyone thinks
        we're going to
      

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.700

        hell in a hand basket.


00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.570

        Ed Petrie, who runs the nation's
        largest group of
      

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.670

        in-house corporate ethics
        officers, says that in some
      

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.430

        areas ethical standards
        have improved.
      

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.660

        Conflict of interest inside the
        organization, gifts and
      

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.800

        gratuities, time charging,
        sexual harassment issues,
      

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.980

        diversity issues.


00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.370

        Vast improvement on those
        fronts inside the
      

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.800

        organization.


00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.880

        But nobody was paying much
        attention to things like
      

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.380

        corporate governance, reporting
        your financial
      

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:02.870

        statements.


00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.780

        Well, I won't say people weren't
        paying attention to
      

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.770

        them, but part of the problem
        is that the expectations are
      

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.660

        much higher than they
        used to be.
      

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.900

        And you also have far more
        employees who are willing to
      

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.910

        come forward with allegations.


00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:22.010

        And you have the public, who is
        looking and eager to hold
      

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.110

        companies to a higher standard
        and want them to be
      

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.900

        accountable.


00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.410

        But is corporate America
        responding by hiring ethicists
      

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.910

        like Barbara Toffler?


00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.290

        Do I have a lot of work as a
        business ethics consultant?
      

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.130

        No.


00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.990

        Instead, Toffler is writing a
        book on her years at Arthur
      

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.580

        Andersen and teaching ethics at
        Columbia Business School.
      

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.550

        Easier perhaps than teaching
        them the real world of recent
      

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.270

        years, since in economic terms
        the bigger the payoffs became
      

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.900

        for playing fast and loose, the
        greater the cost of being
      

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.950

        ethical in terms of risks not
        taken, opportunities foregone.
      

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.450



00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.590

        Of course that's true of any
        boom, not just this one,
      

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.570

        suggesting that in the end
        business ethics may simply be
      

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.950

        at one of its cyclical ebbs.


00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.240

        But whether we've hit new lows
        or not, Daniel Colton's words
      

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.660

        ring equally true.


00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.680

        Please, please be vigilant, be
        careful, be honest, be open.
      

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.510

        Do not expose yourself to
        these kinds of dangers.
      

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.610

        Words easier to say than to live
        by, it seems, when you
      

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.960

        get down to business.


00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:37.350



00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.200

        Finally tonight, business
        ethics.
      

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.420

        Enron, Andersen, Global
        Crossing,
      

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.890

        Tyco, and now, Worldcom.


00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.790

        Our business correspondent, Paul
        Solomon of WGBH Boston,
      

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.830

        has been looking into these
        recent scandals of cooked
      

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.390

        books and other corporate
        misdoings.
      

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.390

        Here's part two of his series,
        A Talk with Five Veteran
      

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.800

        Business Journalists.


00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.730

        It was conducted before the
        most recent Worldcom news
      

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.670

        Thank you all for coming.


00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.500

        First question.


00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.100

        Has American business hit some
        kind of ethical ebb?
      

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.770

        Where are the sounds of the
        tumbrils rolling through the
      

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.540

        cobblestone streets to
        the guillotines.
      

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.280

        Of course it has.


00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:16.850

        JP Morgan--


00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.600

        Loyal PBS viewers will recognize
        the first journalist
      

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.100

        as the eponymous host of Adam
        Smith's Money World.
      

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.960

        Now we've seen famous firms
        eager to sell themselves out
      

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.140

        just to make this
        year's numbers.
      

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.690

        There is an old line that the
        four most dangerous words on
      

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.310

        Wall Street are, "this time,
        it's different."
      

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.020

        Next, Allan Sloane, financial
        writer for Newsweek.
      

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.530

        We're not in any ethical ebb.


00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.080

        What you're seeing now
        is what's been
      

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.280

        going on for years.


00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.950

        Now it's only surfaced.


00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.850

        It's not that things are worse
        now than they were.
      

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.210

        It's that you're seeing
        how bad they were.
      

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.150

        The question is, what is the
        quality of our miscreants
      

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.000

        versus the miscreants
        of yesteryear?
      

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.550

        And I submit to you that ours
        are ever so much worse.
      

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.360

        Jim Grant was with Barron's in
        the 1970's, and now writes and
      

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.350

        edits Grant's Interest
        Rate Observer.
      

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.770

        I'm not sure that people were
        nobler or more honest in the
      

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.940

        past. I dare way
        they were not.
      

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.570

        But I think the standards of
        behavior were better on Wall
      

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.730

        Street and in finance.


00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.650

        One of my readers has suggested
        the Wheel of
      

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:18.400

        Misfortune.


00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.500

        Andy Tobias, personal finance
        writer since 1970.
      

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.860

        White collar criminals would get
        the trials that they now
      

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.340

        get, and every so often
        someone is convicted.
      

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.110

        But then they go to the
        Wheel of Misfortune.
      

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.080

        And if you're unlucky and you're
        the tenth or the twenty
      

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.330

        second or whatever number it is,
        you get the death penalty.
      

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:39.830

        Now let's say to make it
        actually a little bit less
      

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.080

        silly, you get some serious
        prison where you don't get to
      

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.280

        play tennis and you don't have
        a phone in your room, and you
      

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.840

        don't have a double bed.


00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.020

        I want to take it more back to
        executive compensation and
      

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.270

        stock options and that
        kind of thing.

        Carol Loomis started covering
        business for
      

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.660

        Fortune magazine in 1954.


00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:01.020

        But I believe that much of this
        bad behavior is tied to
      

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.410

        what I have called in the past,
        the madness of executive
      

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.270

        compensation.


00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.470

        And to the arrogance that sort
        of comes out of that, where
      

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.990

        the guys think they
        can do anything.
      

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.470

        And I say, guys, advisedly,
        because there aren't many of
      

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.160

        my sex in this.


00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.370

        Well the sense I get is that
        everyone, or many people in
      

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.550

        the public, are outraged but
        everybody was doing it.
      

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.550

        Am I wrong?


00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:27.010

        What I'm wondering is,
        why aren't the
      

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:28.970

        American people angrier?


00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.430

        Will we see some of this anger
        in the months to come?
      

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.430

        How do they exhibit the anger,
        if they are angry?
      

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.120

        They can withdraw
        from the market.
      

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.220

        And I think we are indeed
        seeing some of that.
      

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.080

        But I don't think we have seen
        the kind of withdrawal from
      

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.020

        the market that yet says that
        we're going to burn everybody
      

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.410

        who's involved here
        at the guillotine.
      

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:54.610

        I think the anger is going to
        come from people who thought
      

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.930

        they had paid for their
        retirement.
      

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:02.810

        After all, we had a big move to
        the 401(K)s, and we had--
      

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.970

        in order to get the pension
        obligations off the company's
      

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:09.590

        expense sheet.


00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.790

        So we moved the people in.


00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.220

        And if you're in your own
        company stock, and the company
      

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.860

        is Enron, you've lost
        your pension.
      

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.820

        And even in those companies that
        are not Enron, many of
      

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.640

        them have very desiccated
        looking 401(K)s.
      

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.990

        Well, people-- on the upside,
        no one was complaining when
      

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.810

        things got so unrealistic and
        people thought they could
      

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.460

        retire young because the
        market was going
      

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.780

        to go up 15% a year.


00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.130

        Maybe one of the reasons the
        outrage isn't quite what it
      

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.950

        will be if things keep going is
        that, to a certain extent,
      

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.830

        people somehow know that some
        of this wasn't real.
      

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:46.350

        They knew some of this
        wasn't real.
      

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.280

        But I think people
        will go to jail.
      

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.700

        I think people should
        go to jail.
      

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.920

        And I think a certain number of
        people are outraged enough
      

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.010

        that they would like
        to see that.
      

00:16:55.010 --> 00:17:00.680

        I'm not quite as convinced that
        sending a few of these
      

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.000

        people to jail will kill the
        wrongdoing out there.
      

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.550

        We saw Michael Milken go to
        jail, and that doesn't seem to
      

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.490

        have done much at all.


00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.610

        The question is--


00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:14.420

        you don't have to shoot them,
        you have to scare the others.
      

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.970

        It takes a long time for
        people to go to jail.
      

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.190

        It takes a long time
        to get indictments.
      

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.880

        Look at this fellow, Kozlowski
        from Tyco.
      

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.730

        The company goes offshore a few
        years ago, ducks out on
      

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.290

        probably by now a billion
        dollars of federal income tax,
      

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.670

        and nobody cares.


00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:33.850

        New York state gets him for a
        million dollars of sales tax
      

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.530

        personally, and he's criminally
        indicted.
      

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.730

        The likes of Kozlowski are
        reminders that in any capital
      

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:45.660

        society, there is an implicit
        social contract between the
      

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:46.520

        rich and the others.


00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.740

        And the idea is that the rich
        can get as rich as they like,
      

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.700

        as long as the poor can
        also try to get rich.
      

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.260

        But when there is a breach of
        the contract, when the rich
      

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:02.740

        take what is not theirs,
        there is a sense that
      

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.730

        something is wrong and.


00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.580

        And the result is that envy
        and avarice meet head on.
      

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.380

        And that is what I think we're
        looking at socially with the
      

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.630

        contemporary crop of bad guys.


00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.100

        It's one wishes one had lived
        in the Coolidge boom.
      

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.440

        It's a lot easier to cheat now
        than it used to be, I think.
      

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.110

        It used to be if you wanted to
        make up phony numbers, you had
      

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.800

        to sit, the numbers had to add
        up across and down, you needed
      

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.890

        imagination.


00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.680

        Now with the spreadsheet,
        you're just pushing your
      

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.750

        conclusions, you work backwards
        to your assumptions,
      

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.090

        you get the accountants
        to sign anything.
      

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.210

        And then it all gets
        disseminated
      

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:37.610

        in about three seconds.


00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.330

        And what we're seeing now is
        not what's happening now.
      

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.140

        We're seeing now what happened
        three and five
      

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.280

        and seven years ago.


00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.540

        That surface economy.


00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.950

        Right, it's a new economy
        of frauds.
      

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.960

        Another factor is the multiplier
        in the bubble
      

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.880

        economy was so much greater.


00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.920

        That is, everything went
        up so much more.
      

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.570

        You could have a company--


00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.550

        there are always little
        companies coming out that
      

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.820

        weren't worth very much, but
        you couldn't have them be
      

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.810

        worth $5 billion, $10 billion,
        the day they came out, when
      

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.630

        they still have no earnings
        and no earning power.
      

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.700

        That didn't happen--


00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.230

        --or revenues.


00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.230

        --or revenues, or anything.


00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.810

        In other words, this was the
        biggest boom in fiction since
      

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:23.740

        Dickens and Thackeray in the
        mid-nineteenth century.
      

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.940

        The legacy of a boom is excess
        in all forms. During the great
      

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.840

        bubble years, the late
        90's, capital was
      

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.210

        virtually free to takers.


00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.320

        You signed up an investment bank
        and basically you funded
      

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.900

        your enterprise.


00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.180

        People availed themselves
        of it.
      

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.960

        They built stuff.


00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.830

        They built to excess.


00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.190

        And the excess weighs
        on an economy.
      

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.740

        When when there's too
        much investment,
      

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.700

        people produce too much.


00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.940

        They produce too much at
        uneconomic margins.
      

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.500

        They drive out competitors who
        haven't got free capital
      

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.330

        behind them.


00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.470

        The result is a kind of a
        chronic low level of virus in
      

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.210

        the economy.


00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.820

        And people talk about
        stagnation.
      

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.370

        Japan has been sitting in the
        soup for about a decade.
      

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.560

        It too had a bubble.


00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.090

        It refused to clear
        the debris.
      

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.320

        It wouldn't let markets work.


00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.730

        It wouldn't mark things down.


00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.840

        And lo and behold, it's
        still struggling.
      

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.150

        But you explain it
        the way Jim does.
      

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.160

        That is that a bubble, or period
        of euphoria, inevitably
      

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.310

        brings with it weird,
        aberrant behavior.
      

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.540

        You don't see the bones on the
        beach 'til the tide goes out.
      

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.060

        And what you're seeing now is
        the bones on the beach.
      

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.160

        There's more to come.


00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.080

        I've always heard that you
        never know who's swimming
      

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.420

        naked 'til the tide goes out.


00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.210

        Which I like much better
        than the bones.
      

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.570

        Ever since the SEC came into
        being, we've had an
      

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:51.920

        expectation that the markets
        supposedly are working well
      

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.450

        under a strong regulatory
        scheme.
      

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:58.210

        And so you don't expect the
        kind of thing that is
      

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.060

        happening today.


00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.500

        And also, I think
        it's very broad.
      

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.850

        To borrow a line from Warren
        Buffett, the people who are
      

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:11.250

        engaging in bad behavior today
        are people that you would be
      

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:15.200

        willing to have marry your
        daughter, or be a trustee of
      

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.390

        your trust. But there isn't--


00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.920

        these people are accepting
        that it's OK to do this
      

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.320

        managing the books and doing
        anything to produce the kind
      

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.510

        of earnings that is desired.


00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.450

        My question is, here are great
        firms like Morgan Stanley and
      

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:36.530

        Merrill Lynch, and they are
        paying people $15 million a
      

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:42.130

        year for a product that
        they know is not
      

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:43.300

        really first class.


00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:47.290

        And if they have any sense of
        history, it's going to lose a
      

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:48.850

        lot of people a lot of money.


00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:51.900

        But it will make money
        this quarter.
      

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.670

        And so that's why they do it.


00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.860

        It's a kind of myopia,
        that is terrifying.
      

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.860

        I don't know what the
        repercussions should be for
      

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.610

        someone like that.


00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.120

        But a lifelong of happy,
        repercussion-free retirement?
      

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.760

        I don't think so.


00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.190

        Would you feel the same if they
        were making $200,000 a
      

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.350

        year, instead of $15 million?


00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.610

        Well I think--


00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:14.710

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.000

        less.


00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.430

        But you know, for not being paid
        much, you figure maybe
      

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.970

        they're doing it to preserve
        their job or to try to somehow
      

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.170

        pay for their child's bad leg.


00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:26.270

        But for $15 million, you figure
        that they're doing it
      

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.500

        because they want to be
        rich beyond imagining.
      

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.310

        So it was just a question of a
        screwed up set of incentives?
      

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.810

        Wall Street has never
        been a holy place.
      

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.380

        Wall Street is always greedy.


00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.620

        It's the nature of the beast.
        What happened was, there was
      

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.240

        far more money around than
        ever, the boom was
      

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.690

        greater than ever.


00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:48.210

        And largely because of the
        Internet, and partly because
      

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.900

        certain members of my profession
        fell for this
      

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.850

        nonsense or promoted some of
        these people who shouldn't
      

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.900

        have been allowed out without
        keepers, you had this
      

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.470

        irrational boom, this idea that
        everybody can get rich.
      

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:04.270

        All of us here, all
        of us panelists,
      

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.690

        knew this wasn't true.


00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.230

        But you'd raise your voice, it
        didn't make any difference.
      

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.070

        It was like madness and it
        burned out about 2000, and now
      

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.920

        the hunt is on for villains.


00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.780

        Thank you all very much.


00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:28.310



00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:32.040

        Today it was Xerox and questions
        over its accounting.
      

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.000

        The scandals hitting corporate
        America continue to unravel
      

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.070

        and our business correspondent,
        Paul Solomon of
      

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.980

        WGBH Boston, continues to shed
        some light on them for us.
      

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.550

        Here's part three of his series
        on Money and Ethics.
      

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:49.140

        This one focuses on
        the behavior of
      

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.800

        investment stock analysts.


00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.540

        I'm looking at your portfolio
        right now.
      

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.300

        You've got to buy.


00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.210

        A new ad for discount broker
        Charles Schwab, playing off
      

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.940

        one of the year's top
        business scandals.
      

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.930

        I think you should buy.


00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.310

        It's a buy.


00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.710

        Buy it.


00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.260

        Just buy.


00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.000

        It's a no brainer.


00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.250

        I'd sell.


00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:05.500



00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.210

        Did I say sell?


00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:10.080

        No, no, I meant buy, buy, yes.


00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.220

        The ad mocks Wall Street firms
        touting stocks not because
      

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:16.140

        they like the companies, but
        because they were getting paid
      

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.350

        to hype them, despite
        misgivings
      

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.080

        documented in their emails.


00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.650

        This is only a sample of some of
        the communications revealed
      

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.410

        in our investigation.


00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.940

        New York Attorney General Eliot
        Spitzer has made a name
      

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.020

        for himself by going after Wall
        Street, getting Merrill
      

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.610

        Lynch to pay a $100
        million fine for
      

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:34.310

        having misled investors.


00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.470

        The motive was investment
        banking fees and enormous
      

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.360

        personal compensation
        for the analysts.
      

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:43.650

        In the process, an untold number
        of people were left to
      

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.500

        rely on stock ratings the
        analysts themselves didn't
      

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.980

        believe, and there's
        no telling how much
      

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.830

        they lost as a result.


00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.860

        Merrill has also promised
        reforms to prevent such abuses
      

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.460

        in the future.


00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.390

        But several questions remain.


00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:02.120

        Why did so many analysts
        become stock shills?
      

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.560

        And why did so few of us seem
        to notice until now?
      

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.700

        We start in good old PBS fashion
        with a bit of history,
      

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.720

        and a good old PBS celebrity.


00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.160

        The host of Adam Smith's Money
        World started as a stock
      

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.570

        analyst in 1960 at
        a modest salary.
      

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:25.030

        It was barely $15,000 a year,
        and it was a kind of like a
      

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.660

        treasure hunt.


00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.830

        The field wasn't a very crowded
        And you'd go out and
      

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.980

        you'd see the competitors of a
        company, you'd see the people
      

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.730

        that the company sold to, you'd
        see the company that the
      

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.900

        people who supplied the company
        with its goods.
      

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.270

        Only at the very end would you
        go to see the company itself.
      

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.260

        Now the title stock analyst
        describes the job, analyzing
      

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.310

        companies, their revenues,
        profits, their business, so
      

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.300

        that investors can decide
        whether or not
      

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.800

        to buy their stock.


00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.190

        It was basically a search
        for the truth.
      

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.890

        Money manager Alan Benasuli
        describes what he was looking
      

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.940

        for as an analyst in
        1966, fresh from
      

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.150

        Harvard Business School.


00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.890

        Is it true that the ratings
        are going to be rising, as
      

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.230

        they tell us they will?


00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.500

        If they're not, why
        will they not?
      

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.510

        And what will be the impact
        on the price of the stock,
      

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.610

        assuming we are right
        and they're wrong?
      

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.020

        And Benasuli was right enough to
        be named airline analyst of
      

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.890

        the year six times by


00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.380

        Institutional Investor magazine.


00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.760

        Its readers were the big money
        managers at banks, insurance
      

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.350

        companies, pension funds
        and the like.
      

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:35.880

        The more helpful they found
        Benasuli's analysis, the more
      

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.810

        stock trades they funneled
        through his firm, which
      

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.810

        charged hefty commissions fixed
        at a sizable percentage
      

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.890

        of the trade's total value.


00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.520

        The firm then paid the analyst
        from those commissions since,
      

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.650

        after all, he'd helped
        bring them in.
      

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.060

        In other words, the way you
        got paid was sort of
      

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.550

        indirectly, in that the people
        who read your reports and
      

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:00.730

        trusted them would buy or sell
        stocks through your firm.
      

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:01.300

        That is correct.


00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.180

        That was called soft dollars
        or commissions, general
      

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.680

        commissions.


00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.500

        And then that disappeared.


00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:15.240

        The disappearance began on May
        1, 1975, known forever on Wall
      

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.310

        Street as May Day, the day the
        government forced Wall Street
      

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:22.970

        to compete on price instead
        of charging fixed stock
      

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:23.970

        commissions.


00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.160

        And not surprisingly,


00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.960

        commissions promptly plummeted.


00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.710

        The going rate went very quickly
        to twenty cents, and
      

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.860

        ten cents, and six cents
        per share, which
      

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.440

        is what it is today.


00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.530

        And therefore, the firms were in
        their research business had
      

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.430

        to find ways to get paid.


00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.620

        The way they found to get paid
        in the 80s was investment
      

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:49.230

        banking, the new profit center
        of the old brokerage houses.
      

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.320

        Investment bankers did mergers
        and acquisitions, took
      

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.020

        companies public by selling
        millions of dollars of their
      

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.940

        stock in IPOs, initial
        public offerings.
      

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.680

        The commissions on these
        deals were enormous.
      

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.880

        Analysts were now valuable to
        the extent they could help the
      

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.860

        investment bankers.


00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.180

        In the early 90s, just as the
        system was changing, analyst
      

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:15.180

        Tom Brown switched brokerage
        firms and joined DLJ.
      

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.720

        Their compensation system was
        every quarter, you got a check
      

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.520

        for any investment banking
        transaction
      

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:23.780

        that you helped with.


00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.430

        At the time, Brown was
        considered Wall Street's top
      

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.620

        bank analyst, renowned
        for his research.
      

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.410

        But he was paid only a fourth as
        much as a hot new colleague
      

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:37.320

        who was much more involved in
        investment banking deals.
      

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.110

        Brown's epiphany, he says, came
        on the day his colleague
      

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.450

        addressed a DLJ analysts
        conference in
      

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.100

        confessional mode.


00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:51.800

        And his line was, to work well
        with selling deals that you
      

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.020

        had to be able to say, "Father
        forgive me, for I have
      

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.530

        sinned." And he went on to say
        that the way you sold deals
      

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.510

        was basically to lie and
        exaggerate about
      

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.960

        the company's prospects.


00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.320

        He said this to the
        entire group?
      

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.520

        That's what he said.


00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.510

        Nearly everyone played this
        game, as an old college
      

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.070

        classmate of mine told
        me in January.
      

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.950

        When I was in industry, and
        I was a senior financial
      

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.680

        executive at two New York Stock
        Exchange companies, I
      

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.440

        used to say to the analysts,
        you want to be in the deal?
      

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.920



00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.880

        All right, we're going to
        earn a $1.35 next year.
      

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.950

        This is what each division
        is going to make.
      

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.750

        This is what the company
        is going to do.
      

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.330

        And if you write or say anything
        different from what
      

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.660

        I'm telling you, you won't
        be in our next offering.
      

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.530

        You mean your company, your bank
        will not get a piece of
      

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.130

        the action?


00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:45.850

        Right.


00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.130

        When I was in industry--


00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:48.850

        You would actually
        say that to them?
      

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.100

        Absolutely.


00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.210



00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:55.300

        Why are you looking at
        me like it's strange?
      

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.930

        I wanted one story out there.


00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:00.850

        I wanted every analyst to
        have the same story.
      

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.280

        And if they weren't willing to
        go along with exactly the way
      

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.750

        I wanted that story managed,
        I wouldn't
      

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.770

        take their phone calls.


00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.200

        Look like people were listening
        to you and buying on
      

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.110

        your list.


00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.210

        It had a pretty good
        day today.
      

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.750

        You can see how within such a
        system analysts helped inflate
      

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:17.580

        the stock bubble.


00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:22.020

        We're forecasting 25% growth
        this year, 30 % next, and 25%
      

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.880

        the following year.


00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.650

        In the 60s, says Alan Benasuli,
        he spent 90% of his
      

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.020

        time on research.


00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.630

        And I would say that of my
        recommendations, maybe 30% of
      

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.140

        my universe were buys.


00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:38.820

        Benasuli says that by the 90s,
        analysts were spending 10% of
      

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:44.180

        their time on research, their
        buy recommendations up to 98%.
      

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.720

        Star internet analyst
        Mary Meeker on
      

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.300

        the wild tech sector.


00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:51.110

        It would seem then that the
        new pay system turned the
      

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:54.200

        analyst game and the internet
        stock boom into something
      

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.240

        deeply cynical.


00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.510

        Give us your quick picks.


00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.050

        What are the stocks to own?


00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.070

        Yahoo, Amazon and EBay.


00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.210

        But that ignores another
        important element.
      

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.420

        Boundless enthusiasm.


00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.280

        The economy was in recession.


00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.260

        Jack Hidary was an internet
        entrepreneur who took his
      

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.390

        company public in an
        IPO in the 90s.
      

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.890

        And though he auditioned many
        investment banks and their
      

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.410

        analysts, he says CEOs like him
        were never thinking about
      

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:22.910

        conflicts of interest.


00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.110

        You're not thinking
        that at all.
      

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.350

        No.


00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.120

        What you're really thinking
        is, I'm excited, I want to
      

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.690

        take my company public, I want
        to raise capital for my
      

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.650

        company so that we can then
        expand our company.
      

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:32.880

        That's what you're thinking.


00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.850

        And you think, oh, he
        understands me.
      

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.560

        Exactly.


00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:37.680

        He knows the space,


00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.830

        understands me, gets my company.


00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.940

        It was only after Hidary's
        company crashed that he began
      

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.930

        to realize how corrupted the
        system had become, how
      

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.620

        compromised analysts were.


00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.730

        Traditional research goes to the
        CEOs of companies and asks
      

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.600

        them, how is your
        company doing?
      

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:57.630

        Well it turns out, most often
        the answer is, pretty well.
      

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.410

        What a surprise.


00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.980

        Yeah, what a surprise.


00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.480

        And so he decided to open Vista
        Research, a new firm--
      

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.930

        That did not have any banking,
        any mergers and acquisitions
      

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:12.180

        advisory work, any trading,
        really just pure research.
      

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:16.200

        And we only get paid by one
        kind of company, the fund
      

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.050

        manager, the investor.


00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:22.630

        We do not get paid by the
        companies that we talk about.
      

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.340

        So perhaps stock analysis
        post-bubble will return to the
      

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.690

        golden days of yesteryear,
        assuming of course that
      

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.130

        investors will actually pay
        enough to fund extensive,
      

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.450

        unbiased research.


00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.420

        Upgrading the stock
        to a strong buy--
      

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.740

        But if they do, it will be a
        very different environment
      

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.730

        from the one stock analysts have
        grown into in the last
      

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:43.810

        decade or two.


00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.300

        The younger analysts
        particularly, they didn't know
      

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.270

        anything else.


00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.430

        So they weren't around when the
        analysts really did good,
      

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.100

        hard research.


00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.380

        All they knew was promotion.


00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:57.030

        And that's what was so
        distressing to see, is their
      

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.220

        lack of concern about
        the people who were
      

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.320

        buying these deals.


00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.040

        They didn't care about
        whether the
      

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.540

        company actually succeeded.


00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:08.040

        They just wanted to do the
        transaction, because that's
      

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.360

        how they got paid.


00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.670

        Anybody ever take them aside and
        say, hey you know, you've
      

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.950

        got these other constituents,
        that is to say the investors
      

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.340

        you're giving advice to.


00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.140

        No, nobody ever talked
        about that.
      

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.780

        I was the odd man out.


00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.990

        Nobody on Wall Street ever
        talked about that, nor did
      

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.030

        they want Tom Brown to.


00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:30.240

        Even after he was fired back in
        1998 for refusing, he says,
      

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.830

        to tout questionable deals.


00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.990

        His severance pay discussions,
        according to him, dragged on
      

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.810

        for months because--


00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:41.810

        --in the whole negotiation, what
        they wouldn't give up on
      

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.350

        is that Tom Brown couldn't speak
        to the media about his
      

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.490

        departure from DLJ.


00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.910

        And for that, they were willing
        to pay me half a
      

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.810

        million dollars.


00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.370

        $500,000 just for
        that one clause.
      

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.710

        That's just for that clause.


00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.650

        DLJ's response, "such clauses
        are common on Wall Street, and
      

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:04.580

        Brown was fired for other
        reasons." But the one
      

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.140

        certainty, Tom Brown
        refused the money.
      

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.630

        Let's get back to our original
        question, however.
      

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.320

        Why did some analysts become
        virtual shills?
      

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.050

        Because the end of fixed high
        commissions meant their
      

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.340

        brokerage firms had to find
        another way to pay them.
      

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.520

        A way that proved so
        lucrative, new
      

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.520

        ethical norms took over.


00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.170

        And why did so few of us
        squawk or even notice?
      

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:32.300

        Perhaps because the system was
        so lucrative for us as well.
      

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.550

        Or as Allan Sloan of
        Newsweek puts it--
      

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.430

        --this has been going on
        for at least 18 years.
      

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.060

        And for the first 17,
        nobody cared.
      

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:42.450

        It didn't make any difference.


00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.220

        The only reason we're seeing
        any of this now is that the
      

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:49.100

        market has been in the
        dumps for 27 months,
      

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:50.860

        and people were screaming.


00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:54.970

        And perhaps more worrisomely,
        they're not investing.
      

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:57.700

        Two-thirds of investors say that
        the conflict of interest
      

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.520

        between research and banking
        is holding back
      

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.660

        the investment climate.


00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:05.160

        So the confidence of
        the investor has
      

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.110

        been lost in the system.


00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.400

        And the big picture here is that
        unless we restore that
      

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.870

        credibility, we're not going
        to be able to get our
      

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.830

        financial markets going again.


00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.140

        And if we don't, that would give
        further impetus perhaps
      

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.480

        to the furor over who helped
        create the Wall Street bubble
      

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.240

        in the first place.


00:35:24.240 --> 00:36:06.780
