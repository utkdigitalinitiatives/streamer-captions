00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.070
Romans, make way the goodAndronicus.

3
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.330
Patron of virtue, Rome'sbest champion,

4
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.000
successful in the battlesthat he fights,

5
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.370
with honor and withfortune is returned

6
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.500
from where he circumscribedwith his sword

7
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
and brought to yoke theenemies of Rome.

8
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.130
Hail, Rome,

9
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.670
victorious in thy mourningweeds.

10
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.470
Lo, as the bark that hathdischarged her freight

11
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.900
returns with preciouslading to the bay

12
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.570
from whence at first sheweighed her anchorage,

13
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.370
cometh Andronicus, boundwith laurel boughs,

14
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.430
to resalute his countrywith his tears

15
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.970
tears of true joy for hisreturn to Rome.

16
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.930
Thou great defender ofthis capitol,

17
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.700
stand gracious to therights that we intend.

18
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.100
Romans of five and twentyvaliant sons,

19
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.070
half of the number thatKing Priam had,

20
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.030
behold the poor remains,alive and dead.

21
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.530
These that survive letRome reward with love,

22
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.270
these that I bring untotheir latest home

23
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.730
with burial amongst theirancestors.

24
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.870
Here Goths have given meleave to sheathe my sword.

25
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.070
Titus, unkind and carelessof thine own,

26
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.400
why sufferest thou thysons, unburied yet,

27
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.270
to hover on the dreadfulshore of Styx?

28
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.830
Make way to lay them bytheir brethren.

29
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.530
There greet in silence, asthe dead are wont,

30
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.130
and sleep in peace, slainin your country's wars.

31
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.870
O, sacred receptacle of myjoys,

32
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.130
sweet cell of virtue andnobility,

33
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.270
how many sons hast thou ofmine in store

34
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.800
that thou wilt neverrender to me more?

35
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.470
Give us the proudestprisoner of the Goths,

36
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.730
that we may hew his limbsand on a pile,

37
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.730
ad manes fratrum,sacrifice his flesh

38
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.970
before this earthy prisonof their bones

39
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.930
that so the shadows be notunappeased

40
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.900
nor we disturbed withprodigies on earth.

41
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.830
I give you him, thenoblest that survives,

42
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.070
the eldest son of thisdistressed queen.

43
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.030
Stay, Roman brethren!

44
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.500
Gracious conqueror,victorious Titus,

45
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.470
rue the tears I shed,

46
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.330
a mother's tears inpassion for her son.

47
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.630
And if thy sons were everdear to thee,

48
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.230
O, think my son to be asdear to me.

49
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.730
Sufficeth not that we arebrought to Rome

50
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.570
to beautify thy triumphsand return captive to thee

51
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.830
and to thy Roman yoke; butmust my sons

52
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.070
be slaughtered in thestreets for valiant doings

53
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.900
in their country's cause?

54
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.530
O, if to fight for kingand commonweal

55
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.470
were piety in thine, it isin these.

56
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.730
Andronicus, stain not thytomb with blood.

57
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.100
Wilt thou draw near thenature of the gods?

58
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.830
Draw near them, then, inbeing merciful.

59
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.930
Sweet mercy is nobility'strue badge.

60
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.770
Thrice noble Titus, sparemy firstborn son.

61
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.070
Patient yourself, madam,and pardon me.

62
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.730
These are their brethrenwhom your Goths beheld,

63
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.530
alive and dead, and fortheir brethren slain

64
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.300
religiously they asksacrifice.

65
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.370
To this, your son ismarked, and die he must,

66
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.670
to appease their groaningshadows that are gone.

67
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.270
Away with him, and make apath straight;

68
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.070
and with our swords, upona pile of wood,

69
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.100
let's hew his limbs tillthey be clean consumed.

70
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.030
O, cruel, irreligiouspiety!

71
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.230
Was never Scythia half sobarbarous?

72
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.300
Oppose not Scythia toambitious Rome.

73
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.170
Alarbus goes to rest, andwe survive

74
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.430
to tremble under Titus'threatening look.

75
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.530
And, madam, standresolved, but hope withal

76
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.630
the self-same gods thatarm the queen of Troy

77
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.170
with opportunity of sharprevenge

78
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.070
upon the Thracian tyrantin his tent

79
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.270
may favor Tamora, thequeen of Goths

80
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.230
when Goths were Goths andTamora was queen

81
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.170
to quit the bloody wrongsupon her foes.

82
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.570
See, lord and father, howwe have performed

83
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.000
our Roman rites: Alarbus'limbs are lopped,

84
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.730
and entrails feed thesacrificing fire,

85
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.100
whose smoke, like incense,doth perfume the sky.

86
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.900
Remaineth not but to interour brethren

87
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.170
and with loud larumswelcome them to Rome.

88
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.970
Let it be so, and letAndronicus

89
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.300
make this his latestfarewell to their souls.

90
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.170
In peace and honor restyou here, my sons.

91
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.730
Rome's readiest champions,repose you here in rest,

92
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.600
secure from worldlychances and mishaps.

93
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.130
Here lurks no treason;here no envy swells.

94
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.030
Here grow no damned drugs;here are no storms,

95
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.870
no noise but silence andeternal sleep.

96
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.830
In peace and honor restyou here, my sons.

97
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.400
In peace and honor liveLord Titus long.

98
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.100
My noble lord and father,live in fame.

99
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.970
Lo, at this tomb, mytributary tears I render

100
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.500
for my brethren'sobsequies.

101
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.330
And at thy feet I kneelwith tears of joy

102
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.500
shed on this earth for thyreturn to Rome.

103
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.530
O, bless me here with thyvictorious hand,

104
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.570
whose fortunes Rome's bestcitizens applaud.

105
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.870
Kind Rome, that hast thuslovingly reserved

106
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.870
the cordial of mine age toglad my heart.

107
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.470
Lavinia, live; outlive thyfather's days

108
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.330
and fame's eternal date,for virtue's praise.

109
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.270
Succession Saturninus.Succession Saturninus.

110
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.970
Succession Saturninus.Succession Saturninus.

111
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.900
Succession Saturninus.Succession!

112
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.700
Noble patricians, patronsof my right,

113
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.870
defend the justice of mycause with arms.

114
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.170
And, countrymen, my lovingfollowers,

115
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.830
plead my successive titlewith your swords.

116
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.070
I am his firstborn sonthat was the last thatwear

117
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.870
the imperial diadem ofRome.

118
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.330
Then let my father'shonors live in me,

119
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.470
nor wrong mine age withthis indignity.

120
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.830
Romans, friends,followers, favorers of myright,

121
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.470
if ever Bassianus,Caesar's son,

122
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.730
were gracious in the eyesof royal Rome,

123
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.630
keep then this passage tothe capitol

124
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.030
and suffer not dishonor toapproach the imperialseat.

125
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.870
To virtue consecrate

126
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.930
to justice, continence,and nobility.

127
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.770
But let desert in pureelection shine

128
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.470
and Romans fight forfreedom in your choice.

129
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.330
Princes, that strive byfactions and by friends

130
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.800
ambitiously for rule andempery,

131
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.400
know that the people ofRome,

132
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.430
for whom we stand aspecial party,

133
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.100
have, by common voice inelection for the Romanempery,

134
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.100
chosen Andronicus,surnamed Pius

135
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.300
for many good and greatdesserts to Rome.

136
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.500
A nobler man, a braverwarrior

137
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.830
lives not this day withinthe city wall.

138
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.000
He by the senate isaccited home

139
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.670
from weary wars againstthe barbarous Goths

140
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.870
that with his sons, aterror to our foes,

141
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.200
hath yoked a nationstrong, trained up inarms.

142
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.870
Ten years are spent

143
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.930
since first he undertookthis cause for Rome

144
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.400
and chastised with armsour enemies' pride.

145
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.000
Five times, he hathreturned bleeding to Rome,

146
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.100
bearing his valiant sonsin coffins from the field.

147
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.800
And at this day,

148
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.300
to the monument of theAndronici done sacrificeof expiation

149
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.130
and slain the noblestprisoner of the Goths.

150
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.230
And now at last, ladenwith honor's spoils,

151
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.930
returns the goodAndronicus to Rome;

152
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.800
renowned Titus,flourishing in arms.

153
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.900
Let us entreat, by honorof his name

154
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.330
whom worthily you wouldhave now succeed

155
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.070
and in the capitol andsenate's right,

156
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.600
whom you pretend to honorand adore

157
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.230
let you withdraw you andabate your strength,

158
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.330
dismiss your followersand, as suitors should,

159
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.270
plead your desserts inpeace and humbleness.

160
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.970
How fair the tribunespeaks to calm mythoughts.

161
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.130
Marcus Andronicus, so Ido affy

162
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.430

and her to whom my thoughts arehumbled all, rich ornament,

166
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.570
that I will here dismissmy loving friends

167
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.100
and to my fortunes and thepeople's favor

168
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.300
commit my cause in balanceto be weighed.

169
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.470

as I am confident and kindto thee.

And that he will, andshall if Lucius live.

290
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.270
Traitors, avaunt!

291
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.230
Where is the emperor'sguard?

292
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.530
Treason, my lord! Laviniais surprised.

293
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.770
Surprised by whom?

294
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.370
By him that justly maybear his betrothed

295
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.630
from all the world away.

296
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.430
Brothers, help convey herhence away,

297
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.500
and with my sword, I'llkeep this door safe.

298
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.200
Follow, my lord, and I'llsoon bring her back.

299
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.700
My lord! You pass nothere.

300
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.670
What, villain boy!

301
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.800
Bar'st me my way in Rome?

302
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.830
Help, Lucius, help!

303
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.000
My lord!

304
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.700
You are unjust, and morethan so.

305
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.000
In wrongful quarrel youhave slain your son.

306
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.600
Nor thou nor here are anysons of mine.

307
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.470
My sons would never sodishonor me.

308
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.400
Traitor, restore Laviniato the emperor.

309
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.100
Dead, if you will, but notto be his wife

310
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.230
but as another's lawfulpromised love.

311
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.030
No, Titus, no.

312
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.300
The emperor needs her not;

313
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.670
nor her nor thee, nor anyof thy stock.

314
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.130
I'll trust by leisure himthat mocks me once;

315
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.430
thee never, nor thytraitorous, haughty sons,

316
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.930
confederates all thus todishonor me.

317
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:20.030
Was none in Rome to make astale but Saturnine?

318
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.400
Full well, Andronicus,

319
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.670
agree these deeds withthat proud brag of thine

320
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.600
that said'st I begged theempire at thy hands.

321
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.770
O, monstrous; whatreproachful words arethese?

322
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.800
Go thy ways; go, give thatchanging peace

323
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.000
to him that flourished forher with his sword.

324
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.330
A valiant son-in-law thoushalt enjoy,

325
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.370
one fit to bandy with thylawless sons,

326
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.000
to ruffle in thecommonwealth of Rome.

327
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.270
These words are razors tomy wounded heart.

328
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.270
I will, therefore.

329
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.870

Titus, when wert thou wontto walk alone,

355
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.770
dishonored thus, andchallenged of wrongs?

356
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.300
O, Titus, see; O, see whatthou hast done:

357
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.130
in a bad quarrel slain avirtuous son.

358
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.670
No, foolish tribune, no.

359
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.370
No son of mine, nor thou,nor these confederates

360
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.330
in the deed that hathdishonored all our family;

361
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.100
unworthy brother andunworthy sons.

362
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.030
But let us give himburial, as becomes.

363
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.230
Give Mutius burial withour brethren.

364
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.600
Traitors, away.

365
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.130
He rests not in this tomb.

366
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.730
This monument 500 yearshath stood

367
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.300
which I have sumptuouslyreedified.

368
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.570
Here none but soldiers andRome's servitors

369
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.930
repose in fame; nonebasely slain in brawls.

370
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.370
Bury him where you can.

371
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.900
He comes not here.

372
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.300
My lord, this is impietyin you.

373
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.430
My nephew Mutius' deeds doplead for him.

374
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:05.900
He must be buried with hisbrethren.

375
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.330
And shall, or him we willaccompany.

376
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.500
"And shall."

377
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.800
What villain was it spakethat word?

378
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800
He that would vouch it inany place but here.

379
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.600
What, would you bury himin my despite?

380
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.500
No, noble Titus, butentreat of thee

381
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.070
to pardon Mutius and tobury him.

382
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.830
Marcus, even thou haststruck upon my crest,

383
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.830
and with these boys, minehonor thou hast wounded.

384
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.770
My foes I do repute youevery one.

385
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.000
So trouble me no more, butget you gone.

386
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.530
He is not with himself.

387
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.700
Let us withdraw.

388
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.430
Not I, till Mutius' bonesbe buried.

389
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.370
Brother, for in that namedoth nature plead

390
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.730
Father, and in that namedoth nature speak

391
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.900
Speak thou no more, if allthe rest will speed.

392
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.630
Renowned Titus, more thanhalf my soul

393
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.830
Dear father, soul andsubstance of us all

394
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.200
Suffer thy brother Marcus

395
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.370
to inter his noble nephewhere in virtue's nest

396
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.070
that died in honor andLavinia's cause.

397
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.330
Thou art a Roman; be notbarbarous.

398
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.330
The Greeks, upon advice,did bury Ajax that slewhimself.

399
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.970
And wise Laertes' son didgraciously plead hisfunerals.

400
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.370
Let not young Mutius,then, that was thy joy,

401
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.200
be barred his entrancehere.

402
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.330
Rise, Marcus, rise.

403
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.870
The dismalest day is thisthat e'er I saw,

404
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:40.830
to be dishonored by mysons in Rome.

405
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.100
Well, bury him, and buryme the next.

406
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.670
There lie thy bones, sweetMutius, with thy friends,

407
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.530
till we with trophies doadorn thy tomb.

408
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.870
No man shed tears fornoble Mutius.

409
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.130
He lives in fame that diedin virtue's cause.

410
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.030
My lord, to step out ofthese dreary dumps

411
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.130
How comes it that thesubtle queen of Goths

412
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.630
is of a sudden thusadvanced in Rome?

413
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.730
I know not, Marcus, but Iknow it is;

414
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.830
whether by device or no,the heavens can tell.

415
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.970
Is she not, then,beholding to the man

416
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.070
that brought her for thishigh good turn so far?

417
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.070
Yes, and will nobly himremunerate.

418
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.430
So Bassianus, you haveplayed your prize.

419
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.500
God give you joy, sir, ofyour gallant bride.

420
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.900
And you of yours, my lord.

421
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.630
I say no more, nor wish noless.

422
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.130
And so I take my leave.

423
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.500
Traitor!

424
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.800
If Rome have law or wehave power,

425
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.800
thou and thy faction shallrepent this rape.

426
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.400
Rape call you it, my lord,to seize my own,

427
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.570
my true betrothed love,and now my wife?

428
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.000
But let the laws of Romedetermine all.

429
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.200
Meanwhile am I possessedof that is mine.

430
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.030
'Tis good, sir; you arevery short with us.

431
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.030
But if we live, we'll beas sharp with you.

432
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.530
My lord, what I have done,as best I may,

433
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.130
answer I must, and shalldo with my life.

434
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.730
Only thus much I give YourGrace to know:

435
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.630
by all the duties that Iowe to Rome,

436
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.700
this noble gentleman, LordTitus here,

437
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.030
is in opinion and in honorwronged;

438
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.930
that in the rescue ofLavinia with his own hand

439
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.730
did slay his youngest sonin zeal to you

440
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.600
and highly moved to wrathto be controlled

441
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.730
in that he frankly gave.

442
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.170
Receive him then to favor,Saturnine,

443
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.100
that hath expressedhimself in all his deeds

444
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.570
a father and a friend tothee and Rome.

445
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.330
Prince Bassianus, leave toplead my deeds.

446
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.100
'Tis thou and these thathath dishonored me.

447
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.270
Rome and the righteousheavens be my judge

448
00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.930
how I have loved andhonored Saturnine.

449
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:07.370
My worthy lord, if everTamora were gracious

450
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.900
in those princely eyes ofthine, then hear me speak

451
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.230
indifferently for all, andat my suit, sweet,

452
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.630
pardon what has passed.

453
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.400
What, madam, be dishonoredopenly

454
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.670
and basely put it upwithout revenge?

455
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.630
Not so, my lord.

456
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.100
The gods of Rome forfend

457
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.930
I should be author todishonor you.

458
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.130
But on mine honor may Iundertake

459
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.130
for good Lord Titus'innocence in all,

460
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.570
whose fury not dissembledspeaks his griefs.

461
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.570
And at my suit, lookgraciously on him.

462
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:40.630
Lose not so noble a friendon vain suppose,

463
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:46.230
nor with sour looksafflict his gentle heart.

464
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.630
My lord, be ruled by me.

465
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.430
Be won at last.

466
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.800
Dissemble all your griefsand discontents.

467
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.770
You are but newly plantedin your throne.

468
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.370
Lest then the people andpatricians too

469
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.700
upon a just survey takeTitus' part,

470
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.070
and so supplant you foringratitude

471
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.270
which Rome reputes to be aheinous sin

472
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:10.000
yield at entreats, andthen let me alone.

473
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.130
I'll find a day tomassacre them all

474
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.730
and raise their factionand their family,

475
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.130
the cruel father and histraitorous sons

476
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.970
to whom I sued for my dearson's life,

477
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.130
and make them know what'tis to let a queen

478
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.330
kneel in the streets andbeg for grace in vain.

479
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.030
Come, come, sweet emperor.

480
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.600
Come, Andronicus.

481
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.400
Take up this good old man,and cheer the heart

482
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.070
that dies in tempest ofthy angry frown.

483
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.200
Rise, Titus, rise.

484
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.770
My empress hath prevailed.

485
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.470
I thank Your Majesty andher, my lord.

486
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.530
These words, these looksinfuse new life in me.

487
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.770
Titus, I am incorporate inRome,

488
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.400
a Roman now adoptedhappily.

489
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.570
I must advise the emperorfor his good.

490
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:02.900

And fear not, lords, andyou, Lavinia.

By my advice, all humbledon your knees,

We do, and vow to heavenand to His Highness

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:36.130
That, on mine honor, heredo I protest.

503
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.670
Away, and talk not;trouble us no more.

504
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.100
Nay, nay, sweet emperor.

505
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.230
We must all be friends.

506
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.530
The tribune and hisnephews kneel for grace.

507
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.470
I will not be denied.

508
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.000
Sweet heart, look back.

509
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.730

Stand up.

513
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.800
Lavinia, though you leftme like a churl,

514
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.500
I found a friend.

515
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.300
And sure as death, I swore

516
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.000
I would not part abachelor from the priest.

517
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:35.170
Come, if the emperor'scourt can feast twobrides,

Be it so, Titus, andgramercy too.

Now climbeth TamoraOlympus' top,

advanced above pale envy'sthreatening reach.

528
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:34.330
As when the golden sunsalutes the morn

529
00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.130
and, having gilt the oceanwith his beams,

530
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.500
gallops the zodiac in hisglistering coach

531
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:45.470
and overlooks the highestpeering hills, so Tamora.

532
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:49.400
Upon her wit doth earthlyhonor wait,

533
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.200
and virtue stoops andtrembles at her frown.

534
00:35:55.030 --> 00:36:00.600
Then, Aaron, arm thy heartand fit thy thoughts

535
00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.230
to mount aloft with thyimperial mistress,

536
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.830
and mount her pitch whomthou in triumph

537
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.430
long hast prisoner held,fettered in amorous chains

538
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.570
and faster bound toAaron's charming eyes

539
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.800
than is Prometheus tied toCaucasus.

540
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.930
Away with slavish weedsand servile thoughts.

541
00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.930
I will be bright and shinein pearl and gold

542
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:29.530
to wait upon this new-madeempress.

543
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.330
To wait, said I, to wontonwith this queen,

544
00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:37.700
this goddess, thisSemiramis, this nymph,

545
00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:42.130
this siren that will charmRome's Saturnine

546
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.170
and see his shipwreck andhis commonweal's.

547
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.370
Holloa, what storm isthis?

548
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.730
Chiron, thy years wantwit; thy wit wants edge

549
00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.070
and manners, to intrudewhere I am graced,

550
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.000
and may, for aught thouknow'st, affected be.

551
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.270
Demetrius, thou dostover-ween in all,

552
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.730
and so in this, to bear medown with braves.

553
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.470
'Tis not the difference ofa year or two

554
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:11.230
makes me less gracious orthee more fortunate.

555
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.800
I am as able and as fit asthou to serve

556
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.600
and to deserve mymistress' grace.

557
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.930
And that my sword uponthee shall approve

558
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:20.270
and plead my passions forLavinia's love.

559
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.230
Clubs, clubs; these loverswill not keep the peace.

560
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.400
Why, boy, although ourmother unadvised

561
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.470
gave you a dancing-rapierby your side,

562
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:31.370
are you so desperate grownto threat your friends?

563
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.770
Go to.

564
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.600
Have your lath gluedwithin your sheath

565
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.270
till you know better howto handle it.

566
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:39.970
Meanwhile, sir, with thelittle skill I have,

567
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.930
full well shalt thouperceive how much I dare.

568
00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.600
Grow ye so brave?

569
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.570
Why, how now, lords.

570
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:50.370
So near the emperor'spalace dare ye draw

571
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.030
and maintain such aquarrel openly?

572
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.970
Full well I wot the groundof all this grudge.

573
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:57.470
I would not for a millionof gold

574
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.970
the cause were known tothem it most concerns,

575
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.830
nor would your noblemother for much more

576
00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.570
be so dishonored in thecourt of Rome.

577
00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.870
For shame, put up.

578
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:10.300
Not I, till I havesheathed my rapier in hisbosom

579
00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.570
and withal thrust thosereproachful speeches

580
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.270
down his throat that hehath breathed in mydishonor here.

581
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.470
For that I am prepared andfull resolved.

582
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.570
Foul-spoken coward thatthunder'st with thy tongue

583
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.100
and with thy weaponnothing darest perform.

584
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.730
Away, I say.

585
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.630
Now, by the gods thatwarlike Goths adore,

586
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:33.130
this petty brabble willundo us all.

587
00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.700
Why, lords, and think younot how dangerous

588
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.830
it is to jet upon aprince's right?

589
00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:40.000
What, is Lavinia thenbecome so loose

590
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.600
or Bassianus so degeneratethat for her love suchquarrels

591
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.000
may be broached withoutcontrolment,

592
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
justice, or revenge?

593
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.770
Young lords, beware.

594
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.630
And should the empressknow this discord'sground,

595
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.430
the music would notplease.

596
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.770
I care not, I, knew sheand all the world.

597
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:02.100
I love Lavinia more thanall the world.

598
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.330
Youngling, learn thou tomake some meaner choice.

599
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.930
Lavinia is thine elderbrother's hope.

600
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.170
Are you mad, or know younot in Rome

601
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.570
how furious and impatientthey be

602
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.230
and cannot brookcompetitors in love?

603
00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:23.530
I tell you, lords, you dobut plot your deaths bythis device.

604
00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.600
Aaron, a thousand deathswould I propose

605
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.970
to achieve her whom Ilove.

606
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.230
To achieve her; how?

607
00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.700
Why make'st thou it sostrange?

608
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.630
She is a woman, thereforemay be wooed.

609
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.870
She is a woman, thereforemay be won.

610
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.700
She is Lavinia, thereforemust be loved.

611
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.370
What, man.

612
00:39:46.370 --> 00:39:50.300
More water glideth by themill than wots the millerof.

613
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.730
And easy it is of a cutloaf to steal a shive, weknow.

614
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.630
Though Bassianus be theemperor's brother,

615
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.330
better than he have wornVulcan's badge.

616
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.530
Ay, and as good asSaturninus may.

617
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.970
Then why should he despairthat knows to court it

618
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.370
with words, fair looks,and liberality?

619
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.100
What, hast not thou fulloften struck a doe

620
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.800
and borne her cleanly bythe keeper's nose?

621
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.670
Why, then, it seems somecertain snatch or so

622
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.770
would serve your turns.

623
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.370
Ay, so the turn wereserved.

624
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.870
Aaron, thou hast hit it.

625
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.200
Would you had hit it too;

626
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.500
then should not we betired with this ado.

627
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.230
Why, hark ye, hark ye,

628
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.870
and are you such fools tosquare for this?

629
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.370
Would it offend you, then,that both should speed?

630
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.900
Faith, not me.

631
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.200
Nor me, so I were one.

632
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.100
For shame, be friends, andjoin for that you jar.

633
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.530
'Tis policy and stratagemmust do that you affect.

634
00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:47.830
And so must you resolve

635
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.330
that what you cannot asyou would achieve

636
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.430
you must perforceaccomplish as you may.

637
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.030
Take this of me:

638
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.830
Lucrece was not morechaste than this Lavinia,

639
00:40:57.830 --> 00:40:59.370
Bassianus' love.

640
00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:02.330
A speedier course thanlingering languishment

641
00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.830
must we pursue, and I havefound the path.

642
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.330
My lords, a solemn huntingis in hand.

643
00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.370
There will the lovelyRoman ladies troop.

644
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.900
The forest walks are wideand spacious,

645
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.670
and many unfrequentedplots there are

646
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.070
fitted by kind for rapeand villainy.

647
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.600
Single you thither, then,this dainty doe,

648
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.000
and strike her home byforce, if not by words.

649
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.330
This way or not at allstand you in hope.

650
00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:37.730
Come, come; our empress,with her sacred wit

651
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.870
to villainy and vengeanceconsecrate,

652
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.500
will we acquaint with allthat we intend,

653
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.730
and she shall file ourengines with advice

654
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.200
that will not suffer youto square yourselves,

655
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.300
but to your wishes' heightadvance you both.

656
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.430
The emperor's court islike the house of fame,

657
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.830
the palace full oftongues, of eyes, andears.

658
00:41:56.830 --> 00:42:03.470
The woods are ruthless,dreadful, deaf, and dull.

659
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:08.030
There speak, and strike,brave boys, and take yourturns.

660
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:12.730
There serve your lust,shadowed from heaven'seye,

661
00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.770
and revel in Lavinia'streasury.

662
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.400
Thy counsel, lad, smellsof no cowardice.

663
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.800
Be it right or wrong,

664
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.030
till I find the stream tocool this heat,

665
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:25.530
a charm to calm this fits,I am in hell.

666
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.970
The hunt is up.

667
00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.070
The morn is bright andgrey.

668
00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.870
The fields are fragrant,and the woods are green.

669
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.930
Uncouple here, and let usmake a bay,

670
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.930
and wake the emperor andhis lovely bride

671
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.700
and rouse the prince andring a hunter's peal,

672
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.270
that all the court mayecho with the noise.

673
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:59.030
Sons, let it be yourcharge, as it is ours,

674
00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.570
to attend the emperor'sperson carefully.

675
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:07.770
I have been troubled in mysleep this night,

676
00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.930
but dawning day newcomfort hath inspired.

677
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.130
Many good morrows to YourMajesty.

678
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.330
Madam, to you as many andas good.

679
00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.370
I promised your grace ahunter's peal.

680
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:36.670
And you have rung itlustily, my lords;

681
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.800
somewhat too early fornew-married ladies.

682
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.130
Lavinia, how say you?

683
00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.400
I say no.

684
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.730
I have been broad awaketwo hours and more.

685
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:48.570
Come on, then.

686
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.500
Horse and chariots let ushave, and to our sport.

687
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.900
Madam, now shall ye seeour Roman hunting.

688
00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.270
I have dogs, my lord,

689
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.370
will rouse the proudestpanther in the chase

690
00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:59.800
and climb the highestpromontory top.

691
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.330
And I have horse willfollow where the game makeway

692
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.270
and run like swallows overthe plain.

693
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.970
Chiron, we hunt not, we,with horse nor hound,

694
00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:10.000
but hope to pluck a daintydoe to ground.

695
00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.070
He that had wit wouldthink that I had none,

696
00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:23.470
to bury so much gold undera tree,

697
00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.600
and never after to inheritit.

698
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.430
Let him that thinks of meso abjectly

699
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.600
know that this gold mustcoin a stratagem,

700
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.270
which, cunningly effected,will beget

701
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:37.570
a very excellent piece ofvillainy.

702
00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:41.670
And so repose, sweet gold,for their unrest

703
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.130
that have their alms outof the empress' chest.

704
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.830
My lovely Aaron, whereforelooks thou sad,

705
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:53.700
when every thing doth makea gleeful boast?

706
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.500
The birds chant melody onevery bush,

707
00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.400
the snake lies rolled inthe cheerful sun,

708
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.270
the green leaves quiverwith the cooling wind

709
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:05.570
and make a checkeredshadow on the ground.

710
00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.470
Under their sweet shade,Aaron, let us sit,

711
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.100
and whilst the babblingecho mocks the hounds,

712
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.800
replying shrilly to thewell-tuned horns,

713
00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.700
as if a double hunt wereheard at once,

714
00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:22.030
let us sit down and marktheir yellowing noise.

715
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.600
And after conflict such aswas supposed

716
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.500
the wandering prince andDido once enjoyed,

717
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.770
when with a happy stormthey were surprised

718
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:33.830
and curtained with acounsel-keeping cave,

719
00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:37.970
we may, each wreathed ineach other's arms,

720
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:43.300
our pastimes done, possessa golden slumber;

721
00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.630
whiles hounds and hornsand sweet melodious birds

722
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:51.770
be unto us as is a nurse'ssong of lullaby

723
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:54.930
to bring her babe asleep.

724
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:59.770
Madam, though Venus governyour desires,

725
00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.770
Saturn is dominator overmine.

726
00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.930
What signifies mydeadly-standing eye,

727
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:09.500
my silence and my cloudymelancholy,

728
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.830
my fleece of woolly hairthat now uncurls

729
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:15.530
even as an adder when shedoth unroll

730
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.330
to do some fatalexecution?

731
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:22.200
No, madam, these are novenereal signs.

732
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.530
Vengeance is in my heart,death in my hand.

733
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.470
Blood and revenge arehammering in my head.

734
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:32.700
Hark, Tamora, the empressof my soul,

735
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.970
which never hopes moreheaven than rests in thee,

736
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:39.600
this is the day of doomfor Bassianus.

737
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:43.130
His Philomel must lose hertongue today,

738
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.800
thy sons make pillage ofher chastity

739
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.630
and wash their hands inBassianus' blood.

740
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.370
Seest thou this letter?

741
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.700
Take it up, I pray thee,

742
00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.000
and give the king thisfatal plotted scroll.

743
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.270
Now question me no more.

744
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.600
We are espied.

745
00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.130
Here comes a parcel of ourhopeful booty

746
00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:03.130
which dreads not yet theirlives' destruction.

747
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.870
O, my sweet Moor, sweeterto me than life.

748
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:09.130
No more, great empress;Bassianus comes.

749
00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.130
Be cross with him, andI'll go fetch thy sons

750
00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:15.170
to back thy quarrels,whatsoe'er they be.

751
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.070
Who have we here, Rome'sroyal empress,

752
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.230
unfurnished of herwell-beseeming troop?

753
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.500
Or is it Dian, habitedlike her,

754
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.130
who hath abandoned herholy groves

755
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:32.800
to see the general huntingin this forest?

756
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.500
Saucy controller of myprivate steps,

757
00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.400
had I the power that somesay Dian had,

758
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.470
thy temples should beplanted presently withhorns,

759
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.470
as was Actaeon's, and thehounds

760
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:44.900
should drive upon thynew-transformed limbs,

761
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.070
unmannerly intruder asthou art.

762
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.600
Under your patience,gentle empress,

763
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.770
'tis thought you have agoodly gift in horning

764
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.700
and to be doubted that theMoor and you

765
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.170
are singled forth to tryexperiments.

766
00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.930
Jove shield your husbandfrom his hounds today.

767
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.970
'Tis pity they should takehim for a stag.

768
00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.600
Believe me, queen, yourswarth Cimmerian doth makeyour honor

769
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.500
of his body's hue:spotted, detested, andabominable.

770
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.870
Why are you sequesteredfrom all your train,

771
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:15.030
dismounted from yoursnow-white goodly steed,

772
00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.130
and wandered hither to anobscure plot,

773
00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.170
accompanied but with abarbarous Moor,

774
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.870
if foul desire had notconducted you?

775
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.330
And being intercepted inyour sport,

776
00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:29.770
great reason that my noblelord be rated forsauciness.

777
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.600
I pray you, let us hence,

778
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.670
and let her joy herraven-colored love.

779
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:37.070
This valley fits thepurpose passing well.

780
00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.430
The king, my brother,shall have note of this.

781
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:41.430
Good king, to be somightily abused.

782
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.500
Why have I patience toendure all this.

783
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.800
How now, dear sovereign,and our gracious mother.

784
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.130
Oh!

785
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.370
Why doth your highnesslook so pale and wan?

786
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.700
Have I not reason, thinkyou, to look pale?

787
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.270
These two have 'ticed mehither to this place.

788
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.030
a barren detested vale,you see it is.

789
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.470
The trees, though summer,yet forlorn and lean,

790
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:02.100
overcome with moss andbaleful mistletoe.

791
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.870
Here never shines the sun;here nothing breeds,

792
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.530
unless the nightly owl orfatal raven.

793
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.930
And when they showed methis abhorred pit,

794
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.070
they told me, here, atdead time of the night,

795
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.700
a thousand fiends, athousand hissing snakes,

796
00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.970
ten thousand swellingtoads, as many urchins,

797
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.470
would make such fearfuland confused cries

798
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:23.630
that any mortal bodyhearing it should straightrun mad,

799
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.500
or else die suddenly.

800
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.770
No sooner had they toldthis hellish tale,

801
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:30.070
but straight they told methey would bind me here

802
00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.030
unto the body of a dismalyew

803
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:34.230
and leave me to thismiserable death.

804
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.630
And then they called mefoul adulteress,

805
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:40.830
lascivious Goth, and allthe bitterest terms

806
00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.870
that ever ear did hear tosuch effect.

807
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:46.070
And had you not bywondrous fortune come,

808
00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:48.500
this vengeance on me hadthey executed.

809
00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.070
Revenge it, as you loveyour mother's life,

810
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:53.630
or be ye not henceforthcalled my children!

811
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.830
This is a witness that Iam thy son.

812
00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.170
And this for me, struckhome to show my strength.

813
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:06.970
Ay, come, Semiramis nay,barbarous Tamora,

814
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:10.130
for no name fits thynature but thine own!

815
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:12.470
Give me the poniard; youshall know, my boys,

816
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:14.770
your mother's hand shallright your mother's wrong.

817
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.870
Stay, madam; here is morebelongs to her.

818
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:19.700
First thrash the corn,then after burn the straw.

819
00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.030
This minion stood upon herchastity,

820
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:25.700
upon her nuptial vow, herloyalty,

821
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.600
and with this painted hopebraves your mightiness.

822
00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.600
And shall she carry thisunto her grave?

823
00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.670
And if she do, I would Iwere an eunuch.

824
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:36.130
Drag hence her husband tosome secret hole,

825
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:38.800
and make his dead trunkpillow to our lust.

826
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.330
But when ye have the honeywe desire,

827
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.670
let not this wasp outlive,us both to sting.

828
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:44.730
I warrant you, madam, wewill make that sure.

829
00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:47.470
Come, mistress, nowperforce we will enjoy

830
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.570
that nice-preservedhonesty of yours.

831
00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:51.670
O, Tamora, thou bearest awoman's face

832
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:53.430
I will not hear her speak;away with her.

833
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.570
Sweet lords, entreat herhear me but a word.

834
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:57.700
Listen, fair madam; let itbe your glory

835
00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.370
to see her tears, but beyour heart to them

836
00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:03.330
as unrelenting flint todrops of rain.

837
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:06.200
When did the tiger's youngones teach the dam?

838
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:09.030
O, do not learn her wrath;she taught it thee.

839
00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:11.770
The milk thou suck'dstfrom her did turn tomarble.

840
00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.530
Even at thy teat, thouhadst thy tyranny.

841
00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:17.170
Yet every mother breedsnot sons alike.

842
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:20.230
Do thou entreat her, showher a woman's pity.

843
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.000
What, wouldst thou have meprove myself a bastard?

844
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.630
'Tis true; the raven dothnot hatch a lark.

845
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:30.370
Yet have I heard

846
00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.600
O, could I find it now

847
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.800
The lion, moved with pity,

848
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.000
did endure to have hisprincely paws pared allaway.

849
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.330
Some say the ravens fosterforlorn children,

850
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:44.130
the whilst their own birdsfamish in the nest.

851
00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:47.670
O, be to me, though thyhard heart say no,

852
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.500
nothing so kind, butsomething pitiful!

853
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.000
I know not what it means.Away with her!

854
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.400
O, let me teach thee!

855
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.730
For my father's sake, thatgave thee life

856
00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.430
when well he might haveslain thee,

857
00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:00.570
be not obdurate; open thydeaf ears.

858
00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:04.670
Hadst thou in person ne'eroffended me,

859
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.930
even for his sake am Ipitiless.

860
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.700
Remember, boys, I pouredforth tears in vain

861
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.770
to save your brother fromthe sacrifice.

862
00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:14.630
But fierce Andronicuswould not relent.

863
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:15.870
Away with her.

864
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:17.230
Use her as you will.

865
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.130
The worse to her, thebetter loved of me.

866
00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.670
O, Tamora, be called agentle queen,

867
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:24.470
and with thine own handskill me in this place.

868
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:30.170
For 'tis not life that Ihave begged so long.

869
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.800
Poor I was slain whenBassianus died.

870
00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.830
What beg'st thou, then,fond woman?

871
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:36.130
Let me go.

872
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:40.000
'Tis present death I beg,and one thing more

873
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.300
that womanhood denies atongue to tell.

874
00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.400
O, keep me from theirworse than killing lust,

875
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.930
and tumble me into someloathsome pit,

876
00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:51.600
where never man's eyes maybehold my body.

877
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:55.070
Do this, and be acharitable murderer.

878
00:52:56.530 --> 00:53:01.270
So should I rob my sweetsons of their fee.

879
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:05.300
No, let them satisfy theirlust on thee.

880
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.300
Away, for thou hast stayedus here too long.

881
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.030
No grace?

882
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.270
No womanhood?

883
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:15.800
Ah, beastly creature!

884
00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.400
The blot and enemy to ourgeneral name.

885
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.300
Confusion fall

886
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.070
Nay, then I'll stop yourmouth.

887
00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:25.530
Bring thou her husband.

888
00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:27.770
This is the hole whereAaron bid us hide him.

889
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.170
Farewell, my sons.

890
00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.330
See that you make hersure.

891
00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.100
Ne'er let my heart knowmerry cheer indeed,

892
00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.970
till all the Andronici bemade away.

893
00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.700
Now will I hence to seekmy lovely Moor

894
00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:47.670
and let my spleenful sonsthis trull deflower.

895
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:06.230
Come on, my lords, thebetter foot before.

896
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:08.800
Straight will I bring youto the loathsome pit

897
00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.900
where I espied the pantherfast asleep.

898
00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:16.330
My sight is very dull,whate'er it bodes.

899
00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:17.770
And mine, I promise you.

900
00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.170
Were it not for shame,

901
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.430
well could I leave oursport to sleep awhile.

902
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:28.670
What subtle hole is this

903
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.730
whose mouth is coveredwith rude-growing briers,

904
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:34.600
upon whose leaves aredrops of new-shed blood

905
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.570
as fresh as morning dewdistilled on flowers?

906
00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:43.570
A very fatal place itseems to me.

907
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.200
Speak, brother, hast thouhurt thee with the fall?

908
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.470
O brother, with thedismalest object hurt

909
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.600
that ever eye with sightmade heart lament.

910
00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.400
Now will I fetch the kingto find them here,

911
00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.400
that he thereby may have alikely guess

912
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.300
how these were they thatmade away his brother.

913
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:03.500
Why dost not comfort meand help me out

914
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.930
from this unhallowed andblood-stained hole?

915
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:09.400
I am surprised with anuncouth fear.

916
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.170
A chilling sweat o'errunsmy trembling joints.

917
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:16.330
My heart suspects morethan mine eye can see.

918
00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:18.400
To prove thou hast atrue-divining heart,

919
00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.230
Aaron and thou look downinto this den

920
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.670
and see a fearful sight ofblood and death.

921
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:26.370
Aaron is gone, and mycompassionate heart

922
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.270
will not permit mine eyesonce to behold

923
00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:30.030
the thing whereat ittrembles by surmise.

924
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:33.900
O, tell me who it is, fornigh till now

925
00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.430
was I a child to fear Iknow not what.

926
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:39.230
Lord Bassianus liesbewrayed in blood,

927
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:42.170
all on a heap, like to aslaughtered lamb,

928
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:45.500
in this detested, dark,blood-drinking pit.

929
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.230
If it be dark, how doesthou know it is he?

930
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:49.270
Upon his bloody finger hedoth wear

931
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:51.700
a precious ring thatlightens all this hole,

932
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:53.630
which, like a taper insome monument,

933
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.630
doth shine upon the deadman's earthy cheeks

934
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:58.700
and shows the raggedentrails of this pit.

935
00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.070
So pale did shine the moonon Pyramus

936
00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.800
when he by night laybathed in maiden blood.

937
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:08.830
O, brother, help me withthy fainting hand

938
00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:11.000
if fear hath made theefaint, as me it hath

939
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.030
out of this fell devouringreceptacle,

940
00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:15.500
as hateful as Cocytus'misty mouth.

941
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.230
Give me thy hand, that Imay help thee out

942
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:19.630
or, wanting strength to dothee so much good,

943
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.570
I may be plucked into theswallowing womb

944
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:26.400
of this deep pit, poorBassianus' grave.

945
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.130
I have no strength topluck thee to the brink.

946
00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:35.170
Nor I no strength to climbwithout thy help.

947
00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:36.770
Thy hand once more.

948
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.830
I will not loose again,till thou art here aloftor I below.

949
00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:44.630
Thou canst not come to me.

950
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:48.830
I come to thee.

951
00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:50.070
Along with me!

952
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:51.370
I'll see what hole is here

953
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:54.100
and what he is that now isleapt into it.

954
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:06.130
Say, who art thou thatlately did'st descend

955
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:08.100
into this gaping hollow ofthe earth?

956
00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.900
The unhappy sons of oldAndronicus,

957
00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:11.670
brought hither in a mostunlucky hour

958
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:13.830
to find thy brotherBassianus dead.

959
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.900
My brother dead?

960
00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:20.300
I know thou dost but jest.

961
00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.300
He and his lady both areat the lodge

962
00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:24.070
upon the north side ofthis pleasant chase.

963
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.970
'Tis not an hour since Ileft them there.

964
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:29.700
We know not where you leftthem all alive,

965
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.070
but out alas, here have wefound him dead.

966
00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.370
Where is my lord the king?

967
00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:38.770
Here, Tamora; thoughgrieved with killinggrief.

968
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.500
Where is thy brotherBassianus?

969
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:44.230
Now to the bottom dostthou search my wound.

970
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.770
Poor Bassianus here liesmurdered.

971
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:50.900
Then all too late I bringthis fatal writ,

972
00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.500
the complot of thistimeless tragedy,

973
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.100
and wonder greatly thatman's face can fold

974
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.470
in pleasing smiles suchmurderous tyranny.

975
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:02.530
"And if we miss to meethim handsomely, sweethuntsman

976
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:04.770
"Bassianus 'tis we mean

977
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:07.970
"do thou so much as digthe grave for him.

978
00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:10.100
"Thou know'st our meaning.

979
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:13.000
"Look for thy reward amongthe nettles at theelder-tree

980
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.230
"which overshades themouth of that same pit

981
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.730
"where we decreed to buryBassianus.

982
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:21.800
Do this, and purchase usthy lasting friends."

983
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.130
O, Tamora, was ever heardthe like?

984
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:29.930
This is the pit and thisthe elder tree.

985
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:33.400
Look, sirs, if you canfind the huntsman out

986
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.100
that should have murderedBassianus here.

987
00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:37.070
My gracious lord, here isthe bag of gold.

988
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:45.630
Two of thy whelps, fellcurs of bloody kind,

989
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:48.800
have here bereft mybrother of his life.

990
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:53.200
Sirs, drag them from thepit unto the prison.

991
00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.630
There let them bide untilwe have devised

992
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:59.300
some never-heard-oftorturing pain for them.

993
00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.430
What, are they in thispit?

994
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.000
O, wondrous thing!

995
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.930
How easily murder isdiscovered.

996
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.770
High Emperor, upon myfeeble knee,

997
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:10.800
I beg this boon with tearsnot lightly shed,

998
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:14.400
that this vile fault of myaccursed sons

999
00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.770
accursed if the fault beproved in them

1000
00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.500
If it be proved!

1001
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:21.070
You see it is apparent.

1002
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:22.400
Who found this letter?

1003
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.530
Tamora, was it you?

1004
00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:26.870
Andronicus himself didtake it up.

1005
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:30.270
I did, my lord, yet let mebe their bail;

1006
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.400
for, by my fathers'reverend tomb,

1007
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.770
I vow, they shall be readyat your Highness' will

1008
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:36.800
to answer their suspicionwith their lives.

1009
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.100
Thou shalt not bail them;see thou follow me.

1010
00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.600
Some bring the murderedbody, some the murderers.

1011
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.730
Let them not speak a word.

1012
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:48.000
The guilt is plain.

1013
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.530
For by my soul, were thereworse end than death,

1014
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:52.970
that end upon them shouldbe executed.

1015
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:58.370
Andronicus, I will entreatthe king.

1016
00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:01.800
Fear not thy sons; theyshall do well enough.

1017
01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:16.530
Come, Lucius, come.

1018
01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.800
Stay not to talk withthem.

1019
01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.030
Now go tell, and if thytongue can speak,

1020
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:31.270
who it was that cut thytongue and ravished thee.

1021
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.430
Write down thy mind,bewray thy meaning so,

1022
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:37.070
and if thy stumps will letthee, play the scribe.

1023
01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.770
See how with signs andtokens she can scrowl.

1024
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:44.370
Go home, call for sweetwater, wash thy hands.

1025
01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:46.330
She hath no tongue to callnor hands to wash.

1026
01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:49.470
And so let's leave her toher silent walks.

1027
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.970
And 'twere my cause, Ishould go hang myself.

1028
01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:54.900
If thou had'st hands tohelp thee knit the cord.

1029
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.900
Who is this?

1030
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.530
My niece, that flies awayso fast?

1031
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.300
Cousin, a word.

1032
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.830
Where is your husband?

1033
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:18.970
If I do dream, would allmy wealth would wake me.

1034
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:21.630
If I do wake, some planetstrike me down,

1035
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:23.800
that I may slumber ineternal sleep.

1036
01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.700
Speak, gentle niece.

1037
01:01:28.030 --> 01:01:30.970
What stern, ungentle hand

1038
01:01:30.970 --> 01:01:35.470
hath lopped and hewed andmade thy body bare

1039
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.630
of her two branches, thosesweet ornaments,

1040
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:42.130
whose circling shadowskings have sought to sleepin?

1041
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.330
Why dost not speak to me?

1042
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:51.400
Alas, a crimson river ofwarm blood,

1043
01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.700
like to a bubblingfountain stirred withwind,

1044
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.130
doth rise and fall betweenthy rosed lips,

1045
01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.730
coming and going with thyhoney breath.

1046
01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.630
But sure, some Tereus hathdeflowered thee

1047
01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:06.800
and, lest thou should'stdetect him, cut thytongue.

1048
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.330
Ah, now thou turn'st awaythy face for shame.

1049
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:15.300
And notwithstanding allthis loss of blood

1050
01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:19.700
as from a conduit withthree issuing spouts

1051
01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.670
yet do thy cheeks look redas Titan's face

1052
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:25.230
blushing to be encounteredwith a cloud.

1053
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:29.230
Shall I speak for thee?

1054
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:30.770
Shall I say 'tis so?

1055
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:38.030
O, that I knew thy heartand knew the beast,

1056
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:40.770
that I might rail at himto ease my mind.

1057
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:42.830
Sorrow concealed, like anoven stopped,

1058
01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:45.800
doth burn the heart tocinders where it is.

1059
01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.630
Fair Philomel, why she butlost her tongue

1060
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.970
and in a tedious samplersewed her mind.

1061
01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.930
But, gentle niece, thatmean is cut from thee.

1062
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:58.470
A craftier Tereus, cousin,hast thou met,

1063
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.900
for he hath cut thy prettyfingers off

1064
01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.000
that could have bettersewed than Philomel.

1065
01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:07.070
O, had the monster seenthose lily hands

1066
01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.900
tremble like aspen leavesupon the lute

1067
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:12.530
and make the silkenstrings delight to kissthem,

1068
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:15.500
he would not then havetouched them for his life.

1069
01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:19.900
Or had he heard theheavenly harmony

1070
01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.370
which that sweet, sweettongue hath made,

1071
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.100
he would have dropped hisknife and fell asleep

1072
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.730
as Cerberus at theThracian poet's feet.

1073
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:36.130
Come, let us go and makethy father blind,

1074
01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:40.230
for such a sight willblind a father's eye.

1075
01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:44.000
When one hour's storm willdrown the fragrant meads,

1076
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.800
what will whole months oftears thy father's eyes?

1077
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:55.230
Do not draw back, for wewill mourn with thee.

1078
01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:02.670
O, could our mourning easethy misery.

1079
01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:14.870
Hear me, grave fathers,noble tribunes, stay.

1080
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:18.030
For pity on mine age,whose youth was spent

1081
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:21.600
in dangerous wars whilstyou securely slept;

1082
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.600
for all my blood in Rome'sgreat quarrel shed,

1083
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.700
for all the frosty nightsthat I have watched,

1084
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.000
and for these bittertears, which now you see

1085
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.370
filling the aged wrinklesin my cheeks,

1086
01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:34.130
be pitiful to my condemnedsons,

1087
01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:37.300
whose souls are notcorrupted as 'tis thought.

1088
01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.770
For two and twenty sons Inever wept,

1089
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.400
because they died inhonor's lofty bed.

1090
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.830
For these, tribunes, inthe dust I write

1091
01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:48.900
my heart's deep languorand my soul's sad tears.

1092
01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.000
Let my tears staunch theearth's dry appetite.

1093
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.600
My sons' sweet blood willmake it shame and blush.

1094
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.470
O, earth, I will befriendthee more with rain

1095
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.070
than youthful April shallwith all his showers.

1096
01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:03.100
In summer's drought I'lldrop upon thee still.

1097
01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.530
In winter with warm tearsI'll melt the snow

1098
01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:08.030
and keep eternalspringtime on thy face,

1099
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:11.570
so thou refuse to drink mydear sons' blood.

1100
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:15.230
O, reverend tribunes,gentle aged men,

1101
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:19.200
unbind my sons, reversethe doom of death,

1102
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.100
and let me say that neverwept before,

1103
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.800
my tears are nowprevailing orators.

1104
01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.270
O, noble father, youlament in vain.

1105
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.800
The tribunes hear you not.

1106
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.300
No man is by, and yourecount your sorrows to astone.

1107
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:33.030
Ah, Lucius, for thybrothers let me plead.

1108
01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.400
Grave tribunes, once moreI entreat of you.

1109
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:38.200
My gracious lord, notribune hears you speak.

1110
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.100
Why, 'tis no matter, man.

1111
01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.830
If they did hear, theywould not mark me.

1112
01:05:45.830 --> 01:05:48.270
If they did mark, theywould not pity me.

1113
01:05:48.270 --> 01:05:52.900
Yet plead I must, andbootless unto them.

1114
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:56.070
Therefore I tell mysorrows to the stones,

1115
01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:58.600
who though they cannotanswer my distress,

1116
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.900
yet in some sort, they arebetter than the tribunes,

1117
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.730
for that they will notintercept my tale.

1118
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:08.970
When I do weep, theyhumbly at my feet

1119
01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:14.230
receive my tears and seemto weep with me.

1120
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:17.330
And were they but attiredin grave weeds,

1121
01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:21.070
Rome could afford notribunes like to these.

1122
01:06:21.070 --> 01:06:26.370
A stone is soft as wax,tribunes more hard thanstones.

1123
01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:30.770
A stone is silent andoffendeth not,

1124
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:37.530
and tribunes with theirtongues doom men to death.

1125
01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.770
But wherefore stand'stthou with thy weapondrawn?

1126
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:45.830
To rescue my two brothersfrom their death,

1127
01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:48.230
for which attempt thejudges have pronounced

1128
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:50.300
my everlasting doom ofbanishment.

1129
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.770
O, happy man, they havebefriended thee.

1130
01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:56.970
Why, foolish Lucius, dostthou not perceive

1131
01:06:56.970 --> 01:06:59.670
that Rome is but awilderness of tigers?

1132
01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.130
Tigers must prey,

1133
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:04.330
and Rome affords no preybut me and mine.

1134
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:05.430
How happy art thou then,

1135
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.930
from these devourers to bebanished?

1136
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:11.270
But who comes with mybrother Marcus here?

1137
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:14.700
Titus, prepare thine agedeyes to weep

1138
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:17.130
or, if not so, thy nobleheart to break.

1139
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:19.630
I bring consuming sorrowto thine age.

1140
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.200
Will it consume me?

1141
01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:22.730
Let me see it, then.

1142
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:25.770
This was thy daughter.

1143
01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:33.170
Why, Marcus, so she is.

1144
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:34.870
Ay me; this object killsme.

1145
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:37.900
Fainthearted boy, ariseand look on her.

1146
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.170
Speak, Lavinia!

1147
01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.270
What accursed hand

1148
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.170
hath made thee handless inthy father's sight?

1149
01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:51.100
What fool hath added waterto the sea

1150
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.870
or brought a fagot tobright-burning Troy?

1151
01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:56.130
My grief was at the heightbefore thou came'st,

1152
01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:59.200
and now like Nilus itdisdaineth bounds.

1153
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.730
Give me a sword; I'll chopoff my hands too,

1154
01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:06.030
for they have fought forRome, and all in vain,

1155
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:09.970
and they have nursed thiswoe in feeding life.

1156
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:12.600
In bootless prayer havethey been held up,

1157
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.900
and they have served me toeffectless use.

1158
01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:17.630
Now all the service Irequire of them

1159
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:19.900
is that the one may helpto cut the other.

1160
01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:24.770
'Tis well, Lavinia, thatthou hast no hands,

1161
01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:29.300
for hands to do Romeservice is but vain.

1162
01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:34.030
Speak, gentle sister, whohath martyred thee?

1163
01:08:34.030 --> 01:08:35.970
O, that delightful engineof her thoughts

1164
01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:37.870
that blabbed them withsuch pleasing eloquence

1165
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:40.270
is torn from forth thatpretty hollow cage,

1166
01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:42.030
where like a sweet,melodious bird,

1167
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:45.900
it sang sweet, variednotes, enchanting everyear.

1168
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:48.970
O, say thou for her, whohath done this deed?

1169
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.470
O, thus I found herstraying in the park,

1170
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:53.530
seeking to hide herself asdoth the deer

1171
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:56.330
that hath received someunrecuring wound.

1172
01:08:56.330 --> 01:09:01.830
It was my deer, and hethat wounded her

1173
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:05.230
hath hurt me more than hadhe killed me dead;

1174
01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.700
for now I stand as oneupon a rock

1175
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.670
environed with awilderness of sea

1176
01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:18.530
who marks the waxing tidegrow wave by wave,

1177
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:21.470
ever expecting when someenvious surge

1178
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:24.070
will in his brinish bowelsswallow him.

1179
01:09:25.270 --> 01:09:29.200
This way to death mywretched sons are gone.

1180
01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.730
Here stands my other son,a banished man,

1181
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:35.100
and here my brother,weeping at my woes.

1182
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.300
But that which gives mysoul the greatest spurn

1183
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:44.000
is dear Lavinia, dearerthan my soul.

1184
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.800
Had I but seen thy picturein this plight,

1185
01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.130
it would have madded me.

1186
01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:54.030
What shall I do, now Ibehold thy lifely body so?

1187
01:09:56.470 --> 01:10:01.400
Thou hast no hands to wipeaway thy tears,

1188
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.330
nor tongue to tell me whohath martyred thee.

1189
01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:08.800
Thy husband, he is dead,and for his death

1190
01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.230
thy brothers are condemnedand dead by this.

1191
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:16.230
O, Marcus.

1192
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:20.230
O, son Lucius, look onher.

1193
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:24.570
When I did name herbrothers, then fresh tears

1194
01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:28.170
stood on her cheeks, asdoth the honey dew

1195
01:10:28.170 --> 01:10:31.770
upon a gathered lilyalmost withered.

1196
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.370
Perchance she weepsbecause they killed herhusband;

1197
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:36.700
perchance because sheknows them innocent.

1198
01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.600
If they did kill thyhusband, then be joyful,

1199
01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.530
because the law hath takenrevenge on them.

1200
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:46.870
No, no; they would not doso vile a deed.

1201
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:49.900
Witness the sorrow thattheir sister makes.

1202
01:10:59.470 --> 01:11:07.030
Gentle Lavinia, let mekiss thy lips,

1203
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:11.500
or give some sign how Imay do thee ease.

1204
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:21.170
Shall thy good uncle andthy brother Lucius

1205
01:11:21.170 --> 01:11:24.100
and thou and I sit roundabout some fountain,

1206
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.730
looking all downwards tobehold our cheeks,

1207
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:30.100
how they are stained, likemeadows yet not dry

1208
01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.970
with miry slime left onthem by a flood?

1209
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:36.300
And in that fountain shallwe gaze so long,

1210
01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.800
till the fresh taste betaken from that clearness

1211
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.770
and made a brine pit withour bitter tears?

1212
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:49.100
Or shall we cut away ourhands like thine?

1213
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:51.830
Or shall we bite ourtongues and in dumb shows

1214
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:53.970
pass the remainder of ourhateful days?

1215
01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:55.630
What shall we do?

1216
01:11:57.370 --> 01:12:00.730
Let us that have ourtongues plot some device

1217
01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:04.670
of further misery to makeus wondered at in time tocome.

1218
01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:06.500
Sweet father, cease yourtears,

1219
01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.030
for at your grief see howmy wretched sister sobsand weeps.

1220
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:11.730
Patience, dear niece.

1221
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:13.730
Good Titus, dry thineeyes.

1222
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:19.700
O, Marcus, brother Marcus,

1223
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.030
well I wot thy napkincannot drink a tear ofmine,

1224
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:26.430
for thou, poor man, hathdrowned it with thine own.

1225
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:30.470
Ah, my Lavinia, I willwipe thy cheeks.

1226
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:33.800
Mark, Marcus, mark.

1227
01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.930
I understand her signs.

1228
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:40.630
Had she a tongue to speak,now would she say that

1229
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.870
to her brother which Isaid to thee.

1230
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:46.170
His napkin, with his truetears all bewet,

1231
01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:49.130
can do no service on hersorrowful cheeks.

1232
01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:59.770
O, what a sympathy of woeis this,

1233
01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:03.300
as far from help as Limbois from bliss.

1234
01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:11.900
Titus Andronicus,

1235
01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.500
my lord, the emperor,sends thee this word:

1236
01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.630
that if thou love thysons, let Marcus, Lucius,

1237
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:20.070
or thyself, old Titus, orany one of you,

1238
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:22.630
chop off your hand andsend it to the king.

1239
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:25.970
He for the same will sendthee hither both thy sonsalive,

1240
01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:28.700
and that shall be theransom for their fault.

1241
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.770
O, gracious emperor.

1242
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:32.030
O, gentle Aaron.

1243
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:33.800
Did ever raven sing solike a lark

1244
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.200
to bring sweet tidings ofthe sun's uprise?

1245
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.230
With all my heart, I'llsend the emperor my hand.

1246
01:13:38.230 --> 01:13:40.400
Good Aaron, will thou helpto chop it off?

1247
01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.330
Stay, father, for thatnoble hand of thine

1248
01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.770
that hath thrown down somany enemies shall not besent.

1249
01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:46.270
My hand will serve theturn.

1250
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:48.030
My youth can better sparemy blood than you,

1251
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:50.070
and therefore mine shallsave my brothers' lives.

1252
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:51.770
Which of your hands hathnot defended Rome

1253
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.400
and reared aloft thebloody battle-ax,

1254
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.170
writing destruction on theenemy's castle?

1255
01:13:55.170 --> 01:13:56.630
O, none of both but are ofhigh desert.

1256
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:58.170
My hand hath been butidle.

1257
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:00.800
Let it serve to ransom mytwo nephews from theirdeath.

1258
01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.500
Then have I kept it to aworthy end.

1259
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.200
Nay, come, agree whosehand shall go along,

1260
01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.830
for fear they die beforetheir pardon come.

1261
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:07.930
My hand shall go.

1262
01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:09.030
By heaven, it shall notgo.

1263
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:10.470
Sirs, strive no more.

1264
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:13.230
Such withered herbs asthese are meet forplucking up,

1265
01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:14.430
and therefore mine.

1266
01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:16.130
Sweet father, if I shallbe thought thy son,

1267
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:17.830
let me redeem my brothersboth from death.

1268
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.200
And for thy father's sakeand mother's care,

1269
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.170
now let me show abrother's love to thee.

1270
01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:23.830
Agree between you; I willspare my hand.

1271
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:24.930
Then I'll go fetch an ax.

1272
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.130
I will use the ax.

1273
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.470
Come hither, Aaron; I'lldeceive them both.

1274
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:30.770
Lend me thy hand, and Iwill give thee mine.

1275
01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:37.900
If that be called deceit,I will be honest

1276
01:14:37.900 --> 01:14:41.070
and never whilst I livedeceive men so.

1277
01:14:41.070 --> 01:14:44.830
But I'll deceive thee inanother sort,

1278
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:48.730
and that thou say ere halfan hour pass.

1279
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:08.630
Now strive no more!

1280
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:11.130
What shall be isdispatched.

1281
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:17.570
Good Aaron, send HisMajesty my hand.

1282
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.100
Tell him it was a hand

1283
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.070
that warded him fromthousand dangers.

1284
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:23.630
Bid him bury it.

1285
01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:26.370
More hath it merited; thatlet it have.

1286
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:31.870
As for my sons, say Iaccount of them

1287
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:36.630
as jewels purchased at aneasy price,

1288
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:41.630
and yet dear too, becauseI bought mine own.

1289
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:45.500
I go, Andronicus, and forthy hand

1290
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.770
look by and by to have thysons with thee.

1291
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:52.570
Their heads, I mean.

1292
01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:55.330
O, how this villainy dothfat me

1293
01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:57.730
with the very thoughts ofit.

1294
01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:03.200
Let fools do good and fairmen call for grace.

1295
01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.330
Aaron will have his soulblack like his face.

1296
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:14.800
O, here I lift this onehand up to heaven

1297
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:18.070
and bow this feeble ruinto the earth.

1298
01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:23.970
If any power pitieswretched tears, to that Icall!

1299
01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.770
What, wouldst thou kneelwith me?

1300
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:29.670
Do, then, dear heart,

1301
01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:32.530
for heaven shall hear ourprayers.

1302
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:36.570
Or with our tears, we'llbreathe the welkin dim

1303
01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:39.470
and stain the sun withfog, as sometime clouds

1304
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.730
when they do hug him intheir melting bosoms.

1305
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.830
O, brother, speak withpossibility,

1306
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:46.400
and do not break intothese deep extremes.

1307
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.830
Are not my sorrows deep?

1308
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:52.930
Having no limit, be thenmy passions limitless withthem.

1309
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:55.270
But yet let reason governthy lament.

1310
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:58.070
If there were reason forthese miseries,

1311
01:16:58.070 --> 01:17:01.030
then into limits could Ibind my woes.

1312
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.100
When heaven doth weep,doth not the eartho'erflow?

1313
01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.170
If the winds rage, dothnot the sea wax mad,

1314
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:13.470
threatening the welkinwith his big-swollen face?

1315
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:17.200
And wilt thou have areason for this coil?

1316
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:20.470
I am the sea!

1317
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.570
Hark how her sighs doblow.

1318
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:28.130
She is the weeping welkin,I the earth.

1319
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:31.930
Then must my sea be movedwith her sighs.

1320
01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:35.100
Then must my earth withher continual tears

1321
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:39.670
become a deluge,overflowed and drowned.

1322
01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:44.600
For why my bowels cannothide her woes,

1323
01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.530
but like a drunkard must Ivomit them.

1324
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:54.870
Then give me leave, forlosers will have leave

1325
01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:58.730
to ease their stomachswith their bitter tongues.

1326
01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.400
Worthy Andronicus, ill artthou repaid

1327
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.600
for that good hand thousent'st the emperor.

1328
01:18:09.930 --> 01:18:14.800
Here are the heads of thytwo noble sons,

1329
01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:21.930
and here's thy hand, inscorn to thee sent back

1330
01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:26.970
thy grief their sports,thy resolution mocked,

1331
01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:30.200
that woe is me to thinkupon thy woes,

1332
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:33.930
more than remembrance ofmy father's death.

1333
01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:56.630
Now let hot Etna cool inSicily,

1334
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:59.030
and be my heart anever-burning hell.

1335
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.570
These miseries are morethan may be borne.

1336
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:05.570
To weep with them thatweep doth ease some deal,

1337
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:08.430
but sorrow flouted at isdouble death.

1338
01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:14.100
Ah, that this sight shouldmake so deep a wound,

1339
01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:17.470
and yet detested life notshrink thereat.

1340
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:21.670
That ever death should letlife bear his name

1341
01:19:21.670 --> 01:19:25.070
where life hath no moreinterest but to breathe.

1342
01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:28.430
Alas, poor heart, thatkiss is comfortless

1343
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.170
as frozen water to astarved snake.

1344
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:38.830
When will this fearfulslumber have an end?

1345
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:42.030
Now farewell, flattery.

1346
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:43.570
Die, Andronicus.

1347
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.070
Thou dost not slumber.

1348
01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:48.370
See thy two sons' heads,thy warlike hand,

1349
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:51.070
thy mangled daughter here,thy other banished son

1350
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:53.330
with this dear sightstruck pale and bloodless,

1351
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.630
and thy brother, I,

1352
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:57.930
even like a stony image,cold and numb.

1353
01:19:57.930 --> 01:20:00.700
Ah! Now no more will Icontrol thy griefs.

1354
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.600
Rent off thy silver hair,thy other hand

1355
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.100
gnawing with thy teeth,and be this dismal sight

1356
01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.700
the closing up of our mostwretched eyes.

1357
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.270
This is a time to storm!

1358
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:11.930
Why art thou still?

1359
01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:14.300
Ha, ha, ha.

1360
01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:15.430
Why dost thou laugh?

1361
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:17.270
It fits not with thishour.

1362
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:25.600
Why, I have not anothertear to shed.

1363
01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:33.970
Besides, this sorrow is anenemy

1364
01:20:33.970 --> 01:20:36.370
and would usurp upon mywatery eyes

1365
01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:39.270
and make them blind withtributary tears.

1366
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:43.500
Then which way shall Ifind Revenge's cave?

1367
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:48.270
For these two heads doseem to speak to me,

1368
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.830
and threat me, I shallnever come to bliss

1369
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:54.700
till all these mischiefsbe returned again,

1370
01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.400
even in their throatswhich have committed them.

1371
01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:04.130
Come, let me see what taskI have to do.

1372
01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:08.900
You heavy people, circleme about,

1373
01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.870
that I may turn me to eachone of you

1374
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:16.970
and swear upon my soul toright your wrongs.

1375
01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:39.100
The vow is made.

1376
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:48.070
Marcus, take thou a head,

1377
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:51.970
and in this hand the otherwill I bear.

1378
01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:54.830
Lavinia, thou shalt beemployed in this.

1379
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:59.270
Bear thou my hand, sweetwench, between thy teeth.

1380
01:21:59.270 --> 01:22:01.600
As for thee, boy, go, getthee from my sight.

1381
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.970
Thou art an exile, andthou must not stay.

1382
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.630
Hie to the Goths and raisean army there.

1383
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:14.930
And if you love me and Ithink it so

1384
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:19.630
let's kiss and part, forwe have much to do.

1385
01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:38.000
Farewell, Andronicus, mynoble father,

1386
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.300
the woefullest man thatever lived in Rome.

1387
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:47.530
Farewell, proud Rome, tillLucius come again.

1388
01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.970
He loves his pledgesdearer than his life.

1389
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:57.730
Farewell, Lavinia, mynoble sister.

1390
01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:01.500
O, would thou wert as thoutofore hast been.

1391
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:06.270
But now nor Lucius norLavinia lives

1392
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:09.270
but in oblivion andhateful griefs.

1393
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:14.470
If Lucius live, he willrequite your wrongs

1394
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:17.830
and make proud Saturnineand his empress

1395
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:20.770
beg at the gates likeTarquin and his queen.

1396
01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:25.930
Now will I to the Goths,and raise a power

1397
01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:29.770
to be revenged on Rome andSaturnine.

1398
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:56.130
So so, now sit.

1399
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:14.870
And look you eat no more

1400
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:17.370
than will preserve just somuch strength in us

1401
01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:20.500
as will revenge thesebitter woes of ours.

1402
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:23.270
Marcus, unknit thatsorrow-wreathen knot.

1403
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:25.800
Thy niece and I, poorcreatures, want our hands

1404
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.530
and cannot passionate ourtenfold grief with foldedarms.

1405
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.070
This poor right hand ofmine is left to tyrannize

1406
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:34.600
upon my breast, who, whenmy heart,

1407
01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.030
all mad with misery, beatsin the hollow prison

1408
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.730
of this flesh, then thus Ithump it down.

1409
01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:46.870
Thou map of woe that thusmust talk in signs.

1410
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:50.070
When thy poor heart beatswith outrageous beating,

1411
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:53.470
thou canst not strike itthus to make it still.

1412
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:58.730
Wound it with sighing,girl; kill it with groans,

1413
01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:00.700
or get some little knifebetween thy teeth

1414
01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:03.430
and just against thouheart make thou a hole,

1415
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:06.570
that all the tears thatthy poor eyes let fall

1416
01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:08.800
may run into that sinkand, soaking in,

1417
01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.630
drown the lamenting foolin sea-salt tears.

1418
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:13.300
Fie, brother, fie!

1419
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.830
Teach her not thus to laysuch violent hands

1420
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:17.470
upon her tender life.

1421
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.500
How now; has sorrow madethee dote already?

1422
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.000
Why, Marcus, no man shouldbe mad but I.

1423
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.230
What violent hands can shelay on her life?

1424
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.900
O, handle not the theme,to talk of hands,

1425
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.430
lest we remember stillthat we have none.

1426
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.900
Fie, fie, how franticallyI shape my talk,

1427
01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:38.700
as if we could forget wehave no hands

1428
01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.570
if Marcus did not name theword of hands.

1429
01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.300
Come, let's fall to.

1430
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:53.430
Gentle girl, eat this.

1431
01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.430
Here is no drink.

1432
01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:04.830
Hark, Marcus, what shesays.

1433
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:08.330
I can interpret all hermartyred signs.

1434
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:11.000
She says she drinks noother drink but tears,

1435
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.800
brewed with her sorrows,meshed upon her cheeks.

1436
01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:17.200
Speechless complainer, Iwill learn thy thought.

1437
01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.600
In thy dumb action will Ibe as perfect

1438
01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:22.000
as begging hermits attheir holy prayers.

1439
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.270
Thou shalt not sigh, norhold thy stumps to heaven,

1440
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:28.800
nor wink, nor nod, norkneel, nor make a sign,

1441
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.200
but I of these will wrestan alphabet

1442
01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:34.400
and by still practicelearn to know thy meaning.

1443
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:38.270
Good grandsire, leavethese bitter deep laments.

1444
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:40.930
Make my aunt merry withsome pleasing tale.

1445
01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.630
Alas, the tender boy, inpassion moved,

1446
01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:47.870
doth weep to see hisgrandsire's heaviness.

1447
01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.970
Peace, tender sapling.

1448
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:57.730
Thou art made of tears,

1449
01:26:57.730 --> 01:27:00.800
and tears will quicklymelt thy life away.

1450
01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.000
What dost thou strike at,Marcus, with thy knife?

1451
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.630
At that that I havekilled, my lorda fly.

1452
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:09.700
Out on thee, murderer;thou kill'st my heart!

1453
01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.430
Mine eyes are cloyed withview of tyranny.

1454
01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:14.330
A deed of death done onthe innocent

1455
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:15.570
becomes not Titus'brother.

1456
01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:16.670
Get thee gone.

1457
01:27:16.670 --> 01:27:18.230
I see thou art not for mycompany.

1458
01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.800
Alas, my lord, I have butkilled a fly.

1459
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:26.400
But how if that fly had afather and mother?

1460
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:31.670
How would he hang hisslender gilded wings

1461
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:33.600
and buzz lamenting doingsin the air.

1462
01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.670
Poor harmless fly thatwith his pretty buzzingmelody

1463
01:27:36.670 --> 01:27:40.730
came here to make usmerry, and thou hastkilled him.

1464
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:45.100
O, pardon, sir; it was ablack, ill-favored fly,

1465
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:48.570
like to the empress' Moor;therefore I killed him.

1466
01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:59.500
O, then pardon me forreprehending thee,

1467
01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:01.830
for thou hast done acharitable deed.

1468
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:04.730
Give me thy knife; I willinsult on him,

1469
01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:06.730
flattering myself as if itwere the Moor

1470
01:28:06.730 --> 01:28:08.570
come hither purposely topoison me.

1471
01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:11.230
There's for thyself, andthat's for Tamora.

1472
01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:13.000
Ah, sirrah!

1473
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.370
Yet, I think, we are notbrought so low

1474
01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.370
but that between us we cankill a fly

1475
01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:29.630
that comes in likeness ofa coal-black Moor.

1476
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:33.400
Alas, poor man; grief hasso wrought on him,

1477
01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.500
he takes false shadows fortrue substances.

1478
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.200
Come, take away.

1479
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:49.100
Lavinia, go with me.

1480
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:51.400
I'll to thy closet and goread with thee

1481
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.330
sad stories chanced in thetimes of old.

1482
01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:58.900
Come, boy, and go with me.

1483
01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:08.970
Thy sight is young,

1484
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:14.770
and thou shalt read whenmine begin to dazzle.

1485
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:55.000
Help, Grandsire, help!

1486
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.670
My aunt Lavinia follows meeverywhere.

1487
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:58.400
I know not why.

1488
01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.370
Good uncle Marcus, see howswift she comes.

1489
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:03.570
Alas, sweet aunt, I knownot what you mean.

1490
01:30:03.570 --> 01:30:04.670
Stand by me, Lucius.

1491
01:30:04.670 --> 01:30:05.900
Do not fear thine aunt.

1492
01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.800
She loves thee, boy, toowell to do thee harm.

1493
01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.630
Ay, when my father was inRome, she did.

1494
01:30:10.630 --> 01:30:12.670
What means my nieceLavinia by these signs?

1495
01:30:12.670 --> 01:30:15.330
Fear her not, Lucius;somewhat does she mean.

1496
01:30:15.970 --> 01:30:19.100
See, Lucius, see how muchshe makes of thee.

1497
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.900
Somewhither would she havethee go with her.

1498
01:30:20.900 --> 01:30:23.130
Ah, boy, Cornelia neverwith more care

1499
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:25.570
read to her sons than shehath read to thee

1500
01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:28.100
sweet poetry and Tully'sorator.

1501
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:30.970
Canst thou not guesswherefore she plies theethus?

1502
01:30:30.970 --> 01:30:33.800
My lord, I know not, I,nor can I guess,

1503
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.930
unless some fit or frenzydo possess her.

1504
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.630
For I have heard mygrandsire say full oft

1505
01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:41.100
extremities of grief wouldmake men mad.

1506
01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.030
And I have read thatHecuba of Troy ran madfor sorrow.

1507
01:30:44.030 --> 01:30:45.900
That made me to fear.

1508
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.100
Although, my lord, I knowmy noble aunt

1509
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:50.000
loves me as dear as e'ermy mother did

1510
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.700
and would not but in furyfright my youth,

1511
01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.270
which made me down tothrow my books and fly

1512
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:56.670
causeless, perhaps.

1513
01:30:56.670 --> 01:30:58.570
But pardon me, sweet aunt.

1514
01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:00.870
And, madam, if my uncleMarcus go,

1515
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:03.030
I will most willinglyattend your ladyship.

1516
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:04.130
Lucius, I will.

1517
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:10.600
How now, Lavinia.

1518
01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.070
Marcus, what means this?

1519
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:16.470
Some book there is thatshe desires to see.

1520
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:18.370
Which is it, girl, ofthese?

1521
01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:19.530
Open them, boy.

1522
01:31:19.530 --> 01:31:22.530
But thou art deeper readand better skilled.

1523
01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:24.870
Come and take choice ofall my library,

1524
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:27.400
and so beguile thy sorrow,till the heavens reveal

1525
01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.870
the damned contriver ofthis deed.

1526
01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.730
Why lifts she up her armsin sequence thus?

1527
01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:36.470
I think she means thatthere were

1528
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:39.500
more than one confederatein the fact.

1529
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.770
Ay, more there was;

1530
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:42.770
or else to heaven sheheaves them for revenge.

1531
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:46.830
Lucius, what book is thatshe tosseth so?

1532
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:49.430
Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's"Metamorphoses."

1533
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:50.730
My mother gave it me.

1534
01:31:50.730 --> 01:31:51.830
For love of her that'sgone,

1535
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:53.500
perhaps she culled it fromamong the rest.

1536
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.730
Soft.

1537
01:31:54.730 --> 01:31:57.270
So busily she turns theleaves.

1538
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:59.030
What would she find?

1539
01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:01.170
Help her.

1540
01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:03.530
Lavinia, shall I read?

1541
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:12.200
This is the tragic tale ofPhilomel

1542
01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:18.470
and treats of Tereus'treason and his rape.

1543
01:32:20.930 --> 01:32:24.430
And rape, I fear, was rootof thy annoy.

1544
01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.930
See, brother, see.

1545
01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:29.700
Note how she quotes theleaves.

1546
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:32.600
Lavinia, were thou thussurprised, sweet girl,

1547
01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:35.200
ravished and wronged asPhilomela was,

1548
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:38.800
forced in the vast andruthless, gloomy woods?

1549
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.330
Ay, see, see.

1550
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:45.630
Such a place there iswhere we did hunt

1551
01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:48.100
O, had we never, neverhunted there!

1552
01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:51.170
patterned by this the poethere describes,

1553
01:32:51.170 --> 01:32:55.630
by nature made for murdersand for rapes.

1554
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:57.900
O, why should nature buildso foul a den,

1555
01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:01.430
unless the gods delight intragedies?

1556
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:05.470
Give signs, sweet girl, forhere are none but friends,

1557
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:08.330
what Roman lord it wasdurst do the deed.

1558
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:11.500
Or slunk not Saturnine, asTarquin erst,

1559
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:13.900
that left the camp to sinin Lucrece' bed?

1560
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.170
Sit down, sweet niece.

1561
01:33:18.170 --> 01:33:20.330
Brother, sit down with me.

1562
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:29.900
Apollo, Pallas, Jove, andMercury,

1563
01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.330
inspire me, that I maythis treason find.

1564
01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:44.300
My lord, look here.

1565
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:49.470
Look here, Lavinia.

1566
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:52.330
This sandy plot is plain.

1567
01:33:52.330 --> 01:33:59.800
Guide, if thou canst, thisafter me.

1568
01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.000
I have writ my name

1569
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.670
without the help of anyhand at all.

1570
01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:09.630
Cursed be the heart thatforced us to this shift.

1571
01:34:09.630 --> 01:34:13.870
Write thou, good niece,and here display at last

1572
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:17.600
what God will havediscovered for revenge.

1573
01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:23.370
Heaven guide thy pen toprint thy sorrows plain,

1574
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:27.500
that we may know thetraitors and the truth.

1575
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.400
Do you read, my lord, whatshe hath writ?

1576
01:35:56.730 --> 01:36:00.370
"Rape."

1577
01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:01.870
"Chiron."

1578
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:04.970
"Demetrius."

1579
01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:12.030
Magni Dominator poli, Tamlentus audis scelera?

1580
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:13.930
Tam lentus vides?

1581
01:36:13.930 --> 01:36:16.400
O, calm thee, gentle lord,

1582
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.530
although I know there isenough written upon this earth

1583
01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:21.870
to stir a mutiny in themildest thoughts

1584
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:25.130
and arm the minds ofinfants to exclaims.

1585
01:36:25.130 --> 01:36:28.130
Kneel down with me.

1586
01:36:28.130 --> 01:36:29.700
Lavinia, kneel.

1587
01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:33.870
And kneel, sweet boy, theRoman Hector's hope

1588
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:37.500
and swear with me  as withthe woeful fere

1589
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.400
and father of that chaste,dishonored dame,

1590
01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.930
Lord Junius Brutus swarefor Lucrece's rape

1591
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:44.100
that we will prosecute bygood advice

1592
01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.430
mortal revenge upon thesetraitorous Goths

1593
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:50.400
and see their blood or diewith this reproach.

1594
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:59.770
'Tis sure enough, and youknew how.

1595
01:36:59.770 --> 01:37:04.430
But if you hunt thesebear-whelps, then beware.

1596
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:08.700
The dam will wake; and ifshe wind ye once,

1597
01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:12.630
she's with the lion deeplystill in league

1598
01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:15.830
and lulls him while sheplayeth on her back.

1599
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:20.400
And when he sleeps willshe do what she list.

1600
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:25.870
You are a young huntsman,Marcus; let alone.

1601
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:27.200
Come.

1602
01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.630
I will go get a leaf of brassand with a gad of steel

1603
01:37:31.630 --> 01:37:35.670
will write these words andlay it by.

1604
01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:40.530
The angry northern windwill blow these sands

1605
01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:42.130
like Sibyl's leavesabroad.

1606
01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:44.470
And where's our lessonthen?

1607
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:45.870
Boy, what say you?

1608
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:48.370
I say, my lord, that if Iwere a man,

1609
01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:50.400
their mother's bedchambershould not be safe

1610
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:53.000
for these base bondmen tothe yoke of Rome.

1611
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.200
Ay, there's my boy.

1612
01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:55.570
Thy father hath full oft

1613
01:37:55.570 --> 01:37:57.470
for his ungrateful countrydone the like.

1614
01:37:57.470 --> 01:38:00.100
And, uncle, so will I, andif I live.

1615
01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:01.770
Come, go with me into minearmory.

1616
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:04.270
Lucius, I'll fit thee, andmy boy withal

1617
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:06.830
shall carry from me to theempress' sons

1618
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:10.070
presents that I intend tosend them both.

1619
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:12.470
Come, come; thou'lt do mymessage, wilt thou not?

1620
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:15.030
Ay, and with my dagger intheir bosoms, Grandsire.

1621
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:18.030
No, boy, not so.

1622
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:20.670
I'll teach thee anothercourse.

1623
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:24.300
Lavinia, come.

1624
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.270
Marcus, look to my house.

1625
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:29.930
Lucius and I'll go braveit at the court.

1626
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:33.070
Ay, marry, will we, sir,and we'll be waited on.

1627
01:38:35.530 --> 01:38:38.000
O, heavens, can you hear agood man groan

1628
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.500
and not relent and notcompassion him?

1629
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:43.170
Marcus, attend him in hisecstasy

1630
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:46.770
that hath more scars ofsorrow in his heart

1631
01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:49.230
than foemen's marks uponhis battered shield,

1632
01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:53.400
and yet so just that hewill not revenge.

1633
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.730
Revenge the heavens forold Andronicus.

1634
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.900
Demetrius, here's the sonof Lucius.

1635
01:39:25.900 --> 01:39:27.630
He hath some message todeliver us.

1636
01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:31.370
Ay, some mad message fromhis mad grandfather.

1637
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:33.630
My lords, with all thehumbleness I may,

1638
01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:35.600
I greet your honors fromAndronicus

1639
01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.670
and pray the Roman godsconfound you both.

1640
01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:41.130
Gramercy, lovely Lucius.

1641
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:43.770
What's the news?

1642
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:45.900
That you are bothdeciphered that's the news

1643
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.200
for villains marked withrape.

1644
01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.200
May it please you, mygrandsire,

1645
01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.100
well advised, hath sent byme

1646
01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:53.830
the goodliest weapons ofhis armory

1647
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:55.700
to gratify your honorableyouth,

1648
01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:58.330
the hope of Rome, for sohe bid me say.

1649
01:39:58.330 --> 01:40:00.870
And so I do, and with hisgifts present

1650
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:02.700
Your Lordships, thatwhenever you have need,

1651
01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.670
you may be armed andappointed well.

1652
01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:08.270
And so I leave you both...

1653
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:09.630
like bloody villains.

1654
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:11.200
What's here?

1655
01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:15.270
A scroll, and writtenround about.

1656
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:17.400
Let's see.

1657
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:24.500
"Integer vitae,scelerisque purus,

1658
01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:33.230
non eget Mauri iaculis,nec arcu."

1659
01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:35.400
O, 'tis a verse in Horace.

1660
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:36.600
I know it well.

1661
01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.600
I read it in the grammarlong ago.

1662
01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.670
Ay, just  A verse inHorace.

1663
01:40:41.670 --> 01:40:43.370
Right, you have it.

1664
01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:48.600
Now, what a thing it is tobe an ass.

1665
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.170
Here's no sound jest.

1666
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:53.370
The old man hath foundtheir guilt

1667
01:40:53.370 --> 01:40:56.130
and sends them weaponswrapped about with lines

1668
01:40:56.130 --> 01:40:59.000
that wound, beyond theirfeeling, to the quick.

1669
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.800
But were our witty empresswell afoot,

1670
01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.000
she would applaudAndronicus' conceit.

1671
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.070
But let her rest in herunrest awhile.

1672
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:14.230
And now, young lords,was't not a happy star

1673
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.200
led us to Rome, strangers,

1674
01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.970
and more than so captives

1675
01:41:17.970 --> 01:41:19.700
to be advanced to thisheight?

1676
01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:22.300
It doth me good to see sogreat a lord

1677
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:25.570
basely insinuate and sendus gifts.

1678
01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.130
Had he not reason, LordDemetrius?

1679
01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:32.100
Did you not use hisdaughter very friendly?

1680
01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.870
I would we had a thousandRoman dames

1681
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:38.500
at such a bay, by turn toserve our lust.

1682
01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.200
A charitable wish, andfull of love.

1683
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:42.630
Here lacks but your motherfor to say amen.

1684
01:41:42.630 --> 01:41:44.470
And would she for twentythousand more.

1685
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:48.200
Come, let us go and prayto all the gods

1686
01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.400
for our beloved mother inher pains.

1687
01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.170
Pray to the devils; thegods have given us over.

1688
01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.430
Why do the emperor'strumpets flourish thus?

1689
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:59.400
Belike, for joy theemperor hath a son.

1690
01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:03.070
Soft. Who comes here?

1691
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:05.930
O, tell me, did you seeAaron the Moor?

1692
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:09.470
Well, more or less, orne'er a whit at all,

1693
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:12.170
here Aaron is; and whatwith Aaron now?

1694
01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:15.600
O, gentle Aaron, we areall undone.

1695
01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:18.830
Now help, or woe betidethee evermore.

1696
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:20.630
Why, what a caterwaulingdost thou keep.

1697
01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:22.670
What dost thou wrap andfumble in thy arms?

1698
01:42:22.670 --> 01:42:25.600
O, that which I would hidefrom heaven's eye.

1699
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:30.370
Our empress' shame andstately Rome's disgrace.

1700
01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:33.170
She is delivered, lords;she is delivered.

1701
01:42:33.170 --> 01:42:34.500
To whom?

1702
01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:36.500
I mean she is broughtabed.

1703
01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.700
Well, God give her goodrest.

1704
01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:38.800
What hath he sent her?

1705
01:42:38.800 --> 01:42:39.900
A devil.

1706
01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.500
Why, then she is thedevil's dam;

1707
01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.830
a joyful issue.

1708
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:48.570
A joyless, dismal, black,and sorrowful issue.

1709
01:42:48.570 --> 01:42:51.570
Here is the babe, asloathsome as a toad

1710
01:42:51.570 --> 01:42:54.570
amongst the fair-facedbreeders of our clime.

1711
01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:59.170
The empress sends it thee thy stamp, thy seal

1712
01:42:59.170 --> 01:43:03.370
and bids thee christen itwith thy dagger's point.

1713
01:43:03.370 --> 01:43:04.730
Zounds, ye whore!

1714
01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:07.800
Is black so base a hue?

1715
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:18.430
Sweet blowse,

1716
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:22.530
you are a beauteousblossom sure.

1717
01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:26.100
Villain, what hast thoudone?

1718
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.270
That which thou canst notundo.

1719
01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:30.300
Thou hast undone ourmother.

1720
01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:33.400
Villain, I have done thymother.

1721
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.870
And therein, hellish dog,hast thou undone her.

1722
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.870
Woe to her chance,

1723
01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:42.230
Damned her loathed choice.

1724
01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:45.630
Accursed the offspring ofso foul a fiend.

1725
01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:46.800
It shall not live.

1726
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.900
It shall not die.

1727
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:51.100
Aaron, it must; the motherwills it so.

1728
01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.630
What, must it, nurse?

1729
01:43:52.630 --> 01:43:55.670
Then let no man but I doexecution

1730
01:43:55.670 --> 01:43:56.970
on my flesh and blood.

1731
01:43:56.970 --> 01:43:59.130
I'll broach the tadpole onmy rapier's point.

1732
01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:01.330
Nurse, give it to me!

1733
01:44:01.330 --> 01:44:03.130
My sword shall soondispatch it.

1734
01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:06.430
Sooner this sword shallplough thy bowels up!

1735
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:10.670
Stay, murderous villains;will you kill your brother!

1736
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:12.930
Now, by the burning tapersof the sky

1737
01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:15.830
that shone so brightlywhen this boy was got,

1738
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:18.700
he dies upon my scimitar'ssharp point

1739
01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:22.230
that touches this, myfirst-born son and heir.

1740
01:44:22.230 --> 01:44:25.500
I tell you, younglings,not Enceladus,

1741
01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:29.300
with all his threateningband of Typhon's brood,

1742
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:32.770
nor great Alcides, nor thegod of war,

1743
01:44:32.770 --> 01:44:35.700
shall seize this prey outof his father's hands.

1744
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:47.770
What, what, ye sanguine,shallow-hearted boys

1745
01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:52.630
ye white-limed walls, yealehouse painted signs!

1746
01:44:52.630 --> 01:44:55.330
Coal-black is better thananother hue

1747
01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:58.070
in that it scorns to bearanother hue.

1748
01:44:58.070 --> 01:45:00.730
For all the water in theocean

1749
01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:03.800
can never turn the swan'sblack legs to white,

1750
01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:06.470
although she lave themhourly in the flood.

1751
01:45:13.130 --> 01:45:17.700
Tell the empress from me, Iam of age to keep mine own;

1752
01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.570
excuse it how she can.

1753
01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:23.730
Wilt thou betray thy noblemistress thus?

1754
01:45:23.730 --> 01:45:28.830
My mistress is mymistress, this my self

1755
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:32.200
the vigor and the pictureof my youth.

1756
01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.770
This before all the worlddo I prefer.

1757
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:42.370
This maugre all the worldwill I keep safe,

1758
01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:45.170
or some of you shall smokefor it in Rome.

1759
01:45:45.170 --> 01:45:48.430
By this our mother is forever shamed.

1760
01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:51.430
Rome will despise her forthis foul escape.

1761
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:54.200
The emperor in his ragewill doom her death.

1762
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.700
I blush to think upon thisignomy.

1763
01:45:56.700 --> 01:46:00.070
Why, there's the privilegeyour beauty bears.

1764
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:03.170
Fie, treacherous hue, thatwill betray with blushing

1765
01:46:03.170 --> 01:46:07.230
the close enacts andcounsels of thy heart.

1766
01:46:07.230 --> 01:46:10.100
Here's a young lad framedof another leer.

1767
01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:14.370
Look how the black slavesmiles upon the father,

1768
01:46:14.370 --> 01:46:17.830
as who should say, "Oldlad, I am thine own."

1769
01:46:19.270 --> 01:46:22.400
He is your brother, lords,sensibly fed

1770
01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.130
of that self-blood thatfirst gave life to you;

1771
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:27.630
and from your womb whereyou imprisoned were,

1772
01:46:27.630 --> 01:46:29.930
he is enfranchised andbrought to light.

1773
01:46:29.930 --> 01:46:33.170
Nay, he is your brother bythe surer side,

1774
01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:36.430
although my seal bestamped in his face.

1775
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:40.500
Aaron, what shall I sayunto the empress?

1776
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:48.930
Advise thee, Aaron, whatis to be done,

1777
01:46:48.930 --> 01:46:52.030
and we will all subscribeto thy advice.

1778
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:56.370
Save thou the child, so wemay all be safe.

1779
01:46:56.370 --> 01:47:00.170
Then sit we down and letus all consult.

1780
01:47:00.170 --> 01:47:03.000
My son and I will have thewind of you.

1781
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Keep there.

1782
01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:14.800
Now talk at pleasure ofyour safety.

1783
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:21.470
How many women saw thischild of his?

1784
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:24.070
Why, so, brave lords

1785
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:27.500
When we join in league, Iam a lamb.

1786
01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.530
But if you brave the Moor,

1787
01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:32.230
the chafed boar, themountain lioness,

1788
01:47:32.230 --> 01:47:36.230
the ocean swells not so asAaron storms.

1789
01:47:36.230 --> 01:47:40.430
But say again, how manysaw the child?

1790
01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:43.500
Cornelia the midwife andmyself,

1791
01:47:43.500 --> 01:47:45.770
and no one else but thedelivered empress.

1792
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:49.130
The empress, the midwife,and yourself.

1793
01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:52.170
Two may keep counsel whenthe third's away.

1794
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:59.330
Go to the empress; tellher this I said.

1795
01:48:01.670 --> 01:48:05.400
Weeke, weeke!

1796
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.830
So cries a pig prepared tothe spit.

1797
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:10.100
What mean'st thou, Aaron?Wherefore didst thou this?

1798
01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:13.200
O, Lord, sir, 'tis a deedof policy.

1799
01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.870
Shall she live to betraythis guilt of ours,

1800
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:17.630
a long-tongued babblinggossip?

1801
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:19.030
No, lords, no.

1802
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:21.870
And now be it known to youmy full intent.

1803
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:23.970
Not far, one Muliteus, mycountryman.

1804
01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:26.070
His wife but yesternightwas brought to bed.

1805
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:29.070
His child is like to her,fair as you are.

1806
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:30.670
Go pack with him, give themother gold

1807
01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:32.770
and tell them both thecircumstance of all,

1808
01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:35.300
and how by this theirchild shall be advanced

1809
01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:38.070
and be received for theemperor's heir

1810
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:40.030
and substituted in theplace of mine

1811
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:42.730
to calm this tempestwhirling in the court;

1812
01:48:42.730 --> 01:48:45.400
and let the emperor dandlehim for his own.

1813
01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.400
Hark ye, lords.

1814
01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:52.500
You see I have given herphysic.

1815
01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:54.970
And you must needs bestowher funeral.

1816
01:48:54.970 --> 01:48:58.300
The fields are near, andyou are gallant grooms.

1817
01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:00.130
This done, see that youtake no longer days,

1818
01:49:00.130 --> 01:49:02.630
but send the midwife to mepresently.

1819
01:49:02.630 --> 01:49:04.800
The midwife and the nursewell made away,

1820
01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:08.500
then let the ladies tattlewhat they please.

1821
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:15.900
Aaron, I see thou wilt nottrust the air with secrets.

1822
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:17.930
For this care of Tamora,

1823
01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:21.500
herself and hers arehighly bound to thee.

1824
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:34.500
Now to the Goths, as swiftas swallow flies,

1825
01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.400
there to dispose thistreasure in mine arms

1826
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.830
and secretly to greet theempress' friends.

1827
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:42.770
Come on, you thick-lippedslave.

1828
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:44.270
I'll bear you hence;

1829
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:47.370
for it is you that puts usto our shifts.

1830
01:49:47.370 --> 01:49:50.630
I'll make you feed onberries and on roots

1831
01:49:50.630 --> 01:49:53.630
and feed on curds and wheyand suck the goat

1832
01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:57.200
and cabin in a cave andbring you up

1833
01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.670
to be a warrior andcommand a camp.

1834
01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:32.070
Come, Marcus, come.

1835
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:34.800
Kinsmen, this is the way.

1836
01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:37.600
Sir boy, let me see yourarchery.

1837
01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:42.100
Look you draw home enough,and 'tis there straight.

1838
01:50:57.270 --> 01:51:01.000
The goddess of justice hasleft the earth.

1839
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.100
Be you remembered, Marcus:she's gone, she's fled.

1840
01:51:06.130 --> 01:51:09.800
Sirs, take you to yourtools.

1841
01:51:15.670 --> 01:51:16.830
You, cousins,

1842
01:51:16.830 --> 01:51:19.000
shall so sound the ocean,cast your nets.

1843
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.470
Happily you may catch herin the sea.

1844
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:24.370
Well, there's as littlejustice as at land.

1845
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:27.130
No; Publius and Sempronius,you must do it.

1846
01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:29.900
'Tis you must dig; withmattock and with spade,

1847
01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:32.070
pierce the inmost centreof the earth.

1848
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:33.600
Then, when you come toPluto's region,

1849
01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.500
I pray you, deliver himthis petition.

1850
01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:39.470
Tell him it is for justiceand for aid

1851
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:41.700
and that it comes from oldAndronicus,

1852
01:51:41.700 --> 01:51:43.830
shaken with sorrows inungrateful Rome.

1853
01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.870
O, Rome.

1854
01:51:52.170 --> 01:51:55.500
Well, well, I made theemiserable

1855
01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.830
that time I threw thepeople's suffrages

1856
01:51:57.830 --> 01:52:01.100
on him that now dothtyrannize o'er me.

1857
01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:09.030
Go get you gone, and praybe careful all.

1858
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:11.430
Leave you not oneman-of-war unsearched.

1859
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:13.500
This wicked emperor mayhave shipped her hence;

1860
01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:16.330
then kinsmen, we may gopipe for justice.

1861
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:23.970
Publius, is not this aheavy case,

1862
01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:26.000
to see thy noble unclethus distract?

1863
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.300
Therefore, my lords, ithighly us concerns

1864
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:30.730
by day and night to attendhim carefully

1865
01:52:30.730 --> 01:52:32.630
and feed his humor kindlyas we may

1866
01:52:32.630 --> 01:52:34.630
till time beget somecareful remedy.

1867
01:52:34.630 --> 01:52:37.500
My son, his sorrows arepast remedy.

1868
01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:39.770
Join with the Goths, andwith revengeful war

1869
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:41.630
take wreak on Rome forthis ingratitude,

1870
01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:43.670
and vengeance on thetraitor Saturnine.

1871
01:52:43.670 --> 01:52:44.770
Publius, how now?

1872
01:52:44.770 --> 01:52:45.870
How now, my masters?

1873
01:52:45.870 --> 01:52:47.800
What, have you met withher?

1874
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.230
No, my good lord. butPluto sends you word,

1875
01:52:50.230 --> 01:52:52.570
if you will have Revengein hell, you shall.

1876
01:52:52.570 --> 01:52:55.170
Marry, for Justice, she isso employed, he thinks,

1877
01:52:55.170 --> 01:52:57.030
with Jove in heaven, orsomewhere else,

1878
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:59.230
so that perforce you mustneeds stay a time.

1879
01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:04.400
He doth me wrong to feedme with delays.

1880
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.770
I'll dive into the burninglake below

1881
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:11.000
and pull her out ofAcheron by the heels.

1882
01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:23.600
Marcus, we are but shrubs,no cedars we,

1883
01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.000
no big-boned men framed ofthe cyclops' size.

1884
01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:35.670
But metal, Marcus, steelto the very back,

1885
01:53:35.670 --> 01:53:39.130
yet wrung with wrongs morethan our backs can bear.

1886
01:53:39.130 --> 01:53:44.400
And, sith there is nojustice in earth or hell,

1887
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:49.270
we will solicit heaven,move the gods

1888
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:51.900
to send down justice forto wreak our wrongs.

1889
01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.730
Come, to this gear.

1890
01:53:53.730 --> 01:53:56.300
You are a good archer,Marcus.

1891
01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:58.870
"Ad Jovem " that's foryou.

1892
01:53:58.870 --> 01:54:01.070
Here "Ad Apollinem."

1893
01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:03.600
"Ad Martem " that's formyself.

1894
01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.570
Here, boy, "To Pallas."

1895
01:54:09.570 --> 01:54:11.530
Here "To Mercury."

1896
01:54:11.530 --> 01:54:14.900
"To Saturn," Caius  not toSaturnine.

1897
01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:17.830
You were as good to shootagainst the wind.

1898
01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:23.600
Come to it, boy.

1899
01:54:27.930 --> 01:54:31.300
Marcus, loose when I bid.

1900
01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.100
Of my word, I have writtento effect.

1901
01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.230
There's not a god leftunsolicited.

1902
01:54:35.230 --> 01:54:39.000
Kinsmen, shoot all yourshafts into the court.

1903
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.330
We will afflict theemperor in his pride.

1904
01:54:52.930 --> 01:54:55.030
Now, masters,

1905
01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.100
draw.

1906
01:55:06.230 --> 01:55:09.030
Well done, Lucius!

1907
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:10.670
My lord, I aimed a milebeyond the moon.

1908
01:55:10.670 --> 01:55:12.270
Your letter is withJupiter by this.

1909
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:13.730
Why, there it goes.

1910
01:55:13.730 --> 01:55:16.830
God give his lordship joy.

1911
01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:24.770
News, news from heaven.

1912
01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:26.430
Marcus, the post is come.

1913
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:27.570
Sirrah, what tidings?

1914
01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:28.730
Have you any letters?

1915
01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:29.830
Shall I have justice?

1916
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:32.300
What says Jupiter?

1917
01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:34.830
Oh, the gibbet-maker?

1918
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:37.930
He says that he hath takenthem down again,

1919
01:55:37.930 --> 01:55:40.570
for the man must not behanged till the next week.

1920
01:55:40.570 --> 01:55:43.500
But what says Jupiter, Iask thee?

1921
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.570
Alas, sir, I know notJupiter.

1922
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:49.870
I never drank with him inall my life.

1923
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:52.300
Why, villain, art not thouthe carrier?

1924
01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:56.770
Ay, of my pigeons, sir;nothing else.

1925
01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:03.600
Why, didst thou not comefrom heaven?

1926
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.370
From heaven?

1927
01:56:05.370 --> 01:56:09.200
Alas, sir, no, I nevercame there.

1928
01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:11.070
God forbid I should be sobold

1929
01:56:11.070 --> 01:56:13.400
to press to heaven in myyoung days.

1930
01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:15.300
Why, I am going with mypigeons

1931
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.970
to the Tribunal Plebs, totake up a matter

1932
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:21.670
of brawl betwixt my uncle andone of the imperial's men.

1933
01:56:21.670 --> 01:56:23.630
Why, sir, this is as fitas can be

1934
01:56:23.630 --> 01:56:25.030
to serve you for youroration.

1935
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:28.530
Let him deliver the pigeons tothe emperor from you.

1936
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:32.230
Can you deliver an orationto the emperor with a grace?

1937
01:56:32.230 --> 01:56:33.970
Nay, truly, sir.

1938
01:56:33.970 --> 01:56:36.500
I could never say grace inall my life.

1939
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.970
Come hither, sirrah.

1940
01:56:42.130 --> 01:56:45.400
Make no more ado, but giveyour pigeons to the emperor.

1941
01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:48.630
By me thou shalt havejustice at his hands.

1942
01:56:48.630 --> 01:56:50.500
Hold, hold.

1943
01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:54.500
Here is money for yourcharges.

1944
01:56:55.370 --> 01:56:59.300
Sirrah, can you with a gracedeliver up a supplication?

1945
01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.930
Ay, sir.

1946
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:03.970
Then here is asupplication for you.

1947
01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:05.200
And when you come to him,

1948
01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.770
at the first approach, youmust kneel,

1949
01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:09.970
and then kiss his foot,

1950
01:57:09.970 --> 01:57:11.330
and then deliver up yourpigeons,

1951
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:14.170
and then look for yourreward.

1952
01:57:14.170 --> 01:57:17.300
I'll be at hand, sir; seeyou do it bravely.

1953
01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.700
I warrant you, sir, Iwill.

1954
01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:22.300
Sirrah, hast thou a knife?

1955
01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:24.230
Ay, sir.

1956
01:57:24.230 --> 01:57:26.030
Well, let me see it.

1957
01:57:30.130 --> 01:57:34.130
Here, Marcus, fold it inthe oration;

1958
01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:36.370
for thou hast made it likean humble suppliant.

1959
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.170
And when you have given itto the emperor,

1960
01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:45.630
knock at my door; tell mewhat he says.

1961
01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:48.030
God be with you, sir; Iwill.

1962
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:52.100
Come, Marcus, come.

1963
01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:54.100
Publius, follow me.

1964
01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:17.630
Why, lords, what wrongsare these!

1965
01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.930
Was ever seen an emperorin Rome

1966
01:58:21.930 --> 01:58:26.230
thus overborne, troubled,confronted thus and,

1967
01:58:26.230 --> 01:58:31.270
for the extent of egal justice,used in such contempt?

1968
01:58:31.270 --> 01:58:34.830
My lords, you know, asknow the mightful gods,

1969
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:36.430
however these disturbersof our peace

1970
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:38.570
buzz in the people's ears,there nought hath passed

1971
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:41.500
but even with law againstthe wilful sons

1972
01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:44.170
of old Andronicus.

1973
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:47.700
And what and if hissorrows have sooverwhelmed his wits?

1974
01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:50.130
Shall we be thus afflictedin his wreaks,

1975
01:58:50.130 --> 01:58:54.070
his fits, his frenzy, andhis bitterness?

1976
01:58:54.070 --> 01:58:57.830
And now he writes toheaven for his redress.

1977
01:58:57.830 --> 01:59:02.030
See, here's "To Jove,"

1978
01:59:02.030 --> 01:59:04.170
and this "To Mercury."

1979
01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:07.070
This "To Apollo,"

1980
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:11.170
this "To the God of War."

1981
01:59:11.170 --> 01:59:15.470
Sweet scrolls to fly aboutthe streets of Rome!

1982
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:17.670
What's this but libellingagainst the Senate

1983
01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:20.600
and blazoning ourinjustice everywhere?

1984
01:59:22.170 --> 01:59:23.970
A goodly humor, is it not,my lords,

1985
01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:26.930
as who would say in Romeno justice were?

1986
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:31.300
But if I live, his feignedecstasies

1987
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:33.670
shall be no shelter tothese outrages;

1988
01:59:33.670 --> 01:59:36.600
but he and his shall knowthat justice lives

1989
01:59:36.600 --> 01:59:39.800
in Saturninus' health,whom, if she sleep,

1990
01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:42.230
he'll so awake as he infury

1991
01:59:42.230 --> 01:59:45.470
shall cut off the proudestconspirator that lives.

1992
01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:58.530
My gracious lord, mylovely Saturnine,

1993
01:59:58.530 --> 02:00:02.230
lord of my life, commanderof my thoughts,

1994
02:00:02.230 --> 02:00:06.800
calm thee, and bear thefaults of Titus' age,

1995
02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:09.500
the effects of sorrow forhis valiant sons

1996
02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.830
whose loss hath pierced himdeep and scarred his heart;

1997
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:15.270
and rather comfort hisdistressed plight

1998
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:18.530
than prosecute the meanest orthe best for these contempts.

1999
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:28.800
Why, thus it shall becomehigh-witted Tamora

2000
02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.600
to gloze with all.

2001
02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:33.100
But Titus, I have touchedthee to the quick,

2002
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:35.170
thy life-blood out.

2003
02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:38.900
If Aaron now be wise, thenall is safe,

2004
02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.570
the anchor in the port.

2005
02:00:42.570 --> 02:00:43.670
How now, good fellow.

2006
02:00:43.670 --> 02:00:45.030
Wouldst thou speak withus?

2007
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:48.970
Yea, forsooth, and yourmistership be imperial.

2008
02:00:48.970 --> 02:00:52.070
Empress I am, but yondersits the emperor.

2009
02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.900
'Tis he.

2010
02:00:56.900 --> 02:01:00.430
God and Saint Stephen giveyou godden.

2011
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:05.370
I have brought you aletter and a couple ofpigeons here.

2012
02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:13.370
Go take him away, and hanghim presently.

2013
02:01:13.370 --> 02:01:16.970
How much money must Ihave?

2014
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:19.000
Come, sirrah; you must behanged.

2015
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.830
Hanged by our lady?

2016
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:27.930
Then I have brought up aneck to a fair end.

2017
02:01:27.930 --> 02:01:32.200
Despiteful and intolerablewrongs!

2018
02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:35.700
Shall I endure thismonstrous villainy?

2019
02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:38.800
I know from whence thissame device proceeds.

2020
02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.370
May this be borne  as ifhis traitorous sons

2021
02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:44.730
that died by law formurder of our brother

2022
02:01:44.730 --> 02:01:46.870
have by my means beenbutchered wrongfully?

2023
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:49.170
Go drag the villain hitherby the hair.

2024
02:01:49.170 --> 02:01:53.170
Nor age nor honor shallshape privilege.

2025
02:01:53.170 --> 02:01:56.730
For this proud mock, I'llbe thy slaughterman,

2026
02:01:56.730 --> 02:02:00.370
sly frantic wretch, thatholp'st to make me great,

2027
02:02:00.370 --> 02:02:03.600
in hope thyself shouldgovern Rome and me.

2028
02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.630
What news with thee,Aemilius?

2029
02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:07.430
Arm, my lords!

2030
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:09.600
Rome never had more cause.

2031
02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:11.600
The Goths have gatheredhead,

2032
02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:14.300
and with a power of highresolved men bent to the spoil,

2033
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:16.700
they hither march amain,under conduct of Lucius,

2034
02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:20.700
son to old Andronicus, whothreats in course of hisrevenge

2035
02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:23.470
to do as much as everCoriolanus did.

2036
02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:29.170
Is warlike Lucius generalof the Goths?

2037
02:02:29.170 --> 02:02:33.030
These tidings nip me, andI hang the head

2038
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:40.070
as flowers with frost, orgrass beat down withstorms.

2039
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:47.530
Ay, now begins our sorrowsto approach.

2040
02:02:47.530 --> 02:02:51.930
'Tis he the common peoplelove so much.

2041
02:02:51.930 --> 02:02:53.530
Myself hath often heardthem say

2042
02:02:53.530 --> 02:02:55.130
when I have walked like aprivate man

2043
02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:56.800
that Lucius' banishmentwas wrongfully,

2044
02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:59.030
and they have wished thatLucius were their emperor.

2045
02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:00.200
Why should you fear?

2046
02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.670
Is not your city strong?

2047
02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:03.370
Ay, but the citizens favorLucius

2048
02:03:03.370 --> 02:03:06.130
and will revolt from me tosuccor him.

2049
02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:10.370
King, be thy thoughtsimperious like thy name.

2050
02:03:10.370 --> 02:03:14.230
Is the sun dimmed, thatgnats do fly in it?

2051
02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:16.670
The eagle suffers littlebirds to sing

2052
02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:18.800
and is not careful whatthey mean thereby,

2053
02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:20.630
knowing that with theshadow of his wings

2054
02:03:20.630 --> 02:03:23.100
he can at pleasure stinttheir melody.

2055
02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:28.970
Even so mayest thou thegiddy men of Rome.

2056
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:32.900
Then cheer thy spirit; forknow thou, Emperor,

2057
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:35.530
I will enchant the oldAndronicus

2058
02:03:35.530 --> 02:03:38.170
with words more sweet andyet more dangerous

2059
02:03:38.170 --> 02:03:40.570
than baits to fish orhoney-stalks to sheep,

2060
02:03:40.570 --> 02:03:42.470
when as the one is woundedwith the bait,

2061
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:44.330
the other rotted withdelicious feed.

2062
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:47.870
But he will not entreathis son for us.

2063
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:49.830
If Tamora entreat him,then he will;

2064
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:53.200
for I can smooth and fillhis aged ears

2065
02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:56.500
with golden promises,that, were his heart

2066
02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:58.830
almost impregnable, hisold ears deaf,

2067
02:03:58.830 --> 02:04:02.470
yet should both ear andheart obey my tongue.

2068
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:04.200
Go thou before.

2069
02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.830
Be our ambassador.

2070
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:07.970
Say that the emperorrequests a parley

2071
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:10.170
of warlike Lucius, andappoint the meeting

2072
02:04:10.170 --> 02:04:15.730
even at his father'shouse, the old Andronicus.

2073
02:04:15.730 --> 02:04:18.800
Aemilius, do this messagehonorably.

2074
02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:21.300
And if he stand on hostagefor his safety,

2075
02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:23.770
bid him demand what pledgewill please him best.

2076
02:04:23.770 --> 02:04:27.370
Your bidding shall I doeffectually.

2077
02:04:27.370 --> 02:04:29.670
Now will I to that oldAndronicus,

2078
02:04:29.670 --> 02:04:32.370
and temper him with allthe art I have

2079
02:04:32.370 --> 02:04:35.830
to pluck proud Lucius fromthe warlike Goths.

2080
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:40.300
And now, sweet emperor, beblithe again

2081
02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:43.700
and bury all thy fears inmy devices.

2082
02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:47.000
Then go incessantly, andplead to him.

2083
02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:27.670
Approved warriors and myfaithful friends,

2084
02:05:27.670 --> 02:05:30.100
I have received lettersfrom great Rome,

2085
02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:32.930
which signifies what hatethey bear their emperor

2086
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:35.170
and how desirous of oursight they are.

2087
02:05:35.170 --> 02:05:38.270
Therefore, great lords, be,as your titles witness,

2088
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:41.500
imperious and impatient ofyour wrongs;

2089
02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:44.270
and wherein Rome hath doneyou any scathe,

2090
02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:48.730
let him make treblesatisfaction.

2091
02:05:48.730 --> 02:05:53.930
Brave slip, sprung fromthe great Andronicus,

2092
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:58.400
whose name was once ourterror, now our comfort,

2093
02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:01.800
whose high exploits andhonorable deeds

2094
02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:05.870
ingrateful Rome requiteswith foul contempt,

2095
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:10.270
be bold in us: we'llfollow where thou lead'st,

2096
02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:13.330
like stinging bees inhottest summer's day,

2097
02:06:13.330 --> 02:06:17.370
led by their master to theflowered fields,

2098
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:21.070
and be avenged on cursedTamora.

2099
02:06:21.070 --> 02:06:25.100
And as he saith, so say weall with him.

2100
02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:26.430
Ay.

2101
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:29.430
I humbly thank him, and Ithank you all.

2102
02:06:29.430 --> 02:06:34.530
But who comes here, led bya lusty Goth?

2103
02:06:34.530 --> 02:06:37.730
Renowned Lucius, from ourtroops I strayed

2104
02:06:37.730 --> 02:06:39.800
to gaze upon a ruinousmonastery.

2105
02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:41.770
And as I earnestly did fixmine eye

2106
02:06:41.770 --> 02:06:43.000
upon the wasted building,

2107
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.470
suddenly I heard a childcry underneath a wall.

2108
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:47.530
I made unto the noise,when soon I heard

2109
02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:50.630
the crying babe controlledwith this discourse:

2110
02:06:50.630 --> 02:06:54.400
"Peace, tawny slave, halfme and half thy dame!

2111
02:06:54.400 --> 02:06:57.070
"Did not thy hue bewraywhose brat thou art,

2112
02:06:57.070 --> 02:06:59.530
"had nature lent thee butthy mother's look,

2113
02:06:59.530 --> 02:07:01.600
"villain, thou mightsthave been an emperor.

2114
02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:03.900
"But where the bull andcow are both milk-white,

2115
02:07:03.900 --> 02:07:06.330
"they never do beget acoal-black calf.

2116
02:07:06.330 --> 02:07:07.770
Peace, villain, peace! "

2117
02:07:07.770 --> 02:07:09.030
even thus he rates thebabe

2118
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:11.370
"For I must bear thee to atrusty Goth,

2119
02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:13.630
"who, when he knows thouart the empress' babe,

2120
02:07:13.630 --> 02:07:15.800
will hold thee dearly forthy mother's sake."

2121
02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:18.270
With this, my weapondrawn, I rushed upon him,

2122
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:20.470
surprised him suddenly,and brought him hither

2123
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:21.970
to use as you thinkneedful of the man.

2124
02:07:21.970 --> 02:07:26.200
O, worthy Goth, this isthe incarnate devil

2125
02:07:26.200 --> 02:07:29.230
that robbed Andronicus ofhis good hand.

2126
02:07:29.230 --> 02:07:33.630
This is the pearl thatpleased your empress' eye.

2127
02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:38.330
And here's the base fruitof her burning lust.

2128
02:07:38.330 --> 02:07:41.570
Say, wall-eyed slave,whither wouldst thou convey

2129
02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:44.330
this growing image of thyfiend-like face?

2130
02:07:44.330 --> 02:07:46.300
Why dost not speak?

2131
02:07:46.300 --> 02:07:48.530
What, deaf?

2132
02:07:48.530 --> 02:07:50.370
Not a word?

2133
02:07:50.370 --> 02:07:51.670
A halter, soldiers!

2134
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.930
Hang him on this tree,

2135
02:07:52.930 --> 02:07:55.330
and by his side his fruitof bastardy.

2136
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:57.630
Touch not the boy; he isof royal blood.

2137
02:07:57.630 --> 02:07:59.770
Too like the sire for everbeing good.

2138
02:07:59.770 --> 02:08:03.270
First hang the child, thathe may see it sprawl,

2139
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:05.970
a sight to vex thefather's soul withal.

2140
02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:07.370
Get me a ladder.

2141
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:08.930
Lucius, save the child,

2142
02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:10.930
and bear it from me to theempress.

2143
02:08:10.930 --> 02:08:13.830
If thou do this, I'll showthee wondrous things

2144
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:16.000
that highly may advantagethee to hear.

2145
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:19.330
If thou wilt not, befallwhat may befall,

2146
02:08:19.330 --> 02:08:22.100
I'll speak no more butvengeance rot you all!

2147
02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:24.700
Say on; and if it pleaseme which thou speak'st,

2148
02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.670
thy child shall live, andI will see it nourished.

2149
02:08:26.670 --> 02:08:28.370
And if it please thee.

2150
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:29.730
Why, assure thee, Lucius,

2151
02:08:29.730 --> 02:08:32.970
'twill vex thy soul tohear what I shall speak;

2152
02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:36.200
for I must talk of murders,rapes, and massacres,

2153
02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:38.830
acts of black night,abominable deeds,

2154
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:41.630
complots of mischief,treason, villainies,

2155
02:08:41.630 --> 02:08:44.830
ruthful to hear, yetpiteously performed.

2156
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:47.200
And this shall all beburied in my death,

2157
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.100
unless thou swear to me mychild shall live.

2158
02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:51.200
Tell on thy mind.

2159
02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.800
I say thy child shalllive.

2160
02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:54.500
Swear that he shall, andthen I will begin.

2161
02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:55.630
Who should I swear by?

2162
02:08:55.630 --> 02:08:56.870
Thou believest no god.

2163
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:58.900
That granted, how canstthou believe an oath?

2164
02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:01.700
What if I do not, asindeed I do not?

2165
02:09:01.700 --> 02:09:04.130
Yet, for I know thou artreligious

2166
02:09:04.130 --> 02:09:07.270
and hast a thing withinthee called conscience;

2167
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:09.200
therefore, I urge thyoath.

2168
02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:13.300
For that I know an idiotholds his bauble for a god,

2169
02:09:13.300 --> 02:09:16.430
and keeps the oath whichby that god he swears,

2170
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:17.870
to that I'll urge him.

2171
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:20.600
Therefore, thou shalt vowby that same god

2172
02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:22.570
what god soe'er it be thatthou adorest

2173
02:09:22.570 --> 02:09:23.730
and hast in reverence

2174
02:09:23.730 --> 02:09:26.170
to save my boy, to nourishand bring him up;

2175
02:09:26.170 --> 02:09:31.100
or else I will discovernought to thee.

2176
02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:36.200
Even by my god, I swear tothee I will.

2177
02:09:58.030 --> 02:10:01.970
First know thou, I begothim on the empress.

2178
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:04.300
O, most insatiate andluxurious woman!

2179
02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:08.200
Tut, Lucius; this was buta deed of charity

2180
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.900
to that which thou shalthear of me anon.

2181
02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:15.630
'Twas her two sons thatmurdered Bassianus.

2182
02:10:15.630 --> 02:10:18.400
They cut thy sister'stongue and ravished her

2183
02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:22.300
and cut her hands andtrimmed her as thousaw'st.

2184
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.830
O, detestable villain!

2185
02:10:23.830 --> 02:10:25.030
Call'st thou thattrimming?

2186
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:27.870
Why, she was washed andcut and trimmed,

2187
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:30.830
and 'twas trim sport for themwhich had the doing of it.

2188
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:32.970
O, barbarous beastlyvillains like thyself!

2189
02:10:32.970 --> 02:10:35.700
Indeed, I was their tutorto instruct them.

2190
02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:38.500
That codding spirit hadthey from their mother,

2191
02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:41.600
as sure a card as ever wonthe set.

2192
02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:44.970
That bloody mind, I think,they learned of me,

2193
02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:47.670
as true a dog as everfought at head.

2194
02:10:47.670 --> 02:10:50.530
Well, let my deeds bewitness of my worth.

2195
02:10:50.530 --> 02:10:54.230
I trained thy brethren tothat guileful hole

2196
02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:57.200
where the dead corpse ofBassianus lay.

2197
02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:59.970
I wrote the letter thatthy father found

2198
02:10:59.970 --> 02:11:02.570
and hid the gold withinthat letter mentioned,

2199
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:05.570
confederate with the queenand her two sons.

2200
02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:08.570
And what not done, thatthou hast cause to rue,

2201
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:11.470
wherein I had no stroke ofmischief in it?

2202
02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:14.570
I played the cheater forthy father's hand,

2203
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:17.000
and when I had it, drewmyself apart

2204
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.070
and almost broke my heartwith extreme laughter.

2205
02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:22.300
I pried me through thecrevice of a wall,

2206
02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:25.330
when, for his hand, he hadhis two sons' heads,

2207
02:11:25.330 --> 02:11:28.870
beheld his tears, andlaughed so heartily

2208
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:32.400
that both mine eyes wererainy like to his.

2209
02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:34.600
And when I told theempress of this sport,

2210
02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:37.300
she sounded almost at mypleasing tale

2211
02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:40.200
and for my tidings gave metwenty kisses.

2212
02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:44.500
What, canst thou say allthis and never blush?

2213
02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:47.970
Ay, like a black dog, asthe saying is.

2214
02:11:47.970 --> 02:11:51.130
Art thou not sorry forthese heinous deeds?

2215
02:11:51.130 --> 02:11:55.270
Ay, that I had not done athousand more.

2216
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:58.330
Even now I curse the day and yet, I think,

2217
02:11:58.330 --> 02:12:00.730
few come within thecompass of my curse

2218
02:12:00.730 --> 02:12:03.670
wherein I did not somenotorious ill

2219
02:12:03.670 --> 02:12:07.100
as kill a man, or elsedevise his death,

2220
02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:10.400
ravish a maid, or plot theway to do it,

2221
02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:13.730
accuse some innocent andforswear myself,

2222
02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:16.700
set deadly enmity betweentwo friends,

2223
02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:19.970
make poor men's cattlebreak their necks,

2224
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:23.530
set fire on barns andhaystacks in the night,

2225
02:12:23.530 --> 02:12:27.030
and bid the owners quenchthem with their tears.

2226
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:29.900
Oft have I digged up deadmen from their graves

2227
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:32.500
and set them upright attheir dear friends' door

2228
02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:35.570
even when their sorrowsalmost was forgot

2229
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:38.100
and on their skins, as onthe bark of trees,

2230
02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:40.830
have with my knife carvedin Roman letters,

2231
02:12:40.830 --> 02:12:43.770
"Let not your sorrow die,though I am dead."

2232
02:12:43.770 --> 02:12:47.630
Tut, I have done athousand dreadful things

2233
02:12:47.630 --> 02:12:50.300
as willingly as one wouldkill a fly,

2234
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:53.500
and nothing grieves meheartily indeed

2235
02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:56.000
but that I cannot do tenthousand more.

2236
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.770
Bring down the devil, forhe must not die

2237
02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:59.670
so sweet a death ashanging presently.

2238
02:12:59.670 --> 02:13:02.130
If there be devils, wouldI were a devil,

2239
02:13:02.130 --> 02:13:04.270
to live and burn ineverlasting fire,

2240
02:13:04.270 --> 02:13:06.800
so I might have yourcompany in hell

2241
02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:09.530
but to torment you with mybitter tongue!

2242
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:13.330
Sirs, stop his mouth, andlet him speak no more!

2243
02:13:13.330 --> 02:13:15.870
My lord, there is amessenger from Rome

2244
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:17.470
desires to be admitted toyour presence.

2245
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:21.570
Let him come near.

2246
02:13:21.570 --> 02:13:23.330
Welcome, Aemilius.

2247
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:24.730
What's the news from Rome?

2248
02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:27.700
Lord Lucius, and youprinces of the Goths,

2249
02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:30.230
the Roman emperor greetsyou all by me,

2250
02:13:30.230 --> 02:13:32.530
and, for he understandsyou are in arms,

2251
02:13:32.530 --> 02:13:35.330
he craves a parley at yourfather's house,

2252
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:37.170
willing you to demand yourhostages,

2253
02:13:37.170 --> 02:13:39.500
and they shall beimmediately delivered.

2254
02:13:39.500 --> 02:13:42.200
What says our general?

2255
02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:44.700
Aemilius, let the emperorgive his pledges

2256
02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:47.500
unto my father and my uncleMarcus, and we will come.

2257
02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:49.500
March away!

2258
02:14:12.070 --> 02:14:14.900
Thus, in this strange andsad habiliment,

2259
02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:17.230
I will encounter withAndronicus

2260
02:14:17.230 --> 02:14:20.370

Knock at his study, wherethey say he keeps

2263
02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:29.930
to ruminate strange plotsof dire revenge.

2264
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:32.430
Tell him Revenge is cometo join with him,

2265
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:34.730
and work confusion on hisenemies.

2266
02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:51.430
Who doth molest mycontemplation?

2267
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:54.070
Is it your trick to makeme ope the door,

2268
02:14:54.070 --> 02:14:56.700
that so my sad decrees mayfly away

2269
02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:59.070
and all my study be to noeffect?

2270
02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:01.770
You are deceived; for whatI mean to do

2272

and what is written shallbe executed.

2273
02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:11.200
Titus, I am come to talkwith thee.

2274
02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:14.870
No, not a word.

2275
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:16.570
How can I grace my talk,

2276
02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:19.470
wanting a hand to give itthat accord?

2277
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:22.230
You have the odds of me;therefore no more.

2278
02:15:22.230 --> 02:15:25.500
If thou didst know me,thou wouldst talk with me.

2279
02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:28.570
I am not mad; I know theewell enough.

02:15:28.570 --> 02:15:30.270
Witness this wretchedstump.

2281
02:15:30.270 --> 02:15:32.400
Witness these crimsonlines.

2282
02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:35.230
Witness these trenchesmade by grief and care.

2283
02:15:35.230 --> 02:15:37.800
Witness the tiring day andheavy night.

2284
02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:40.030
Witness all sorrow that Iknow thee well

2285
02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:41.900
for our proud empress,mighty Tamora.

2286
02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:44.630
Is not thy coming for myother hand?

2287
02:15:44.630 --> 02:15:48.600
Know thou, sad man, I amnot Tamora.

2288
02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:52.600
She is thy enemy and I thyfriend.

2289
02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:56.470
I am Revenge, sent fromthe infernal kingdom

2290
02:15:56.470 --> 02:15:58.830
to ease the gnawingvulture of thy mind

2291
02:15:58.830 --> 02:16:04.030
by working wreakfulvengeance on thy foes.

Therefore, come down andwelcome me to this world'slight.

02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:15.770
There's not a hollow caveor lurking place,

2295
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:18.400
no vast obscurity or mistyvale

2296
02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:20.370
where bloody murder ordetested rape

2297
02:16:20.370 --> 02:16:23.630
can couch for fear but Iwill find them out

2298
02:16:23.630 --> 02:16:27.170
and in their ear tell themmy dreadful name,

2299
02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:31.100
Revenge, which makes thefoul offender quake.

2300
02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:33.830
Art thou Revenge?

2301
02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:37.930
And art thou sent to me to bea torment to mine enemies?

2302

2303
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:47.170
Do me some service ere Icome to thee.

2304
02:16:47.170 --> 02:16:50.400
Lo, by thy side where Rapeand Murder stands.

2305
02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:52.870
Now give some surance thatthou art Revenge.

2306
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:55.470
Stab them, or tear them onthy chariot wheel.

2307
02:16:55.470 --> 02:16:57.430
And then I'll come and bethy wagoner

2308
02:16:57.430 --> 02:16:59.430
and whirl along with theeabout the globes.

2309
02:16:59.430 --> 02:17:02.270
Provide thee two properpalfreys, black as jet,

2310
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:04.800
to hale thy vengeful wagonswift away,

2311
02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:07.730
and find out murderers intheir guilty caves.

2312
02:17:07.730 --> 02:17:10.670
And when thy car is loadenwith their heads,

2313
02:17:10.670 --> 02:17:13.900
I will dismount, and bythy wagon wheel

2314
02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:17.530
trot like a servilefootman, all day long,

2315
02:17:17.530 --> 02:17:20.000
even from Hyperion'srising in the east

2316
02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.370
until his very downfall inthe sea.

2317
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:27.130
And day by day I'll dothis heavy task,

2318
02:17:27.130 --> 02:17:30.400
so thou destroy Rapine andMurder there.

2319
02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:34.930
These are my ministers andcome with me.

2320
02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:37.730
Are they thy ministers?

2321
02:17:37.730 --> 02:17:40.200
What are they called?

2322
02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.470
Rape and Murder; thereforecalled so

2323
02:17:43.470 --> 02:17:47.100
'cause they take vengeanceof such kind of men.

2324
02:17:47.100 --> 02:17:53.370
Good Lord, how like theempress' sons they are!

2325
02:17:53.370 --> 02:17:58.230
And you the empress!

2326
02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:06.600
But we worldly men havemiserable, mad, mistaking eyes.

2327
02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:11.770
O, sweet Revenge, now do Icome to thee.

2328
02:18:11.770 --> 02:18:14.570
And, if one arm's embracementwill content thee,

2329
02:18:14.570 --> 02:18:21.370
I will embrace thee in itby and by.

2330
02:18:21.370 --> 02:18:23.870
This closing with him fitshis lunacy.

2331
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:26.430
Whate'er I forge to feedhis brain-sick humors

2332
02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:28.730
do you uphold and maintainin your speeches,

2333
02:18:28.730 --> 02:18:31.200
for now he firmly takes mefor Revenge.

2334
02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:33.430
And, being credulous inthis mad thought,

2335
02:18:33.430 --> 02:18:35.730
I'll make him send forLucius his son,

2336
02:18:35.730 --> 02:18:38.000
and whilst I at a banquethold him sure,

2337
02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.130
I'll find some cunningpractice out of hand

2338
02:18:40.130 --> 02:18:42.370
to scatter and dispersethe giddy Goths,

2339
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:44.170
or at the least, make themhis enemies.

2340
02:18:44.170 --> 02:18:52.470
See, here he comes, and Imust ply my theme.

2341
02:18:52.470 --> 02:18:56.170
Long have I been forlorn,and all for thee.

2342
02:18:56.170 --> 02:19:01.370
Welcome, dread Fury, to mywoeful house.

2343
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:06.070
Rapine and Murder, you arewelcome too.

2344
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:11.230
How like the empress andher sons you are.

2345
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:13.370
Well are you fitted, hadyou but a Moor.

2346
02:19:13.370 --> 02:19:15.900
Could not all hell affordyou such a devil?

2347
02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:18.030
For well I wot the empressnever wags

2348
02:19:18.030 --> 02:19:22.370
but in her company thereis a Moor.

2349
02:19:22.370 --> 02:19:24.230
And, would you representour queen aright,

2350
02:19:24.230 --> 02:19:28.070
it were convenient you hadsuch a devil.

2351
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:31.770
But welcome as you are.

2352
02:19:31.770 --> 02:19:33.870
What shall we do?

2353
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:36.170
What wouldst thou have usdo, Andronicus?

2354
02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:39.900
Show me a murderer; I'lldeal with him.

2355
02:19:39.900 --> 02:19:41.900
Show me a villain thathath done a rape,

2356
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.770
and I am sent to berevenged on him.

2357
02:19:43.770 --> 02:19:45.930
Show me a thousand thathath done thee wrong,

2358
02:19:45.930 --> 02:19:48.930
and I will be revenged onthem all.

2359
02:19:48.930 --> 02:19:53.830
Look round about thewicked streets of Rome,

2360
02:19:53.830 --> 02:19:56.530
and when thou find'st aman that's like thyself,

2361
02:19:56.530 --> 02:20:00.330
good Murder, stab him;he's a murderer.

2362
02:20:00.330 --> 02:20:02.770
Go thou with him, and whenit is thy hap

2363
02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:04.930
to find another that islike to thee,

2364
02:20:04.930 --> 02:20:09.330
good Rapine, stab him;he's a ravisher.

2365
02:20:09.330 --> 02:20:13.300
Go thou with them, and inthe emperor's court

2366
02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:15.570
there is a queen, attendedby a Moor.

2367
02:20:15.570 --> 02:20:17.730
Well shalt thou know herby thine own proportion,

2368
02:20:17.730 --> 02:20:21.530
for up and down she dothresemble thee.

2369
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:25.900
I pray thee, do on themsome violent death.

2370
02:20:25.900 --> 02:20:30.070
They have been violent tome and mine.

2371
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:32.830
Well hast thou lessonedus.

2372
02:20:32.830 --> 02:20:35.430
This shall we do.

2373
02:20:35.430 --> 02:20:37.870
But would it please thee,good Andronicus,

2374
02:20:37.870 --> 02:20:40.600
to send for Lucius, thythrice-valiant son,

2375
02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:43.530
who leads towards Rome aband of warlike Goths,

2376
02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:46.130
and bid him come andbanquet at thy house.

2377
02:20:46.130 --> 02:20:49.500
When he is here, even atthy solemn feast,

2378
02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:52.870
I will bring in theempress and her sons,

2379
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:55.570
the emperor himself, andall thy foes.

2380
02:20:55.570 --> 02:20:58.430
And at thy mercy shallthey stoop and kneel,

2381
02:20:58.430 --> 02:21:01.600
and on them shalt thouease thy angry heart.

2382
02:21:01.600 --> 02:21:05.670
What says Andronicus tothis device?

2383
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:09.600
Marcus, my brother!

2384
02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:15.870

Thou shalt inquire him outamong the Goths.

2387
02:21:23.070 --> 02:21:25.270
Bid him repair to me, andbring with him

2388
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:28.370
some of the chiefestprinces of the Goths.

2389
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:30.970
Bid him encamp hissoldiers where they are.

2390
02:21:30.970 --> 02:21:36.270
Tell him the emperor andthe empress too

2392

The one is Murder, andRape is the other's name.

2425
02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:45.830
And therefore bind them,gentle Publius

2426
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:50.400
Caius and Valentine, layhands on them.

2427
02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:52.770
Oft have you heard me wishfor such an hour,

2428
02:23:52.770 --> 02:23:56.430
and now I find it;therefore bind them sure,

2429
02:23:56.430 --> 02:24:00.970
and stop their mouths ifthey begin to cry.

2430
02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:02.670
Villains, forbear!

2431
02:24:02.670 --> 02:24:04.400
We are the empress' sons.

2432
02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:09.400
And therefore do what weare commanded.

2433
02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:11.170
Stop close their mouths.

2434
02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:13.770
Let them not speak a word.

2435
02:24:13.770 --> 02:24:16.030
Is he sure bound?

2436
02:24:16.030 --> 02:24:18.030
Look that you bind themfast.

2437
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:53.070
Come, come, Lavinia.

2438
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:54.800
Look, thy foes are bound.

2439
02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:57.470
Sirs, stop their mouths.

2440
02:24:57.470 --> 02:25:01.230
Let them not speak to me.

2441
02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:07.730
But let them hear whatfearful words I utter.

2442
02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:11.630
O, villains, Chiron andDemetrius.

2443
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:15.200
Here stands the spring whomyou have stained with mud;

2444
02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.530
this goodly summer withyour winter mixed.

2445
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:22.330
You killed her husband,and for that vile fault

2446
02:25:22.330 --> 02:25:25.230
two of her brothers werecondemned to death,

2447
02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:28.030
my hand cut off and made amerry jest.

2448
02:25:28.030 --> 02:25:30.070
Both her sweet hands, hertongue,

2449
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:32.230
and that more dear thanhands or tongue

2450
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:35.430
her spotless chastity

2451
02:25:35.430 --> 02:25:41.030
inhuman traitors, youconstrained and forced.

2452
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:43.500
What would you say, if Ishould let you speak?

2453
02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:48.330
Villains, for shame youcould not beg for grace.

2454
02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:52.730
Hark, wretches, how I meanto martyr you.

2455
02:25:52.730 --> 02:25:55.670
This one hand yet is leftto cut your throats,

2456
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:58.770
whiles that Lavinia 'tweenher stumps doth hold

2457
02:25:58.770 --> 02:26:01.470
the basin that receivesyour guilty blood.

2458
02:26:01.470 --> 02:26:03.870
You know your mother meansto feast with me

2459
02:26:03.870 --> 02:26:07.900
and calls herself Revenge,and thinks me mad.

2460
02:26:07.900 --> 02:26:11.930
Hark, wretches; I willgrind your bones to dust,

2461
02:26:11.930 --> 02:26:14.670
and with your blood and itI'll make a paste;

2462
02:26:14.670 --> 02:26:18.130
and of the paste a coffinI will rear

2463
02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:20.730
and make two pasties ofyour shameful heads

2464
02:26:20.730 --> 02:26:24.930
and bid that strumpet,your unhallowed dam,

2465
02:26:24.930 --> 02:26:29.030
like to the earth, swallowher own increase.

2466
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:32.170
This is the feast that Ihave bid her to

2467
02:26:32.170 --> 02:26:34.600
and this the banquet sheshall surfeit on;

2468
02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:37.470
for worse than Philomelyou used my daughter,

2469
02:26:37.470 --> 02:26:41.030
and worse than Progne Iwill be revenged.

2470
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:43.230
And now prepare yourthroats.

2471
02:26:52.330 --> 02:26:59.230
Lavinia, come, receive theblood.

2472
02:26:59.230 --> 02:27:02.930
Come, come, be every oneofficious

2473
02:27:02.930 --> 02:27:06.330
to make this banquet,which I wish may prove

2474
02:27:06.330 --> 02:27:11.070
more stern and bloody thanthe centaurs' feast.

2475
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:41.230
Bring them in, for I willplay the cook

2476
02:27:41.230 --> 02:27:44.670
and see them ready againsttheir mother comes.

2477
02:28:38.500 --> 02:28:41.970
Uncle Marcus, since 'tismy father's mind

2478
02:28:41.970 --> 02:28:44.470
that I repair to Rome, Iam content.

2479
02:28:44.470 --> 02:28:48.370
And ours with thine,befall what fortune will.

2480
02:28:48.370 --> 02:28:51.400
Good uncle, take you inthis barbarous Moor,

2481
02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:54.270
this ravenous tiger, thisaccursed devil.

2482
02:28:54.270 --> 02:28:56.030
Let him receive nosustenance.

2483
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:58.230
Fetter him till he be broughtunto the empress' face

2484
02:28:58.230 --> 02:29:03.170
for testimony of her foulproceedings.

2485
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:05.670
And see the ambush of ourfriends be strong.

2486
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:08.030
I fear the emperor meansno good to us.

2487
02:29:11.470 --> 02:29:14.530
Some devil whisper cursesin my ear

2488
02:29:14.530 --> 02:29:17.500
and prompt me that mytongue may utter forth

2489
02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:20.470
the venomous malice of myswelling heart!

2490
02:29:20.470 --> 02:29:25.000
Away, inhuman dog,unhallowed slave!

2491
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:31.870
Sirs, help our uncle toconvey him in.

2492
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:34.570
The trumpets show theemperor is at hand.

2493
02:29:56.930 --> 02:29:59.530
What, hath the firmamentmore suns than one?

2494
02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:02.130
What boots it thee to canthyself a sun?

2495
02:30:02.130 --> 02:30:05.000
Rome's emperor, andnephew, break the parle.

2496
02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:08.500
These quarrels must bequietly debated.

2497
02:30:08.500 --> 02:30:11.230
The feast is ready whichthe careful Titus

2498
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:14.000
hath ordained to anhonorable end,

2499
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.870
for peace, for love, forleague, and good to Rome.

2500
02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:20.600
Please you, therefore, drawnigh and take your places.

2501
02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:22.600
Marcus, we will.

2502
02:31:02.470 --> 02:31:04.100
Welcome, my lord.

2503
02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:07.030
Welcome, dread queen.

2504
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:09.970
Welcome, ye warlike Goths.

2505
02:31:09.970 --> 02:31:11.600
Welcome, Lucius.

2506
02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:13.630
And welcome all.

2507
02:31:13.630 --> 02:31:16.900
Although the cheer be poor,'twill fill your stomachs.

2508
02:31:16.900 --> 02:31:18.900
Please you eat of it.

2509
02:32:21.130 --> 02:32:24.200
Why art thou thus attired,Andronicus?

2510
02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:26.500
Because I would be sure tohave all well

2511
02:32:26.500 --> 02:32:29.870
to entertain Your Highnessand your empress.

2512
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:32.500
We are beholding to you,good Andronicus.

2513
02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:35.530
And if Your Highness knewmy heart, you were.

2514
02:33:47.930 --> 02:33:51.430
My lord the emperor,resolve me this:

2515
02:33:51.430 --> 02:33:55.300
was it well done of rashVirginius

2516
02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:58.230
to slay his daughter withhis own right hand

2517
02:33:58.230 --> 02:34:04.570
because she was enforced,stained, and deflowered?

2518
02:34:04.570 --> 02:34:06.670
It was, Andronicus.

2519
02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:10.400
Your reason, mighty lord.

2520
02:34:10.400 --> 02:34:12.930
Because the girl shouldnot survive her shame

2521
02:34:12.930 --> 02:34:16.900
and by her presence stillrenew his sorrows.

2522
02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:23.800
A reason mighty, strong,and effectual

2523
02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:29.930
a pattern, precedent, andlively warrant

2524
02:34:29.930 --> 02:34:36.030
for me, most wretched, toperform the like.

2525
02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:56.670
Die, die, Lavinia, and thyshame with thee;

2526
02:34:56.670 --> 02:35:00.300
and with thy shame thyfather's sorrow die!

2527
02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:02.930
What hast thou done,unnatural and unkind?

2528
02:35:02.930 --> 02:35:08.330
Killed her for whom mytears have made me blind.

2529
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:11.830
I am as woeful asVirginius was

2530
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:15.800
and have a thousand timesmore cause than he

2531
02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:18.600
to do this outrage.

2532
02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:21.730
And it now is done.

2533
02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:24.370
What, was she ravished?

2534
02:35:24.370 --> 02:35:26.630
Tell who did the deed.

2535
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:28.870
Will it please you eat?

2536
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:31.370
Will it please YourHighness feed?

2537
02:35:31.370 --> 02:35:34.400
Why hast thou slain thineonly daughter thus?

2538
02:35:34.400 --> 02:35:37.270
Not I; 'twas Chiron andDemetrius.

2539
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:39.370
They ravished her, and cutaway her tongue,

2540
02:35:39.370 --> 02:35:43.400
and they, 'twas they thatdid her all this wrong.

2541
02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.170
Go, fetch them hither tous presently.

2542
02:35:45.170 --> 02:35:47.830
Why, there they are, bothbaked in this pie

2543
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:50.230
whereof their motherdaintily hath fed,

2544
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:54.330
eating the flesh that sheherself hath bred.

2545
02:35:54.330 --> 02:36:00.470
'Tis true, 'tis true: witnessmy knife's sharp point.

2546
02:36:00.470 --> 02:36:04.870
Die, frantic wretch, forthis accursed deed!

2547
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:11.730
Can the son's eye beholdhis father bleed?

2548
02:36:11.730 --> 02:36:15.630
There's meed for meed,death for a deadly deed!

2549
02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:25.370
You sad-faced men, peopleand sons of Rome,

2550
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:28.670
by uproars severed as aflight of fowl

2551
02:36:28.670 --> 02:36:32.600
scattered by winds andhigh tempestuous gusts,

2552
02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:36.030
O, let me teach you how toknit again

2553
02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:39.970
this scattered corn intoone mutual sheaf,

2554
02:36:39.970 --> 02:36:42.630
these broken limbs againinto one body,

2555
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:46.000
lest Rome herself be baneunto herself

2556
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.830
and she whom mightykingdoms curtsy to,

2557
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:51.500
like a forlorn anddesperate castaway,

2558
02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:55.230
do shameful execution onherself.

2559
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:57.770
But if my frosty signs andchaps of age,

2560
02:36:57.770 --> 02:37:00.670
grave witnesses of trueexperience,

2561
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:03.170
cannot induce you toattend my words,

2562
02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:08.200
speak, Rome's dear friend,as erst our ancestor,

2563
02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:11.030
when with his solemntongue he did discourse

2564
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:13.330
to love-sick Dido's sadattending ear

2565
02:37:13.330 --> 02:37:15.870
the story of that balefulburning night,

2566
02:37:15.870 --> 02:37:19.830
when subtle Greeks surprisedKing Priam's Troy.

2567
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:23.700
Tell us what Sinon hathbewitched our ears,

2568
02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:25.770
and who hath brought thefatal engine in

2569
02:37:25.770 --> 02:37:31.470
that gives our Troy, ourRome, the civil wound.

2570
02:37:31.470 --> 02:37:35.730
My heart is not compact offlint nor steel,

2571
02:37:35.730 --> 02:37:38.770
nor can I utter all ourbitter griefs,

2572
02:37:38.770 --> 02:37:42.000
but floods of tears willdrown my oratory

2573
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.670
and break my utterance,even in the time

2574
02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:46.630
when it should move ye toattend me most,

2575
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:50.630
and force you tocommiseration.

2576
02:37:50.630 --> 02:37:53.070
Here's Rome's youngcaptain.

2577
02:37:53.070 --> 02:37:55.170
Let him tell the tale

2578
02:37:55.170 --> 02:37:59.870
while I stand by and weepto hear him speak.

2579
02:37:59.870 --> 02:38:04.500
Then, gracious auditory,be it known to you

2580
02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:06.400
that Chiron and the damnedDemetrius

2581
02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:09.170
were they that murderedour emperor's brother.

2582
02:38:09.170 --> 02:38:13.030
And they it were thatravished our sister.

2583
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:16.770
For their fell faults ourbrothers were beheaded,

2584
02:38:16.770 --> 02:38:21.330
our father's tears despised,and basely cozened

2585
02:38:21.330 --> 02:38:23.800
of that true hand thatfought Rome's quarrel out

2586
02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:26.570
and sent her enemies untothe grave.

2587
02:38:26.570 --> 02:38:31.570
Lastly, myself unkindlybanished,

2588
02:38:31.570 --> 02:38:35.900
the gates shut on me, andturned weeping out

2589
02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:38.200
to beg relief among Rome'senemies,

2590
02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:40.930
who drowned their enmityin my true tears

2591
02:38:40.930 --> 02:38:45.270
and oped their arms toembrace me as a friend.

2592
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:47.970
I am the turned forth, beit known to you,

2593
02:38:47.970 --> 02:38:51.100
that have preserved herwelfare in my blood

2594
02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:53.670
and from her bosom tookthe enemy's point,

2595
02:38:53.670 --> 02:38:56.830
sheathing the steel in myadventurous body.

2596
02:38:56.830 --> 02:39:00.170
Alas; you know I am novaunter, I.

2597
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:03.730
My scars can witness, dumbalthough they are,

2598
02:39:03.730 --> 02:39:07.130
that my report is just andfull of truth.

2599
02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:10.070
But, soft; methinks I dodigress too much,

2600
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:12.400
citing my worthlesspraise.

2601
02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:14.770
O, pardon me.

2602
02:39:14.770 --> 02:39:19.630
For when no friends areby, men praise themselves.

2603
02:39:19.630 --> 02:39:23.430
Now is my turn to speak.

2604
02:39:23.430 --> 02:39:26.100
Behold the child.

2605
02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:28.630
Of this was Tamoradelivered,

2606
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:30.970
the issue of anirreligious Moor,

2607
02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:33.870
chief architect andplotter of these woes.

2608
02:39:33.870 --> 02:39:36.730
The villain is alive inTitus' house,

2609
02:39:36.730 --> 02:39:42.730
and as he is, to witnessthis is true.

2610
02:39:42.730 --> 02:39:47.400
Now judge what cause hadTitus to revenge

2611
02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:51.130
these wrongs unspeakable,past patience,

2612
02:39:51.130 --> 02:39:54.900
or more than any livingman could bear.

2613
02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:57.570
Now have you heard thetruth.

2614
02:39:57.570 --> 02:39:59.330
What say you, Romans?

2615
02:39:59.330 --> 02:40:02.500
Have we done aught amiss,show us wherein,

2616
02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:04.830
and, from the place whereyou behold us pleading,

2617
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:06.800
the poor remainder ofAndronici

2618
02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:10.270
will, hand in hand, allheadlong hurl ourselves

2619
02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:13.000
and on the ragged stonesbeat forth our souls

2620
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.500
and make a mutual closureof our house.

2621
02:40:17.500 --> 02:40:19.700
Speak, Romans, speak.

2622
02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:23.730
And if you say we shall,lo, hand in hand,

2623
02:40:23.730 --> 02:40:26.400
Lucius and I will fall.

2624
02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:31.130
Come, Marcus, come, thoureverend man of Rome,

2625
02:40:31.130 --> 02:40:34.900
and bring our emperorgently in thy hand,

2626
02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:36.930
Lucius our emperor;

2627
02:40:36.930 --> 02:40:40.700
for well I know the commonvoice do cry it shall be so.

2628
02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:47.500
Lucius, all hail, Rome'sroyal emperor!

2629
02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:49.570
Go to old Titus' sorrowfulhouse

2630
02:40:49.570 --> 02:40:51.700
and hither hale thatmisbelieving Moor

2631
02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:53.730
to be adjudged somedireful slaughtering death

2632
02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:57.530
as punishment for his mostwicked life.

2633
02:40:57.530 --> 02:41:02.970
Lucius, all hail, Rome'sgracious governor!

2634
02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:10.730
Thanks, gentle Romans.

2635
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:13.400
May I govern so to healRome's harms

2636
02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.370
and wipe away her woe.

2637
02:41:15.370 --> 02:41:18.970
But gentle people, give meaim awhile,

2638
02:41:18.970 --> 02:41:21.700
for nature puts me to aheavy task.

2639
02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:26.270
Stand all aloof, but,uncle, draw you near

2640
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:28.870
to shed obsequious tearsupon this trunk.

2641
02:41:34.170 --> 02:41:38.570
O, take this warm kiss onthy pale cold lips,

2642
02:41:38.570 --> 02:41:42.930
these sorrowful drops uponthy blood-stained face

2643
02:41:42.930 --> 02:41:46.270
the last true duties ofthy noble son.

2644
02:41:48.970 --> 02:41:53.200
Tear for tear and lovingkiss for kiss

2645
02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:56.770
thy brother Marcus tenderson thy lips.

2646
02:41:58.530 --> 02:42:00.830
O, were the sum of thesethat I should pay

2647
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:05.900
countless and infinite,yet would I pay them.

2648
02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:08.430
Come hither, boy.

2649
02:42:08.430 --> 02:42:16.830
Come, come, and learn ofus to melt in showers.

2650
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:19.470
Thy grandsire loved theewell.

2651
02:42:19.470 --> 02:42:22.930
Many a time he danced theeon his knee,

2652
02:42:22.930 --> 02:42:26.630
sung thee asleep, hisloving breast thy pillow.

2653
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:29.270
Many a story hath he toldto thee

2654
02:42:29.270 --> 02:42:32.030
and bid thee bear hispretty tales in mind

2655
02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:34.400
and talk of them when hewas dead and gone.

2656
02:42:37.070 --> 02:42:39.630
How many thousand timeshave these poor lips,

2657
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:43.300
when they were living,warmed themselves on thine.

2658
02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:46.530
O, now, sweet boy, givethem their latest kiss.

2659
02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:50.330
Bid him farewell; commithim to the grave.

2660
02:42:50.330 --> 02:42:54.370
Do them that kindness andtake leave of them.

2661
02:42:54.370 --> 02:42:57.600
Grandsire, Grandsire, evenwith all my heart,

2662
02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:00.570
were I were dead so youdid live again.

2663
02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:03.900
O Lord, I cannot speak tohim for weeping.

2664
02:43:03.900 --> 02:43:06.070
My tears will choke me, ifI ope my mouth.

2665
02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:09.970
You sad Andronici, havedone with woes.

2666
02:43:09.970 --> 02:43:12.370
Give sentence on theexecrable wretch

2667
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:15.070
who hath been breeder ofthese dire events.

2668
02:43:32.130 --> 02:43:36.500
Set him breast-deep inearth and famish him.

2669
02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:40.800
There let him stand andrave and cry for food.

2670
02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:42.430
If any one relieves orpities him,

2671
02:43:42.430 --> 02:43:43.970
for the offence he dies.

2672
02:43:43.970 --> 02:43:45.600
This is our doom.

2673
02:43:48.470 --> 02:43:53.700
Ah, why should wrath bemute and fury dumb?

2674
02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:56.930
I am no baby, I, that withbase prayers

2675
02:43:56.930 --> 02:43:59.500
I should repent the evilsI have done.

2676
02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:02.330
Ten thousand worse thanever yet I did

2677
02:44:02.330 --> 02:44:05.170
would I perform, if Imight have my will.

2678
02:44:05.170 --> 02:44:09.130
If one good deed in all mylife I did,

2679
02:44:09.130 --> 02:44:12.230
I do repent it from myvery soul.

2680
02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:24.430
Some loving friends conveythe emperor hence

2681
02:44:24.430 --> 02:44:27.330
and give him burial in hisfather's grave.

2682
02:44:27.330 --> 02:44:30.930
My father and Laviniashall forthwith be closed

2683
02:44:30.930 --> 02:44:33.770
in our household'smonument.

2684
02:44:33.770 --> 02:44:37.700
As for that ravenoustiger, Tamora

2685
02:44:37.700 --> 02:44:44.570
no funeral rite nor man inmourning weed.

2686
02:44:44.570 --> 02:44:46.870
No mournful bell shallring her burial,

2687
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:52.000
but throw her forth tobeasts and birds to prey.

2688
02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:56.470
Her life was beastly anddevoid of pity,

2689
02:44:56.470 --> 02:45:04.270
and being dead, let birdson her take pity.

2690
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:51.230
