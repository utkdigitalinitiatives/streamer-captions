00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000


2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.570
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.330
thy shoulders, shall within this hour be off;

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.270
thy mistress enforced;

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.300
thy garments cut to pieces before thy face:

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.970
and all this done, spurn her home to her father;

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.630
who may haply be a little angry

8
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.970
for my so rough usage;

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.000
but my mother, having power of his testiness,

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.130
shall turn all into my commendations.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.570
Out, sword, and to a sore purpose!

12
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.000
Fortune, put them into my hands!

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.530
You are not well: remain here in the cell;

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.470
We'll come to you after hunting.

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.330
Brother, stay here

16
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.670
Are we not brothers?

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.500
So man and man should be;

18
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.730
But clay and clay differs in dignity,

19
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.770
Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.700
Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

21
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.700
So sick I am not, yet I am not well;

22
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070
But not so citizen a wanton as

23
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.770
To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.630
Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.170
Is breach of all.

26
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170
I am ill, but your being by me

27
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.430
Cannot amend me; society is no comfort

28
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.830
To one not sociable: I am not very sick,

29
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.470
Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.870
I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,

31
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.800
Stealing so poorly.

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.730
Brother, farewell.

33
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.170
I wish ye sport.

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.930
You health. So please you, sir.

35
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.830
These are kind creatures.

36
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.770
Gods, what lies I have heard!

37
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.930
Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:

38
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.100
Experience, O, thou disprovest report!

39
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.100
The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish

40
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.000
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.

41
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.570
I am sick still; heart-sick.

42
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.670
Pisanio, I'll now taste of thy drug.

43
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.700
I cannot find those runagates;

44
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.370
That villian hath mocked me. I am faint!

45
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.000
What slave art thou?

46
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Thou art a robber,

47
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.300
A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.

48
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.000
To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I

49
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.800
An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?

50
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.070
Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not

51
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.370
My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,

52
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.030
Why I should yield to thee?

53
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.200
Thou villain base,

54
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.870
Know'st me not by my clothes?

55
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.930
Thou art some fool;

56
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.430
I am loath to beat thee.

57
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.630
Thou injurious thief,

58
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.930
Hear but my name, and tremble.

59
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.200
What's thy name?

60
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.470
Cloten, thou villain.

61
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.830
Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,

62
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.070
I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad,

63
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.270
or Adder, Spider,

64
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.430
'Twould move me sooner.

65
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.730
To thy further fear,

66
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.670
Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know

67
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.200
I am son to the queen.

68
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.070
I am sorry for 't; not seeming

69
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.330
So worthy as thy birth.

70
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.470
Art not afeard?

71
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.730
Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:

72
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.200
At fools I laugh, not fear them.

73
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.830
Die the death:

74
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.530
Yield, rustic mountaineer.

75
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.230
What hast thou done?

76
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.070
I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,

77
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.130
Son to the queen, after his own report;

78
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.670
Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore

79
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.170
With his own single hand he'ld take us in

80
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.000
Displace our heads where--

81
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.600
thank the gods!--they grow,

82
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.370
And set them on Lud's-town.

83
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.370
We are all undone.

84
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.130
Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,

85
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.330
But that he swore to take, our lives?

86
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.230
The law protects not us: then why should we be tender

87
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.570
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,

88
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.770
Play judge and executioner all himself,

89
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.600
For we do fear the law?

90
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.130
What company discover you abroad?

91
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.070
No single soul

92
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.270
Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason

93
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.200
He must have some attendants.

94
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.600
then on good ground we fear,

95
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.630
If we do fear this body hath a tail

96
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.970
More perilous than the head.

97
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.830
Let ordinance

98
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.200
Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,

99
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.170
My brother hath done well.

100
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.170
I had no mind

101
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.130
To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness

102
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.270
Did make my way long forth.

103
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.030
With his own sword,

104
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.170
Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en

105
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.970
His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek

106
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.230
And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:

107
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.570
That's all I reck.

108
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.470
I fear 'twill be revenged:

109
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.730
Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't!

110
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.900
though valour becomes thee well enough.

111
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.070
Would I had done't

112
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.200
So the revenge alone pursued me!

113
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.000
Well, 'tis done:

114
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.470
We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger

115
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.730
Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our cell;

116
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.100
Poor sick Fidele!

117
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.600
I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour

118
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.230
I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,

119
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.900
And praise myself for charity.

120
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.800
O thou goddess,

121
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.230
Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st

122
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.000
In these two princely boys!

123
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.700
'Tis wonder

124
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.430
That an invisible instinct should frame them

125
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.430
To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,

126
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.600
Civility not seen from other,

127
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.900
valour that wildly grows in them, but yields a crop

128
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.270
As if it had been sow'd.

129
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.900
Where's my brother?

130
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.700
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,

131
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.870
In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage

132
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.430
For his return.

133
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.570
(Solemn music plays)

134
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.300
My ingenious instrument!

135
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.870
Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion

136
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.870
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

137
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.870
Is he at home?

138
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.700
He went hence even now.

139
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.330
What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother

140
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
it did not speak before.

141
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:39.170
All solemn things should answer solemn accidents.

142
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.930
The matter?

143
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.770
The bird is dead

144
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.130
That we have made so much on.

145
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:46.770
I had rather have skipp'd

146
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.400
from sixteen years of age to sixty,

147
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.430
To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,

148
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.930
than have seen this.

149
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.070
O melancholy!

150
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.800
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom?

151
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.030
find the ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare

152
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.600
Might easiliest harbour in?

153
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.930
How found you him?

154
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.730
Stark, as you see:

155
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.230
Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,

156
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.000
Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at;

157
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.930
his right cheek

158
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.130
Reposing on a cushion.

159
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.700
Where?

160
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.400
O' the floor;

161
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.870
His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept,

162
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.200
and put my clouted brogues from off my feet,

163
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.800
whose rudeness answer'd my steps too loud.

164
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.130
Why, he but sleeps:

165
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.900
If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;

166
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:58.170
♪ Fear no more the heat o' the sun,

167
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:05.800
Nor the furious winter's rages;

168
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.030
Thou thy worldly task hast done,

169
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:23.530
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:

170
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:30.470
Golden lads and girls all must,

171
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:42.670
As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

172
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:48.800
Fear no more the frown o' the great;

173
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:56.230
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;

174
00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:03.070
Care no more to clothe and eat;

175
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:13.530
To thee the reed is as the oak:

176
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:20.670
The sceptre, learning, physic, must

177
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:33.130
All follow this, and come to dust.

178
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:38.730
Fear no more the lightning flash,

179
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.770
Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;

180
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.700
Fear not slander, censure rash;

181
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.730
Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:

182
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:56.730

Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten

Is quite forgotten. He was a queen's son, boys;

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.270
Which the brain makes of fumes:

Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.970

All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,

237
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.930
And mine to boot, be darted on thee!

Thou, conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,

Hast here cut off my lord.

241
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.700
Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio

Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.200
From this most bravest vessel of the world

244
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:45.670
Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,

245
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:51.230
Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!

246
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.270
where's that?

247
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.900
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,

248
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:11.430
And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?

249
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.170
'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them

250
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.400
Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!

251
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.430
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious

252
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.000
And cordial to me, have I not found it

253
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.630
Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:

254
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.470
This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's:

255
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:55.530
O! Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,

256
00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:01.070
O! Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,

257
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.330
That we the horrider may seem to those

258
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:22.970
Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!

259
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.530
Now, sir, What have you dream'd of late

260
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.330
of this war's purpose?

261
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.570
Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--

262
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:40.430
I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:

263
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.130
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd

264
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.770
From the spongy south to this part of the west,

265
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:54.870
There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--

266
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:59.130
Unless my sins abuse my divination--

267
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:02.430
Success to the Roman host.

268
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.470
Dream often so,

269
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.900
And never false.

270
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.570
Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.

271
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.770
A fever with the absence of her son,

272
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.230
A madness, of which her life's in danger.

273
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:42.070
Heavens! How deeply you at once do touch me!

274
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:46.030
Imogen, The great part of my comfort, gone;

275
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.670
my queen upon a desperate bed,

276
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.700
and in a time when fearful wars point at me;

277
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.670
her son gone,

278
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:59.000
So needful for this present: it strikes me, past

279
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.930
The hope of comfort.

280
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.330
So please your majesty,

281
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.500
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,

282
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.030
Are landed on your coast, with a supply

283
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.730
Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.

284
00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.970
Now for the counsel of my son and queen!

285
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.500
I am amazed with matter.

286
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.330
Good my liege,

287
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.330
Your preparation can affront no less

288
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.430
Than what you hear of: come more, for more

289
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.400
you're ready:

290
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.000
The want is but to put those powers in motion

291
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.800
That long to move.

292
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.300
I thank you. Let's withdraw;

293
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.230
I heard no letter from my master since

294
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.930
I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:

295
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.800
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise

296
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.970
To yield me often tidings:

297
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:44.970
neither know I

298
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:50.070
What is betid to Cloten; but remain

299
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:56.970
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.

300
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:06.930
Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true

301
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.470
These present wars shall find I love my country,

302
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.770
Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them

303
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:23.300
All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:

304
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.700
Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd

305
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:36.600
Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd

306
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.170
Thou shouldst be colour'd thus.

307
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.230
You married ones,

308
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.700
If each of you should take this course, how many

309
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.130
Must murder wives much better than themselves

310
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:55.030
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!

311
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.770
Every good servant does not all commands:

312
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.500
No bond but to do just ones.

313
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.570
Gods! if you should have ta'en vengeance

314
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.930
on my faults, I never

315
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.270
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved

316
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.630
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck

317
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.330
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,

318
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:29.200
You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,

319
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.800
To have them fall no more: you some permit

320
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.170
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,

321
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.730
And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.

322
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.800
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,

323
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.330
And make me blest to obey!

324
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.430
I am brought hither

325
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.030
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight

326
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.030
Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough

327
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:06.130
That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!

328
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.570
I'll give no wound to thee.

329
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.130
Let's see the boy's face.

330
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.170
He's alive, my lord.

331
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.300
He'll then instruct us of this body.

332
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.330
Young one, inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems

333
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.530
They crave to be demanded. Who is this

334
00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.470
Thou makest thy bloody pillow?

335
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.370
How came it? Who is it?

336
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:31.770
What art thou?

337
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.470
I am nothing: or if not,

338
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.300
Nothing to be were better.

339
00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.100
I may wander

340
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.030
From east to occident,

341
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:51.530
Try many, all good, serve truly,

342
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.330
never find such another master.

343
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:56.370
'Lack, good youth!

344
00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.730
Thou movest no less with thy complaining than

345
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.300
Thy master in bleeding:

346
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.430
Thy name?

347
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.970
Fidele, sir.

348
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.230
Thou dost approve thyself the very same:

349
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:11.130
Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.

350
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:19.400
Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say

351
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.830
Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,

352
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.330
No less beloved.

353
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.430
I'll follow, sir.

354
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.670
So please you entertain me.

355
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.370
Ay, good youth!

356
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.630
And rather father thee than master thee.

357
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.100
