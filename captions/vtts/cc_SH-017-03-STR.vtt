00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.670


2
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.700
Flaminius, honest Flaminius;

3
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.200
you are very respectively welcome, sir.

4
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.530
And how does that honorable, complete,

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.430
free-hearted gentleman of Athens,

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.130
thy very bountiful good lord and master?

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.800
His health is well sir.

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.830
I am right glad that his health is well, sir.

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.000
And what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.630
'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir;

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.070
Which, in my lord's behalf,

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.270
I come to entreat Your Honor to supply;

13
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.230
who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents,

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.970
hath sent to Your Lordship to furnish him,

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.330
nothing doubting your present assistance therein.

16
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.600
La, la!

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000
La, la, la!

18
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.570
"Nothing doubting," says he?

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.330
Alas, good lord!

20
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.070
A noble gentleman 'tis,

21
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.730
if he would not keep so good a house.

22
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.900
Many a time and often I have dined with him,

23
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.700
and told him on it, and come again to supper to him,

24
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.530
of purpose to have him spend less,

25
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.270
and yet he would embrace no counsel,

26
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.170
take no warning by my coming.

27
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.700
Every man has his fault, and honesty is his.

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.830
I had told him on it,

29
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.900
but I could ne'er get him from it.

30
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.270
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise.

31
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730
Your Lordship speaks your pleasure.

32
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.630
I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit

33
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.870
give thee thy due

34
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.800
and one that knows what belongs to reason;

35
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well.

36
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.970
Good parts in thee.

37
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.230
Draw nearer, honest Flaminius.

38
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.300
Thy lord's a bountiful gentleman.

39
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.770
But thou art wise;

40
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.900
and thou knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.230
that this is no time to lend money,

42
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.970
especially upon bare friendship, without security.

43
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.770
Here's three solidares for thee.

44
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.400
Good boy, wink at me, and say thou sawest me not.

45
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.030
Fare thee well.

46
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.270
Is it possible the world should so much differ,

47
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.870
and we alive that lived?

48
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.870
Fly, damned baseness, to him that worships thee!

49
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.100
Ha!

50
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.630
Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master.

51
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.600
May these add to the number that may scald thee!

52
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.670
Let molten coin be thy damnation,

53
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.570
thou disease of a friend, and not himself!

54
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.070
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,

55
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.000
it turns in less than two nights?

56
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.170
Oh, you gods, I feel master's passion!

57
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.230
This slave, unto his honor, has my lord's meat in him.

58
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.130
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,

59
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.970
when he is turned to poison?

60
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030
Oh, may diseases only work upon it!

61
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.930
And when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature

62
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.230
which my lord paid for

63
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.030
be of any power to expel sickness,

64
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.730
but prolong his hour!

65
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.800
Servilius!

66
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.900
You are kindly met, sir.

67
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.370
Commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord,

68
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.530
my very exquisite friend.

69
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.400
May it please Your Honor, my lord hath sent

70
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.170
Ha! What has he sent?

71
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.900
I am so much endeared to that lord;

72
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.270
he's ever sending.

73
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.770
How shall I thank him, thinkest thou?

74
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.030
And what has he sent now?

75
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.970
Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;

76
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.200
requesting Your Lordship to supply his instant use

77
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.330
with so many talents.

78
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.270
I know His Lordship is but merry with me;

79
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.100
he cannot want 5,500 talents.

80
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.000
But in the meantime, he wants less, my lord.

81
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.530
If his occasion were not virtuous,

82
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.230
I should not urge it half so faithfully.

83
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.900
Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?

84
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.330
Upon my soul, 'tis true, sir.

85
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.900
What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself

86
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.730
against such a good time,

87
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.230
when I might have shown myself honorable.

88
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.170
How unluckily it happened, that I should purchase

89
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.830
the day before for a little part

90
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.170
and undo a great deal of honor.

91
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.700
Servilius, now, before the gods, I am not able to do

92
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.930
the more beast, I say.

93
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.000
I was sending to use Lord Timon myself,

94
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.970
But I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done it now.

95
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.900
Commend me bountifully to His good Lordship;

96
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.800
and I hope His Honor will conceive the fairest of me,

97
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.430
because I have no power to be kind.

98
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.130
And tell him this from me,

99
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.200
I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say,

100
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.800
that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman.

101
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.030
Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far

102
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.700
as to use mine own words to him?

103
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.900
Yes, sir, I shall.

104
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.670
I'll look you out a good turn,

105
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.730
Servilius.

106
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.130
Must he needs trouble me in it, hmm,

107
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.470
above all others?

108
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.370
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;

109
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.500
and now Ventidius is wealthy too,

110
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.370
whom he redeemed from prison.

111
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.270
all these owe their estates unto him.

112
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.630
My lord, they've all been touched and found base metal,

113
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.170
for they have all denied him.

114
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.700
How!

115
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.470
Have they denied him?

116
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.370
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?

117
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.470
And does he send to me?

118
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:53.570
Three?

119
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.930
Hum!

120
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.100
It shows but little love or judgment in him.

121
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.070
Must I be his last refuge?

122
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.800
His friends, like physicians, thrice give him over.

123
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.700
Must I take the cure upon me?

124
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.270
Has much disgraced me in it;

125
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.970
I'm angry at him, that might have known my place.

126
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.530
I see no sense for it,

127
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.170
but his occasions might have wooed me first;

128
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.000
for, in my conscience, I was the first man

129
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.470
that e'er received gift from him.

130
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.930
And does he think so backwardly of me now

131
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.870
that I'll requite it last?

132
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.700
No.

133
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.400
So it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest,

134
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.200
and I amongst the lords be thought a fool.

135
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.470
I'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum

136
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.870
had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;

137
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.130
I'd such a courage to do him good.

138
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:51.400
But now return, and with their faint reply this answer join:

139
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.530
who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.

140
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.870
One of Lord Timon's men.

141
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.030
Flaminius!

142
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.300
Sir, a word.

143
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.200
Pray, is my lord ready to come forth?

144
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.300
No, indeed, he is not.

145
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.430
We attend His Lordship;

146
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.430
pray, signify so much.

147
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.430
I need not tell him that!

148
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.430
He knows you are too diligent.

149
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.470
Is not that his steward muffled so?

150
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.600
He goes away in a cloud.

151
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
Call him.

152
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.770
Ho! Do you hear, sir?

153
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.000
By your leave, sir,

154
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.700
What do ye ask of me, my friend?

155
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.630
We wait for certain money here, sir.

156
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.630
Ay, if money were as certain as your waiting,

157
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:20.100
'twere sure enough.

158
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.230
Why then preferred you not your sums and bills,

159
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.030
when your false masters eat of my lord's meat?

160
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.770
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts

161
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.470
and take down the interest into their gluttonous maws.

162
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.430
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up.

163
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.570
Let me pass quietly.

164
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.130
Believe it, my lord and I have made an end;

165
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.230
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.

166
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.400
Ay, but this answer will not serve.

167
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.270
If 'twill not serve, 'tis not so base as you;

168
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.070
For you serve knaves.

169
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.900
How, what does his cashiered worship mutter?

170
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.870
No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge enough.

171
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.100
Here comes Servilius;

172
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.730
now we shall know some answer.

173
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.470
If I might beseech you, gentlemen,

174
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.600
to repair some other hour,

175
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.170
I should derive much from it;

176
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.700
for take it of my soul,

177
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.800
my lord leans wondrously to discontent.

178
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.730
His comfortable temper has forsook him;

179
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.600
he's much out of health and keeps his chamber.

180
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.630
Many who keep their chambers are not sick.

181
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.970
And if it be so far beyond his health,

182
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.800
methinks he should the sooner pay his debts

183
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.670
and make a clear way to the gods.

184
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.000
We cannot take this for answer, sir.

185
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.600
Aah!

186
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.970
Are my doors opposed against my passage?

187
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.670
Have I been ever free,

188
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.200
and must my house now be my retentive enemy, my jail?

189
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.800
The place which I have feasted, does it now, like all mankind,

190
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.870
show me an iron heart?

191
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.930
My lord, here is my bill.

192
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.930
Here's mine.

193
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:33.930
And mine, my lord.

194
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.930
Knock me down with 'em.

195
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.930
Cleave me to the girdle.

196
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.930
Alas, my lord

197
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.930
Cut my heart in sums.

198
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:38.930
Mine, fifty talents.

199
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.930
Tell out my blood!

200
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:40.930
Five thousand crowns, my lord.

201
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.930
Five thousand drops pays that.

202
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:42.930
What's yours?

203
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.400
Alas, my lord

204
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.370
The gods fall upon you!

205
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.670
They have even put my breath from me, the slaves.

206
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.670
Creditors?

207
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.670
Devils!

208
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.770
My dear lord

209
00:08:58.770 --> 00:08:59.830
What if it should be so?

210
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.200
My lord

211
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.470
I'll have it so.

212
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.630
My steward!

213
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.130
Here, my lord.

214
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.470
So fitly?

215
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.400
Go, bid all my friends again,

216
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:20.130
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius.

217
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.500
All.

218
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.300
I'll once more feast the rascals.

219
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.400
O my lord, you only speak from your distracted soul;

220
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.100
there is not so much left to furnish out a moderate table.

221
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.700
Be it not in thy care.

222
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.230
Go, I charge thee, invite them all.

223
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.130
Let in the tide of knaves once more;

224
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.000
my cook and I'll provide.

225
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:04.230
My lord, you have my voice to it;

226
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.800
the fault's Bloody;

227
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.970
'tis necessary he should die.

228
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.470
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

229
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:11.470
Most true.

230
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.270
The law shall bruise him.

231
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.800
Honor, health, and compassion to the senate.

232
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.600
Now, Captain?

233
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.570
I am an humble suitor to your virtues;

234
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.600
for pity is the virtue of the law,

235
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.330
and none but tyrants use it cruelly.

236
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:37.430
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy

237
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.170
upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,

238
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.470
hath stepped into the law,

239
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.000
which is past depth to those that, without heed,

240
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.230
do plunge into it.

241
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.330
He is a man, setting his fate aside, of comely virtues.

242
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.770
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice

243
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.270
an honor in him which buys out his fault

244
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.630
but with a noble fury and fair spirit,

245
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.000
seeing his reputation touched to death,

246
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.100
he did oppose his foe.

247
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.230
And with such sober and unnoted passion,

248
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.400
he did behoove his anger,

249
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.800
ere 'twas spent,

250
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.100
as if he had but proved an argument.

251
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.700
You undergo too strict a paradox,

252
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.870
striving to make an ugly deed look fair.

253
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.600
Your words have took such pains

254
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.070
as if they labored to bring manslaughter into form

255
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.900
and set quarrelling upon the head of valor;

256
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.170
which indeed is valor misbegot and came into the world

257
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.130
when sects and factions were newly born.

258
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.030
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer

259
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.830
the worst that man can breathe

260
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.330
and make his wrongs his outsides,

261
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.070
to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,

262
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.770
and ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,

263
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:42.100
to bring it into danger.

264
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.000
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,

265
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.130
what folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

266
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.230
My lord

267
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.330
You cannot make gross sins look clear.

268
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.370
My lord!

269
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.570
To revenge is no valor, but to bear.

270
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:55.630
My lords, then, under favor,

271
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.300
pardon me, if I speak like a captain.

272
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.570
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,

273
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.530
and not endure all threats?

274
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.730
Sleep upon it, and let the foes quietly cut their throats,

275
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.670
without repugnancy?

276
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.100
If there be such valor in the bearing,

277
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.970
what make we abroad?

278
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.770
Why then, women are more valiant that stay at home,

279
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.700
if bearing carry it,

280
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.830
and the ass more captain than the lion,

281
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.130
the fellow loaden with irons wiser than the judge,

282
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:25.430
if wisdom be in suffering.

283
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:31.330
O my lords, as you are great, be pitifully good.

284
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.730
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?

285
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.300
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;

286
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.170
but, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.

287
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.430
To be in anger is impiety;

288
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.930
but who is man that is not angry?

289
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.600
Weigh but the crime with this.

290
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.700
You breathe in vain.

291
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.470
In vain!

292
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.730
His service done at Lacedaemon and Byzantium

293
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.400
were a sufficient briber for his life.

294
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.500
What's that?

295
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:55.770
I say, my lords, he has done fair service,

296
00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.670
and slain in fight many of your enemies.

297
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.170
How full of valor did he bear himself in the last conflict,

298
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:01.930
and made plenteous wounds!

299
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:03.630
He has made too much plenty with 'em;

300
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.430
he's a sworn rioter.

301
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.070
He has a sin that often drowns him

302
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.570
and takes his valor prisoner.

303
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:09.770
If there were no foes,

304
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.370
that were enough to overcome him.

305
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.530
In the beastly fury, he has been known to commit outrages

306
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.500
and cherish factions.

307
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.900
It is inferred to us

308
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.970
that his days are foul and his drink dangerous.

309
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.030
He dies.

310
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.100
Hard fate!

311
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.170
He might have died in war.

312
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.900
My lords, if not for any parts in him

313
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.630
though his right arm might purchase his own time

314
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.900
and be in debt to none

315
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.530
yet more to move you,

316
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.530
take my deserts to his, and join 'em both.

317
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.030
And, for I know your reverend ages love security,

318
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.900
I'll pawn my victories, all my honors to you,

319
00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.730
upon his good returns.

320
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.800
If, by this crime, he owes the law his life,

321
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.430
why, let the war receive it in valiant gore

322
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.900
for law is strict, and war is nothing more.

323
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.930
We are for law.

324
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.100
He dies.

325
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.130
Urge it no more, on height of our displeasure.

326
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.500
Friend or brother,

327
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.770
he forfeits his own blood that spills another.

328
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.300
Must it be so?

329
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.670
It must not be.

330
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.130
My lords, I do beseech you, know me.

331
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.130
How!

332
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.130
Call me to your remembrances.

333
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.270
What!

334
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.630
I cannot think but that your age has forgot me;

335
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.100
it could not else be, I should prove so base, to sue,

336
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.900
and be denied such common grace.

337
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.270
My wounds ache at you.

338
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.070
Do you dare our anger?

339
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.830
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;

340
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.770
we banish thee forever.

341
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.430
Banish me!

342
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:31.470
Banish your dotage;

343
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.630
banish usury, that makes the senate ugly.

344
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.370
If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,

345
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.030
attend our weightier judgment.

346
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.430
And, not to swell our spirit, he shall be executed presently.

347
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.970
Now the gods keep you old enough;

348
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.300
that you may live only in bone, that none may look on you!

349
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.670
I'm worse than mad.

350
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.670
I have kept back their foes,

351
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.900
while they have told their money

352
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.470
and let out their coin upon large interest,

353
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.100
I myself rich only in large hurts.

354
00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.400
All those for this?

355
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.570
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate

356
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.770
pours into captains' wounds?

357
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.400
Banishment.

358
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.870
It comes not ill;

359
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.170
I hate not to be banished;

360
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.930
it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury

361
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.500
that I may strike at Athens.

362
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.970
I'll cheer up my discontented troops

363
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.300
and lay for hearts.

364
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:36.970
'Tis honor with most lands to be at odds;

365
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.900
soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

366
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.070
The good time of day to you, sir.

367
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.270
I also wish it to you.

368
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.270
I think this honorable lord did but try us this other day.

369
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.300
Upon that were my thoughts tiring,

370
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.800
when we encountered.

371
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.200
I hope it is not so low with him

372
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:16.000
as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.

373
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.100
It should not be,

374
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.230
by the persuasion of his new feasting.

375
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:23.100
I should think so.

376
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.100
He hath sent me an earnest inviting,

377
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.570
which many my near occasions did urge me to put off;

378
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.200
but he hath conjured me beyond them,

379
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.970
and I must needs appear.

380
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.930
In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business,

381
00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.130
but he would not hear my excuse.

382
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.200
I am sorry, when he sent to borrow of me,

383
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.500
that my provision was out.

384
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.830
I am sick of that grief too,

385
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.970
as I understand how all things go.

386
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.930
Every man here's so.

387
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.530
What would he have borrowed of you?

388
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.600
A thousand pieces.

389
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.400
He sent to me, sir

390
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.600
Here he comes.

391
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.930
With all my heart, gentlemen both.

392
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.300
How fare you?

393
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.270
Ever at the best, hearing well of Your Lordship.

394
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:23.870
The swallow follows not summer

395
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.400
more willing than we, Your Lordship.

396
00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.600
Nor more willingly leaves winter;

397
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.030
such summer-birds are men.

398
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.100
Our dinner will not recompense this long stay.

399
00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:44.800
Feast your ears with the music awhile,

400
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.070
if they will fare so harshly of the trumpet's sound;

401
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.600
we will to it presently.

402
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.000
I hope it remains not unkindly with Your Lordship

403
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.830
that I returned you an empty messenger.

404
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.500
O, sir, let it not trouble you.

405
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.570
My noble lord

406
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.400
My good friend, what cheer?

407
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.270
My most honorable lord, I am even sick of shame that,

408
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.270
when this other day Your Lordship sent to me,

409
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.430
I was so unfortunate a beggar.

410
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:31.870
Think not on it.

411
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.500
If you had sent but two hours before

412
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.700
Let it not cumber your better remembrance.

413
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.600
Come, bring in all together.

414
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.930
All covered dishes.

415
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.530
Royal cheer, I warrant you.

416
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.800
I doubt not that,

417
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.200
if money and the season can yield it.

418
00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200
How do you?

419
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.300
What's the news?

420
00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.430
Alcibiades is banished.

421
00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.570
Hear you of it?

422
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.330
Alcibiades banished.

423
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.900
'Tis so; be sure of it.

424
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.900
How, how?

425
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.600
I pray you, upon what?

426
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.330
My worthy friends, will you draw near?

427
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.600
I'll tell you more anon.

428
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.330
Here's a noble feast toward.

429
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.570
This is the old man still.

430
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.670
Will it do? Will it do?

431
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.670
It does.

432
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.270
But time will, and so

433
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.670
I do conceive.

434
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.270
Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would

435
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.270
to the lip of his mistress.

436
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.300
Your diet shall be in all places alike.

437
00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.170
Make not a city feast of it, to let the meat cool

438
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:37.970
ere we can agree upon the first place.

439
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:39.800
Sit, sit.

440
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:45.270
The gods require our thanks.

441
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.270
You great benefactors,

442
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:57.930
sprinkle our society with thankfulness.

443
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.470
For your own gifts, let yourselves be praised.

444
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:07.470
But reserve still to give, lest your deities be despised.

445
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.300
Lend to each man enough,

446
00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.170
that one need not lend to another;

447
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.230
for, were your godheads to borrow of men,

448
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.200
men would forsake the gods.

449
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.470
Let the meat be beloved

450
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.570
more than the man that gives it.

451
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.230
Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains.

452
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.300
if there sit twelve women at the table,

453
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.400
let a dozen of them be as they are.

454
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.330
The rest of your fees, you gods

455
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:38.500
the senators of Athens,

456
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.030
together with the common lag of people

457
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.500
what is amiss in them,

458
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.900
you gods, make suitable for destruction.

459
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.230
For these, my present friends, as they are nothing to me,

460
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.670
so in nothing bless them,

461
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.300
and to nothing are they welcome.

462
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.130
Uncover, dogs, and lap.

463
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.570
What does His Lordship mean?

464
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.430
I know not.

465
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.100
May you a better feast never behold,

466
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.100
you knot of mouth-friends.

467
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.330
Smoke and lukewarm water is your perfection.

468
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.730
This is Timon's last;

469
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.130
who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,

470
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.600
washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces

471
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:40.300
your reeking villainy.

472
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.570
Live loathed and long,

473
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.500
most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,

474
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:54.500
courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,

475
00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:01.330
you fools of fortune, trencher-friends,

476
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:06.830
cap and knee slaves, vapors, minute-jacks!

477
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:13.930
Of man and beast the infinite malady crust you quite o'er!

478
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.630
What, dost thou go?

479
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.170
All in motion soft!

480
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.200
Take thy physic first thou too

481
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.970
and thou

482
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:24.600
Stay, I'll lend thee money, borrow none.

483
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.930
Henceforth be no feast,

484
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.530
whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.

485
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:33.530
Burn, house!

486
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.630
Sink, Athens!

487
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.300
Henceforth hated be of Timon

488
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.200
man and all humanity!

489
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:47.530
Matrons, turn incontinent!

490
00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:50.330
Obedience, fail in children!

491
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.430
Slaves and fools,

492
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.400
pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,

493
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.630
and minister in their steads!

494
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.130
To general filths convert of the instant,

495
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:05.270
green virginity, do it in your parents' eyes!

496
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.200
Bankrupts, hold fast;

497
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.630
rather than render back, out with your knives,

498
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.670
and cut your trusters' throats!

499
00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.830
Bound servants, steal!

500
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.730
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,

501
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.830
and pill by law.

502
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.330
Maid, to thy master's bed;

503
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.100
thy mistress is of the brothel!

504
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.400
Son of sixteen, pluck the lined crutch

505
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.500
from thy old limping sire, with it, beat out his brains!

506
00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.070
Piety and fear, religion to the gods,

507
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:43.100
peace, justice, truth, domestic awe, night-rest,

508
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.300
neighborhood, instruction, manners,

509
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.870
mysteries, trades,

510
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.800
decline to your confounding contraries,

511
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.770
and let confusion live!

512
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.530
Plagues, incident to men,

513
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.730
your potent and infectious fevers heap on Athens,

514
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.770
ripe for stroke!

515
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:06.470
Thou cold sciatica, cripple our senators,

516
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.000
that their limbs may halt as lamely as their manners.

517
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.500
Lust and liberty creep into the minds and marrows of our youth,

518
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.600
that 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,

519
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.700
and drown themselves in riot!

520
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.400
Itches, blains, sow all the Athenian bosoms;

521
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.370
and their crop be general leprosy!

522
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.970
Breath infect breath, that their society,

523
00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.400
as their friendship, may be merely poisoned!

524
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.700
Nothing I'll bear from thee but nakedness,

525
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.370
thou detestable town!

526
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:49.770
Take thou that with multiplying bans!

527
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.030
The gods confound

528
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.100
hear me, you good gods all

529
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.600
the Athenians both within and out that wall!

530
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.130
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow

531
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:07.970
to the whole race of mankind, high and low!

532
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.500
Amen.

533
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:22.000
Hear you!

534
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:25.930
Master steward?

535
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:34.130
Where's our master?

536
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600
Are we undone?

537
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.600
Cast off? Nothing remaining?

538
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.530
Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?

539
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.630
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,

540
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.270
I am as poor as you.

541
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.830
Such a house broke?

542
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.500
So noble a master fallen?

543
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.300
All gone, and not one friend to take his fortune by the arm,

544
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.500
and go along with him?

545
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.700
As we do turn our back from our companion

546
00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.730
thrown into his grave,

547
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.930
so his familiars to his buried fortunes

548
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.100
slink all away,

549
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.500
leave their false vows in him,

550
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.070
like empty purses picked;

551
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.300
and his poor self, a dedicated beggar to the air,

552
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.400
with his disease of all-shunned poverty,

553
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.530
walks, like contempt, alone.

554
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:15.930
More of our fellows.

555
00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.700
All broken implements of a ruined house.

556
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:21.430
Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;

557
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.930
that see I by our faces;

558
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.900
we are fellows still, serving alike in sorrow.

559
00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.870
Leaked is our bark, and we, poor mates,

560
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.470
stand on the dying deck, hearing the surges threat.

561
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.470
We must all part into this sea of air.

562
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.400
Good fellows all, the latest of my wealth

563
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.200
I'll share amongst you.

564
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.070
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,

565
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.670
let's yet be fellows;

566
00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.430
let's shake our heads and say,

567
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.070
as 'twere a knell unto our master's fortune,

568
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.400
"We have seen better days."

569
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.770
Let each take some;

570
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.830
nay, put out all your hands.

571
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.000
Not one word more.

572
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.300
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.

573
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.970
Oh, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us.

574
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.070
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,

575
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.870
since riches point to misery and contempt?

576
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.430
Who would be so mocked with glory?

577
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:12.000
Or to live but in a dream of friendship?

578
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.900
To have his pomp and all what state compounds

579
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.330
but only painted, like his varnished friends?

580
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.830
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,

581
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.200
undone by goodness.

582
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.900
Strange, unusual blood, when man's worst sin is

583
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.000
he does too much good.

584
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.700
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?

585
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.530
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.

586
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:39.600
My dearest lord, blessed, to be most accursed,

587
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.330
rich, only to be wretched,

588
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:47.330
thy great fortunes are made thy chief afflictions.

589
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.770
Alas, kind lord.

590
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.030
He's flung in rage

591
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.900
from this ingrateful seat of monstrous friends,

592
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.570
nor has he with him to supply his life,

593
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.500
or that which can command it.

594
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.030
I'll follow and inquire him out.

595
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.400
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;

596
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.630
whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.
