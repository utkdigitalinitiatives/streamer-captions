00:00:00.431 --> 00:00:01.831
Voiceover: One second. Adjust the light.

00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:02.434
Veronica: Yes.

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:03.206
Voiceover: Is this the [switch]?

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:05.967
Veronica: I think it's
the other side over there.

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:07.689
Voiceover: Oh, it's on
this side. This one.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.661
Veronica: This one, oh, oops.

00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.657
Voicover: Can't be that one.

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:14.222
I shocked myself.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.312
Maybe this one?

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:17.472
Veronica: Yeah, I think so.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.130
Ryan: It's a program that sends Americans

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.438
all over the world for
about two years, sorry.

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:25.476
Voiceover: Sorry.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:28.199
Very interesting.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.478
Ryan: What do you see?

00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:30.214
Voiceover: Oh, just-

00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:31.128
Ryan: Is it a rat?

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:32.185
Voiceover: No, it's just a bug.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:33.554
Ryan: Oh, no, that's fine.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:36.095
I thought it was a rat
because it could happen.

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:37.944
And I was gonna like freak out.

00:00:37.944 --> 00:00:40.253
George: You know what's funny
about South Africa though it's

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:44.715
like you said, nothing goes
according to plan here.

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:46.112
(rain beating)

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.160
(George sighs)

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.307
Cameraman: Let's move.

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.921
(rain beating)

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:57.553
(thunder booms)

00:00:57.553 --> 00:00:59.681
George: Nothing goes
according to plan, ever.

00:00:59.681 --> 00:01:01.261
(Cameraman laughs)

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.201
(thunder booms)

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:03.496
Cameraman: Oh.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.805
Fran: You're not gonna be
able to do our interview

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:08.397
since the power's out.

00:01:08.397 --> 00:01:09.993
Cameraman: How are you gonna
cook if the power's out?

00:01:09.993 --> 00:01:11.737
Fran: Oh, shit!

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:15.278
(rain beating)

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.439
Fran: Ugh, I'll just prepare it,

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.343
and then hopefully it will stay on.

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:23.415
But then if it doesn't

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:24.716
it'll come on eventually.

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.818
(Veronica laughs)

00:01:29.508 --> 00:01:31.344
Veronica: Peace Corps is,

00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:36.551
I would say at the basic level Peace Corps

00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:41.281
sends Americans to other
countries to help with

00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:45.059
projects or teaching or just help

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:48.208
communities to improve
their way of living.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:52.600
(guitar music)

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.508
(horn honks)

00:01:56.202 --> 00:02:00.400
(guitar music)

00:02:01.797 --> 00:02:05.180
Uh, I joined Peace Corps because I wanted

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.852
to help people in some way.

00:02:06.852 --> 00:02:11.312
And I also wanted to get
experience interntaionally.

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:15.039
I was hoping to go to Uganda,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.012
my first choice in terms
of region was Africa,

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:21.876
but specifically I wanted to go to Uganda.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:23.587
I was still excited.

00:02:23.587 --> 00:02:25.484
I didn't know that much
about South Africa,

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:28.440
but I was still pretty excited.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.440
I was kind of surprised with
how developed everything was.

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:36.937
But yeah, it was kind
of weird to just like

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:40.660
get off, get on a plane in America

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.580
and fly for however many hours,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.785
and then land in Africa and seem like

00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:47.555
you're in America still. (laughs)

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:49.740
(horn honks)

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.402
(horn honks)

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.256
(brakes squeaking)

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:08.303
(guitar music)

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.200
(bell jingling)

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.347
(chickens clucking)

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:53.460
(baby crying)

00:03:58.718 --> 00:04:00.517
Ryan: Even when I first
found out I was coming

00:04:00.517 --> 00:04:03.479
to South Africa, reaction
by some people are like,

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.679
oh, we didn't know that they,

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:06.781
why would they have Peace
Corps in South Africa?

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:09.844
Not only are we dealing with
similar development issues

00:04:09.844 --> 00:04:11.409
that other volunteers might face,

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.643
but we're also dealing with
knowing that there is money,

00:04:15.643 --> 00:04:17.416
there are resources in this country,

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:21.394
and they're not equally
distributed by any means.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.596
And we can see it on a, we see it,

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:24.879
I mean, when we go to Pretoria,

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.610
when we go to the cities,
we actually feel it.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.990
And there are days when, in Pretoria,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.632
I can start off, if I'm at
a mall or I'm, you know,

00:04:32.632 --> 00:04:34.832
in a private taxi or
I'm having a great meal,

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:38.210
and that same day I can be
back here in my community.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.215
To have that in one day, at
first it was really difficult

00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:42.630
just wrapping your mind around it,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.233
and how can people be okay with that?

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.953
(people talking)

00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:01.455
Maybe if the HIV rate wasn't
the highest in the world,

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:04.421
maybe if the youth
unemployment wasn't so high,

00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:06.803
maybe if rape wasn't such a big issue,

00:05:06.803 --> 00:05:09.540
maybe we wouldn't be here, you know?

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.144
And it kind of feels
wrong having to justify

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.253
us being here by giving
all of those statistics,

00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:17.280
but, you know, there are problems here.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.270
(guitar music)

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:24.806
Kevin: What you see here is

00:05:24.806 --> 00:05:26.829
all the development, and that's it.

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:28.855
It's now, as far as you look to the left,

00:05:28.855 --> 00:05:30.325
as far as you look to the right,

00:05:30.325 --> 00:05:34.301
protected, there's no, I love
it, there's no development.

00:05:35.432 --> 00:05:36.927
Kevin: You know, Peace Corps markets,

00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:38.872
like any marketing firm
they're going to give

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:40.610
an ideal version of what
Peace Corps is like.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.912
So that's why you see the
pictures of digging a well

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:44.144
out in the middle of nowhere,

00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:45.861
and happy people all around you,

00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:48.428
rejoicing at what you're doing.

00:05:48.428 --> 00:05:53.428
But, it's so difficult
to put a common stamp

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.960
on Peace Corps because
it's true, the saying,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.577
every experience is different.

00:05:58.577 --> 00:06:02.656
And I've observed here in
South Africa, just one country,

00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:06.669
that there is a huge
difference in your experience

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.220
from one town to another town,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.833
and it's things that you can't anticipate.

00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:14.570
I'm living now in paradise.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.483
(guitar music)

00:06:17.483 --> 00:06:19.920
The world has changed since 1961,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.410
the communication is different,

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.410
the access to the internet,
which makes the world,

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.960
we can all communicate well.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.145
Most of the volunteers
now have Blackberries.

00:06:33.447 --> 00:06:34.481
Voiceover: Has anybody ever told you that

00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:36.365
it's like Posh Corps
or anything like that?

00:06:36.365 --> 00:06:39.594
Kevin: Only once, and they'll
never make that mistake again.

00:06:39.594 --> 00:06:43.978
I was in Pretoria at Peace
Corps, and it was somebody from,

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:46.256
they weren't from South
Africa, of course, cause nobody

00:06:46.256 --> 00:06:48.555
in South Africa will
say this is Posh Corps.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:50.521
George: What's Posh Corps?

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:53.884
Posh Corps is what Peace Corps volunteers,

00:06:53.884 --> 00:06:56.453
maybe from other countries or
even Peace Corps volunteers

00:06:56.453 --> 00:07:00.238
within South Africa or within a country,

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:02.347
that's what they call the volunteers who

00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:05.825
have more access to first world amenities.

00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:12.217
I have two really big sinks
right outside my door,

00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:15.128
and I actually have running
hot water from one of them,

00:07:15.128 --> 00:07:19.230
which is kind of unheard
of in Peace Corps.

00:07:20.182 --> 00:07:22.795
I do have a flushing toilet.

00:07:22.795 --> 00:07:25.944
Yeah, I actually, I have my own bathroom.

00:07:25.944 --> 00:07:29.490
It has a flush toilet, it has a bathtub,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.600
and it even has like a sink.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.653
I'm actually sweeping the
ants out of my bathroom

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.441
before I take a bath.

00:07:35.441 --> 00:07:38.301
And they just swarm everywhere.

00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:41.549
I was actually saying how I
think they're really resilient,

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.702
and that kind of embodies
Peace Corps. (laughs)

00:07:43.702 --> 00:07:45.964
No matter how many times
I keep trying to keep them

00:07:45.964 --> 00:07:47.869
out of my house and they
keep finding new ways in.

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:49.168
I would definitely say that
this is not your parents

00:07:49.168 --> 00:07:50.793
Peace Corps anymore,
it's totally different.

00:07:50.793 --> 00:07:53.614
You have internet, you have
computers, you have electricity.

00:07:53.614 --> 00:07:56.309
The problems the world is facing now isn't

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.306
necessarily the same ones
they were facing in the 50's,

00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:00.324
and, you know, I mean in
the 60's and 70's, you know?

00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:03.555
Now it's, like we said it's
about resource allocation.

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:07.281
But there's still be a need for diplomacy,

00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:08.877
and sharing American culture.

00:08:08.877 --> 00:08:10.185
Just cause you have
cell phones doesn't mean

00:08:10.185 --> 00:08:12.905
that you don't need those things.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.714
Fran: They think that just because we have

00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:19.277
like Pretoria and Cape
Town at our disposal,

00:08:19.277 --> 00:08:23.830
and that some of our sites
have like running water

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.526
or whatever we have, nice, like
we live with host families,

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:30.270
we have nice things,
that it's easy, you know?

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.320
And that we don't struggle,
but that's not true.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.403
Okay, Denella?

00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:36.828
Kids: L O E.

00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:37.793
Fran:[Donai]

00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:38.899
Kids: [Ene].

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:39.868
Fran: Hello.

00:08:39.868 --> 00:08:40.990
Kids: Hi.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:41.812
Fran: How are you?

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:43.495
Kids: Fine.

00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:46.935
So calling it Posh Corps,
I think, is really,

00:08:46.935 --> 00:08:48.253
can be very ignorant.

00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:51.396
This country, am I even
allowed to say vulgar words?

00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:53.444
This county's a mind fuck, right?

00:08:53.444 --> 00:08:57.404
It's like a total mind fuck. (laughs)

00:08:57.404 --> 00:09:02.180
It like just messes with your head, so,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.836
I just think it's a silly
thing for people to say.

00:09:04.836 --> 00:09:06.762
And I get really annoyed
when people say it,

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:09.550
cause they don't know.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.849
Sean: For me, like I
studied Swahili in college,

00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:18.849
and I knew that I wanted
to work in Africa, and,

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.582
I always thought that was
gonna be Kenya and Tanzania,

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:22.892
and I was kind of bummed when I found out

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:24.635
it was South Africa.

00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:27.372
South Africa never was appealing to me.

00:09:29.987 --> 00:09:32.490
(animal squealing)

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.294
(woman in scarf speaking native language.)

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:34.165
Sean: Yeah.

00:09:34.165 --> 00:09:36.103
Woman in scarf: [Turn in.]

00:09:36.103 --> 00:09:36.918
Sean: It's good?

00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:37.733
(woman in scarf speaking native language)

00:09:37.733 --> 00:09:38.938
Sean: Yeah.

00:09:39.877 --> 00:09:41.346
Woman in scarf: Huh? Alrighty.

00:09:41.346 --> 00:09:43.754
Sean: Yeah, alright, yeah.
(laughs) Yeah, it's good.

00:09:43.754 --> 00:09:46.139
But, after being in the
country and talking to people

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:48.749
about other countries in Africa, like,

00:09:48.749 --> 00:09:50.854
this seems like a great
place to start and kind of

00:09:51.454 --> 00:09:54.489
keep some meat on my
bones and make decisions

00:09:54.489 --> 00:09:57.184
and plot and do things that way.

00:09:57.184 --> 00:10:01.124
(guitar music)

00:10:02.444 --> 00:10:06.349
(kids talking and laughing)

00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:14.390
I knew I was gonna love
whatever was gonna come

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.436
across me eyes and, so whatever came in

00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:20.170
to South Africa I just decided to love.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.197
(singing and clapping)

00:10:25.844 --> 00:10:30.217
(singing and clapping)

00:10:43.936 --> 00:10:46.535
Veronica: My village is
called Mavalani village.

00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:51.304
It's, I'm still not sure how many people,

00:10:51.304 --> 00:10:53.669
but they estimate like 5,000.

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:58.532
It's pretty, it's kind
of spread out I think.

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:02.378
And there's no like
structures like a clinic,

00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:05.384
or a community center or a
library or anything like that.

00:11:05.384 --> 00:11:07.732
We have a few organizations and then

00:11:09.115 --> 00:11:13.259
a lot of churches and that's about it.

00:11:16.463 --> 00:11:21.257
Okay, okay, so I'll just start
here and then wrap around.

00:11:21.257 --> 00:11:25.279
But this is where I've stayed
during my Peace Corps service.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:27.865
Over here is the garage
where we usually store

00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:30.329
drinking water and things.

00:11:31.698 --> 00:11:35.362
This is where I do laundry
and then hang them. (laughs)

00:11:35.362 --> 00:11:36.728
Yeah, yeah, I definitely feel like a

00:11:36.728 --> 00:11:38.377
different person in the village.

00:11:38.377 --> 00:11:42.851
It's definitely a more
relaxed feeling that I have,

00:11:42.851 --> 00:11:46.029
just because it feels
like home at this point.

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:49.440
And then this is my room right here.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.197
Living in this house, I like it.

00:11:52.197 --> 00:11:54.548
I like having the big
windows and just like

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:55.971
having a lot of air coming through,

00:11:55.971 --> 00:11:58.997
and it's just like a lot of space.

00:11:58.997 --> 00:12:00.314
This, I don't know how big it is,

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:03.449
but it's probably not that
much space to other people,

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:07.165
but, (laughs) but like,
compared to other volunteers

00:12:07.165 --> 00:12:09.270
it's like a big room.

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:12.711
(singing and clapping)

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.308
So my role in the village is,

00:12:20.308 --> 00:12:23.950
I'm assigned to an organization called

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.631
[Here Swingve Bacdahalo Organization],

00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:28.312
and they run six projects
throughout the village.

00:12:28.312 --> 00:12:31.122
I primarily work with the home based care

00:12:32.059 --> 00:12:34.116
Drop in Center and then
occasionally do stuff

00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:36.320
with the Victim Empowerment Project.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.412
For me, like the thing that I
do as a volunteer is just like

00:12:40.412 --> 00:12:44.375
try to start projects that
will benefit the community

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:47.914
and that they can get
involved in and interested in.

00:12:47.914 --> 00:12:49.130
(kids talking)

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:53.135
So this is a mural that I
did, me and the kids did,

00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:58.135
after an anti-bullying sessions
that we did for a week.

00:12:58.905 --> 00:13:00.522
Yeah, so for the anti-bullying campaign

00:13:00.522 --> 00:13:03.551
we did a few sessions
at the Drop In Center,

00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.493
which was just like teaching
kids what bullying is,

00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:12.950
and then after that the
kids came up with rules,

00:13:13.479 --> 00:13:15.947
things like no hitting
and no throwing rocks,

00:13:16.777 --> 00:13:19.847
no swearing, no calling people bad names.

00:13:19.847 --> 00:13:22.433
And like, their signature of the contract

00:13:22.433 --> 00:13:25.958
that they would agree to
the rules of the contract

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.364
we're putting their handprints on the wall

00:13:28.364 --> 00:13:31.334
in the form of a peace
sign, so... (laughs)

00:13:31.334 --> 00:13:35.344
Phillip: Yeah, when she
came with this idea,

00:13:35.344 --> 00:13:37.766
I took it as a lie

00:13:37.766 --> 00:13:38.662
(Veronica laughs)

00:13:38.662 --> 00:13:41.690
but after what you've done here,

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.914
we have seen a huge change on children,

00:13:44.914 --> 00:13:48.111
on children's behavior, they're
not bullying each other,

00:13:48.111 --> 00:13:51.946
they're not fighting,
they're working as a team.

00:13:51.946 --> 00:13:54.248
They're living like brothers and sisters.

00:13:54.248 --> 00:13:59.248
What I can say is that
she left a mark on us,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.328
and we're still expecting more from her,

00:14:02.328 --> 00:14:05.141
and her leaving, it would be a wound

00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:07.246
into our hears but we don't have choice

00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:12.246
It's left a mark that America
is a very helpful country.

00:14:12.745 --> 00:14:16.504
A country that doesn't want other people,

00:14:16.504 --> 00:14:20.815
that doesn't want seeing
other people suffering.

00:14:20.815 --> 00:14:23.392
They are friendly and so loving.

00:14:23.392 --> 00:14:27.791
(kids talking and laughing)

00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:33.815
Veronica: I can tell you
like during the first,

00:14:33.815 --> 00:14:35.310
like I said the first year,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.115
the first six months or so I would say,

00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:39.800
it was, like I said,
difficult of getting them

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.542
to realize that I was an
American because I was black.

00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:46.481
But also it was difficult to prove to them

00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:49.775
that I could do the work as
well as a white person could.

00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:52.845
Because they would say
things like Oh Veronica,

00:14:52.845 --> 00:14:54.941
don't think like a black person,

00:14:54.941 --> 00:14:56.344
think like a white person.

00:14:56.344 --> 00:14:57.983
As if someone else would say,

00:14:57.983 --> 00:15:00.228
Oh, the early bird gets the worm.

00:15:00.228 --> 00:15:02.473
It was just like a saying
they they had. (laughs)

00:15:02.473 --> 00:15:04.388
But like I tried to
explain to them, I think,

00:15:04.388 --> 00:15:06.221
I hope I got it across to them just like,

00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:09.561
why as black people themselves,

00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:11.494
and just like talking
to another black person

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.312
they shouldn't say something like that

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.662
and shouldn't think like that.

00:15:14.662 --> 00:15:16.815
But every now and then something like that

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:19.144
will come out of someone's mouth at work.

00:15:19.144 --> 00:15:22.604
We'll be like Oh, we need
a white person to come

00:15:22.604 --> 00:15:24.859
and do this so they can do it
right, or something like that,

00:15:24.859 --> 00:15:27.913
and I'm just like please
don't, please don't say that.

00:15:27.913 --> 00:15:30.402
Voiceover: And what is the
thing you will miss most

00:15:30.402 --> 00:15:32.247
when Veronica leaves?

00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:35.342
(Philip translates)

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:42.622
(speaking native language)

00:15:42.622 --> 00:15:46.114
Philip: They are saying that
they will miss her love,

00:15:46.114 --> 00:15:49.861
her support, because they know
that in terms of conflict,

00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:52.210
when they fail to handle conflict,

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.670
they will call Veronica and help them.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.845
There were taking her like their sister.

00:15:57.845 --> 00:16:00.130
They were family, in fact.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.220
So, it will be hard for
them when she's gone

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.123
because they were used to her.

00:16:05.123 --> 00:16:08.750
Voiceover: Do you hope that
she can come back one day?

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:09.748
(Philip translates)

00:16:09.748 --> 00:16:11.664
Women: Yes! (laughing)

00:16:11.664 --> 00:16:14.899
(speaking native language)

00:16:14.899 --> 00:16:17.379
(Philip laughs)

00:16:17.988 --> 00:16:20.611
Philip: Yeah, they say
they wish if she can come.

00:16:20.611 --> 00:16:24.101
If and when she is going
back, they are not interested.

00:16:24.101 --> 00:16:27.960
If it was their way, they
would say she must stay.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.450
(laughing)

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.826
(guitar music)

00:16:37.524 --> 00:16:40.358
Kevin: I think it's incredibly
difficult for someone

00:16:40.358 --> 00:16:42.520
my age to join Peace Corps.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.622
I was in a job I didn't really like,

00:16:46.852 --> 00:16:48.197
I was making money but I didn't feel like

00:16:48.197 --> 00:16:49.795
I was doing anything meaningful.

00:16:49.795 --> 00:16:52.609
So I could just stay at
my job and make money

00:16:52.609 --> 00:16:55.666
and spend it on things I
don't really care about,

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.170
or do this.

00:16:58.299 --> 00:17:01.710
So, I joke it's my midlife
crisis, but it's not really.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:02.946
It was just something I've wanted to do,

00:17:02.946 --> 00:17:07.946
and the timing was such
that I asked the question

00:17:08.223 --> 00:17:10.201
if not now, when?

00:17:14.047 --> 00:17:16.171
When I first came, the
first week I was here,

00:17:16.171 --> 00:17:19.861
Peace Corps held a perma
gardening workshop.

00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:23.183
And it was for, it was held here,

00:17:23.183 --> 00:17:25.789
but it was for the Peace
Corps volunteers in the area.

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:28.128
I had, the only training
I've had in gardening

00:17:28.128 --> 00:17:30.133
was the perma gardening workshop,

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:33.384
My background is tech, but, the point

00:17:33.384 --> 00:17:36.802
I think that should be made
is that where I'm hoping

00:17:36.802 --> 00:17:41.360
Peace Corps remains flexible
in letting volunteers

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.392
have some autonomy because
even though I'm a tech guy,

00:17:44.392 --> 00:17:46.808
with a tech background, I
can spend, and I don't mind,

00:17:46.808 --> 00:17:48.595
that's what I'm here for,
I'll help out in any way,

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:52.773
but there's interest, so
for me, that's opportunity,

00:17:52.773 --> 00:17:53.751
and they've taken it.

00:17:53.751 --> 00:17:55.720
And if you look out there,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.112
we've got stuff growing
all over the place.

00:17:57.112 --> 00:17:59.793
So again, my background is tech,

00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.795
but there was an opportunity
here with the gardening,

00:18:04.795 --> 00:18:07.994
there was interest, people
took off, so I went there.

00:18:07.994 --> 00:18:11.525
That's where I went and, I
don't know how you fit that,

00:18:11.525 --> 00:18:14.627
how you explain that to a volunteer

00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:16.125
when they first come to a site,

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:18.471
and they're looking for what to do.

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:22.396
My suggestion is you kind of have to just

00:18:22.396 --> 00:18:25.824
be an opportunist and see
where you can help out.

00:18:28.884 --> 00:18:30.626
So that's the biggest challenge is that,

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:32.922
what you think you're going to do,

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.672
you're not going to do it,
likely you're not going to do it,

00:18:36.672 --> 00:18:38.929
and then you're going
to get to a site and,

00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:41.759
there's gonna be other things,
other factors in there,

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:43.940
that are just gonna prevent you from doing

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.414
what you think you were going to do.

00:18:47.106 --> 00:18:48.587
So that's very frustrating.

00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:50.473
I don't know how Peace
Corps, in their defense,

00:18:50.473 --> 00:18:52.182
I don't know how they
can prep you for that.

00:18:52.182 --> 00:18:53.616
I don't know.

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:58.990
(guitar music)

00:19:06.826 --> 00:19:11.826
I think South Africa was
particularly difficult

00:19:13.954 --> 00:19:16.673
as a location for a number of reasons.

00:19:16.673 --> 00:19:17.886
Yes, there are a lot of nice things,

00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:19.107
but you don't have any money,

00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:20.973
so you can't do these things.

00:19:20.973 --> 00:19:23.574
So the person you're working
with is driving a BMW,

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.710
and you are not, so
there's this disconnect.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.820
You know, you're given 80 rand a day,

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.976
that's your allowance, you know,

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:33.394
to put it in perspective that's about

00:19:33.394 --> 00:19:35.918
10 dollars a day to live on.

00:19:35.918 --> 00:19:39.341
So, yeah, you see all this stuff,

00:19:39.341 --> 00:19:42.557
but you don't get to experience it.

00:19:48.003 --> 00:19:51.703
I actually, one time I did
my laundry, I was in Hinesa,

00:19:51.703 --> 00:19:55.896
I did my laundry, put it
on the clothesline to dry,

00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:57.858
the woman that comes to the house,

00:19:57.858 --> 00:19:59.571
didn't like how I did my laundry,

00:19:59.571 --> 00:20:01.867
took it all down, washed
it, put it back up,

00:20:01.867 --> 00:20:04.824
charged me 30 rand. (laughs)

00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:08.268
I'm just getting into the groove now.

00:20:08.268 --> 00:20:10.442
Here's what was going to happen:

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:12.788
I'm working with 6th and 7th graders,

00:20:12.788 --> 00:20:16.112
and the lab I work with,
we have 20 computers,

00:20:16.112 --> 00:20:21.112
and the goal is to get them
some basic typing skills,

00:20:21.629 --> 00:20:23.545
and by the end of
September they'll be able

00:20:23.545 --> 00:20:25.926
to research and write a paper.

00:20:25.926 --> 00:20:27.353
(kids talking)

00:20:27.353 --> 00:20:29.997
Today what I want you to do is I want you

00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:34.828
to practice typing, those
of you with a typing name,

00:20:35.596 --> 00:20:38.284
I want you to practice a little bit,

00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:41.455
and then yes, you can
go back to [unka], okay?

00:20:41.455 --> 00:20:44.580
Yes, I do talk differently
and what you do,

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.291
you know exactly, yeah, you hit it.

00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:51.299
You become, first of all, you
start limiting your words,

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:53.362
so you use less words.

00:20:53.362 --> 00:20:56.068
Have any of you done the typing game yet?

00:20:56.068 --> 00:20:58.451
Do you know what the typing game is?

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.823
Do you understand any words
coming out of my mouth?

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.302
Yes, now I know your village voice,

00:21:03.302 --> 00:21:05.045
and yes, we all do it.

00:21:05.045 --> 00:21:06.603
You're a Peace Corps volunteer, you and I,

00:21:06.603 --> 00:21:09.622
were having a conversation,
someone will come in,

00:21:09.622 --> 00:21:12.652
who's English is a second language,

00:21:12.652 --> 00:21:15.265
and you talk differently,
yes, the village voice, so.

00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:19.400
(guitar music)

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:25.767
(kids talking)

00:21:34.952 --> 00:21:37.271
George: I know I gave it to you, Julia.

00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:38.608
(kids talking)

00:21:38.608 --> 00:21:40.358
I will make some more. Antino?

00:21:40.358 --> 00:21:41.900
When you're a teacher in South Africa,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.785
there's no room for compromise.

00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:46.942
I mean, I think I was, I had
some level of preparedness,

00:21:46.942 --> 00:21:50.488
but I don't think you can
ever truthfully be prepared

00:21:50.488 --> 00:21:52.345
to teach here coming
from the United States.

00:21:52.345 --> 00:21:53.560
(kids talking)

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.795
Hey! (clapping) Hey! (clapping)

00:21:55.826 --> 00:21:57.543
Class: [Hey!] (clapping)

00:21:57.543 --> 00:21:58.557
George: Good morning!

00:21:58.557 --> 00:22:00.180
Class: Good morning!

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.683
George: Like they told you
your class may be overcrowded,

00:22:03.329 --> 00:22:07.204
I just didn't expect there
to be not enough furniture.

00:22:07.204 --> 00:22:10.054
Like in the first few
days of class half my kids

00:22:10.054 --> 00:22:11.898
were standing cause there
weren't enough desks.

00:22:11.898 --> 00:22:13.830
(kids reciting)

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.405
I don't have textbooks for my learners.

00:22:15.405 --> 00:22:16.854
I just have to write stuff on the board

00:22:16.854 --> 00:22:18.334
and they have to copy it.

00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:19.166
It's a waste of time, but...

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:21.613
Yeah, it's just stuff like
that you don't think about,

00:22:21.613 --> 00:22:23.292
you take for granted
in American classrooms,

00:22:23.292 --> 00:22:25.320
but they don't have as
much materials here.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.585
Okay, do this, okay.

00:22:27.585 --> 00:22:32.585
The second part, activity
four, activity five.

00:22:32.892 --> 00:22:37.563
I'm going to explain
them now, again, okay.

00:22:38.331 --> 00:22:41.044
Do you know how to do a line graph?

00:22:41.044 --> 00:22:42.044
Class: Yes.

00:22:42.044 --> 00:22:44.117
George: Okay, let's revise it then.

00:22:45.978 --> 00:22:49.112
So here we have months
and we have numbers, yes?

00:22:49.112 --> 00:22:50.080
Class: Yes.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.020
George: Okay, the numbers
are going to represent

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.814
how many cows a man has.

00:22:56.814 --> 00:22:58.019
(door banging)

00:22:58.074 --> 00:23:00.138
Oh, okay.

00:23:01.984 --> 00:23:04.328
I mean, like, in my school,
we have third world materials,

00:23:04.328 --> 00:23:05.746
we're working with third
world materials, we've got

00:23:05.762 --> 00:23:07.975
chalkboard and chalk, that's
pretty much all we got.

00:23:07.975 --> 00:23:11.143
But, the curriculum, or
what they might want us

00:23:11.143 --> 00:23:12.932
to teach these kids, or the
workbooks they might give us,

00:23:12.932 --> 00:23:17.077
if we get workbooks, it's,
the demands are first world,

00:23:17.677 --> 00:23:19.069
and I feel like the conditions

00:23:19.069 --> 00:23:21.167
on the ground are still third world.

00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:23.632
How many from 70 until...

00:23:24.447 --> 00:23:25.916
You live in a third world place,

00:23:25.916 --> 00:23:29.464
then you know, you get
a call from the office,

00:23:29.464 --> 00:23:29.867
and you have to go into Pretoria,

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:31.314
it's only two hours away.

00:23:31.314 --> 00:23:33.184
You go two hours from where I am,

00:23:33.184 --> 00:23:34.969
and you're living in like
a bustling metropolis

00:23:34.969 --> 00:23:36.632
that has first world everything.

00:23:36.632 --> 00:23:38.471
And then as a Peace Corps volunteer,

00:23:39.409 --> 00:23:41.834
then you go back to your village.

00:23:41.834 --> 00:23:46.317
And that's, I've heard
that that's one of the most

00:23:46.317 --> 00:23:48.840
difficult parts of being in
South Africa as a volunteer

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.655
is having the mental
toughness to be able to

00:23:52.655 --> 00:23:56.574
withstand the constant switch from

00:23:56.574 --> 00:23:58.784
living in a third world
going to the first world,

00:23:58.784 --> 00:24:00.817
then going back to the third world again.

00:24:00.817 --> 00:24:04.844
(guitar music)

00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:10.963
My village, the predominant culture

00:24:10.963 --> 00:24:14.341
in my village is Ndbele, but it's,

00:24:14.341 --> 00:24:17.169
kwaNdebele is this whole
area's kind of weird,

00:24:17.169 --> 00:24:18.822
because there was this
whole homeland [zact] thing

00:24:18.822 --> 00:24:19.751
where they kind of moved all the

00:24:19.751 --> 00:24:21.104
different tribes different places.

00:24:21.104 --> 00:24:24.347
And they moved the Ndebele's to this area.

00:24:24.347 --> 00:24:26.079
Fendzi: Oh, quite nice.

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:26.873
George: Yeah.

00:24:26.873 --> 00:24:28.631
Fendzi: Yes, very nice.

00:24:32.476 --> 00:24:33.778
George: So if I was going to get married,

00:24:33.778 --> 00:24:34.794
I would wear this also.

00:24:34.794 --> 00:24:36.911
Fendzi: Also, put it inside.

00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:40.241
This thing, it's a sign from the Ndebeles.

00:24:40.241 --> 00:24:42.036
I don't know what I can explain

00:24:42.036 --> 00:24:45.503
but it's our traditional Ndebeles

00:24:45.503 --> 00:24:47.966
when the boys are coming
from the mountain.

00:24:47.966 --> 00:24:50.064
George: Oh, so this is
Ndebeles, it's not Sotho,

00:24:50.064 --> 00:24:51.364
Fendzi: Yeah, no.

00:24:51.364 --> 00:24:52.019
George: this is Ndebeles.
Fendzi: Ndebeles, yeah.

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:53.481
George: So my family
is Ndebeles and Sotho.

00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:54.639
Fendzi: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:56.292
George: I feel like Ndebeles are,

00:24:56.292 --> 00:24:57.942
there a little more traditional I think.

00:24:57.942 --> 00:24:58.925
I always thought Ndebeles are,

00:24:58.925 --> 00:25:01.214
they're really, really
proud of their culture.

00:25:01.214 --> 00:25:05.669
But I can't say if that's
specifically a Ndebele thing,

00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:09.186
because I've only lived
in the Ndebele village.

00:25:10.325 --> 00:25:12.260
Oh, oh yeah, definitely Ndebele colors,

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.286
Fendzi: They are.

00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:14.424
Fendzi: No problem, yeah.

00:25:14.424 --> 00:25:15.470
George: These are very Ndebele colors.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.646
I think, I think,

00:25:17.646 --> 00:25:19.115
(speaking in Ndebele)
I see beautiful, yes?

00:25:19.115 --> 00:25:20.044
Fendzi: (speaking in Ndebele)

00:25:20.044 --> 00:25:21.889
Yes, you look good in these.

00:25:21.889 --> 00:25:25.475
You must take a picture,

00:25:25.475 --> 00:25:28.533
so they will see it in America.

00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:30.211
(George laughs)

00:25:30.211 --> 00:25:30.986
Fendzi: (speaking in Ndebele)

00:25:30.986 --> 00:25:32.772
I think you are adjusting
well to South Africa,

00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:35.957
and with your studies.

00:25:35.957 --> 00:25:39.017
We are happy that George is in our family,

00:25:39.017 --> 00:25:42.467
but you need to study more because

00:25:42.467 --> 00:25:46.288
we do not speak English in KwaNdebele.

00:25:46.288 --> 00:25:47.150
George: Okay.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.866
Fendzi: Thank you, George. (laughs)

00:25:48.866 --> 00:25:50.252
George: Ah, siyabonga.

00:25:50.252 --> 00:25:51.617
(laughing)

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:53.149
Peace Corps has made me a better person.

00:25:53.149 --> 00:25:54.335
I can already tell.

00:25:54.335 --> 00:25:57.598
I'm just more patient, and it's made me,

00:25:57.598 --> 00:25:59.952
I feel like, what Peace Corps does,

00:25:59.952 --> 00:26:02.640
and this is why I think a lot
of people fail in Peace Corps,

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.591
is because they come to Peace Corps,

00:26:04.591 --> 00:26:06.367
like I said, running away from something.

00:26:06.367 --> 00:26:07.658
Thing about Peace Corps,

00:26:07.658 --> 00:26:09.920
is that is exposes all your weaknesses.

00:26:10.396 --> 00:26:11.780
You know what's funny?

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.585
When my girlfriend and
my friends come to visit

00:26:13.585 --> 00:26:16.118
in September, right, they
said they were going to visit,

00:26:16.118 --> 00:26:18.600
my girlfriend speaks Chinese
and I don't speak Chinese.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.041
(Sibusiso laughs)

00:26:20.041 --> 00:26:21.281
Sibusiso: They know how to speak Chinese?

00:26:21.281 --> 00:26:22.284
George: They know how to speak Chinese.

00:26:22.284 --> 00:26:23.254
Sibusiso: You don't know?

00:26:23.254 --> 00:26:24.533
George: I'm not Chinese man,

00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:26.534
so I don't know how to speak Chinese.

00:26:26.534 --> 00:26:27.803
I don't speak Chinese, but my friends,

00:26:27.803 --> 00:26:29.269
they speak Chinese.

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:31.072
So you're going to enjoy it, man.

00:26:31.072 --> 00:26:33.129
Sibusiso: Yeah, yeah, ching, chong.

00:26:33.129 --> 00:26:35.063
George: No, my gosh, it's
not even a word, man.

00:26:35.063 --> 00:26:36.678
Sibusiso: I want them to
speak it at the plaza, man,

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:37.958
people are gonna be like, ahh,

00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:39.910
this guy, I knew you were Chinese.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:41.129
(both laughing)

00:26:41.129 --> 00:26:42.371
George: That's true, if
I'm hangin out with my

00:26:42.371 --> 00:26:45.446
Chinese friends, they'll
be, ahh, you, when, I know.

00:26:45.446 --> 00:26:47.625
(both laughing)

00:26:47.764 --> 00:26:49.629
You're Chinese, you've been lying.

00:26:49.629 --> 00:26:51.148
(both laughing)

00:26:51.148 --> 00:26:53.117
Yeah, Sibu, Sibusiso,

00:26:53.117 --> 00:26:57.843
Sibusiso is probably
one of my best friends

00:26:57.843 --> 00:26:59.284
here in South Africa.

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:01.504
He's just a really, like, laid back guy.

00:27:01.504 --> 00:27:04.446
But he's a super serious teacher,

00:27:04.446 --> 00:27:06.782
and I really like Sibusiso
because he kind of

00:27:06.782 --> 00:27:08.420
took me under his wing when I got here,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.154
and he really made an
effort to be my friend.

00:27:11.154 --> 00:27:15.367
(kids talking)

00:27:20.008 --> 00:27:22.267
I really think, when you're
teaching in Peace Corps,

00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:23.904
especially in South Africa,

00:27:23.904 --> 00:27:25.616
like you do have to steal
your heart a little bit.

00:27:25.616 --> 00:27:28.319
Because otherwise, you're
just gonna bleed out.

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:30.636
You have to wear, like, emotional armor,

00:27:30.636 --> 00:27:33.406
I think, otherwise it's
just too much heartbreak.

00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:36.023
I give my students a practice test,

00:27:36.023 --> 00:27:38.122
and a lot of them failed it,

00:27:38.122 --> 00:27:39.998
and some of it's my fault.

00:27:42.213 --> 00:27:44.935
I over-emphasized some
things that were not,

00:27:44.935 --> 00:27:46.848
that I felt were really important,

00:27:46.848 --> 00:27:49.875
but weren't emphasized
on the work schedule,

00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:52.793
and that's totally on me and
it feels really bad right now.

00:27:52.793 --> 00:27:54.234
That's what's tough.

00:27:54.234 --> 00:27:55.842
(George and Sibusiso laughing)

00:27:55.842 --> 00:27:58.597
Sibusiso: So even the ones
that you trusted to pass,

00:27:58.597 --> 00:27:59.603
they didn't perform well?

00:27:59.603 --> 00:28:01.203
George: No, I mean, the
ones I trusted to pass,

00:28:01.203 --> 00:28:05.858
they passed or just almost
passed, so it's okay.

00:28:05.858 --> 00:28:09.192
But, I mean, I don't know,

00:28:09.192 --> 00:28:10.950
I just thought it would be better.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.120
I thought it would be
better, so I don't know,

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.847
I thought it would be better.

00:28:14.847 --> 00:28:16.781
Basically I'm asking him, like,

00:28:16.781 --> 00:28:19.413
how can I get my math scores higher.

00:28:19.413 --> 00:28:22.289
Because, I was, I graded a
small sample size of them,

00:28:22.289 --> 00:28:24.112
but they weren't really that good.

00:28:24.112 --> 00:28:25.776
And he says he gives
them a lot more homework

00:28:25.776 --> 00:28:29.147
than I give them, but,
I gave my kids homework

00:28:29.147 --> 00:28:30.995
in the beginning, they
just didn't do it. (laughs)

00:28:30.995 --> 00:28:35.994
So I'm not sure if that's gonna work.

00:28:35.994 --> 00:28:38.152
Yeah, I feel like I
failed those kids today.

00:28:38.152 --> 00:28:39.169
Like I really do.

00:28:39.169 --> 00:28:40.723
Sibusiso: Get past this one and-

00:28:40.723 --> 00:28:42.629
George: I have to, I
learned my lesson now.

00:28:42.629 --> 00:28:45.020
I have to follow your schedule probably

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:49.575
cause I think these kids
failed cause I messed up.

00:28:49.575 --> 00:28:50.614
(scoffs)

00:28:51.306 --> 00:28:55.264
Anyway, okay, thanks Si.

00:28:55.264 --> 00:28:57.636
They always tell you this
in training and everything,

00:28:57.636 --> 00:28:59.305
they say, you know, as
long as you get to know,

00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:01.970
or as long as you know two or three kids,

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.383
get it, then, you made a
difference, you know, or

00:29:05.983 --> 00:29:08.632
as long as that one kid can
use the past tense afterwards,

00:29:08.632 --> 00:29:09.990
or you know, these kids
they finally understand

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.590
their multiplication tables and, you know,

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:13.884
even if you were doing it
for two years it's worth it.

00:29:13.884 --> 00:29:16.120
I want to do better than that,

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.550
and it's not working out so far. (laughs)

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.810
I can't accept mediocrity, I can't do it,

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.420
I want all my kids to pass.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.132
And I don't know how
I'm gonna do that yet.

00:29:26.132 --> 00:29:30.254
(water streaming)

00:29:34.346 --> 00:29:39.234
(people singing)

00:30:36.003 --> 00:30:40.848
(pastor speaking in native language)

00:30:51.179 --> 00:30:54.066
Sean: So I live in the
village of Ha-Lambani.

00:30:54.066 --> 00:30:56.776
So the first day I arrived
was with my principal,

00:30:56.776 --> 00:30:58.598
I knew that I hit Peace Corps jacktpot.

00:30:58.598 --> 00:31:02.154
It was this cool sense
of feeling that like,

00:31:02.154 --> 00:31:04.503
I had found a place, or
I had been put in a place

00:31:04.503 --> 00:31:06.937
by Peace Corps that would work for me

00:31:06.937 --> 00:31:09.142
and that I'd be able to do cool things.

00:31:09.142 --> 00:31:12.312
Yeah, so there was pure
excitement when I came here.

00:31:12.312 --> 00:31:13.905
And then we parked the car at the school,

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:16.870
and I met my host mom, and then afterwards

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.275
we walked up to the house,

00:31:19.275 --> 00:31:23.304
and I was like, it was the
first feeling of disappointment,

00:31:23.304 --> 00:31:25.924
cause I was like oh, man,
like, my house is really nice,

00:31:25.924 --> 00:31:29.044
like, I'm not gonna be
like that stereotypical

00:31:29.044 --> 00:31:30.409
Peace Corps volunteer.

00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:32.804
But then I like met my family,

00:31:32.804 --> 00:31:36.618
and we spent the night and
we had some dinner together,

00:31:36.618 --> 00:31:40.843
and it was just, I knew it
was gonna be cool, yeah.

00:31:49.242 --> 00:31:50.322
In the name of the Father, and the Son,

00:31:50.322 --> 00:31:51.848
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

00:31:51.848 --> 00:31:53.967
Bless us Lord in these fine
gifts which we are about

00:31:53.967 --> 00:31:56.981
to receive through thy bounty
through Christ, our Lord, Amen.

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:57.797
All: Amen.

00:31:57.797 --> 00:32:00.624
Sean: In the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, Amen.

00:32:00.624 --> 00:32:01.619
(television chatter)

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:06.060
Venda is the language spoken
by less than a million people

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.401
spread throughout southern
Zimbabwe and northern Limpopo.

00:32:10.401 --> 00:32:13.854
They still have their own way of eating,

00:32:13.854 --> 00:32:17.181
their own way of kind of designing things,

00:32:17.181 --> 00:32:18.799
living in a certain way.

00:32:20.675 --> 00:32:25.323
They've never really had
to sell who they are,

00:32:25.323 --> 00:32:27.294
they just have been who they are.

00:32:27.294 --> 00:32:31.628
(guitar music)

00:32:33.249 --> 00:32:37.556
(kids talking)

00:32:45.494 --> 00:32:47.202
But in South Africa as a whole,

00:32:47.202 --> 00:32:49.804
it's one of the only
countries where you can go

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:55.185
and poop in a pit latrine
and then be in a mall

00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:58.070
and buy a pair of Nike's in the same day

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.579
within a respectful amount of time.

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:03.367
I think for some people it
becomes this crippling crutch

00:33:03.367 --> 00:33:06.872
that, you know, whenever
I'm stressed I just need to

00:33:06.872 --> 00:33:09.120
treat myself and I go into town.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.120
So they kind of avoid
what's going to keep them

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.767
feeling connected in Peace Corps,

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:17.225
which is staying in your village,

00:33:17.225 --> 00:33:19.700
being integrated into the community.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.559
Oui.

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:21.640
Woman in pink: [Mefunzi].

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.269
Sean: [Mefunzi], oh right!

00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:25.109
(speaking native language)
Oh the wife of Eric.

00:33:25.109 --> 00:33:26.425
Is Eric here today?

00:33:26.425 --> 00:33:27.495
Woman in pink: (speaking native
language) Over that side.

00:33:27.495 --> 00:33:30.105
Sean: Okay, (speaking native language)

00:33:30.105 --> 00:33:31.027
Yeah, this is South Africa,

00:33:31.027 --> 00:33:33.968
like you can go to Menlyn
Mall, Brooklyn Mall,

00:33:33.968 --> 00:33:35.574
be in these nice situations,

00:33:35.574 --> 00:33:37.575
but like, your work is in the village,

00:33:37.575 --> 00:33:39.344
that's what our agreement
is and that's what's gonna

00:33:39.344 --> 00:33:40.831
kind of keep you happy.

00:33:40.831 --> 00:33:42.597
Like, we know it's gonna keep you happy.

00:33:42.597 --> 00:33:45.854
(insects buzzing)

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.227
Sean: Yeah.

00:33:47.971 --> 00:33:49.578
(Eric speaking native language)

00:33:49.578 --> 00:33:50.774
Sean: Yeah.

00:33:51.598 --> 00:33:56.598
Eric: Maybe three hours
[unintelligible]. Three hours.

00:33:56.771 --> 00:33:57.998
Sean: So it takes about three hours

00:33:57.998 --> 00:33:59.341
to cut down a tree like this.

00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:08.679
(speaking native language)

00:34:14.006 --> 00:34:15.186
Sean: This is more expensive.

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:16.659
Eric: Yeah.

00:34:17.505 --> 00:34:19.867
Sean: You're saying
this wood is used mostly

00:34:19.867 --> 00:34:24.654
for like basic items like
spoons and cooking utensils.

00:34:24.654 --> 00:34:26.365
And it's like a softer wood.

00:34:26.365 --> 00:34:29.781
And this inner wood is used
more for like [mutoli],

00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:31.305
the thing that we saw him building.

00:34:31.305 --> 00:34:33.775
He was kind of carving the inside.

00:34:34.821 --> 00:34:35.974
Oh, okay.

00:34:36.018 --> 00:34:38.562
Eric: Go like so.

00:34:39.798 --> 00:34:42.908
Sean: This morning we were
at Eric Lambani's house.

00:34:43.355 --> 00:34:45.795
He is a local artist.

00:34:45.795 --> 00:34:49.161
And he just has these really hard woods

00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:51.512
that grow throughout Venda,
he cuts down the trees

00:34:51.512 --> 00:34:56.006
and turns them into items
like canes for priests,

00:34:56.006 --> 00:34:58.643
and he turns them into,
like, little sculptures

00:34:58.643 --> 00:35:02.260
of kids that become ornaments for yards.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.402
And we've been working on
trying to get some funding

00:35:05.402 --> 00:35:08.233
for him to expand an
arts and crafts program

00:35:08.233 --> 00:35:10.823
for local kids to kind of teach them

00:35:10.823 --> 00:35:14.350
the ancient Venda ways
of doing woodcarving.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:19.350
(speaking native language)

00:35:20.235 --> 00:35:22.134
Sean: Oh, yeah.

00:35:22.134 --> 00:35:23.149
(Eric laughing)

00:35:23.149 --> 00:35:25.808
So they also make, he also
makes the little bones

00:35:25.808 --> 00:35:28.121
for like the [samgoma]
when they put it in a,

00:35:28.121 --> 00:35:31.103
and then you (blowing).

00:35:32.903 --> 00:35:37.023
(speaking native language)

00:35:37.023 --> 00:35:41.495
(laughing)

00:35:43.982 --> 00:35:48.982
(speaking native language)

00:36:00.965 --> 00:36:02.072
Sean: Yeah.

00:36:03.904 --> 00:36:05.871
He was first discussing about like,

00:36:05.871 --> 00:36:08.101
having coming from God and like God put

00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:09.826
the message on his tongue,

00:36:09.826 --> 00:36:12.445
and when he threw the bones
he learned different things.

00:36:12.445 --> 00:36:15.314
And this bone talks about being careful

00:36:15.314 --> 00:36:18.634
about African magic and that some people

00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:21.562
have a lot of jealousy and
they will try to blind you

00:36:21.562 --> 00:36:25.499
on your way but you have
to keep finding your way.

00:36:25.499 --> 00:36:27.114
Don't let people be jealous,

00:36:27.114 --> 00:36:29.866
and there's good people too that,

00:36:29.866 --> 00:36:33.374
like him and his wife,
that aren't here to fight.

00:36:33.374 --> 00:36:37.058
(speaking native language)

00:36:37.749 --> 00:36:39.850
Sean: Gossip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.111
There's so much, as
American's, that we don't see,

00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:44.629
that we don't experience.

00:36:44.629 --> 00:36:49.164
Peace Corps creates this
bizarre productive bubble

00:36:49.164 --> 00:36:50.606
for Americans to go abroad,

00:36:50.606 --> 00:36:53.506
like do things that help communities,

00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:54.969
at the same time help America.

00:36:54.969 --> 00:36:58.047
But putting Americans
in other people's shoes,

00:36:58.047 --> 00:36:59.381
I think is our real goal.

00:36:59.381 --> 00:37:02.344
Like putting Americans in shoes of people

00:37:02.344 --> 00:37:04.149
in other countries because we have such a

00:37:04.149 --> 00:37:05.847
big impact on the rest of the world.

00:37:05.847 --> 00:37:10.314
(speaking native language)

00:37:10.395 --> 00:37:12.334
(guitar music)

00:37:12.334 --> 00:37:13.940
("La Bamba" by Ritchie Valens)

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.768
Fran: ♫ (lyrics) Bamba, bamba

00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:19.954
♫ Bamba, bamba

00:37:19.954 --> 00:37:22.395
♫ Bamba, bamba

00:37:22.395 --> 00:37:24.474
♫ Bamba, bamba

00:37:24.474 --> 00:37:27.299
♫ Para bailar La Bamba

00:37:27.299 --> 00:37:29.116
♫ Para bailar La Bamba

00:37:29.116 --> 00:37:33.153
♫ Se necessita una poca de gracia

00:37:33.153 --> 00:37:35.147
♫ Una poca de gracia

00:37:35.147 --> 00:37:38.512
♫ Para mi, para ti, ay arriba, ay arriba ♫

00:37:38.512 --> 00:37:42.411
So my family is Filipino.

00:37:42.411 --> 00:37:46.215
I don't know how many Asian
parents share with their kids

00:37:46.215 --> 00:37:49.177
their experiences living in poverty.

00:37:49.177 --> 00:37:54.177
My parents saw it as, we
emigrated out of poverty

00:37:54.472 --> 00:37:57.453
to get you into a world
that's like developed

00:37:57.453 --> 00:37:59.086
so you can live comfortably.

00:37:59.086 --> 00:38:01.606
Like, why are you going back to poverty?

00:38:01.606 --> 00:38:06.499
♫ Bamba, bamba ♫

00:38:06.499 --> 00:38:08.356
Yay!

00:38:08.372 --> 00:38:11.994
I wanted to see how the
rest of the world lived.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.281
I knew I wasn't gonna
make a huge difference,

00:38:15.281 --> 00:38:17.194
I knew I wasn't gonna change a village,

00:38:17.194 --> 00:38:19.119
I knew I wasn't gonna build an orphanage,

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:21.933
but I knew that I needed to grow,

00:38:21.933 --> 00:38:23.997
and I needed to see how the
rest of the world lived,

00:38:23.997 --> 00:38:25.813
and I needed to be
grateful for what I had.

00:38:25.813 --> 00:38:28.167
And I got exactly that.

00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.793
That's what I came here for,

00:38:29.793 --> 00:38:31.510
and that's exactly what I got.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.480
Oh, one sec, one sec, one sec.

00:38:39.265 --> 00:38:42.264
Lo-Himyani, it's a
village that's three hours

00:38:42.264 --> 00:38:45.249
outside of the capital, Pretoria.

00:38:45.249 --> 00:38:48.350
You know, in my opinion,
the people who stay here

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.647
have a real shot at getting a bursary

00:38:51.647 --> 00:38:56.334
and moving out of this area
and moving into the city.

00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:57.178
That's how I feel about Lo-Himyani,

00:38:57.178 --> 00:39:00.112
and that's why I feel so strongly
about making a difference

00:39:00.112 --> 00:39:01.481
here and building those relationships,

00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:04.272
cause I really think that
these kids are briliant,

00:39:04.272 --> 00:39:06.914
and their English is very good,

00:39:06.914 --> 00:39:09.971
and they could climb the social ladder.

00:39:09.971 --> 00:39:11.603
Oh, I made a mistake here, sorry guys.

00:39:11.603 --> 00:39:12.978
(laughs)

00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:17.518
(kids laughing)

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.394
[Douho]

00:39:20.394 --> 00:39:21.209
Duoho: H?

00:39:21.212 --> 00:39:22.635
Fran: Uh-huh.

00:39:22.635 --> 00:39:25.360
Kids: Oh. L!

00:39:25.821 --> 00:39:27.397
Fran: What does that spell?

00:39:27.397 --> 00:39:28.694
Kids: School.

00:39:28.694 --> 00:39:29.986
Fran: Yay! Okay.

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.150
Throughout the day I do my lesson,

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.404
and also prepare for
my girl's club meeting.

00:39:35.404 --> 00:39:37.336
So I have girl's club twice a week,

00:39:37.336 --> 00:39:38.373
I'll do my girl's club,

00:39:38.373 --> 00:39:41.107
usually it consists of
games and then a topic,

00:39:41.107 --> 00:39:43.861
and just talking about life.

00:39:43.861 --> 00:39:45.804
(girl in center speaking native language)

00:39:45.804 --> 00:39:49.836
(kids talking and laughing)

00:39:55.108 --> 00:39:58.586
Fran: I just knew that the pregnancy rate

00:39:58.586 --> 00:40:00.632
in these areas are really high,

00:40:00.632 --> 00:40:03.014
and I also saw that like,

00:40:03.014 --> 00:40:06.625
the super bright ones in
these classes were girls,

00:40:06.625 --> 00:40:08.419
but I also knew they were really at risk,

00:40:08.419 --> 00:40:09.955
because even though they're bright,

00:40:09.955 --> 00:40:11.341
it doesn't mean that they won't be

00:40:11.341 --> 00:40:13.354
sexually active when they are 12.

00:40:13.354 --> 00:40:15.624
So I wanted to reach them
at a really young age,

00:40:15.624 --> 00:40:17.856
and start talking to them really early on

00:40:17.856 --> 00:40:21.519
about setting their goals and objectives,

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:26.519
and not being distracted by boys.

00:40:26.864 --> 00:40:29.475
What about, do you guys
know Michelle Obama?

00:40:29.475 --> 00:40:30.999
Kids: Yes!

00:40:30.999 --> 00:40:32.404
Fran: Is she a leader?

00:40:32.404 --> 00:40:35.097
(kids mumbling yes and no)

00:40:35.097 --> 00:40:36.310
Fran: No?

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:37.787
Kids: Yes.

00:40:37.787 --> 00:40:40.781
Fran: Okay, so do you think
that she's a good leader?

00:40:40.781 --> 00:40:41.888
Kids: Yes.

00:40:41.888 --> 00:40:43.063
Fran: Is she in a position where

00:40:43.063 --> 00:40:44.873
people have to look up to her?

00:40:44.873 --> 00:40:45.978
Kids: Yes.

00:40:45.978 --> 00:40:47.466
Fran: Does that make her a leader?

00:40:47.466 --> 00:40:48.248
Kids: Yes.

00:40:48.248 --> 00:40:48.933
Fran: Okay.

00:40:48.933 --> 00:40:49.867
I'm just really worried that they're

00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:52.213
gonna get pregnant at a really young age.

00:40:52.213 --> 00:40:53.488
I don't think they're gonna get pregnant,

00:40:53.488 --> 00:40:56.008
but I kind of think
they might get pregnant.

00:40:56.008 --> 00:40:59.068
I mean, it's just so common here,

00:40:59.068 --> 00:41:01.499
and it's so like in your face and,

00:41:01.499 --> 00:41:03.974
it's not like they have
role models all the time

00:41:03.974 --> 00:41:08.974
to tell them that that can
seriously ruin their chances.

00:41:09.184 --> 00:41:10.418
Cause these girls are so smart,

00:41:10.418 --> 00:41:13.126
if they had the right
foundation and the right people

00:41:13.126 --> 00:41:14.973
to continuously push them,

00:41:14.973 --> 00:41:17.843
they could be doctors or
whatever they want to be.

00:41:17.843 --> 00:41:20.164
They could do that, but I don't,

00:41:20.164 --> 00:41:20.988
if they get pregnant they're just not

00:41:20.988 --> 00:41:22.706
gonna have that option.

00:41:23.459 --> 00:41:25.935
What does it take to be a good leader?

00:41:25.935 --> 00:41:28.632
Losecho: To be loyal,
responsible, and kind.

00:41:28.632 --> 00:41:30.517
Fran: Okay, loyal, responsible, and kind.

00:41:30.517 --> 00:41:31.078
Do you guys-

00:41:31.078 --> 00:41:32.182
Losecho: And make a difference.

00:41:32.182 --> 00:41:34.234
I am Losecho [Swayi].

00:41:34.234 --> 00:41:37.082
My position in girl's
club is as a president.

00:41:37.082 --> 00:41:40.059
I have to make sure that
the girl's club is in order,

00:41:40.059 --> 00:41:43.628
there's no fighting,
people respect each other,

00:41:43.628 --> 00:41:46.070
and no bullying to the little sisters.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.877
Fran: Alright?

00:41:46.877 --> 00:41:47.818
Kids: Yes.

00:41:47.818 --> 00:41:49.821
Fran: So Losecho's gonna lead
the meeting today. (clapping)

00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:51.125
Give her a round of applause.

00:41:51.125 --> 00:41:53.291
(clapping)

00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:55.655
Okay, so, I want you guys to give her

00:41:55.655 --> 00:41:58.581
the same kind of respect
that you would give me, okay?

00:41:58.581 --> 00:41:59.456
Kids: Yes.

00:41:59.456 --> 00:42:04.234
Lesocho: They told us that
she was processing [in diego],

00:42:04.234 --> 00:42:06.773
but in South Africa her
name is [Olevie Latuse].

00:42:06.773 --> 00:42:09.524
She taught us to be loyal,

00:42:09.524 --> 00:42:10.953
to never underestimate each other,

00:42:10.953 --> 00:42:12.649
never undermine each other,

00:42:12.649 --> 00:42:14.468
never take somebody for granted.

00:42:14.468 --> 00:42:17.864
Cause you'll never know
what she's capable of,

00:42:17.864 --> 00:42:19.633
as a girl or as a woman.

00:42:19.633 --> 00:42:21.300
Fran: Okay, respect, yeah?

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.410
What's one of the rules of our club?

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.563
Kids: Respect.

00:42:25.716 --> 00:42:26.869
Fran: Respect. Okay, so if you guys think

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:28.356
all of these qualities...

00:42:28.356 --> 00:42:29.575
Lesocho: I just want to say that,

00:42:29.575 --> 00:42:31.918
Pasma never underestimates girls.

00:42:31.918 --> 00:42:34.633
Whenever boys tell them
that girls can't do this,

00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:36.791
girls can't play rugby,
girls can't do this,

00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:40.153
you just must sit them
down and tell them that,

00:42:41.122 --> 00:42:43.594
it is possible.

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.315
Kids: [Let's go!]

00:42:45.315 --> 00:42:49.435
(kids talking)

00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:54.088
When I was younger, I
was really picked on.

00:42:54.088 --> 00:42:55.840
Did you know that?

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.661
Lesocho: No.

00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:58.558
Fran: Yeah, when I was really young,

00:42:58.558 --> 00:43:01.786
when I was your age, I
was picked on by people,

00:43:01.786 --> 00:43:03.613
and people would talk to me that way,

00:43:03.613 --> 00:43:07.182
and they would make me
feel small and left out.

00:43:07.182 --> 00:43:10.961
And so I was like you,
I would cry sometimes,

00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:15.071
you know, by myself, because
it's very hurtful, you know?

00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:17.255
The president at my primary school,

00:43:17.255 --> 00:43:19.677
the president is Losecho,

00:43:20.246 --> 00:43:23.125
one of my girls, [Ketomehse],
who's another one

00:43:23.125 --> 00:43:25.827
of the girls that I am very close to,

00:43:25.827 --> 00:43:27.602
they're just having problems.

00:43:27.602 --> 00:43:30.157
I guess [Ketomehse] doesn't
want her to be friends

00:43:30.157 --> 00:43:33.835
with [Tomoho], so she just
always make Losecho feel bad.

00:43:33.835 --> 00:43:35.514
Whenever Losecho says something she like

00:43:35.514 --> 00:43:36.926
gives her a look.

00:43:36.926 --> 00:43:38.135
(Losecho crying)

00:43:38.135 --> 00:43:43.135
There you go, there you go,
you'll be okay, Losecho.

00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:45.884
I know it seems like a
very, very big deal now,

00:43:45.884 --> 00:43:47.848
and it's very scary but I promise,

00:43:47.848 --> 00:43:49.769
if you stay strong through this,

00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:50.540
(knocking on door)

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.190
when you're older you won't
even think about it anymore.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:55.384
It breaks my heart, it makes me so sad.

00:43:55.384 --> 00:43:58.157
I, it makes me really
sad whenever they cry,

00:43:58.157 --> 00:44:00.841
cause I remember how hard
that is to have people

00:44:00.841 --> 00:44:02.784
pick on you or just not fit in,

00:44:02.784 --> 00:44:04.591
or just be fighting with a friend.

00:44:04.591 --> 00:44:07.884
Or just, you know,
continue to be yourself,

00:44:07.884 --> 00:44:09.925
and don't let them make you feel small.

00:44:09.925 --> 00:44:11.801
Because Losecho, you're not small.

00:44:11.801 --> 00:44:14.574
Think about all the cool
stuff that you did today.

00:44:14.574 --> 00:44:16.334
You led this whole meeting, you know?

00:44:16.334 --> 00:44:18.642
By yourself. You're
president of the counsel,

00:44:18.642 --> 00:44:20.918
you're smart, so don't
let the way somebody

00:44:20.918 --> 00:44:23.227
treats you make you feel small, okay?

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:23.939
Losecho: Yes.

00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:26.833
Just let her have her space,
[Ketomehse] will come around.

00:44:26.833 --> 00:44:30.027
She'll grow, she's
still growing too, okay?

00:44:30.027 --> 00:44:30.945
Losecho: Okay.

00:44:30.945 --> 00:44:31.698
Fran: Alright?

00:44:31.698 --> 00:44:32.531
Losecho: Mm-hmm.

00:44:32.531 --> 00:44:33.452
Fran: You'll be okay?

00:44:33.452 --> 00:44:34.954
Thanks for calling me this holiday.

00:44:34.954 --> 00:44:36.362
(laughing)

00:44:36.362 --> 00:44:38.527
Losecho: Nobody is going to replace Olebie

00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:40.294
in my heart, nobody is.

00:44:40.294 --> 00:44:42.814
She tells us what's
right and what's wrong.

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:46.335
To me, she's like my
own mother but (laughs)

00:44:46.335 --> 00:44:51.335
not really my own, like
my second mother, yeah.

00:44:52.324 --> 00:44:56.776
(guitar music)

00:45:05.164 --> 00:45:06.118
I think it's harder to be a female

00:45:06.118 --> 00:45:07.854
Peace Corps volunteer
here than it is to be a

00:45:07.854 --> 00:45:10.504
male Peace Corps volunteer here.

00:45:10.504 --> 00:45:12.297
I think there's a lot of
restrictions placed on us

00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:15.101
because we're women
and a lot more dangers,

00:45:15.101 --> 00:45:16.274
like if you ever go anywhere,

00:45:16.274 --> 00:45:19.301
guys are always hustling
you, even in your village.

00:45:19.301 --> 00:45:22.214
Everyone is, you know, cat-calling you,

00:45:22.214 --> 00:45:24.597
but that happens everywhere in the world.

00:45:24.597 --> 00:45:27.394
But I think here it's just
there's that extra element

00:45:27.394 --> 00:45:29.301
of like, if I don't shut
this down immediately

00:45:29.301 --> 00:45:31.887
it might lead to something more.

00:45:31.887 --> 00:45:36.184
And then, he could rape
me, you know? (laughs)

00:45:36.184 --> 00:45:37.274
And that's just because
of all the statistics

00:45:37.274 --> 00:45:40.196
and people, PCV's who've
gotten raped and stuff.

00:45:40.672 --> 00:45:42.803
That's not even like a subconscious thing.

00:45:42.803 --> 00:45:44.842
I mean, every time you
hear about another one

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:48.004
of my friends like getting assaulted,

00:45:48.004 --> 00:45:50.566
I'm just like, you know,
every time I walk around,

00:45:50.566 --> 00:45:52.854
I'm like, you know, like really jumpy.

00:45:52.854 --> 00:45:54.902
I wasn't like that when I came here.

00:45:54.902 --> 00:45:59.744
(crowd talking)

00:46:01.897 --> 00:46:04.289
It's crazy when you're here for two years,

00:46:04.289 --> 00:46:08.276
and you can see like
another person's growth.

00:46:08.276 --> 00:46:10.018
I'm sure they look at me and they're like

00:46:10.018 --> 00:46:12.264
wow, she's changed a lot.

00:46:12.264 --> 00:46:15.614
Like when I first came
here, I was like woo!

00:46:15.614 --> 00:46:17.180
Cheers and doing dances with them,

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:19.203
and like playing games all the time.

00:46:19.203 --> 00:46:22.433
And really idealistic,
and I just wonder like

00:46:22.433 --> 00:46:24.244
if the kids have seen the change in terms

00:46:24.244 --> 00:46:26.089
of like me becoming more realistic.

00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:27.810
Put that under the table.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.291
(crowd talking)

00:46:29.291 --> 00:46:32.632
The balls here, put them
underneath the table.

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:38.266
I think there's so, I do think
there's a lot of potential here,

00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:41.402
for like volunteers to
really make a difference.

00:46:41.402 --> 00:46:43.462
The frustrating thing
about South Africa is

00:46:43.462 --> 00:46:47.561
there's money here and
there's so much potential,

00:46:47.561 --> 00:46:50.646
and there is a working
economy to a degree.

00:46:50.646 --> 00:46:55.090
But I think volunteers need
to know what's going on.

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:57.926
Like, I think they really
need to know beforehand

00:46:57.926 --> 00:47:01.927
what they're getting
themselves into I guess.

00:47:01.927 --> 00:47:06.927
I would tell them to be
ready for challenges,

00:47:07.347 --> 00:47:11.606
like mental challenges,
and I would tell them

00:47:11.606 --> 00:47:16.606
to be ready for people to
just expect you to do things.

00:47:17.812 --> 00:47:22.138
And to figure out how you
want to approach people

00:47:22.138 --> 00:47:24.207
who have that attitude towards you.

00:47:24.207 --> 00:47:27.166
And to know that just because
people aren't saying thank you

00:47:27.166 --> 00:47:30.494
it doesn't mean you shouldn't still help.

00:47:30.494 --> 00:47:31.499
That's what I would say.

00:47:31.499 --> 00:47:36.499
Cameraman: [Unintelligible]

00:47:41.214 --> 00:47:42.994
Fran: Very happy.

00:47:43.763 --> 00:47:47.919
(crowd talking)

00:47:47.919 --> 00:47:47.919
Fran: Go to start.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.003
(singing in native language and clapping)

00:48:19.158 --> 00:48:24.051
Ryan: I feel like it's a
very typical response to say,

00:48:24.051 --> 00:48:27.063
you know, I joined Peace
Corps to change the world.

00:48:27.063 --> 00:48:30.194
A main reason I wanted
to join Peace Corps was

00:48:30.194 --> 00:48:33.043
I wanted to be in a different culture,

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:36.023
because I wanted to try
and see things differently.

00:48:36.023 --> 00:48:37.465
That was one of the big motivations.

00:48:37.465 --> 00:48:39.129
I wanted to learn another language,

00:48:39.129 --> 00:48:43.364
I wanted to feel really uncomfortable.

00:48:43.364 --> 00:48:44.767
(people talking in native language)

00:48:44.767 --> 00:48:46.326
Ryan: Sing!

00:48:46.326 --> 00:48:48.398
(women speaking in native language)

00:48:48.398 --> 00:48:50.782
Ryan: They must sing!

00:48:50.782 --> 00:48:52.463
(Women speaking in native language)

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:54.034
Ryan: They must!

00:48:54.034 --> 00:48:57.281
(women speaking in native language)

00:48:59.656 --> 00:49:04.049
(singing and clapping)

00:49:17.564 --> 00:49:21.461
I think there's something so
beautiful and human and real

00:49:21.461 --> 00:49:24.111
about the Zulu's singing and dancing

00:49:24.111 --> 00:49:25.410
and the life behind that,

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.220
I would love to bring that back.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:30.326
I've been able to go
to a few ceremonies and

00:49:30.326 --> 00:49:33.295
participate in some really
wonderful activities

00:49:33.295 --> 00:49:35.041
with the dancing.

00:49:35.041 --> 00:49:36.738
(woman speaking in native language)

00:49:36.738 --> 00:49:38.826
Ryan: You must teach them.

00:49:38.826 --> 00:49:43.101
(singing and clapping)

00:49:45.239 --> 00:49:49.548
(laughing and clapping)

00:49:54.039 --> 00:49:56.424
Ryan: Thank you!

00:49:56.424 --> 00:49:59.859
(women laughing and talking)

00:50:03.886 --> 00:50:07.306
Weenen or Veenen is Africans
for the place of weeping.

00:50:07.306 --> 00:50:09.964
Officially it became a town in 1841,

00:50:09.964 --> 00:50:14.382
when the Africans came to this place

00:50:14.382 --> 00:50:19.382
after many women and
children were brutally killed

00:50:20.189 --> 00:50:24.976
by the Zulu's in an
agreement that went bad.

00:50:24.976 --> 00:50:28.561
So, they were weeping,
coming to this place.

00:50:28.561 --> 00:50:33.350
And started all different
kinds of farming in this area.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.652
It's really great farming land.

00:50:36.267 --> 00:50:38.446
But of course, there were
Zulu people living here.

00:50:38.446 --> 00:50:41.084
It's been said that, you
know, apartheid really

00:50:41.084 --> 00:50:43.125
was birthed in this area.

00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:46.056
So, there's just a lot of history,

00:50:46.056 --> 00:50:48.974
a lot of hatred in this place of weeping.

00:50:48.974 --> 00:50:51.109
But, you could drive through
Weenen and not really,

00:50:51.693 --> 00:50:54.204
you know, see a white person.

00:50:54.988 --> 00:50:57.581
I also, I guess I saw
my role here as bridging

00:50:57.581 --> 00:50:59.833
these two worlds.

00:51:01.874 --> 00:51:04.243
Baba: Some people, it's news to them,

00:51:04.243 --> 00:51:06.930
if you talk about HIV.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.002
For some yes, they understand,

00:51:10.002 --> 00:51:12.347
especially the elderly's.

00:51:12.347 --> 00:51:16.804
You see, they grown up
people, they say oh fuck,

00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:21.804
you are wasting your
time, I've got my wife,

00:51:22.222 --> 00:51:24.600
and I make so many kids.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.524
You come and tell me about HIV now?

00:51:27.524 --> 00:51:31.500
No, that's no sense, go to the youngsters.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.836
Ryan: So yesterday morning we
were in an area called Gunka.

00:51:34.836 --> 00:51:36.561
So I met with the InDuna there,

00:51:36.561 --> 00:51:39.264
to have a focus group meeting with him

00:51:39.264 --> 00:51:42.854
and some of the men who
attended our event in November.

00:51:42.854 --> 00:51:47.801
An event where the InDuna
trained men about HIV

00:51:47.801 --> 00:51:50.193
and Aids transmission,
prevention, condom use,

00:51:50.193 --> 00:51:54.012
HIV testing in medical
male circumcision mostly.

00:51:54.012 --> 00:51:59.012
Baba: You see, in our
culture, we always pin

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:06.580
the responsibility of
teaching the boys to the Baba

00:52:07.536 --> 00:52:12.536
When it comes to girls, we
feel that mother is going to,

00:52:13.918 --> 00:52:17.249
you know, bring the girls up.

00:52:17.249 --> 00:52:21.334
So it's like, I cannot, as a father,

00:52:21.334 --> 00:52:23.421
bring my daughter to come
and sit here and say,

00:52:23.421 --> 00:52:26.276
look my daughter, this
is how I want you to-

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.967
Ryan: Of course.

00:52:27.967 --> 00:52:30.384
Baba: No, it's impossible.

00:52:30.384 --> 00:52:31.764
Ryan: He seems like a natural born leader,

00:52:31.764 --> 00:52:34.903
and I just think that it's
fantastic that he has been

00:52:34.903 --> 00:52:36.880
chosen as an InDuna in the area.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.395
He can communicate well with
different types of people,

00:52:39.395 --> 00:52:42.440
and holds his authority
but not in a powerful way.

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:43.815
Where I've seen some other leaders

00:52:43.815 --> 00:52:45.077
get obsessed with the power.

00:52:45.077 --> 00:52:47.510
So I've been really
happy to work with him,

00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:51.565
with this HIV education and information,

00:52:51.565 --> 00:52:52.913
which can be a sensitive topic,

00:52:52.913 --> 00:52:54.500
especially as a young female talking to

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.282
an elder male about these things.

00:52:56.282 --> 00:52:58.130
You don't have to, if
you don't want to tell us

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.594
about testing or Mmc'ing, that's fine,

00:53:00.594 --> 00:53:05.153
but have you had any
conversations from that meeting

00:53:05.153 --> 00:53:08.807
maybe with your family or any other men,

00:53:08.807 --> 00:53:10.400
what have you done since that meeting

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.502
with the information you learned?

00:53:14.203 --> 00:53:18.889
(woman translating)

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.020
(man speaks in native language)

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.298
Translater: He says he
didn't say anything.

00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:29.658
Ryan: I think it's a really complicated

00:53:29.658 --> 00:53:31.130
and complex history.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:34.966
You have to understand
the history to understand

00:53:34.966 --> 00:53:37.804
how and why things are the way they are.

00:53:37.804 --> 00:53:40.208
For 50 years you had a government that had

00:53:40.208 --> 00:53:43.168
an education system that
was oppressing people.

00:53:43.168 --> 00:53:45.560
In this area in particular,

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.797
the Zulu's were evicted from their lands.

00:53:48.797 --> 00:53:51.234
They had their land, their
homes, and their livestock

00:53:51.234 --> 00:53:52.121
taken away from them.

00:53:52.121 --> 00:53:54.365
So you look at all these
things and you can understand,

00:53:54.365 --> 00:53:57.527
you begin to understand where
the people are coming from.

00:53:57.527 --> 00:54:00.401
Which I think, you need
to have understanding

00:54:00.401 --> 00:54:02.381
coming into these
communities and working here.

00:54:02.381 --> 00:54:03.359
You have to.

00:54:05.035 --> 00:54:07.214
So maybe you can talk
to one of the counselors

00:54:07.214 --> 00:54:08.379
and see if they'd be willing to do that.

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:09.417
Baba: Yeah, yeah.

00:54:09.417 --> 00:54:14.206
Ryan: Wonderful. Also, what
I wanted to say is that

00:54:14.206 --> 00:54:17.592
I'm leaving South Africa in a few weeks.

00:54:17.592 --> 00:54:18.325
Baba: Really?

00:54:18.325 --> 00:54:19.323
Ryan: I'm finished, yeah.

00:54:19.323 --> 00:54:20.025
Baba: Yeah?

00:54:20.025 --> 00:54:21.557
Ryan: I've been here for three years now.

00:54:21.557 --> 00:54:22.543
Baba: Oh.

00:54:22.543 --> 00:54:23.572
Ryan: but I'll miss,
I'll miss these things.

00:54:23.572 --> 00:54:25.419
Baba: It's been so nice working with you.

00:54:25.419 --> 00:54:25.969
Ryan: Mmm.

00:54:25.969 --> 00:54:27.045
Baba: Really.

00:54:27.448 --> 00:54:31.175
(engine chugging)

00:54:35.795 --> 00:54:37.634
Les: I'm Les.

00:54:38.404 --> 00:54:40.493
Hazel: And I'm Hazel.

00:54:41.186 --> 00:54:42.660
Les: And we're the Stanleys.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.409
(laughing)

00:54:44.409 --> 00:54:47.293
Ryan: I met Les and Hazel
Stanley after being here

00:54:47.293 --> 00:54:48.946
about four or five months.

00:54:48.946 --> 00:54:51.096
So they were doing some
outreach work in the community,

00:54:51.096 --> 00:54:54.630
doing English education
on a Friday afternoon.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:56.646
At their home, they
have a training center.

00:54:56.646 --> 00:54:58.866
And it was so amazing,
cause they've worked in

00:54:58.866 --> 00:55:00.394
KwaZulu-Natal their whole lives,

00:55:00.394 --> 00:55:02.527
they're South African,
they've worked in eduction

00:55:02.527 --> 00:55:03.916
in [imeril] areas their whole lives,

00:55:03.916 --> 00:55:06.613
so they shared a lot of
the same frustrations

00:55:06.613 --> 00:55:08.110
that I shared.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:11.321
Hazel: We went to friends for supper and

00:55:11.321 --> 00:55:13.537
they had told us that they had discovered

00:55:13.537 --> 00:55:18.134
this young, black girl living in Stenden.

00:55:18.134 --> 00:55:20.567
And, this I remember very clearly,

00:55:20.567 --> 00:55:24.247
meeting her and immediately thinking wow,

00:55:24.247 --> 00:55:26.093
she must have something very special.

00:55:26.093 --> 00:55:30.449
Especially in an area that just has this

00:55:30.449 --> 00:55:31.833
incredible history of hatred.

00:55:31.833 --> 00:55:35.567
And here's this young girl in Stenden.

00:55:35.567 --> 00:55:37.475
We were amazed.

00:55:37.475 --> 00:55:40.114
You know, for the people,
cause I believe that

00:55:40.114 --> 00:55:43.633
also brings healing amongst
even the white people here,

00:55:43.633 --> 00:55:45.501
when they see what she's done.

00:55:45.501 --> 00:55:47.118
People who wouldn't even drive,

00:55:47.118 --> 00:55:50.246
white people wouldn't drive into Stenden,

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:52.394
because, you know, you
don't drive in there,

00:55:52.394 --> 00:55:53.074
it's too dangerous.

00:55:53.074 --> 00:55:54.664
And there's this young girl living there,

00:55:54.664 --> 00:55:57.110
and suddenly people are going in there.

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.532
Because they're seeing, you
know, it's actually okay.

00:55:59.532 --> 00:56:01.807
these people are fine.

00:56:01.807 --> 00:56:06.544
(crowd talking)

00:56:15.061 --> 00:56:18.977
(woman speaking native language)

00:56:22.572 --> 00:56:25.381
Ryan: Okay, so let's pretend the water

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:27.923
is the male sex fluid, okay?

00:56:27.923 --> 00:56:29.977
And the male's HIV positive.

00:56:29.977 --> 00:56:32.105
If he's wearing a condom,

00:56:33.566 --> 00:56:37.888
the fluid goes into a little
pocket, into the condom.

00:56:37.888 --> 00:56:39.407
(woman speaking native language)

00:56:39.407 --> 00:56:42.807
Les: Whatever the vehicle
that is being used,

00:56:42.807 --> 00:56:45.434
whether it's HIV, whether
it's computer courses

00:56:45.434 --> 00:56:46.531
that they offer,

00:56:46.531 --> 00:56:49.490
the most important thing that she's given

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:53.462
many of the young folk here, is a hope.

00:56:53.462 --> 00:56:56.313
And she's, she's enabled
them, and she's actually

00:56:56.313 --> 00:57:00.543
empowered them to be catalysts for change.

00:57:00.543 --> 00:57:04.139
Ryan: So, exactly, you pinch
this so that no air can enter.

00:57:04.139 --> 00:57:07.275
(woman translating)

00:57:07.275 --> 00:57:09.887
Ryan: So follow me, okay?

00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:12.552
Okay?

00:57:12.552 --> 00:57:16.894
(kids talking and laughing)

00:57:17.465 --> 00:57:19.514
It's inside out, see?

00:57:20.812 --> 00:57:23.364
Okay, no very good, very good.

00:57:23.364 --> 00:57:25.646
Now, can he or someone else explain

00:57:25.646 --> 00:57:27.822
how does this protect you from HIV?

00:57:27.822 --> 00:57:29.913
[Kunjen], how?

00:57:30.037 --> 00:57:32.312
Les: I would just like to
say thank you to Peace Corps

00:57:32.312 --> 00:57:35.087
for what is being done in the country,

00:57:35.087 --> 00:57:40.087
and yeah, just a very
special thank you for Ryan.

00:57:40.145 --> 00:57:42.964
Hazel: Yeah. (laughs)

00:57:42.964 --> 00:57:46.937
Yeah, I just, Ryan is
just so special to us,

00:57:46.937 --> 00:57:51.317
and, yeah, she's been
like a daughter to us.

00:57:51.317 --> 00:57:54.920
And we're gonna miss her incredibly.

00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:00.720
(kids talking)

00:58:05.817 --> 00:58:07.794
Ryan: For so long we're here,

00:58:07.794 --> 00:58:10.931
and we feel like we're
not making any progress.

00:58:10.931 --> 00:58:12.439
We feel like we're not having any impact

00:58:12.439 --> 00:58:15.394
or influence over the
people we're working with.

00:58:15.394 --> 00:58:17.263
It's not often you get people that say,

00:58:17.263 --> 00:58:20.254
hey thanks for doing this,
or you helped me with this.

00:58:20.254 --> 00:58:21.002
And that's not why you do it,

00:58:21.002 --> 00:58:23.647
but every once in a while
you need that encouragement.

00:58:23.647 --> 00:58:27.307
So, even just the past few
weeks when I've started

00:58:27.307 --> 00:58:28.929
to tell people I'm leaving,

00:58:28.929 --> 00:58:31.271
and just to hear their reactions,

00:58:31.271 --> 00:58:35.419
or to see them feel saddened by it.

00:58:37.173 --> 00:58:38.991
It's comforting in some way,

00:58:38.991 --> 00:58:40.173
as strange as that might sound,

00:58:40.173 --> 00:58:41.602
because it kind of feels like oh,

00:58:41.602 --> 00:58:43.191
well you did know that I was here,

00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:45.393
you did recognize that
I was at least trying.

00:58:45.393 --> 00:58:47.862
I might not have done
everything that you wanted,

00:58:47.862 --> 00:58:50.781
but at least I really cared
and I tried really hard.

00:58:50.781 --> 00:58:53.418
So to finally feel like noticed I guess.

00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:55.873
It means a lot,

00:58:55.873 --> 00:58:58.652
because it's really hard to keep going

00:58:58.652 --> 00:59:01.095
when you feel like no one
even cares that you're here.

00:59:01.095 --> 00:59:03.062
And for awhile it feels like that.

00:59:03.062 --> 00:59:06.870
(kids clapping and talking)

00:59:13.798 --> 00:59:18.798
(kids singing and clapping)

00:59:29.993 --> 00:59:31.625
And I think you come in as a volunteer

00:59:31.625 --> 00:59:34.952
wanting to see these huge changes,

00:59:35.521 --> 00:59:39.642
but also knowing that sometimes
it's in the small things.

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:40.955
Those are where the miracles are.

00:59:40.955 --> 00:59:44.461
It's not this big idea that
we have of changing the world,

00:59:44.461 --> 00:59:46.166
it's starts with each and every one of us,

00:59:46.166 --> 00:59:49.230
and it's very small but
those are the big things.

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:53.187
So I think we have to also
change the way we view success.

00:59:53.187 --> 00:59:55.338
(clapping and talking)

00:59:55.338 --> 00:59:56.774
Ryan: (speaking native
language) Girls, get it.

00:59:56.774 --> 01:00:00.611
(singing and clapping)

01:00:12.803 --> 01:00:17.803
(guitar playing)

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:27.981
(people talking)

01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:31.266
(Veronica laughs)

01:00:31.653 --> 01:00:33.561
Veronica: There were a lot of
other volunteers in my cohort

01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:37.110
that started like months
and months ago packing up.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:40.166
And I started like not
that long ago. (laughs)

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:42.474
Like doing the bulk of it this week.

01:00:42.474 --> 01:00:43.776
So that's been just a hectic thing

01:00:43.776 --> 01:00:47.128
of sorting through things.

01:00:47.128 --> 01:00:49.882
Giving away like clothes
and things I didn't want.

01:00:49.882 --> 01:00:51.050
(laughs)

01:00:52.918 --> 01:00:53.849
Young girl: Veronica?

01:00:53.849 --> 01:00:55.388
Veronica: Yeah.

01:00:57.964 --> 01:00:59.125
(boy in t-shirt speaks in native language)

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:01.638
Veronica: Yeah. (speaks
in native language)

01:01:01.638 --> 01:01:03.500
(boy in t-shirt speaks in native language)

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.605
(girl in green speaks in native language)

01:01:05.605 --> 01:01:07.239
Veronica: No, in America.

01:01:07.239 --> 01:01:09.272
I think they realize I'm going,

01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:11.421
but they don't know I'm
not coming back. (laughs)

01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:13.502
No, cause even like adults in my family,

01:01:13.502 --> 01:01:16.271
or like neighbors, have
come up to me this week

01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:17.871
and just like oh, I didn't even realize

01:01:17.871 --> 01:01:20.974
that you would like ever leave type thing.

01:01:20.974 --> 01:01:22.654
And I was just like yeah. (laughs)

01:01:22.654 --> 01:01:26.223
(laughs) Remember me
from the farewell party.

01:01:26.223 --> 01:01:28.922
Woman in stripes: Okay,
thank you. It's nice.

01:01:28.922 --> 01:01:30.258
(Veronica laughs)

01:01:30.258 --> 01:01:32.435
Yeah, I remember you Veronica.

01:01:32.435 --> 01:01:34.620
Veronica: (laughs) Yeah.

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.487
Woman in stripes: But today, you go?

01:01:36.487 --> 01:01:37.624
Veronica: Yeah, yeah.

01:01:37.624 --> 01:01:42.624
And a lot of people, I know
this has been used to describe

01:01:43.293 --> 01:01:44.369
like other South Africans,

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:46.402
but I know a lot of people,
especially at my organization,

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:49.434
they're very stoic and not,

01:01:49.434 --> 01:01:52.006
they won't like break down and cry,

01:01:52.006 --> 01:01:53.971
like I didn't expect anyone to break down

01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:56.267
and cry or anything. (laughs)

01:01:56.267 --> 01:01:57.840
(Veronica laughs)

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.081
Woman in stripes: Don't go.

01:01:59.081 --> 01:02:00.931
Stay here.

01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:02.569
Veronica: (laughs) No, I have to go.

01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:05.580
I have to see my family and, yeah.

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.934
Woman in stripes: Giyan is boring you.

01:02:07.934 --> 01:02:10.873
Veronica: No, no, I like Giyan.

01:02:10.873 --> 01:02:13.603
Woman in stripes: You like
Giyan. You like to stay with us.

01:02:13.603 --> 01:02:16.164
Veronica: I'll try to.

01:02:16.164 --> 01:02:20.819
I definitely felt not
as emotional or like,

01:02:21.147 --> 01:02:23.764
yeah, I guess emotional
as other volunteers.

01:02:23.764 --> 01:02:25.540
So like, I'll talk to other people that,

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:26.994
other volunteers in my group,

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:29.493
and they're like very
sad and crying every day.

01:02:29.493 --> 01:02:32.786
And it's just like I cried
a little bit yesterday,

01:02:32.786 --> 01:02:35.820
but I don't know if it has hit me yet.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.314
And so like, yeah there are
times when I'm lying in bed,

01:02:39.314 --> 01:02:42.850
like, should I, I feel like a bad person

01:02:42.850 --> 01:02:46.028
because I'm not an emotional wreck.

01:02:47.412 --> 01:02:49.025
Veronica: Whoa!

01:02:49.025 --> 01:02:50.914
(girl in pink laughs)

01:02:50.914 --> 01:02:52.217
Girl in pink: Goodbye.

01:02:52.217 --> 01:02:54.929
Veronica: Goodbye, I'm gonna miss you.

01:02:57.481 --> 01:02:58.819
Veronica: Oh!

01:03:00.301 --> 01:03:01.984
Having the full two years of just like

01:03:01.984 --> 01:03:04.523
all the interactions, all the experiences,

01:03:05.107 --> 01:03:06.837
it's how it's changed me.

01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:09.598
And like I'm glad that
I just did the two years

01:03:09.598 --> 01:03:12.573
because of that and like
learned from my organization

01:03:12.573 --> 01:03:14.634
for the whole two years,

01:03:14.634 --> 01:03:16.815
and continued to work with them for this

01:03:16.815 --> 01:03:18.270
entire two years because I felt like

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:23.270
having that whole time
period was important to me.

01:03:26.031 --> 01:03:28.650
(rooster cawing)

01:03:36.818 --> 01:03:39.392
I don't know, I guess I
would describe coming back

01:03:39.392 --> 01:03:44.392
as kind of overwhelming and
underwhelming at the same time.

01:03:46.258 --> 01:03:48.131
I mean, cause there are like adjustments

01:03:48.131 --> 01:03:49.661
that you need to make and,

01:03:49.661 --> 01:03:53.607
just like getting used to
like how you lived before.

01:03:53.607 --> 01:03:57.249
And just like reconnecting
with friends and family.

01:03:58.033 --> 01:04:02.283
It's a big thing, but also
you realize that just like

01:04:03.652 --> 01:04:06.058
people have been here living their lives

01:04:06.058 --> 01:04:07.592
for those two years as well.

01:04:07.592 --> 01:04:10.149
So it's just like interesting
and weird to just like

01:04:10.149 --> 01:04:13.569
come back and see that
your friends have changed,

01:04:13.569 --> 01:04:16.658
and like oh yeah, they were
living for two years too.

01:04:16.658 --> 01:04:17.981
(laughs)

01:04:18.404 --> 01:04:19.506
I'm definitely glad to be back.

01:04:19.506 --> 01:04:23.802
I don't know if I'm
gonna miss South Africa.

01:04:23.802 --> 01:04:25.898
I definitely miss like the
people that I worked with

01:04:25.898 --> 01:04:28.189
and that I lived around in my village.

01:04:28.189 --> 01:04:29.587
And every now and then there are things

01:04:29.587 --> 01:04:31.580
that I miss of just like,

01:04:34.502 --> 01:04:36.964
actually like taxis for some reason,

01:04:36.964 --> 01:04:39.049
I kind of miss them. (laughs)

01:04:40.972 --> 01:04:43.008
Cameraman: How is it going?

01:04:43.853 --> 01:04:47.470
Veronica: It's alright,
stressful as well. (laughs)

01:04:47.470 --> 01:04:51.519
Just to not have your own space and, yeah.

01:04:51.519 --> 01:04:56.315
It's hard to be 20 living
with your parents. (laughs)

01:04:56.315 --> 01:04:57.777
In your 20's living with your parents.

01:04:57.777 --> 01:05:02.202
But, I mean, it's good to like be here

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:03.963
and just like also spend time with them

01:05:03.963 --> 01:05:06.121
since I've been gone, too.

01:05:06.121 --> 01:05:09.022
Veronica's mom: Veronica?
Get you some more. Veronica?

01:05:09.022 --> 01:05:09.878
Veronica: Yes?

01:05:09.878 --> 01:05:11.251
Veronica's mom: I'll get you some.

01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:14.542
Veronica: Okay. (laughs)

01:05:16.304 --> 01:05:20.775
(people talking)

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:26.060
(class reciting)

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.045
Class: How are you.

01:05:31.336 --> 01:05:33.089
Sean: Sounds good.

01:05:33.089 --> 01:05:36.103
As I continue to go through Peace Corps,

01:05:36.103 --> 01:05:38.378
I quickly started to realize that this is

01:05:38.378 --> 01:05:42.951
like purely dependent on the individual.

01:05:42.951 --> 01:05:45.387
And it's like a very
individual experience.

01:05:45.387 --> 01:05:49.165
You can let other volunteers
and other elements

01:05:49.165 --> 01:05:51.042
impact you, but at the end of the day,

01:05:51.042 --> 01:05:54.324
it's really a matter of you.

01:05:54.324 --> 01:05:58.278
And so, yeah, my opinion
changed from it being like this

01:05:58.278 --> 01:06:02.024
Americans abroad to like Sean abroad,

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:05.634
like Sean, the American abroad.

01:06:05.634 --> 01:06:07.113
So we're gonna read a story,

01:06:07.113 --> 01:06:09.091
and I want you guys to look for

01:06:09.091 --> 01:06:12.154
the uncountable nouns, okay?

01:06:12.154 --> 01:06:13.219
Winnie the Pooh went around to

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.542
his friend, Christopher Robin.

01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:17.820
I wonder if you got a balloon, he said.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.133
What do you want a balloon for?

01:06:20.133 --> 01:06:23.358
Do we see any uncountable nouns?

01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:26.331
Any countable or uncountable nouns?

01:06:26.332 --> 01:06:29.944
There's this perception about
Americans being aggressive,

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:32.247
and it's just in general not understanding

01:06:32.247 --> 01:06:34.324
the rest of the world.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:37.874
And I think that's reflected in our TV,

01:06:37.874 --> 01:06:39.204
it's reflected in our politics,

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:42.472
it's reflected in a lot of
elements of our culture.

01:06:42.472 --> 01:06:45.143
But I think if we have this
massive amount of people

01:06:45.143 --> 01:06:47.504
that got exposed to Peace Corps,

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.904
and they did in a good, strong manner,

01:06:50.904 --> 01:06:53.815
I think it would cause a general change

01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:57.133
in a lot of those layers of our culture.

01:06:57.133 --> 01:06:59.992
The change that happens
within the individuals

01:06:59.992 --> 01:07:04.034
is immeasurable for like, I don't know,

01:07:04.034 --> 01:07:07.375
just the benefit of, the
social benefit in the states.

01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:11.188
(water running)

01:07:16.514 --> 01:07:18.274
Kevin: I would maintain that even a bad

01:07:18.274 --> 01:07:23.037
Peace Corps volunteer is
still good for America.

01:07:23.037 --> 01:07:25.868
And I mean that by, even if
you have a volunteer that,

01:07:25.868 --> 01:07:28.444
let's say you had one that wasn't good,

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:31.126
that liked to party or he
didn't go to school as much.

01:07:31.126 --> 01:07:35.104
He's still a human being, he's seen as,

01:07:35.104 --> 01:07:38.114
they may look at him as,
you know, he wasn't helpful

01:07:38.114 --> 01:07:41.314
or this or that, but he's
not gonna be viewed as evil.

01:07:41.314 --> 01:07:43.969
To hate America, you kind of
have to demonize people, right?

01:07:43.969 --> 01:07:45.766
That's how bad things happen.

01:07:45.766 --> 01:07:47.818
So, it's be hard to demonize even the

01:07:47.818 --> 01:07:49.438
worst Peace Corps volunteer.

01:07:49.438 --> 01:07:50.632
You might say oh, they're silly,

01:07:50.632 --> 01:07:52.397
or they didn't do what
they were supposed to do.

01:07:52.397 --> 01:07:54.323
But we're not evil.

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:59.008
(kids talking and screaming)

01:08:06.126 --> 01:08:08.178
Fran: I'm really hoping
that one of my girls,

01:08:08.178 --> 01:08:12.199
like one day will be like
President of South Africa,

01:08:12.199 --> 01:08:15.124
and would be like, I had
a PCV who was a teacher,

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:18.425
you know, and she changed
my mind about my capacity.

01:08:18.425 --> 01:08:21.454
Alright, listen up, okay!

01:08:21.454 --> 01:08:26.044
Personally, I feel very fulfilled.

01:08:26.044 --> 01:08:27.172
I feel like I've grown,

01:08:27.172 --> 01:08:30.195
and these people have affected me hugely.

01:08:30.195 --> 01:08:35.164
And, in that I'm very
grateful for this opportunity.

01:08:35.164 --> 01:08:35.982
You have a lot today, eh?

01:08:35.982 --> 01:08:37.003
(woman in hat speaking native language)

01:08:37.003 --> 01:08:40.153
We have come into a
community where people,

01:08:40.153 --> 01:08:44.514
people didn't think that
America cared about them at all.

01:08:44.514 --> 01:08:47.094
And we have come and dedicated
two years of our lives

01:08:47.094 --> 01:08:50.905
to show that not only do we care

01:08:50.905 --> 01:08:52.980
about what's happening
with the rest of the world

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.820
and what's happening with
them on a personal level,

01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.883
but that we're just like them.

01:08:57.883 --> 01:08:59.426
But she makes it perfectly, eh?

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.314
I won't make it as good as her.

01:09:01.314 --> 01:09:03.956
Man in jacket: No, just
go to her and ask her.

01:09:03.956 --> 01:09:04.839
Fran: The recipe?

01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.898
Man in jacket: Yeah. Then
she'll write down for you.

01:09:06.898 --> 01:09:07.794
Fran: Mmm, mmm.

01:09:07.794 --> 01:09:09.548
Man in jacket: Then you'll
prepare it for yourself.

01:09:09.548 --> 01:09:10.474
Fran: Mmm.

01:09:10.474 --> 01:09:11.381
Man in jacket: You see?

01:09:11.381 --> 01:09:12.479
Then you'll start a business that side.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.160
(laughing)

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.898
Fran: I don't think
America's ready for this.

01:09:16.898 --> 01:09:18.579
That's why this is important.

01:09:18.579 --> 01:09:20.636
And it is, it is important, you know?

01:09:20.636 --> 01:09:23.127
And it is important even in the sense of

01:09:23.127 --> 01:09:26.954
the government wants us, wants
Peace Corps to be that branch

01:09:26.954 --> 01:09:28.418
that's like look, we
are helping the world,

01:09:28.418 --> 01:09:31.417
because America needs that image. (laughs)

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:34.029
We can't just be seen as
war mongers all the time,

01:09:34.029 --> 01:09:36.092
that's not gonna help us.

01:09:36.092 --> 01:09:39.749
(people talking)

01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:41.847
Ryan: As I said, it's hard
letting go of projects.

01:09:41.847 --> 01:09:43.945
It's been really hard
to come to terms with

01:09:43.945 --> 01:09:46.257
that I'm leaving here after three years.

01:09:46.257 --> 01:09:48.544
And that's something I'm
personally dealing with.

01:09:48.544 --> 01:09:52.594
But to know that there is
another volunteer coming,

01:09:52.594 --> 01:09:54.224
that's hopefully going to
pick up where I left off.

01:09:54.224 --> 01:09:55.724
(speaking native language)

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:56.661
Should we call?

01:09:56.661 --> 01:09:58.069
Woman with umbrella: Who is it?

01:09:58.069 --> 01:09:59.594
Ryan: [Makese, Mama Makese].

01:09:59.594 --> 01:10:00.921
Woman with umberella: Makese.

01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:02.590
Ryan: I guess.

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:03.984
Woman with umbrella: Hello?

01:10:03.984 --> 01:10:05.176
Ryan: This is an amazing place.

01:10:05.176 --> 01:10:07.826
It's been challenging beyond belief,

01:10:07.826 --> 01:10:09.332
but it's a beautiful place,

01:10:09.332 --> 01:10:10.964
the people are so welcoming.

01:10:10.964 --> 01:10:14.829
So I think the volunteer
will do wonderful things.

01:10:14.829 --> 01:10:17.233
And I can't wait to see what happens.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:25.216
I think maybe Monday,
maybe by three or four,

01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:27.188
if you want to come with me here,

01:10:28.156 --> 01:10:30.925
I have some books for the volunteer,

01:10:30.925 --> 01:10:34.594
and I just want to make sure
everything's set up nicely

01:10:34.594 --> 01:10:36.080
so when she comes Tuesday it's okay.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.048
Learning about the relationships

01:10:39.048 --> 01:10:41.207
has been a big part of this experience,

01:10:41.207 --> 01:10:44.270
and how people are
really all that we have.

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:45.472
I mean, we get so caught up in so many

01:10:45.472 --> 01:10:49.896
other worldly things that we forget that.

01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:52.773
(speaking native language)
I want to give books.

01:10:52.773 --> 01:10:53.916
Mama Makese: Yeah.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:54.768
Ryan: To make it-

01:10:54.768 --> 01:10:56.221
Mama Makese: Oh finish and make it nice.

01:10:56.221 --> 01:10:57.793
Ryan: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:57.793 --> 01:10:59.979
I think we make things more complicated

01:10:59.979 --> 01:11:03.284
then they are, in America.

01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:07.950
And there's an obsession of
our time being so valuable,

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:12.316
but I question what are
we doing with our time.

01:11:12.316 --> 01:11:13.391
If you're not using your extra time

01:11:13.391 --> 01:11:16.172
to really spend it with
the people you care about,

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:19.282
or to add real depth
and value to your life,

01:11:19.282 --> 01:11:21.438
is it a good thing?

01:11:25.631 --> 01:11:28.294
George: Oh, gosh, I was just
looking this up yesterday,

01:11:28.294 --> 01:11:29.343
I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of at,

01:11:29.343 --> 01:11:31.305
they call it peaks and valleys,

01:11:31.305 --> 01:11:32.641
that's what they call it.

01:11:32.641 --> 01:11:35.106
And the Peace Corps
staff, the medical staff,

01:11:35.106 --> 01:11:36.650
actually gives you like this graph.

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:38.553
There's this graph and it's all about

01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:41.376
your ups and your downs
during your service,

01:11:41.376 --> 01:11:43.805
and it's really accurate. (laughs)

01:11:43.805 --> 01:11:47.546
And right now I'm kind of
in a down turn, currently.

01:11:48.577 --> 01:11:49.883
I don't really know what it is,

01:11:49.883 --> 01:11:51.060
I don't know why Peace
Corps does it to you.

01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:53.239
I think because maybe you
don't have any control

01:11:53.239 --> 01:11:55.344
sometimes when you're in Peace Corps,

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:58.271
and that can be really
difficult for some people.

01:11:58.271 --> 01:12:03.271
And you know, mentally, gosh,
I teach a lot of classes,

01:12:03.434 --> 01:12:06.165
and so I'm in front of a class, you know,

01:12:06.165 --> 01:12:07.934
four out of six periods of the day,

01:12:07.934 --> 01:12:09.943
and sometimes after school,

01:12:09.943 --> 01:12:11.960
and sometimes on the weekends,

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.048
so it gets kind of tiring.

01:12:14.048 --> 01:12:16.834
And emotionally it's like I said,

01:12:16.834 --> 01:12:19.766
the rug gets pulled out from
under you a lot more here,

01:12:19.766 --> 01:12:23.114
or a lot more during your
service then you'd expect.

01:12:23.114 --> 01:12:24.794
But you just gotta deal with it,

01:12:24.794 --> 01:12:26.151
gotta roll with it. (laughs)

01:12:26.151 --> 01:12:27.113
That's the only way you're gonna make it,

01:12:27.113 --> 01:12:29.629
getting a laugh like I am now. (laughs)

01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:30.987
Aye, aye, aye.

01:12:30.987 --> 01:12:34.011
On sour cream walls, donations.

01:12:34.826 --> 01:12:38.864
Shakespeare's head, cloudless at dawn.

01:12:38.864 --> 01:12:43.356
It sounds awful, but you
can't be too empathetic.

01:12:43.356 --> 01:12:46.212
Like, there really are some students,

01:12:46.212 --> 01:12:47.645
and I'm sure it's the
same way in the states,

01:12:47.645 --> 01:12:50.845
they're just not gonna listen to you.

01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:54.180
And, it's really sad, you try your best,

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.067
and I have tried my best,

01:12:56.067 --> 01:13:00.337
but if they don't come to school
I'm not sure what I can do.

01:13:00.337 --> 01:13:02.574
This map becomes their window

01:13:02.574 --> 01:13:07.168
and these windows that shut
upon their lives like catacombs.

01:13:07.168 --> 01:13:12.168
Break open, break open
until they break the town.

01:13:12.231 --> 01:13:15.645
And show the children green fields,

01:13:15.645 --> 01:13:19.618
and make their world
run azure on gold sands,

01:13:19.618 --> 01:13:23.250
and let their tongues
run naked into books.

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:26.373
The white and green leaves open.

01:13:26.373 --> 01:13:30.487
History is their's who's
language is the sun.

01:13:30.487 --> 01:13:33.198
Oh gosh, I love that, I love
that grade 12 poetry class.

01:13:33.198 --> 01:13:36.206
Yeah so, once a week,
usually on Thursdays,

01:13:36.206 --> 01:13:38.215
I'll meet with some of
the grade 12 students

01:13:38.215 --> 01:13:40.814
who are gonna be taking their
exam at the end of the year.

01:13:40.814 --> 01:13:45.414
I really enjoy it, and I think
it keeps me a little sane, maybe?

01:13:45.414 --> 01:13:46.634
What do you think that means,

01:13:46.634 --> 01:13:47.465
to be like paper?

01:13:48.234 --> 01:13:49.854
Student: To be thin.

01:13:49.854 --> 01:13:53.407
George: Yeah, exactly!
Exactly, the paper is thin.

01:13:53.407 --> 01:13:58.018
So this boy is like paper,
you can just rip it.

01:13:58.018 --> 01:14:00.389
He's so, he's so thin.

01:14:00.389 --> 01:14:02.370
(students talking)

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:04.386
I don't know, maybe I'm a science person.

01:14:04.386 --> 01:14:07.767
Like, you know, like I
want to see statistics.

01:14:07.767 --> 01:14:09.248
That's also what PC wants to see, too,

01:14:09.248 --> 01:14:10.644
they want to see statistics.

01:14:10.644 --> 01:14:12.392
You know, you reach x amount of youth,

01:14:12.392 --> 01:14:15.774
the passing level went from here to here,

01:14:17.112 --> 01:14:21.460
that's not really what
I think is important.

01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.256
Like I think it's
important to make friends

01:14:23.256 --> 01:14:25.506
and to have people remember you.

01:14:25.506 --> 01:14:28.077
What you're doing is you're
not so much building something,

01:14:28.077 --> 01:14:31.110
you're building relationships with people.

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:35.766
And that's really what Peace
Corps South Africa is about.

01:14:35.766 --> 01:14:37.394
Building relationships with people,

01:14:37.394 --> 01:14:41.460
and hopefully gradually making a change.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.779
None of these, none of them are good.

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:47.417
But then, now tell me about
[deliverer] number four.

01:14:48.601 --> 01:14:51.505
Girl in pink: He's just muttering things.

01:14:51.505 --> 01:14:56.194
Not even concentrating
on what is happening.

01:14:56.194 --> 01:14:57.323
Like, he's not even there.

01:14:57.323 --> 01:14:58.392
George: Yeah, that's right.

01:14:58.392 --> 01:15:01.885
It says that his eyes live in a dream,

01:15:01.885 --> 01:15:04.807
a squirrels dream in a tree root.

01:15:04.807 --> 01:15:06.355
So, maybe he's sitting there,

01:15:06.355 --> 01:15:08.213
but he's looking out the window.

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:12.925
But the other thing is that
it says he's sweet and young.

01:15:13.371 --> 01:15:15.991
Which means that all these
other children [there],

01:15:15.991 --> 01:15:18.354
they are broken.

01:15:18.354 --> 01:15:21.983
But this one, he's
still, he's still strong,

01:15:21.983 --> 01:15:24.244
but he's still looking outside.

01:15:24.244 --> 01:15:25.089
The rest of these children are broken.

01:15:25.089 --> 01:15:27.876
He's, maybe you can help him.

01:15:27.876 --> 01:15:29.835
So that's why I said is there any mention

01:15:29.835 --> 01:15:32.014
of hope on question one.

01:15:32.014 --> 01:15:34.141
And I think this boy, maybe he has hope.

01:15:34.141 --> 01:15:37.774
(kids talking)

01:15:39.064 --> 01:15:42.661
(clapping and singing)
