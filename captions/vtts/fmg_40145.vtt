00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.900
THE AMAZON RIVER IS AN
EXTRAORDINARY FORCE OF NATURE.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.760
STRETCHING OVER
6,500 KILOMETERS

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300
ACROSS THE SOUTH
AMERICAN CONTINENT,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.260
IT FEEDS THE LARGEST
TROPICAL RAINFOREST ON EARTH.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.500
ITS WATERS CONTAIN A
GREATER VARIETY OF FISH

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.160
THAN THE ENTIRE
ATLANTIC OCEAN.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.600
NOT ONLY IS THIS THE
RICHEST RIVER ON EARTH,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.230
IT IS ALSO
THE MIGHTIEST.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.460
UP TO 100 METERS DEEP
AND 40 KILOMETERS WIDE,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.630
IT CARRIES MORE WATER
THAN ANY RIVER IN THE WORLD.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.460
THIS PRECIOUS RESOURCE
HAS NEVER BEEN TAMED BY MAN.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.630
FROM SOURCE TO SEA, NOT A SINGLE
BRIDGE CROSSES ITS WATERS,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.100
NOT A SINGLE DAM
HOLDS ITS FLOW.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.300
BUT WHILE THE RIVER
CANNOT BE CONTROLLED,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.830
IT COULD BE
DESTROYED.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.100
TODAY, COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT IS KILLING

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.360
THE WILDERNESS WHICH
PROTECTS THE AMAZON

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.330
AND ITS FUTURE
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.960
THE CRUCIAL QUESTION NOW IS,
HOW LONG CAN THIS GREAT RIVER

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.060
CONTINUE
TO RUN WILD?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.930
THE AMAZON RIVER HAS
IMMENSE POWER OVER

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.100
EVERYTHING THAT LIVES
NEAR ITS WATERS.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.260
THOUGH IT FLOWS THROUGH ONE
OF THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.260
ON EARTH, SEVEN MILLION
PEOPLE HAVE MADE THEIR HOME

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.100
ON THE RIVER BANKS.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.860
FROM ISOLATED VILLAGE
TO BUSTLING METROPOLIS,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.760
NONE OF THOSE
WHO LIVE NEAR IT

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.300
CAN CONTROL THE
FORCE OF THE AMAZON...

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.800
THEY HAVE SIMPLY ADAPTED TO A
LIFE DETERMINED BY THE RIVER.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.200
THE POWER OF ITS WATERS AND THE
REMOTE LANDSCAPE THROUGH WHICH

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.660
IT TRAVELS HAVE FOR CENTURIES
PROTECTED THE AMAZON FROM MAN.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.460
UNTIL RECENTLY, THIS
RAINFOREST WAS BELIEVED TO BE

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.560
ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST
STABLE ENVIRONMENTS.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.860
BUT AGGRESSIVE COMMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT IS DESTROYING THE

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.500
JUNGLE AND THE PROTECTION IT
OFFERS IS BEING STRIPPED AWAY.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.300
TODAY, THE DELICATE
ECO-BALANCE OF THE REGION

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.260
IS BEING PUSHED TO THE
POINT OF NO RETURN.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.930
THE AMAZON RIVER, ITS
WILDLIFE AND ITS PEOPLE

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.300
ARE VULNERABLE
AS NEVER BEFORE.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.560
FROM ITS PERUVIAN HEADWATERS
TO ITS BRAZILIAN DELTA,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.060
THE AMAZON RIVER CUTS
ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.300
ITS RIVER BASIN, THE
LARGEST IN THE WORLD,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.060
IS RIDDLED WITH A
THOUSAND TRIBUTARIES

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.960
ALL FLOWING TOWARD THE MAIN
ARTERY OF THE AMAZON ITSELF.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.960
WHILE ITS GLACIAL SOURCE LIES
HIGH IN THE ANDEAN MOUNTAINS

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.630
OF PERU, THE AMAZON
STORY PROPER BEGINS HERE,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.760
OVER 1,800 KILOMETERS
DOWNSTREAM,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.700
WHERE THE UCAYALI AND
MARANON RIVERS MEET.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.360
ONLY AT THIS CONFLUENCE IN
THE PERUVIAN RAINFOREST

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.100
DOES THE RIVER TAKE
ON THE NAME "AMAZON".

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.900
A FEW KILOMETERS DOWNSTREAM,
MARISCAL CASTILLA

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.360
IS ONE OF THE FIRST
VILLAGES ON THE AMAZON.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.800
THE PERUVIAN NAME FOR
THESE VILLAGES IS RIBERENOS,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.630
LITERALLY MEANING
"RIVER PEOPLE".

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.630
OF SPANISH AND INDIAN DESCENT,
THE RIBERENOS ARE NOT

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.900
INDIGENOUS TO THE
RAINFOREST BUT HAVE

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.300
ADAPTED TO LIVE AT THE WATERS'
EDGE AND DEVELOPED AN

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.400
INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.530
COPING WITH THE SHIFTING WATERS
IS PART AND PARCEL OF LIFE HERE,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:40.330
PARTICULARLY DURING THE
RIVER'S SEASONAL FLOODS.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.960
IN THE WET SEASON, INCREASED
RAINFALL OVER THE FORESTS

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.560
DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE
AMOUNT OF WATER IN THE RIVER.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.400
IN A TYPICAL FLOOD, LEVELS
RISE BY UP TO 20 METERS

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.730
AND THE AREA COVERED
BY THE RIVER TRIPLES.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.460
AT THIS TIME, THE AMAZON CARRIES
SO MUCH EXTRA WATER THAT THE

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.730
SOUTH AMERICAN CONTINENT
SINKS SEVERAL CENTIMETERS

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.600
UNDER THE WEIGHT AND RISES
AGAIN AS THE WATERS RECEDE.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.000
IT IS THIS IMMENSE
FLUCTUATION IN FLOW

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.160
WHICH MAKES THE AMAZON
IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.100
AND SO THE RIBERENOS HAVE NO
CHOICE BUT TO ADOPT A LIFESTYLE

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.430
WHICH ACCOMMODATES THE
RIVER'S EXTREME FLOODS.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.860
THEIR HOUSES ARE DESIGNED
FOR THIS PURPOSE,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.430
BUILT ON STILTS TO ALLOW
FLOOD WATER TO FLOW BENEATH.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.930
BUT THIS ISN'T ALWAYS
ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM SAFE...

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.900
FOR NOT ONLY DOES THE AMAZON
FLOOD, IT CHANGES COURSE

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.960
SO DRAMATICALLY THAT A VILLAGE
COULD SUDDENLY FIND ITSELF

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.000
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE
NEW RIVER CHANNEL.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.460
MARIA PITZANGO HAS LIVED IN
MARISCAL CASTILLA ALL HER LIFE.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.000
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS SHE
HAS HAD TO REBUILD HER HOME

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.630
SEVERAL TIMES TO AVOID
THE ROAMING WATERS.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.060
TRANSLATOR: THE RIVER STARTED
TO ERODE THE RIVER BANK.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.260
BEFORE THIS PLATFORM
WAS WASHED AWAY

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.330
I ORDERED A NEW HOUSE
TO BE BUILT OVER THERE.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.360
I HAD TO MOVE THERE
BEFORE MY HOUSE DISAPPEARED

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.800
WITH THE RIVER BANK.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.030
>>THE HUGE VOLUME OF WATER IN
THE AMAZON MEANS IT CAN EASILY

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.530
CHANGE ITS COURSE THROUGH THE
FLAT TERRAIN AND SOFT SOILS.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.300
WHEN THE RIVER MOVES
THE PEOPLE HAVE NO CHOICE

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.800
BUT TO MOVE WITH IT.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.230
YET, THE RIBERENOS LIVE HERE
NOT DESPITE BUT BECAUSE OF

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.200
THE RIVER'S EVER
SHIFTING FLOOD PATTERNS.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.460
FOR IT IS THIS WHICH
MAKES THE RIVERBANKS,

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.430
OR VARZEA, AS
THEY ARE KNOWN,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.300
THE RICHEST TRACTS OF LAND
IN THE WHOLE RAINFOREST.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.230
TRANSLATOR: HERE
I'VE GOT THE TOMATOES,

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.100
THE CHICLAYO AND THE
POTATOES WHICH WE EAT.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.500
AND HERE ARE
THE CUCUMBERS.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.500
WE ALSO GROW
YUCCA FOR FOOD.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.260
>>THE MAGIC INGREDIENT WHICH
MAKES THIS LAND SO FERTILE

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.700
IS SILT WASHED DOWN FROM
THE ANDES MOUNTAINS

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:42.530
SUSPENDED IN THE MURKY
BROWN WATERS OF THE RIVER.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.200
WHEN THE AMAZON FLOODS, THIS
MINERAL RICH SILT IS DISTRIBUTED

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:52.830
OVER THE EARTH, RENDERING THE
GROUND REMARKABLY PRODUCTIVE.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.100
THESE VARZEA FLOOD
PLAINS CAN SUPPORT

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:01.560
CONTINUOUS AGRICULTURE,
ALBEIT ON A SMALL SCALE.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.800
TRANSLATOR: THIS YEAR THE
RIVER HAS REPLENISHED THE MUD

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.860
AND THAT'S WHY MY
RICE IS OVER THERE.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.930
LAST YEAR THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN
AND MY RICE FAILED TO GROW.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.300
THIS TIME THERE
WAS MORE MUD.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.830
IT CAME UP TO HERE
TO IRRIGATE THE RICE.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.900
>>TO MAINTAIN THE FERTILITY OF
THE SOIL, THE RIBERENOS ONLY

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.730
CLEAR SMALL PATCHES OF
LAND AT A TIME AND GROW MANY

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.460
DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF
CROPS IN THE SAME AREA.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:43.500
AS WELL AS PROVIDING FERTILE
SOIL, THE RIVER ALSO PROVIDES

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.960
FISH TO EAT AND THE LOCALS
HAVE DEVELOPED UNIQUE WAYS

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.600
OF CATCHING THEM.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.800
THESE MEN ARE COLLECTING
LEAVES FROM THE HUACA PLANT

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.660
FOR FISHING.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:06.760
FIRST THE HUACA LEAVES ARE
CRUSHED TO RELEASE THEIR JUICES.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.130
NEXT, THE CRUSHED LEAVES
ARE TRANSFERRED TO A BASKET

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.600
AND DIPPED SEVERAL
TIMES IN ONE OF THE MANY

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:20.060
RIVER POOLS NEAR
MARISCAL CASTILLA VILLAGE.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.530
AS THE HUACA POISON IS
RELEASED, IT DEPLETES

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.230
THE OXYGEN IN THE WATER,
MAKING THE FISH DROWSY

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.560
AND FORCING THEM TO
THE SURFACE FOR AIR.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.900
ONCE THEY ARE WITHIN REACH
OF THE RIBERENOS' SPEARS,

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.360
THEY ARE EASY PREY.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.460
TO SURVIVE ON THE RIVER BANK,
THE RIBERENOS HAVE COME TO

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.260
DEVELOP A DEEP UNDERSTANDING
OF THE RIVER AND TO ACCEPT

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.460
THAT IT HOLDS ABSOLUTE
POWER OVER THEIR DESTINY.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.430
BUT SUBSISTENCE FARMING IS A
PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE AND AN

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.200
INCREASING NUMBER OF RIBERENOS
ARE LEAVING THE SECLUSION

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.830
OF THEIR VARZEA VILLAGES
IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.800
MANY END UP HERE, 125
KILOMETERS DOWNSTREAM

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.330
IN THE CITY OF IQUITOS,
THE JUNGLE METROPOLIS.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.700
PERCHED AT THE JUNCTION
WHERE THE AMAZON MEETS

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:32.830
TWO MAJOR TRIBUTARIES,
IQUITOS HAS 400,000 RESIDENTS.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.200
TODAY, SOME 70% OF THE
POPULATION OF THE AMAZON BASIN

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.460
LIVES IN CITIES
LIKE THESE.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:44.660
EVEN IN THE JUNGLE, URBANIZATION
IS A GROWING TREND.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.430
SURROUNDED BY WATER AND
RAINFOREST, IQUITOS IS THE

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.160
LARGEST CITY IN THE WORLD
THAT CAN'T BE REACHED BY ROAD.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:59.600
TRAVEL WITHIN THE CITY
IS MOSTLY BY RICKSHAW.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:05.230
TRAVEL TO AND FROM THE
CITY IS BY PLANE AND BOAT.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:11.230
EVEN THOUGH IT IS OVER 3,700
KILOMETERS FROM THE SEA,

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.000
IQUITOS IS SAVED
FROM TOTAL ISOLATION

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.100
BY THE WATER HIGHWAY
THAT IS THE AMAZON RIVER.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.530
THIS WATERWAY PROVIDES
THE CITY WITH A PRECIOUS

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.430
COMMERCIAL LINK TO
THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.400
BUT THIS LINK
COMES AT A PRICE.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.430
AT JUST 106 METERS ABOVE SEA
LEVEL, THE RESIDENTS OF IQUITOS

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.860
HAVE NO MEANS OF CONTROLLING
THE WATERS WHICH SURROUND THEM.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:43.600
LIFE HERE IS LIVED AT
THE MERCY OF THE RIVER.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.030
THE SUBURB OF BELEN
IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:53.460
DURING THE WET SEASON BELEN
COULD ONLY BE REACHED BY BOAT.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.930
MANY OF THE HOUSES
HERE ARE BUILT TO FLOAT

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.560
ON THE
RISING WATERS.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:03.300
HOUSES THAT DON'T FLOAT ARE
DESIGNED TO BE FLOODED.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.660
FAMILIES WHO LIVE IN THESE
TWO-STORY HOMES MOVE THEIR

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.630
POSSESSIONS TO THE UPPER
LEVELS DURING THE WET SEASON,

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:14.060
ALLOWING THE GROUND FLOOR
TO BE SWALLOWED UP BY WATER.

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.430
WHEN THE FLOODS
HAVE RECEDED

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.660
THE FAMILY CLAIM BACK
THAT HALF OF THEIR HOME

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:26.830
ONLY TO GIVE IT OVER TO
THE RIVER AGAIN NEXT YEAR.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:31.860
MOST OF THE 40,000 PEOPLE
IN BELEN LIVE IN POVERTY.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.060
MANY ARE MIGRANTS WHO HAVE
LEFT REMOTE RIVER SETTLEMENTS

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.930
IN SEARCH OF A
BETTER LIFE IN THE CITY.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.030
BUT WITH HIGH
UNEMPLOYMENT

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.260
AND WITHOUT LAND TO
GROW THEIR OWN FOOD,

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.430
THEY STRUGGLE TO
FEED THEIR FAMILIES,

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.600
LIVING IN CRAMPED HOUSING
WITH NO ELECTRICITY

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.430
AND NO
RUNNING WATER.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.130
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS,
THE DAMP AND HUMID

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.430
ATMOSPHERE OF THE
AMAZON TAKES ITS TOLL.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:04.500
MALARIA AND RESPIRATORY
DISEASES ARE COMMONPLACE.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.130
WHEN PEOPLE BECOME ILL
THEIR FIRST PORT OF CALL

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.800
IS PASAJE PAQUITO,
OR MEDICINE LANE.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:17.130
LOCATED IN A PART OF BELEN
WHICH DOESN'T FLOOD,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.560
THIS MARKET STREET
SELLS NOTHING BUT

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.330
LOCAL PLANT AND
ANIMAL REMEDIES.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.230

I'VE GOT IPURU.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:40.500
IT'S COMMON IN THIS
AREA OF THE AMAZON.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.930
THIS GROWS NEAR THE RIVER
AND THE SURROUNDING AREA.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:52.330
IT'S GOOD FOR COLDS AND
IMPOTENCE, FOR MEN ESPECIALLY.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.830
THE ACHIOTE ALSO
GROWS BY THE RIVER.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.030
YOU TAKE IT IN TEA FOR
PROSTATE PROBLEMS

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:04.400
AND TO REDUCE
INFLAMMATION.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.660
>>IT'S NOT JUST THE LOCALS WHO
RECOGNIZE THE HEALTH BENEFITS

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.760
OF THE LOCAL PRODUCE.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.630
A QUARTER OF ALL PHARMACEUTICAL
DRUGS ARE DERIVED FROM

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.600
PLANTS WHICH ONLY GROW IN
THE DELICATE ECOSYSTEM

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.500
SUPPORTED BY
THE AMAZON RIVER.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.030
BUT UNREFINED REMEDIES ARE NO
MATCH FOR THE KILLER DISEASES

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.800
WHICH BLIGHT THE
RESIDENTS OF BELEN.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.160
WHEN LOCAL MEDICINES
HAVE FAILED,

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.960
THEIR ONLY HOPE IS A
CHARITY-RUN MEDICAL CENTER.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.600
RONALD GONZALEZ IS A DOCTOR WHO
WORKS AT THIS DROP-IN CLINIC

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.600
FOR THE POOREST
RESIDENTS OF BELEN.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.860
THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE PATIENTS
THAN HE HAS TIME TO SEE.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.000
THIS CHILD IS
FIVE YEARS OLD.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.860
HE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO
THE CLINIC BY HIS MOTHER

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.830
WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT
HIS PERSISTENT COUGH.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.630
DR. GONZALEZ BELIEVES
THAT THE CHILD'S CONDITION

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:15.000
IS DIRECTLY CAUSED BY
LIVING NEAR THE RIVER.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.660
TRANSLATOR: THE CHILD
HAS A CHEST COMPLAINT.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.730
HE'S GOT ACUTE BRONCHIAL
OBSTRUCTION SYNDROME.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:28.460
ASTHMA, IN SHORT, AND SO
HE WILL BE GIVEN TREATMENT.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.960
THIS ACUTE BRONCHIAL OBSTRUCTION
SYNDROME IS MORE VIRULENT

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.230
WHEN CHILDREN LIVE IN VERY
HUMID AREAS SUCH AS HERE,

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.630
CLOSE TO THE RIVER.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.360
EXCESSIVE HUMIDITY IN
THE MORNING AND AT NIGHT

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.160
CLOSES THE BRONCHI SO
THAT HE CAN'T BREATHE EASILY.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:51.500
HE COUGHS A LOT
AND CAN'T SLEEP.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:55.460
>>BUT PERHAPS THE GREATEST
DANGER TO PEOPLES' HEALTH

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.500
IS NOT THE AIR BUT
THE WATER ITSELF

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:04.160
AS THE RIVER IN IQUITOS IS
INCREASINGLY POLLUTED.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.100
IN THESE SHANTY TOWNS
THERE IS NO SEWER SYSTEM

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.360
TO DEAL WITH THE
WASTE PRODUCED.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:15.100
LATRINES EMPTY INTO
THE RIVER CANALS.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.660
DURING THE DRY SEASON PEOPLE
WALK THE PLANK ALONG THE WOODEN

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:24.600
PATHWAYS TO AVOID THE HUMAN
EXCREMENT WHICH FLOWS BENEATH.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.800
DURING THE FLOODS, THE WASTE
GETS CARRIED BY THE RIVER

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.700
INTO PEOPLES' HOUSES.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.860
WHAT'S MORE, THE POOREST
RESIDENTS OF IQUITOS

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.560
HAVE NO PIPED
DRINKING SUPPLY.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.730
THEY'RE FORCED TO USE THE
UNTREATED RIVER OR RAINWATER

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.600
FOR THEIR DAILY USE -
TO DISASTROUS EFFECT.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:51.360
CHILD MORTALITY RATES IN
BELEN ARE SHOCKINGLY HIGH.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.600
TRANSLATOR: INTESTINAL
INFECTIONS LIKE DYSENTERY

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.300
AND NON-DYSENTERY DIARRHEA
ARE CAUSED MAINLY BECAUSE

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.060
PEOPLE HAVE NO ACCESS
TO CLEAN WATER TO DRINK.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.800
BACTERIAL, VIRAL AND
GASTROINTESTINAL INFECTIONS

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.230
ARE VERY COMMON HERE.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.100
>>IT'S IRONIC THAT THOUGH THE
AMAZON CARRIES MORE FRESH WATER

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.230
THAN THE COMBINED CAPACITY OF
THE NEXT EIGHT LARGEST RIVERS

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.760
ON EARTH, PEOPLE
WHO LIVE ON ITS BANKS

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.200
DON'T HAVE CLEAN
WATER TO DRINK.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.960
YET THE RIVER ITSELF
IS LARGELY TO BLAME

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.130
FOR THE AMAZON FLOODS AND
CHANGES COURSE SO DRAMATICALLY

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.700
IT CAN'T BE RELIED UPON TO
PROVIDE A PIPED WATER SUPPLY.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.200
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,
THE RIVER HAS MOVED AWAY

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.260
FROM THE CENTER
OF IQUITOS.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.400
WHAT WAS DEEP WATER ONE YEAR
BECAME DRY RIVER BED THE NEXT.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:57.860
BUT WHERE HUMANS STRUGGLE TO
COPE, NATURE HAS NO PROBLEM.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:04.430
AS IT LEAVES IQUITOS, FLOWING
FROM PERU INTO BRAZIL,

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:08.230
THE AMAZON RUNS MORE OR
LESS PARALLEL WITH THE EQUATOR

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.900
WHERE THE EARTH RECEIVES
MAXIMUM ENERGY FROM THE SUN.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.930
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS
WILDLIFE THRIVES

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.200
IN MANY
SPECIALIZED FORMS.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.230
THE AMAZON'S FLOODING
CREATES A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:44.230
TO WHICH NATURE ADAPTS IN
THE MOST REMARKABLE WAY.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.130
THE FLOODED FORESTS
ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.200
THESE WATER-LOGGED JUNGLES
OCCUPY SWATHS OF LAND

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:55.160
UP TO 20 KILOMETERS
EITHER SIDE OF THE RIVER.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.830
DURING THE WET SEASON, THE SOIL
IN WHICH THESE PLANTS GROW

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.300
IS UNDERWATER.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.900
THE SMALLER TREES ARE
COMPLETELY SUBMERGED.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.900
TO SURVIVE, THEY GROW
ROOTS UP TO 20 METERS LONG,

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.060
ANCHORING THEMSELVES AGAINST
THE FORCE OF THE FLOODS.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.760
SOME TREES EVEN GROW NEW
ROOTS, REACHING DOWN FROM

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:19.600
THEIR BRANCHES TO ABSORB
NUTRIENTS FROM THE WATER.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.700
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE
WILDLIFE OF THE AMAZON

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.930
JUST SCRATCHES
THE SURFACE.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.260
THE AREA COVERED BY THE RIVER
BASIN IS SO VAST THAT THERE ARE

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.260
STILL TRIBUTARIES WHICH HAVE YET
TO BE EXPLORED AND THOUSANDS

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.200
OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS
WHICH ARE UN-CATALOGUED.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.730
SCIENTISTS ARE CONTINUALLY
WORKING TO UNDERSTAND

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:48.830
THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX
ECOSYSTEM OF THIS REGION.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:53.030
ONE OF THE AMAZON'S MANY
WILDLIFE RESEARCH PROJECTS

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.760
IS BASED HERE, AT
THE PIRANHA RESERVE

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.530
IN THE MIDDLE REACHES
OF THE AMAZON.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.800
WORKING FROM A
FLOATING LABORATORY,

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.660
MARIA SOARES IS DIRECTOR
OF THE OPERATION.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.730
TRANSLATOR: WE MEASURE
AND WEIGH THE FISH.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.860
FIRST WE WEIGH IT, THEN WE
MEASURE IT AND REMOVE THE

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.430
STOMACH SO WE HAVE AN IDEA
WHAT ITS FEEDING HABITS ARE.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.030
THIS INFORMATION IS VERY
IMPORTANT AS THE MAIN AIM

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.830
OF THE PROJECT IS TO
COMPILE AND TO COMPARE DATA.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.560
THE PIRANHA RESERVE IS HOME
TO A HUGE VARIETY OF FISH

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.230
PERFECTLY ADAPTED TO LIVING
IN THIS UNDERWATER JUNGLE.

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:44.260
TRANSLATOR: DURING THE FLOOD
SEASON LOTS OF TREES PRODUCE

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.700
VARIOUS TYPES OF FRUIT WHICH
PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT SOURCE

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.500
OF NOURISHMENT FOR THE
MANY SPECIES OF FISH.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.760
HERE, FOR EXAMPLE,
IS A TEROUMA FRUIT

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.060
IN THE STOMACH
OF A SARDINE.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:01.360
IT'S A LONG SARDINE, A
SPECIES OF THE CLUPEIDAE

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.830
AND IT'S A SMART FISH
FOR EATING TEROUMA.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.430
TEROUMA IS A
VERY TASTY FRUIT.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.100
EVEN PEOPLE
CAN EAT IT.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:20.130
IT'S SWEET AND TASTY AND THE
TREE ITSELF IS ALSO BEAUTIFUL.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:25.930
>>IN THIS SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
THE TREES ALSO BENEFIT AS THE

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.860
FISH DISTRIBUTE THEIR FRUIT
SEEDS IN THEIR DROPPINGS.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:36.030
THE FISH SUPPORTED BY THE RIVER
ARE A CRUCIAL FOOD SOURCE

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:42.230
FOR THE RIBERENOS WHO
LIVE ON PIRANHA RESERVE.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.600
IN RETURN FOR PROTECTED
FISHING RIGHTS, THEY SHARE

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.800
THEIR LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
WITH THE RESEARCHERS,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.260
HELPING THEM TRACK
THE MIGRATORY PATHS

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.230
OF FISH AND IDENTIFYING
NEW SPECIES.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.660
IT'S PRICELESS INFORMATION IN
A PLACE WHERE ONLY A FRACTION

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:10.530
OF THE WILDLIFE HAS BEEN
SCIENTIFICALLY DOCUMENTED.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:14.130
TRANSLATOR: IN THE AMAZON

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.830
2,000 MUSEUM
CATALOGUED SPECIES.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.900
BUT WE CAN CONSERVATIVELY
ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.900
IN FACT SOME
3,000 SPECIES.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.900
WHY IS THIS A
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE?

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.000
BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL A LOT
OF NARROW RIVER CHANNELS

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.430
AND RIVER POOLS THAT
HAVE NOT YET BEEN SURVEYED.

NEW SPECIES OF FISH EVERY YEAR.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.530

RIBERENOS BOTH EXPLOIT AND

THERE IS ONE ANIMAL,
HOWEVER, THAT THE RIBERENOS

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.300
DARE NOT HUNT, THE
LEGENDARY BOTO DOLPHIN.

UP TO THREE METERS LONG
AND WEIGHING SOME 90 KILOS,

THE BOTO VARY IN COLOR
FROM GRAY TO PINK.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.160

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.860
OFTEN THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE VULNERABLE.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.130
>>THOUGH THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE
TO WALK ON LAND, THESE DOLPHINS

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:53.560
HAVE EVOLVED PERFECTLY
TO SUIT THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.260
PRACTICALLY BLIND, SINCE
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SEE IN THE

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:59.660
MURKY WATERS, THEY HUNT THEIR
PREY WITH SONAR DETECTORS

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.760
AND HAVE A FLEXIBLE
BACKBONE TO WEAVE THEIR WAY

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.300
THROUGH UNDERWATER
VEGETATION.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:11.500
THE AMAZON DOLPHINS ARE NOT THE
ONLY RIVER DOLPHINS IN THE WORLD

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.030
BUT THEY ARE ONE OF THE FEW
TYPES THAT ARE THRIVING,

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.860
PROTECTED BY THE
UNTAMED RIVER.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.430
IN THE REMOTE PIRANHA RESERVE,
THE BOTO AND THE FISHERMEN

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:27.800
HAVE DEVELOPED
AN UNDERSTANDING.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.230
BUT ELSEWHERE ON THE AMAZON,
COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:38.600
IS PLACING ANIMALS AND
HUMANS IN DIRECT CONFLICT.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.460
SOME 4,000 KILOMETERS
DOWNSTREAM OF ITS SOURCE,

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:48.300
THE AMAZON APPROACHES ITS
LARGEST TRIBUTARY CONFLUENCE.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.730
HERE THE DARK AND CLEAR
WATERS OF THE RIO NEGRO

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.730
JOIN THE MUDDY
FLOW OF THE AMAZON.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.860
FOR ELEVEN KILOMETERS THE
BLACK AND BROWN WATERS

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.160
FLOW SIDE BY SIDE
BEFORE FINALLY MINGLING

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.600
TO CREATE THE LARGEST
RIVER IN THE WORLD.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.830
OVER EIGHT KILOMETERS
WIDE AND 100 METERS DEEP,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.030
AT THIS POINT THE AMAZON
IS A TRADE SUPERHIGHWAY

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.130
ALONG WHICH PRODUCTS
CAN BE EXPORTED FROM

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:21.230
THE HEART OF THE
RAINFOREST DIRECTLY TO SEA.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:23.660
UPSTREAM OF
THE CONFLUENCE,

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.500
THE CITY OF MANAUS IS
PERFECTLY POSITIONED

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:31.700
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
RIVER'S COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.730
TODAY MANAUS IS A TRADING
POINT FOR ALL KINDS OF CARGO.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.760
IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY,
HOWEVER, RUBBER WAS THE

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.860
KEY COMMODITY TO BE EXPORTED
THROUGH THESE DOCKS.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.230
TAPPED FROM THE RAINFOREST,
THE RUBBER WAS SHIPPED DOWN

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:52.860
THE AMAZON FROM MANAUS
TO ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.160
IN THOSE DAYS MANAUS WAS KNOWN
AS THE "PARIS OF THE TROPICS".

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.530
THE RUINED OLD BUILDINGS IN THE
CITY CENTER ARE A REMINDER OF

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:07.830
THE IMMENSE WEALTH WHICH
RUBBER ONCE BROUGHT.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.230
BUT THE GLORY DAYS
WERE SHORT LIVED.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.560
IN LESS THAN 30 YEARS THE
AMAZON RUBBER INDUSTRY

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.160
WENT BUST AS RIVAL
PLANTATIONS OPENED IN ASIA

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.860
AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER
BECAME AVAILABLE.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:28.230
TO HELP MANAUS REINVENT ITSELF,
THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.100
HAVE DECLARED IT
A DUTY FREE ZONE.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.230
CONSIGNMENTS IN AND OUT
OF THE CITY ARE TAX EXEMPT,

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:40.060
ENCOURAGING INTERNATIONAL
INVESTORS TO SET UP HERE.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.930
TODAY, BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS WORTH OF GOODS

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:48.330
ENTER AND LEAVE
MANAUS EVERY YEAR.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.230
THIS COMMERCE
ATTRACTS THOUSANDS

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.430
OF NEW MIGRANTS
TO THE CITY,

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.600
ALL HOPING TO SHARE IN THE
WEALTH WHICH THE RIVER BRINGS.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.630
TO ACCOMMODATE THE
GROWTH, MANAUS' CITY LIMITS

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.800
ARE EXPANDING
FURTHER AND FURTHER

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.000
INTO THE SURROUNDING
RAINFOREST,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:17.000
ENCROACHING ON THE
WILDERNESS AND ITS WILDLIFE.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.360
ONE OF THE MOST COMMON
ANIMALS HERE ARE CAYMANS,

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:25.360
CROCODILIAN REPTILES
UNIQUE TO THE AMAZON.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.500
IN THE 1980'S CAYMANS WERE
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.560
BUT A PROJECT
TO SAVE THEM

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.260
HAS LED TO AN EXPLOSION
IN THEIR NUMBERS.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.430
SOME BELIEVE SEVERAL
MILLION CAYMANS NOW LIVE

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.630
ALONG THE AMAZON,
OUTNUMBERING AND

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:47.330
POSING A REAL DANGER TO
THE HUMAN POPULATION.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:54.430
FOR THOSE WHO MAKE A LIVING ON
THE WATER, THE RISKS ARE DEADLY.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.460
ALDOSAMIR CARDOSA IS A
FISHERMAN WHO WAS ATTACKED

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.030
BY A CAYMAN A
FEW YEARS AGO.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:06.300
TRANSLATOR: AS I WAS REMOVING
THE FISH AND SORTING THEM OUT

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.530
I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO
THIS SIDE AND THE CAYMAN

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.600
JUMPED ABOUT A METER
HIGH STRAIGHT AT ME.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.430
HE WAS AIMING FOR MY HEAD AND
SO I SAW THAT IT WAS AN ANIMAL.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:23.530
I WAS ABLE TO MOVE MY HEAD
THIS WAY AND THREW UP MY ARM.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.630
IT GRABBED MY ARM
AND FLOODED THE BOAT.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:33.330
IT WAS HEAVY AND
FIVE METERS LONG

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:40.060
AND IT STARTED
TO DRAG ME AWAY.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.760
>>IN THE 20 MINUTE
STRUGGLE THAT FOLLOWED

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.460
THE CAYMAN TRIED TO DRAG
ALDOSAMIR UNDER WATER

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.000
BY HIS ARM.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.400
TRANSLATOR: IT
BROKE IN FOUR PARTS.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.600
THIS JOINT WAS
SEVERED HERE.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.800
THIS FINGER
WAS SEVERED.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.230
IT WAS ONLY
ATTACHED HERE.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.460
>>ONLY BY PLAYING DEAD
DID ALDOSAMIR GET AWAY

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.060
WITH HIS LIFE.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.360
BUT IT'S NOT JUST FISHERMEN
WHO ARE NOW AT RISK...

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.000
FOR AS THE NUMBER OF CAYMANS
INCREASE AND AS MANAUS EXPANDS,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.900
ANIMALS AND HUMANS
COMPETE FOR LIVING SPACE.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.430
THE NARROW RIVER CANALS WHICH
FLOW THROUGH MANAUS' SUBURBS

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.630
ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:32.060
HERE, THE CAYMANS THRIVE
AMONG THE URBAN WASTE.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.760
BUT MANY PEOPLE ALSO
LIVE NEXT TO THE CANALS.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:42.530
IT'S A SITUATION WHICH IS
BOUND TO LEAD TO CONFLICT.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.500
CYNTIA MARTEZ OWNS A
RESTAURANT WHICH BACKS ONTO

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.000
ONE OF THE MANY
RIVER CANALS.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.530
SHE ARRIVED AT WORK
ONE MORNING TO FIND A

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:55.160
SURPRISE VISITOR
WAITING FOR HER.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.930
TRANSLATOR: WHEN I ARRIVED AT
THE GATE THERE WAS A CAIMAN

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.930
ABOUT THREE
METERS LONG.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:06.230
I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED
BECAUSE, IMAGINE, A CAYMAN.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:09.700
I WAS VERY SCARED SO I
CALLED THE PEOPLE AT WORK

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.830
AND LIVE HERE TOO AND WE
WENT OVER THERE TO THE GATE

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:18.160
WITH A ROPE AND PUT
IT AROUND ITS MOUTH.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.300
>>CYNTIA HAD TO TRY AND DRAG
THE CAYMAN BACK TO THE CANAL

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.260
FROM WHICH IT
HAD EMERGED.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.360
TRANSLATOR: IT HAD
RAINED A LOT THAT NIGHT.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.300
I THINK THE RIVER CANAL
FILLED UP AND IT CLIMBED OUT

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.460
AND WE HAD TO BUILD A WALL
SO THAT WE COULD FEEL SAFER.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:41.060
>>BUT DEALING WITH THE LOCAL
WILDLIFE IS JUST ONE OF

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.800
THE CHALLENGES OF
URBAN DEVELOPMENT.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.330
FOR AS ITS ECONOMIC
REVIVAL CONTINUES,

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:52.800
MANAUS' ELECTRICITY
NEEDS ARE ALSO INCREASING.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:57.030
ONE OF THE GREATEST POTENTIAL
POWER SOURCES IN THE

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:02.600
ENTIRE AMAZON REGION
IS THE RIVER ITSELF.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:08.100
IT'S A FORCE THAT DEVELOPERS
WOULD LOVE TO HARNESS,

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:11.230
PARTICULARLY IN BRAZIL, WHERE
80% OF ALL THE COUNTRY'S

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:15.600
ELECTRICITY IS CREATED
BY HYDRO POWER.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.400
SO FAR THE AMAZON
HAS NOT BEEN DAMMED.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.000
IT'S TOO BIG TO CONTROL
AND WITH A GRADIENT OF

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.730
LESS THAN 100 METERS
OVER MOST OF ITS COURSE,

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.500
IT'S JUST TOO SLOW TO
PRODUCE ELECTRICITY.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.230
BUT MANY OF THE
HUNDREDS OF TRIBUTARIES

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:35.760
WHICH JOIN THE AMAZON
HAVE MUCH FASTER CURRENTS

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.530
AND IT'S THESE ARTERIES
WHICH ARE BEING CLAMPED

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:44.300
IN THE RACE TO
PRODUCE HYDRO POWER.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.400
SOME 150 KILOMETERS
EAST OF MANAUS ON THE

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.500
UATUMA TRIBUTARY OF THE
AMAZON IS BALBINA DAM.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:58.630
TODAY THE LAKE FORMED BY THE DAM
LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND TRANQUIL

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.860
BUT IN THE 1980'S WHEN IT WAS
BUILT IT CAUSED SO MUCH

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.700
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THE
BALBINA WAS DUBBED ONE OF THE

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:09.660
GREATEST ERRORS EVER
COMMITTED IN THE AMAZON.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.000
ITS STORY SOUNDS A TERRIBLE
WARNING OF THE DANGERS OF

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.530
DAMMING A RIVER IN
THE RAINFOREST.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.630
BEFORE IT WAS BUILT THE
DEVELOPERS CLAIMED THAT

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.800
BALBINA WOULD FLOOD SOME
2,360 SQUARE KILOMETERS OF

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.560
RAINFOREST TO PRODUCE 250
MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY,

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.530
MOST OF WHICH WOULD
BE FED TO MANAUS.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.130
FROM THE OUTSET,
ENVIRONMENTALISTS WERE

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.500
CRITICAL OF HOW MUCH
JUNGLE WOULD BE LOST

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.500
TO PRODUCE SUCH MODEST
AMOUNTS OF POWER.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.630
WHAT'S MORE, MANY
INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.630
LIVED IN THE AREA WHICH
WAS TO BE FLOODED.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.730
THEIR HOMES AND LIVELIHOODS
WOULD BE DESTROYED

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.100
WHEN THE WATERS ROSE.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.300
AS OPPOSITION
REACHED FEVER PITCH

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.030
THE AUTHORITIES DECIDED TO END
THE DEBATE WITHOUT WARNING,

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.660
CLOSING THE FLOOD
GATES 30 DAYS EARLY.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:10.230
THE EFFECTS
WERE CATASTROPHIC.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.960
THE ENGINEERS GROSSLY
UNDERESTIMATED THE AREA

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.160
WHICH WOULD
BE SUBMERGED.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.200
WHEN THE FLOOD GATES
CLOSED, THE WATER SPREAD OUT

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.430
EVERYWHERE OVER
THE FLAT LANDSCAPE.

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:32.460

FLED FOR THEIR LIVES.

WHO WITNESSED
THE CARNAGE.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.460
TRANSLATOR: MOST OF THE
ANIMALS THAT WERE KILLED

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.130
AT THAT TIME
WERE MONKEYS.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:49.660
THE MONKEYS DIED
BECAUSE IN THIS LARGE AREA,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:56.460
AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE
WEREN'T MANY ISLANDS LEFT.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.230
>>AS HE WATCHED TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS DROWN,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.100
ELIDIO JOINED A DESPERATE
MISSION TO RESCUE

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.800
AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.460
TRANSLATOR: WE WENT OUT
TO COLLECT THE ANIMALS,

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:16.730
TO MOVE THEM TO THE
HIGHER LAND TO SAVE THEM.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:20.800
WE COULD ONLY
SAVE A FEW.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.730
MANY MORE DIED MAINLY BECAUSE
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH BOATS

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:30.760
TO COLLECT ALL
THE ANIMALS.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:37.430
>>NOT ONLY WAS THE HABITAT
DESTROYED, SO TOO WAS THE WATER.

FOR IN THE HASTE
TO FILL THE DAM,

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.060
THE AREA HAD NOT BEEN
CLEARED OF JUNGLE.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:46.260
AS THE TREES ROTTED DOWN,
THE RESERVOIR BECAME

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.830
SLICK WITH SCUM,
KILLING THE FISH

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.860
AND POISONING THE
LOCAL DRINKING SUPPLY.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.630
TRANSLATOR: THE WATER WAS
SO BAD WE COULDN'T DRINK IT

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:01.760
SO THE COMPANY PROVIDED
SOME WATER WELLS

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.200
BUT THEY WEREN'T
PROPER WELLS.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:12.160
IT WAS JUST A GESTURE TO
KEEP THE PEOPLE HAPPY.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.260
>>AS THE WATER PUMPS ALSO
BEGAN TO DRAW TOXIC WATER,

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.700
THE RESIDENTS OF OLD
BALBINA WERE RELOCATED

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.930
TO A PURPOSE-BUILT
VILLAGE ON HIGHER LAND.

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.760
HERE THEY REMAIN TODAY,
SURROUNDED BY MODERN

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:34.060
AMENITIES BUT DEPRIVED OF
THEIR TRADITIONAL WAY OF LIFE.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:41.160
IN THE NEW BALBINA UNEMPLOYMENT
AND ALCOHOLISM ARE HIGH.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.830
DESPITE THE LESSONS OF
BALBINA THERE ARE MANY

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.600
MORE DAMS PLANNED
FOR THE AMAZON BASIN

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:52.630
AS SOUTH AMERICA'S
ENERGY DEMANDS INCREASE.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:56.730
BUT IN RECENT YEARS THE REGION
HAS SEEN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:05.430
CLIMATE WHICH THREATEN TO PUT A
HALT TO ALL HYDRO POWER PLANS.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.000
DOWNSTREAM OF MANAUS WHERE
THE RIO NEGRO AND AMAZON MEET,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.030
CATALAO IS ONE OF THE MANY LAKES
FORMED BY THE ROAMING WATERS.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:20.530
THOUGH THEY HAVE NO RUNNING
WATER OR ELECTRICITY,

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.730
THE COMMUNITY WHICH
LIVES HERE ARE USED TO

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.530
COPING WITH LIFE
ON THE RIVER.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:33.230
EVERY HOUSE IN THE VILLAGE
IS DESIGNED TO FLOAT.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:42.000
EVEN THE BUILDERS
HERE WORK ON WATER.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.730
BUT IN 2005 LIFE CHANGED
IN A WAY THESE VILLAGERS

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:53.330
COULD NEVER
HAVE IMAGINED.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:58.030
IN THE SUMMER OF THAT YEAR THE
AMAZON SUFFERED THE WORST

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:03.230
DROUGHT ON RECORD,
WREAKING HAVOC IN THE REGION.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:08.460
ON LAKE CATALAO, THE
RESIDENTS FOUND THEMSELVES

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.330
TOTALLY ISOLATED.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:19.730
RAMUNDA VIANA REMEMBERS THE
EFFECT IT HAD ON THE COMMUNITY.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:26.130
TRANSLATOR: FOR US THE
SITUATION WAS A DISASTER.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.260
THERE WAS A LOT OF HUNGER
BECAUSE THE FISH DIED.

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.460
THE FLOATING HOUSES WERE
STRANDED, THERE WAS NO WATER

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.460
AND WE HAD TO WALK
TO GET TO THE RIVER.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.800
WE HAD TO CARRY
WATER ON OUR HEADS

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.660
AND BRING IT BACK FOR
WASHING AND DRINKING.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:45.930
>> THE VILLAGERS
BECAME DESPERATE

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:51.360
AS THE SHRINKING WATERS
FILLED WITH DYING FISH.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.300
WHEN THEIR FOOD AND WATER
SUPPLY WAS DWINDLED TO NOTHING,

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.760
THE PEOPLE CONGREGATED
EVERY DAY AT THE CHURCH

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:03.660
TO PRAY FOR AN END
TO THEIR SUFFERING.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:08.030
TRANSLATOR: SO WE BEGGED GOD TO
SEND RAIN AND WHEN THE RAIN CAME

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.960
PEOPLE WOULD BE BY THE
GUTTER COLLECTING THE WATER

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.600
IN LITTLE BOWLS FROM THE GUTTER
JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DRINK

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:22.130
AND TO AVOID CARRYING
THE WATER IN THE HOT SUN.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:26.130
>>THE SITUATION WAS THE
SAME ALL OVER THE AMAZON.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.000
RIVER WATERS RECEDED SO FAR
THAT BOATS BECAME STRANDED.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.400
THERE WERE EVEN STORIES
OF FISH BEING COOKED ALIVE

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:37.660
IN THE HEAT OF THE
SHALLOW WATERS.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.560
AS THE RIVER DRIED UP,
THE JUNGLE SUFFERED TOO.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.330
TRANSFORMED FROM WET
SPONGE TO TINDER BOX,

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.300
AN AREA MORE THAN 1,000
KILOMETERS SQUARE

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.960
WAS LOST TO
FOREST FIRES.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.260
THE SMOKE PROLONGED
THE CRISIS, INHIBITING THE

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.300
FORMATION OF CLOUDS AND
MAKING THE DROUGHT WORSE.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.330
WHEN THEIR PRAYERS WERE
ANSWERED AND THE RAINS

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.160
EVENTUALLY ARRIVED, THE
PEOPLE OF THE AMAZON

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:18.500
ASSUMED THE DROUGHT OF 2005
WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EVENT.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.600
BUT A YEAR LATER THE
DROUGHTS RETURNED.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.530
AS A PATTERN EMERGES, SCIENTISTS
ARE BEGINNING TO QUESTION

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:33.800
WHY THIS RIVER IS SUFFERING
SUCH UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:40.660
MANY BLAME DEFORESTATION FOR
THE INCREASING DROUGHTS.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:47.000
TREES ARE THE WATER TOWERS OF
THE AMAZON, DRAWING MOISTURE

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.900
FROM THE GROUND AND RELEASING
IT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.660
UNTIL IT EVENTUALLY
FALLS AGAIN AS RAIN.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.600
BUT AN AREA OF JUNGLE THE
SIZE OF SIX FOOTBALL PITCHES

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.660
IS CUT DOWN EVERY MINUTE,
DESTROYING THE WATER CYCLE

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.200
WHICH IS THE LIFELINE
OF THIS REGION.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.260
WHAT'S MORE, THE BURNING OF
FORESTS IS INCREASING GLOBAL

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.760
WARMING AND THE LIKELIHOOD
OF FURTHER DROUGHTS.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.630
FOR THOUGH THE TREES OF THE
AMAZON PRODUCE MORE THAN 20%

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.630
OF THE OXYGEN ON EARTH,
DEFORESTATION FIRES ARE NOW

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:25.930
RESPONSIBLE FOR A QUARTER OF
ALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:32.260
FOR THE RIVER THE CRISIS
IS EVEN MORE IMMEDIATE

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:40.400
AS MOST OF ITS WATER
COMES FROM PRECIPITATION.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.900
WITHOUT RAIN
FROM THE RAINFOREST,

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.800
THE AMAZON AS WE KNOW
IT WOULD CEASE TO EXIST.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.660
AND THE FURTHER THE RIVER
CONTINUES ON ITS EASTWARD

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.500
COURSE, THE GREATER
THE THREAT BECOMES.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.330
TWO HUNDRED KILOMETERS
DOWN STREAM OF MANAUS

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:09.300
IS THE CITY
OF SANTAREM.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:14.060
POSITIONED AT THE CONFLUENCE OF
THE TAPAJOS AND AMAZON RIVERS

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.030
AND FED BY THOUSANDS OF
KILOMETERS OF JUNGLE HIGHWAY,

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.460
SANTAREM IS A VITAL
EXPORT TERMINAL

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:22.460
FOR RAINFOREST
PRODUCTS.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.560
FROM THE CITY DOCKS IT'S A
STRAIGHT 1,300 KILOMETERS

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.460
ALONG THE AMAZON
RIVER TO SEA.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:34.360
OF ALL THE CARGO PROCESSED HERE
THE MOST PROFITABLE IS SOYA.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:37.560
SHIPS LADEN WITH SOYA
BEANS SAIL FROM SANTAREM

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.860
DIRECTLY TO EUROPE
AND THE UNITED STATES

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.960
WHERE THE SOYA IS
USED TO FEED ANIMALS

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:47.730
DESTINED FOR THE SUPERMARKET
AND FAST FOOD CHAINS.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:51.630
BUT THIS SEEMINGLY INERT
CARGO POSES A DEADLY THREAT

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.700
TO THE AMAZON
AND TO THE PEOPLE.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:59.760
FOR SOYA IS NOW THE MAIN
ENGINE OF DEFORESTATION

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.500
IN THE WHOLE REGION.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:07.860
1,200,000 ACRES OF PRIME
RAINFOREST HAVE BEEN

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:13.300
CUT DOWN TO MAKE
WAY FOR THE CROP.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.700
MUCH OF THE JUNGLE
BEING CLEARED IS HOME TO

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:20.230
INDIGENOUS TRIBES AND
TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES.

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.930
BUT THE MASSIVE PROFITS TO
BE MADE MEAN THAT SOME

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.730
DEVELOPERS WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO GET THEIR HANDS ON NEW LAND.

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:35.560
THOSE WHO STAND IN THEIR WAY
RISK BEING GUNNED DOWN.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.900
IT'S A FACT WHICH MARIA DOS
SANTOS KNOWS ONLY TOO WELL.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.130
AS PRESIDENT OF
THE WORKERS UNION,

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:45.300
SHE HAS RECEIVED
SEVERAL DEATH THREATS

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.500
FOR DEFENDING THE
RIGHTS OF LOCAL FARMERS

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.860
AGAINST THE
SOYA MAGNATES.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.860
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS
SHE'S BEEN PROTECTED BY

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.000
24-HOUR ARMED GUARD.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.630
TRANSLATOR: WHAT MOVES ME
IS KNOWING THAT PEOPLE ARE

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.000
SLOWLY GETTING
THEIR RIGHTS.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.200
IT'S ABOUT
FACING, FIGHTING.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.100
MAYBE IT WOULDN'T
BE DANGEROUS

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.760
IF WE DIDN'T WANT TO FACE
THE ENEMY, BUT WE DECIDED

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:12.930
THIS WAS THE APPROACH
THE UNION WOULD TAKE.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.630
>>SOYA IS A RELATIVELY
NEW THREAT TO THE AMAZON.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.160
THE BIGGEST CAUSE OF
DEFORESTATION USED TO BE

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:23.530
LOGGING AND
CATTLE RANCHING.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.830
RECENTLY, HOWEVER,
DEVELOPERS REALIZED

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.300
THAT THE VAST TRACTS
OF LAND AVAILABLE HERE

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.230
WERE IDEAL FOR THE
PRODUCTION OF SOYA

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:35.100
WHICH IS ONLY PROFITABLE
WHEN GROWN IN HUGE QUANTITIES.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.000
THE FIRST REGION TO BE
EXPLOITED WAS MATO GROSSO

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.300
IN THE FAR SOUTH.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.000
BUT IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE THE SOYA MAGNATES

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.860
ARRIVED IN SANTAREM.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:53.130
TRANSLATOR: BY 1999 OR 2000 WE'D
ALREADY HEARD THAT THEY WERE

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.130
ON THEIR WAY, THAT THE
SOYA FARMERS WOULD ARRIVE

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:01.300
IN OUR REGION. SOME PEOPLE
TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO US,

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.900
BUT WE NEVER REALLY
KNEW WHAT IT MEANT.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:11.400
WE DIDN'T PREPARE
OURSELVES FOR THIS.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:18.260
>>THE MOST OBVIOUS SYMBOL
OF SOYA'S ARRIVAL IN SANTAREM

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.900
WAS THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
PRIVATELY OWNED EXPORT STATION

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:25.330
NEXT TO THE CITY DOCKS.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.500
BUILT WITHOUT PLANNING
PERMISSION, THE LEGALITY

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.960
OF THIS STATION IS STILL
BEING DEBATED IN THE COURTS.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.260
THE FIRST SANTAREM'S RESIDENTS
KNEW OF IT WAS WHEN THE CITY

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:40.400
BEACH WAS SUDDENLY REPLACED BY
AN IMMENSE INDUSTRIAL PLATFORM.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.760
SOON AFTER, HOWEVER,
THE IMPLICATIONS HIT HOME

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.930
AS LOCAL FARMERS WERE
FORCED TO SELL THEIR LAND

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:51.230
TO THE MORE UNSCRUPULOUS
SOYA MAGNATES.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.760
SINCE MOST RURAL WORKERS
HAVE NO DOCUMENTS TO PROVE

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:58.130
THEY OWN THEIR FARMS, MAKING
THEM SELL WAS RELATIVELY EASY.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:02.360
TRANSLATOR: SO THEY
WOULD REGISTER THE LAND

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.960
AND THEN THEY'D SAY TO
THE PEOPLE LIVING ON IT,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.330
LOOK, NOW WE HAVE
THIS DOCUMENTATION,

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.060
EITHER YOU ACCEPT OUR OFFER
OR YOU LEAVE WITH NOTHING.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.360
THEY THREATENED TO CALL THE
POLICE SO THE FARMERS WOULD

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.700
ACCEPT SOME $5,000 OR
$10,000, IN IGNORANCE.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:22.730
THEY'D EVEN SAY TO HIM,
LOOK, YOU CAN GO TO THE CITY

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.800
AND BUY A HOUSE THERE AND
YOU'LL HAVE A BETTER LIFE.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.600
YOU CAN WATCH TV AND
LEAVE THIS WILDERNESS

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.430
WHICH HAS NO
ELECTRICITY.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:36.360
AND SO THE PEOPLE
WOULD FALL FOR THIS CON.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.260
>>MANY OF THE RURAL
MIGRANTS COME HERE

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.630
TO SANTAREM'S
SHANTY TOWN SUBURBS.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:48.000
BUT THEY SOON REALIZED THAT
$10,000 DOES NOT GO VERY FAR

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.860
IN THE CITY.

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.700
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE THEY
COULD GROW THEIR OWN CROPS

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.900
FOR FOOD AND PROFIT,
WHEREAS HERE THEY HAVE

00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:00.200
NOTHING TO
CREATE AN INCOME.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.160
THESE BACK STREETS ARE FULL
OF DESPERATE FAMILIES WHO HAVE

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:09.030
LOST EVERYTHING TO THE
GREED OF THE SOYA INDUSTRY.

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:15.800
THESE ARE THE KIND OF
PEOPLE MARIA TRIES TO HELP.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.800
AMONG THEM IS A WOMAN WHO
DOESN'T WANT TO BE IDENTIFIED

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.300
FOR FEAR OF HER LIFE.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.460
FIVE YEARS AGO SHE AND HER
HUSBAND FLED TO THE CITY

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.460
WHEN THEIR RURAL VILLAGE
WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:31.360
BY GUERILLAS WORKING ON
BEHALF OF THE SOYA MAGNATES.

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.800
TRANSLATOR: WHEN WE GOT TO THE
CITY GOD GAVE US THIS PLACE

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.860
AND THE PEOPLE
HERE HELPED US.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.000
THIS HUT WAS BUILT
BY THE PEOPLE.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.900
>>AFTER REACHING THE CITY,
HOWEVER, HER HUSBAND TOOK PART

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.230
IN A COMPENSATION CLAIM
AGAINST THE SOYA FARMERS.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.100
NOW HE HAS A
PRICE ON HIS HEAD.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:48:00.230
TRANSLATOR: WHEN I USED TO WALK
THROUGH THE CITY PEOPLE WOULD

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:04.860
SAY TO ME "THEY ARE MAKING
PLANS TO KILL YOUR HUSBAND".

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.000
I WAS IN SUCH A STATE THAT
I COULDN'T EAT ANYMORE.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.360
WHEN MY HUSBAND CAME HERE I
ASKED HIM TO STOP EVERYTHING.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.660
THE POOR CAN'T CHALLENGE
THE RICH BECAUSE THE RICH

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.800
HAVE MONEY TO
KILL PEOPLE.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:26.730
"YOU MIGHT AS WELL ALREADY BE
DEAD", I USED TO SAY TO HIM.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:30.800
>>FOR MARIA AND FOR
THE PEOPLE OF SANTAREM,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.430
THE FIGHT FOR
JUSTICE CONTINUES.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:39.860
MEANWHILE, THE THREAT
FROM SOYA IS INCREASING.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:44.130
SEVERAL NEW ROADS ARE PLANNED
IN THE AMAZON WHICH WILL

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:47.330
CUT THROUGH THE RAINFOREST,
ESTABLISHING NEW TRADE ROUTES

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:51.060
AND OPENING NEW
AREAS TO DEVELOPMENT.

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.430
IN ALL THIS, THE RIVER
CONTINUES TO BE

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.900
THE MOST VITAL LINK OF
THE EXPORT CORRIDOR.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.830
FROM SANTAREM THE HEAVILY
LADEN SHIPS CONTINUE

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.130
EASTWARDS FOR
ANOTHER 1,300 KILOMETERS

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:11.430
BEFORE THE AMAZON
FINALLY MEETS THE OCEAN.

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:15.700
MORE THAN 240 KILOMETERS
WIDE, THE RIVER ENTERS THE SEA

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.200
WITH SUCH POWER THAT IT
PUSHES THE SALT WATER BACK

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:24.730
HUNDREDS OF
KILOMETERS FROM LAND.

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:28.160
IN THE INCREDIBLE FORCE OF THIS
FLOW, THE SOYA AND OTHER

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:33.730
PRODUCTS OF THE RAINFOREST
ARE CARRIED AWAY TO MARKET.

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.600
BUT IN FORMING A PART OF
THE COMMERCIAL CHAIN,

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.500
THE RIVER IS A TOOL OF
ITS OWN DESTRUCTION.

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.660
FOR THE RAINFOREST AND THE
RIVER ARE INTERDEPENDENT.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:52.860
WHAT DESTROYS ONE WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY DESTROY THE OTHER.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:58.330
TODAY, THE AMAZON RIVER
STILL CARRIES ONE-FIFTH

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:03.060
OF ALL THE WORLD'S
FRESH WATER.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.030
FOR THE PEOPLE
WHO LIVE NEAR IT,

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:09.800
THE RIVER STILL DICTATES
THE PLACE AND PACE OF LIFE.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.600
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THE
AMAZON CAN NO LONGER

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.700
ESCAPE THE INFLUENCES
OF THE MODERN WORLD.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:22.160
FOR HOW LONG THE LAST
GREAT UNTAMED RIVER ON EARTH

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:26.160
WILL CONTINUE TO RUN
WILD REMAINS TO BE SEEN.
