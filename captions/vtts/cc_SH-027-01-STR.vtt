136
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.730

143
00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.700

The tevil and his tam!what phrase is this,

146
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.930
'He hears with ear'? why,it is affectations.

Ay, by these gloves, didhe,

149
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.400

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.770
that cost me two shillingand two pence apiece

154
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.500
of Yead Miller, by thesegloves.

155
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.330
Is this true, Pistol?

156
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.900
No; it is false, if it isa pick-purse.

157
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.400
Ha, thou mountain-foreigner!Sir John and Master mine,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.330
I combat challenge of thislatten bilbo.

159
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.870
Word of denial in thylabras here!

160
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.300
Word of denial: froth andscum, thou liest!

161
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.630
By these gloves, then,'twas he.

162
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.870
Be avised, sir, and passgood humours:

163
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.800
I will say 'marry trap'with you,

164
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.870
if you run the nuthook'shumour on me;

165
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.070
that is the very note ofit.

166
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.570
By this hat, then, he inthe red face had it;

167
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.270
for though I cannotremember

168
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.570
what I did when you mademe drunk,

169
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.570
yet I am not altogether anass.

170
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.200
What say you, Scarlet andJohn?

171
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.230
Why, sir, for my part

172
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.700
I say the gentleman haddrunk himself

173
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.170
out of his five sentences.

174
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.430
It is his five senses: fie,what the ignorance is!

175
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.730
And being fap, sir, was,as they say,

176
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.900
cashiered; and so conclusionspassed the careires.

177
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.630
Ay, you spake in Latinthen too;

178
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.830
but 'tis no matter:

179
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.770
I'll ne'er be drunk whilstI live again,

180
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.600

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.200
I'll be drunk with thosethat have

183
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.970
the fear of God, and notwith drunken knaves.

184

Do you understand me?

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.730
Ay, sir, you shall find mereasonable;

he's a justice of peace inhis country,

228
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.930
simple though I standhere.

229
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.530
But that is not thequestion:

230
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.530
the question is concerningyour marriage.

231
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.630
Ay, there's the point,sir.

232
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.030
Marry, is it; the verypoint of it;

233
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.570
to Mistress Anne Page.

234
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.430
Cousin Abraham Slender,can you love her?

235
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:30.270
Can you, carry her, your desirestowards her?

236
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.070
I hope, sir,

237
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.430
I will do

238
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.000
as it shall become onethat would do reason.

239
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.630
Nay, conceive me, conceiveme, sweet coz:

240
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.030

241
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.870
Can you love the maid?

242
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.330
I will marry her, sir, atyour request:

243
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.730
but if there be no greatlove in the beginning,

244
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.630
yet heaven may decrease it

245
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.670
upon better acquaintance,

246
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.530
when we are married andhave more occasion

247
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.170
to know one another;

248
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.070
I hope, upon familiaritywill grow more contempt:

249
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.030
but if you say, 'Marryher,' I will marry her;

250
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.500
that I am freely dissolved,and dissolutely.

251
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.400
It is a fery discretionanswer;

252
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.570
save the fall is in theword 'dissolutely:'

253
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.530
the word is, according toour meaning,

254
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.200
'resolutely:' his meaningis good.

255
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.770
Ay, I think my cousinmeant well.

256
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.800

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.670

go wait upon my cousinShallow.

271
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.300
A justice of peacesometimes may be beholding

272
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.630
to his friend for a man.

273
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.900
I keep but three men and aboy yet,

274
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.830

275

they will not sit till youcome.

278
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.870
I' faith, I'll eatnothing;

279
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.800
I thank you as much asthough I did.

280
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.370
I pray you, sir, walk in.

281
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.930
I had rather walk here, Ithank you.

282
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.000
I bruised my shin th'other day with playing

283
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.200
at sword and dagger with amaster of fence;

284
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.930
three veneys for a dish ofstewed prunes;

285
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:46.800
and, by my troth, I cannot abidethe smell of hot meat since.

286
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:53.570
Why do your dogs bark so?be there bears i' the town?

287
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.870
I think there are, sir; Iheard them talked of.

288
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.230
I love the sport well

289
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.170
but I shall as soonquarrel

290
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.230
at it as any man inEngland.

291
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.830
You are afraid, if you seethe bear loose,

292
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.600
are you not?

293
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.230
Ay, indeed, sir.

294
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.430
That's meat and drink tome, now.

295
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.600
I have seen Sackersonloose twenty times,

296
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.500
and have taken him by thechain;

297
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.470
but, I warrant you,

298
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.700
the women have so criedand shrieked at it,

299
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.830
that it passed:

300
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.930
but women, indeed, cannotabide 'em;

301
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.700
they are very ill-favoredrough things.

302
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.030
Come, gentle Master Slender,come; we stay for you.

303
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.900
I'll eat nothing, I thankyou, sir.

304
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.330
By cock and pie, you shallnot choose, sir!

305
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.200
come, come.

306
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.470
Nay, pray you, lead theway.

307
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.000
Come on, sir.

308
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.470
Mistress Anne, yourselfshall go first.

309
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.930

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.770
No, I will not. I will notgo first.

311
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.500
Truly, indeed, I will notdo you that wrong.

312
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.570
I pray you sir!

313
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.470
I'll rather be unmannerlythan troublesome.

314
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.730
You do yourself wrong,indeed you do!

315
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.630
Go your ways, and ask ofDoctor Caius' house

316
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.870

319
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.900
or his dry nurse, or hiscook,

and require her to solicityour master's desires

328
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.730

335
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.530
Truly, good mine host, I mustturn away

336
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.470
some of my followers.

337
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.500
Discard, bully Hercules;cashier:

338
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.270
let them wag; trot, trot.

339
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.770
I sit at ten pounds aweek.

340
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:58.000
Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar,Keisar, and Pheezar.

341
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.170

342
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.370

349
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.430
A tapster is a good trade:

350
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.100
an old cloak makes a newjerkin;

351
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.730

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.370
I will thrive.

355
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.170
O base Hungarian wight!

356
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.430
Wilt thou the spigotwield?

357
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.170
He was gotten in drink:

358
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.500
is not the humourconceited?

359
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.330
I am glad I am so acquitof this tinderbox:

360
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.770
his thefts were too open;

361
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.770
his filching was like anunskilful singer;

362
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.770
he kept not time.

363
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.830
The good humour is tosteal at a minute's rest.

364
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.630
'Convey,' the wise itcall.

365
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.770
'Steal!' foh! a fico forthe phrase!

366
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.100
Well, sirs, I am almostout at heels.

367
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.830
Why, then, let kibesensue.

368
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.830
There is no remedy; I mustcony-catch;

369
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:37.870
I must shift.

370
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.500
Young ravens must havefood.

371
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.400
Which of you know Ford ofthis town?

372
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.730
I ken the wight: he is ofsubstance good.

373
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.530
My honest lads,

374
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.470
I will tell you what I amabout.

375
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.230
Two yards, and more.

376
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.400
No quips now, Pistol!

377
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.870
Indeed, I am in the waisttwo yards about;

378
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.270
but I am now about nowaste;

379
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.700
I am about thrift.

380
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.870
Briefly, I do mean

381
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.730
to make love to Ford'swife:

382
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.970
I spy entertainment inher;

383
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.970
she discourses, shecarves,

384
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.100
she gives the leer ofinvitation:

385
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.630
I can construe the action

386
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.730
of her familiar style;

387
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.670
and the hardest voice ofher behavior,

388
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.030
to be Englished rightly,is,

389
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.530
'I am Sir JohnFalstaff's.'

390
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.170
He hath studied her will,

391
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.230
and translated her will,

392
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.000
out of honesty intoEnglish.

393
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.300
The anchor is deep: willthat humour pass?

394
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.370
Now, the report goes

395
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.700
she has all the rule ofher husband's purse:

396
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.030
he hath a legion ofangels.

397
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.400
As many devils entertain;

398
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.270
and 'To her, boy,' say I.

399
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.870
The humour rises; humourme the angels.

400
00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:00.130
I have writ me here aletter to her:

401
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.470
and here another to Page'swife,

402
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.200
who even now gave me goodeyes too,

403
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.730
examined my parts

404
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.100
with most judiciousoeillades;

405
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.600
sometimes the beam of herview gilded my foot,

406
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.400
sometimes my portly belly.

407
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.030
Then did the sun ondunghill shine.

408
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.600
I thank thee for thathumour.

409
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.300
O, she did so course o'ermy exteriors

410
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.230
with such a greedyintention,

411
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.970
that the appetite of hereye did seem to

412
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.370
scorch me up like aburning-glass!

413
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.200
she bears the purse too;

414
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200
she is a region in Guiana,

415
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200
all gold and bounty.

416
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.800
I will be cheater to themboth,

417
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.300
and they shall beexchequers to me;

418
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.430
they shall be my East andWest Indies,

419
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.170
and I will trade to themboth.

420
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.900
Go bear thou this letterto Mistress Page;

421
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.770
and thou this to MistressFord:

422
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:57.800
we will thrive, lads, wewill thrive.

423
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.000
Shall I Sir Pandarus ofTroy become,

424
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.500
And by my side wear steel?

425
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.270
then, Lucifer take all!

426
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.000
I will run no base humour:

427
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.830
here, take thehumour-letter:

428
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.630
I will keep the havior ofreputation.

429
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.970
Hold, sirrah,

430
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.900
bear you these letterstightly;

431
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.130
Sail like my pinnace tothese golden shores.

432
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.800
Rogues, hence, avaunt!

433
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.970
vanish like hailstones,go;

434
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.670
Trudge, plod away o' thehoof;

435
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.530
seek shelter, pack!

436
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.770
Falstaff will learn thehumour of the age,

437
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.970
French thrift, you rogues;myself and skirted page.

438
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.200
Let vultures gripe thyguts!

439
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.730
for gourd and fullamholds,

440
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.400
And high and low beguilesthe rich and poor:

441
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.470
Tester I'll have in pouchwhen thou shalt lack,

442
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.470
Base Phrygian Turk!

443
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:11.100
I have operations which behumours of revenge.

444
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.530
Wilt thou revenge?

445
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.300
By welkin and her star!

446
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.070
With wit or steel?

447
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.330
With both the humours, I:

448
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.500
I will disclose the humour

449
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.870
of this love to Page.

450
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.530
And I to Ford shall ekeunfold

451
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.500
How Falstaff, varlet vile,

452
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.330
His dove will prove, hisgold will hold,

453
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.370
And his soft couch defile.

454
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.570
My humour shall not cool:

455
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.770
I will incense Page todeal with poison;

456
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.770
I will possess him withyellowness,

457
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.130
for the revolt of mine isdangerous:

458
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.130
that is my true humour.

459
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.930
Thou art the Mars ofmalecontents:

460
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:04.070
I second thee; troop on.

461
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:32.800
What, John Rugby! John?John, I say!

462
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800
I pray thee, go to thecasement,

463
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.370
and see if you can see mymaster,

464
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.530
Master Doctor Caius,coming.

465
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.530
If he do, i' faith,

466
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.100
and find any body in thehouse,

467
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.430
here will be an oldabusing

468
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.700
of God's patience

469
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.000
and the king's English.

470
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.870
I'll go watch.

471
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.530
Go; and we'll have aposset

472
00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.100
for't soon at night,

473
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.500
in faith, at the latterend

474
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.230
of a sea-coal fire.

475
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.000
An honest, willing, kindfellow,

476
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.930
as ever servant shall comein house withal,

477
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.400
and, I warrant you, notell-tale

478
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.900
nor no breed-bate:

479
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.030
his worst fault is,

480
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.700
that he is given toprayer;

481
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.430
he is something peevishthat way:

482
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.530
but nobody but has hisfault;

483
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.430
but let that pass.

484
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.770
Peter Simple, you say yourname is?

485
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.030
Ay, for fault of a better.

486
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.230
And Master Slender's yourmaster?

487
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.200
Ay, forsooth.

488
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.670
Does he not wear a greatround beard,

489
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.430
like a glover'sparing-knife?

490
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.800
No, forsooth:

491
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.730
he hath but a little weeface,

492
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.230
with a little yellowbeard,

493
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.770
a Cain-coloured beard.

494
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.470
A softly-sprighted man, ishe not?

495
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.870
Ay, forsooth: but he is astall a man

496
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.070
of his hands as any is

497
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.800
between this and his head;

498
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.600
he hath fought with awarrener.

499
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.130
How say you? O, I shouldremember him:

500
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.770
does he not hold up hishead, as it were,

501
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.370
and strut in his gait?

502
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.970
Yes, indeed, does he.

503
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.370
Well, heaven send AnnePage no worse fortune!

504
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.330
Tell Master Parson Evans Iwill do what I can

505

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.000

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.430
The young man is an honestman.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.500
What shall de honest mando in my closet?

549
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.530

I beseech you, be not sophlegmatic.

552
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.700
Hear the truth of it:

553
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.530
he came of an errand to me

554
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.800
from Parson Hugh.

555
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.500
Vell.

556
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.730
to desire her to--

557
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.300
Peace-a your tongue.

558
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.730
Speak-a your tale.

559
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.370
To desire this honestgentlewoman, your maid,

560
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.300
to speak a good word toMistress Anne Page

561
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.370
for my master in the wayof marriage.

562
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.800
This is all, indeed, la!

563
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.870
but I'll ne'er put myfinger in the fire,

564
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.430

Tarry you a little-awhile.

567
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.870
I am glad he is so quiet:

568
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.930
if he had been thoroughlymoved,

569
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:15.970
you should have heard him

570
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.270
so loud and so melancholy.

571
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.800
But notwithstanding, man,

572
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.500
I'll do you your masterwhat good I can:

573
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.700

'Tis a great charge to comeunder one body's hand.

581
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.900
Are you avised o' that?

582

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.430
and to be up early anddown late;

584
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.230
but notwithstanding,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.130
--to tell you in your ear;

586
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.670

591
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.930

622
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.300

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.030
nor can do more than I dowith her,

624
00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.470

How now, good woman? howdost thou?

What news? how does prettyMistress Anne?

630

632
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.600
and one that is yourfriend,

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.430
I can tell you that by theway;

634
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.100
I praise heaven for it.

635
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.970
Shall I do any good,thinkest thou?

636
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.470
shall I not lose my suit?

637
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.400
Troth, sir, all is in hishands above:

638
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.330
but notwithstanding,Master Fenton,

639
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:36.400

640
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.300
Have not your worship awart above your eye?

641
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.970
Yes, marry, have I; whatof that?

642
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.300
Well, thereby hangs atale:

643
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.800
good faith, it is suchanother Nan;

644
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.930
but, I detest, an honestmaid

645
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.500
as ever broke bread:

646
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.500
we had an hour's talk ofthat wart.

647
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.270
I shall never laugh

648
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.800
but in that maid'scompany!

649
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.700
But indeed she is giventoo much

650
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.430
to allicholy and musing:

651
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.070
but for you--well, go to.

652
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.630
Well, I shall see herto-day.

653
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.900
Hold, there's money forthee;

654
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.730
let me have thy voice inmy behalf:

655
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:24.100
if thou seest her beforeme, commend me.

656
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.730
Will I? i'faith, that wewill;

657
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.930
and I will tell yourworship

658
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.930
more of the wart the nexttime we have confidence;

659
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.230
and of other wooers.

660
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:40.970
Well, farewell; I am ingreat haste now.

661

Farewell to your worship.

Truly, an honestgentleman:

663
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.830
but Anne loves him not;

664
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.230
for I know Anne's mind

665
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.400
as well as another does.

666
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.930
(sniffing)

667
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.600
Out upon't! what have Iforgot?

668
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.570
