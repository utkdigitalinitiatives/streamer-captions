59
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.130

77
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.330

I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.

82
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.130
How does your fallow greyhound, sir?

83
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.870
I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.

84
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.800
It could not be judged, sir.

85
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.430
You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

86
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.400
That he will not. 'Tis your fault,

87
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.530
'tis your fault; 'tis a good dog.

88
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.330
A cur, sir.

89
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.700
(laughing)

90
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.330
Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog:

91
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.770
can there be more said? he is good and fair.

92
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.000
Is Sir John Falstaff here?

93
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.300
Sir, he is within;

94
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.200
and I would I could do a good office between you.

95
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.370
It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.

96
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.800
He hath wronged me, Master Page.

97
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.070
Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.

98
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.170
If it be confessed, it is not redress'd:

99
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.570
is not that so, Master Page?

100
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.270
He hath wronged me; indeed he hath,

101
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.000
at a word, he hath, believe me:

102
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.830
Robert Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.

103
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.170
Here comes Sir John.

104
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.130
Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?

105
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.000
Knight, you have beaten my men,

106
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.870
killed my deer, and broke open my lodge.

107
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.300
But not kissed your keeper's daughter?

108
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.230
Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.

109
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.700
I will answer it straight; I have done all this.

110
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.630
That is now answered.

111
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.500
The council shall know this.

112
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.430
'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:

113
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.570
you'll be laughed at.

114
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.900
Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.

115
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.870
Good worts! good cabbage.

116
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.530
Slender, I broke your head:

117
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.230
what matter have you against me?

118
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.830
Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;

119
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.430
and against your cony-catching rascals,

120
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.130
Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol.

121
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.700
They carried me to the tavern,

122
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.270
made me drunk, and afterward picked my pocket!

123
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.430
You Banbury cheese!

124
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.330
Ay, it is no matter.

125
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.070
How now, Mephostophilus!

126
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.900
Ay, it is no matter.

127
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:11.100
Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice!

128
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.070
that's my humour.

129
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.230
Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?

130
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.470
I pray you, peace. Now let us understand.

131
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.970
There is three umpires in this matter,

132
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.170
as I understand;

133
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.930
that is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page;

134
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.670
and there is myself, fidelicet myself;

135
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.030
and the three party is,

136
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.730
lastly and finally,

137
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.070
mine host of the Garter.

138
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.400
We three, to hear it and end it between them.

139
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.870
Fery goot:

140
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.570
I will make a prief of it in my note-book;

141
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.770
and afterwords we will work upon the cause

142
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.700
with as great discreetly as we can.

143
00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.700
Pistol!

144
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.630
He hears with ears.

145
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.630
The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this,

146
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.930
'He hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.

147
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.570
Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?

148
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.830
Ay, by these gloves, did he,

149
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.400
or I would I might never come

150
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.530
in mine own great chamber again else,

151
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.130
of seven groats in mill-sixpences,

152
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.230
and two Edward shovel-boards, of Yead Miller

153
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.770
that cost me two shilling and two pence apiece

154
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.500
of Yead Miller, by these gloves.

155
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.330
Is this true, Pistol?

156
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.900
No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

157
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.400
Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,

158
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.330
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.

159
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.870
Word of denial in thy labras here!

160
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.300
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!

161
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.630
By these gloves, then, 'twas he.

162
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.870
Be avised, sir, and pass good humours:

163
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.800
I will say 'marry trap' with you,

164
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.870
if you run the nuthook's humour on me;

165
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.070
that is the very note of it.

166
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.570
By this hat, then, he in the red face had it;

167
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.270
for though I cannot remember

168
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.570
what I did when you made me drunk,

169
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.570
yet I am not altogether an ass.

170
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.200
What say you, Scarlet and John?

171
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.230
Why, sir, for my part

172
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.700
I say the gentleman had drunk himself

173
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.170
out of his five sentences.

174
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.430
It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!

175
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.730
And being fap, sir, was, as they say,

176
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.900
cashiered; and so conclusions passed the careires.

177
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.630
Ay, you spake in Latin then too;

178
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.830
but 'tis no matter:

179
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.770
I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,

180
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.600
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:

181
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.900
if I be drunk,

182
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.200
I'll be drunk with those that have

183
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.970
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.

184
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.670
So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.

185
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.570
You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen;

186
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.130
you hear it.

187
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.330
Nay, daughter, carry the wine in;

188
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.130
we'll drink within.

189
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.770
O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.

190
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.970
How now, Mistress Ford!

191
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.370
Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:

192
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.600
by your leave, good mistress.

193
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.700
My husband's name is Ford, sir.

194
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.900
Well I shall desire

195
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.270
more acquaintance of you.

196
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.730
The like of you, good Mistress Page.

197
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.170
With all my heart, Sir John.

198
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.530
Come, husband, you go? Dinner stays for us.

199
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.130
Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome.

200
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.070
Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner:

201
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.700
come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down

202
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.700
all unkindness.

203
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.830
I had rather than forty shillings

204
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.230
I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.

205
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.630
How now, Simple! where have you been?

206
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.470
I must wait on myself, now must I?

207
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.830
You have not the Book of Riddles

208
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.270
about you, have you?

209
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.230
Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it

210
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.670
to Alice Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last,

211
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.100
a fortnight afore Michaelmas?

212
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.530
Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you.

213
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.500
A word with you, coz;

214
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.300
marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere,

215
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.070
a tender, a kind of tender,

216
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.730
made afar off by Sir Hugh here.

217
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.930
Do you understand me?

218
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.730
Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable;

219
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.670
if it be so, I shall do that that is reason.

220
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.070
Nay, but understand me.

221
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.300
So I do, sir.

222
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.100
Give ear to his motions, Master Slender:

223
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.130
I will description the matter to you,

224
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.570
if you be capacity of it.

225
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.530
Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says:

226
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.700
I pray you, pardon me sir;

227
00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.200
he's a justice of peace in his country,

228
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.930
simple though I stand here.

229
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.530
But that is not the question:

230
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.530
the question is concerning your marriage.

231
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.630
Ay, there's the point, sir.

232
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.030
Marry, is it; the very point of it;

233
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.570
to Mistress Anne Page.

234
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:24.430
Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?

235
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:30.270
Can you, carry her, your desires towards her?

236
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.070
I hope, sir,

237
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.430
I will do

238
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.000
as it shall become one that would do reason.

239
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.630
Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz:

240
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.030
what I do is to pleasure you, coz.

241
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.870
Can you love the maid?

242
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:50.330
I will marry her, sir, at your request:

243
00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.730
but if there be no great love in the beginning,

244
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.630
yet heaven may decrease it

245
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:55.670
upon better acquaintance,

246
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.530
when we are married and have more occasion

247
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.170
to know one another;

248
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.070
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:

249
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.030
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her;

250
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.500
that I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.

251
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.400
It is a fery discretion answer;

252
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.570
save the fall is in the word 'dissolutely:'

253
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.530
the word is, according to our meaning,

254
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.200
'resolutely:' his meaning is good.

255
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.770
Ay, I think my cousin meant well.

256
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.800
Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!

257
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.830
Here comes fair Mistress Anne.

258
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:35.000
Mistress Anne! Would I were young for your sake.

259
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.670
The dinner is on the table;

260
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.730
my father desires your worships' company.

261
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.200
I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.

262
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.100
Od's plessed will!

263
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.770
I will not be absence at the grace.

264
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.870
Will't please your worship to come in, sir?

265
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.030
No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily;

266
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.500
I am very well.

267
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.270
The dinner attends you, sir.

268
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.370
I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth.

269
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.070
Go, sirrah, for all you are my man,

270
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.470
go wait upon my cousin Shallow.

271
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.300
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding

272
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.630
to his friend for a man.

273
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.900
I keep but three men and a boy yet,

274
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.830
till my mother be dead: but what though?

275
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.330
Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.

276
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.470
I may not go in without your worship:

277
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.870
they will not sit till you come.

278
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:26.870
I' faith, I'll eat nothing;

279
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.800
I thank you as much as though I did.

280
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.370
I pray you, sir, walk in.

281
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:32.930
I had rather walk here, I thank you.

282
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.000
I bruised my shin th' other day with playing

283
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.200
at sword and dagger with a master of fence;

284
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.930
three veneys for a dish of stewed prunes;

285
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:46.800
and, by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since.

286
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:53.570
Why do your dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?

287
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.870
I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.

288
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.230
I love the sport well

289
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.170
but I shall as soon quarrel

290
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.230
at it as any man in England.

291
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.830
You are afraid, if you see the bear loose,

292
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.600
are you not?

293
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.230
Ay, indeed, sir.

294
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.430
That's meat and drink to me, now.

295
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.600
I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times,

296
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.500
and have taken him by the chain;

297
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.470
but, I warrant you,

298
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.700
the women have so cried and shrieked at it,

299
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.830
that it passed:

300
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.930
but women, indeed, cannot abide 'em;

301
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.700
they are very ill-favored rough things.

302
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.030
Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.

303
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.900
I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

304
00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.330
By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir!

305
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.200
come, come.

306
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.470
Nay, pray you, lead the way.

307
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.000
Come on, sir.

308
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.470
Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.

309
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.930
Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.

310
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.770
No, I will not. I will not go first.

311
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.500
Truly, indeed, I will not do you that wrong.

312
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.570
I pray you sir!

313
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.470
I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.

314
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.730
You do yourself wrong, indeed you do!

315
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.630
Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house

316
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.870
which is the way:

317
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.100
and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,

318
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.500
which is in the manner of his nurse,

319
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.900
or his dry nurse, or his cook,

320
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.230
or his laundry, his washer, and his wringer.

321
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:39.230
Well, sir.

322
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.400
Nay, it is petter yet.

323
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.100
Give her this letter;

324
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.070
for it is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance

325
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.530
with Mistress Anne Page:

326
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.270
and the letter is, to desire

327
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.670
and require her to solicit your master's desires

328
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.730
to Mistress Anne.

329
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.470
I pray you, be gone:

330
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.970
I will make an end of my dinner;

331
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.070
there's pippins and cheese to come.

332
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.170
Mine host of the Garter!

333
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.400
What says my bully-rook?

334
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.230
speak scholarly and wisely.

335
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.530
Truly, good mine host, I must turn away

336
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.470
some of my followers.

337
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.500
Discard, bully Hercules; cashier:

338
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.270
let them wag; trot, trot.

339
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.770
I sit at ten pounds a week.

340
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:58.000
Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar.

341
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.170
I will entertain Bardolph;

342
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.370
he shall draw, he shall tap:

343
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.270
said I well, bully Hector?

344
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.370
Do so, good mine host.

345
00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:15.570
I have spoke; let him follow.

346
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.900
Let me see thee froth and lime:

347
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.630
I am at a word; follow.

348
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:30.200
Bardolph, follow him.

349
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.430
A tapster is a good trade:

350
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.100
an old cloak makes a new jerkin;

351
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.730
a withered serving-man a fresh tapster.

352
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.130
Go; adieu.

353
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.800
It is a life that I have desired:

354
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.370
I will thrive.

355
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.170
O base Hungarian wight!

356
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.430
Wilt thou the spigot wield?

357
00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.170
He was gotten in drink:

358
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.500
is not the humour conceited?

359
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.330
I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox:

360
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.770
his thefts were too open;

361
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.770
his filching was like an unskilful singer;

362
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.770
he kept not time.

363
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.830
The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.

364
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.630
'Convey,' the wise it call.

365
00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.770
'Steal!' foh! a fico for the phrase!

366
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.100
Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

367
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.830
Why, then, let kibes ensue.

368
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.830
There is no remedy; I must cony-catch;

369
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:37.870
I must shift.

370
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.500
Young ravens must have food.

371
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.400
Which of you know Ford of this town?

372
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.730
I ken the wight: he is of substance good.

373
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.530
My honest lads,

374
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:52.470
I will tell you what I am about.

375
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.230
Two yards, and more.

376
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.400
No quips now, Pistol!

377
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.870
Indeed, I am in the waist two yards about;

378
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.270
but I am now about no waste;

379
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:04.700
I am about thrift.

380
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.870
Briefly, I do mean

381
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:11.730
to make love to Ford's wife:

382
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.970
I spy entertainment in her;

383
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.970
she discourses, she carves,

384
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.100
she gives the leer of invitation:

385
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:19.630
I can construe the action

386
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.730
of her familiar style;

387
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.670
and the hardest voice of her behavior,

388
00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.030
to be Englished rightly, is,

389
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.530
'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

390
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.170
He hath studied her will,

391
00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.230
and translated her will,

392
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.000
out of honesty into English.

393
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.300
The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?

394
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.370
Now, the report goes

395
00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.700
she has all the rule of her husband's purse:

396
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.030
he hath a legion of angels.

397
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.400
As many devils entertain;

398
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.270
and 'To her, boy,' say I.

399
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.870
The humour rises; humour me the angels.

400
00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:00.130
I have writ me here a letter to her:

401
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.470
and here another to Page's wife,

402
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.200
who even now gave me good eyes too,

403
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.730
examined my parts

404
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.100
with most judicious oeillades;

405
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.600
sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot,

406
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.400
sometimes my portly belly.

407
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.030
Then did the sun on dunghill shine.

408
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.600
I thank thee for that humour.

409
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.300
O, she did so course o'er my exteriors

410
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.230
with such a greedy intention,

411
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.970
that the appetite of her eye did seem to

412
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.370
scorch me up like a burning-glass!

413
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.200
she bears the purse too;

414
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.200
she is a region in Guiana,

415
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.200
all gold and bounty.

416
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.800
I will be cheater to them both,

417
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.300
and they shall be exchequers to me;

418
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.430
they shall be my East and West Indies,

419
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.170
and I will trade to them both.

420
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.900
Go bear thou this letter to Mistress Page;

421
00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.770
and thou this to Mistress Ford:

422
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:57.800
we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

423
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.000
Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,

424
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.500
And by my side wear steel?

425
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.270
then, Lucifer take all!

426
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.000
I will run no base humour:

427
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.830
here, take the humour-letter:

428
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.630
I will keep the havior of reputation.

429
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.970
Hold, sirrah,

430
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.900
bear you these letters tightly;

431
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.130
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.

432
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.800
Rogues, hence, avaunt!

433
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.970
vanish like hailstones, go;

434
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.670
Trudge, plod away o' the hoof;

435
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.530
seek shelter, pack!

436
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.770
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,

437
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:43.970
French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.

438
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.200
Let vultures gripe thy guts!

439
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.730
for gourd and fullam holds,

440
00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.400
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:

441
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.470
Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,

442
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.470
Base Phrygian Turk!

443
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:11.100
I have operations which be humours of revenge.

444
00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:12.530
Wilt thou revenge?

445
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.300
By welkin and her star!

446
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.070
With wit or steel?

447
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.330
With both the humours, I:

448
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.500
I will disclose the humour

449
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.870
of this love to Page.

450
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.530
And I to Ford shall eke unfold

451
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.500
How Falstaff, varlet vile,

452
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.330
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,

453
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:40.370
And his soft couch defile.

454
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.570
My humour shall not cool:

455
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.770
I will incense Page to deal with poison;

456
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.770
I will possess him with yellowness,

457
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.130
for the revolt of mine is dangerous:

458
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.130
that is my true humour.

459
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:58.930
Thou art the Mars of malecontents:

460
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:04.070
I second thee; troop on.

461
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:32.800
What, John Rugby! John? John, I say!

462
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800
I pray thee, go to the casement,

463
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.370
and see if you can see my master,

464
00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.530
Master Doctor Caius, coming.

465
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.530
If he do, i' faith,

466
00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:41.100
and find any body in the house,

467
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.430
here will be an old abusing

468
00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.700
of God's patience

469
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.000
and the king's English.

470
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:45.870
I'll go watch.

471
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.530
Go; and we'll have a posset

472
00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.100
for't soon at night,

473
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.500
in faith, at the latter end

474
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.230
of a sea-coal fire.

475
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.000
An honest, willing, kind fellow,

476
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.930
as ever servant shall come in house withal,

477
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.400
and, I warrant you, no tell-tale

478
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.900
nor no breed-bate:

479
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.030
his worst fault is,

480
00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.700
that he is given to prayer;

481
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.430
he is something peevish that way:

482
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:12.530
but nobody but has his fault;

483
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.430
but let that pass.

484
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:16.770
Peter Simple, you say your name is?

485
00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.030
Ay, for fault of a better.

486
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.230
And Master Slender's your master?

487
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.200
Ay, forsooth.

488
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.670
Does he not wear a great round beard,

489
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.430
like a glover's paring-knife?

490
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.800
No, forsooth:

491
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.730
he hath but a little wee face,

492
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:32.230
with a little yellow beard,

493
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.770
a Cain-coloured beard.

494
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.470
A softly-sprighted man, is he not?

495
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.870
Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man

496
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:40.070
of his hands as any is

497
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.800
between this and his head;

498
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.600
he hath fought with a warrener.

499
00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.130
How say you? O, I should remember him:

500
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.770
does he not hold up his head, as it were,

501
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.370
and strut in his gait?

502
00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.970
Yes, indeed, does he.

503
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.370
Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!

504
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.330
Tell Master Parson Evans I will do what I can

505
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.370
for your master:

506
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.770
Anne is a good girl, and I wish--

507
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.900
Out, alas! here comes my master.

508
00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.500
We shall all be shent.

509
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.770
Run in here, good young man;

510
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:21.670
go into this closet: he will not stay long.

511
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:26.630
What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!

512
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:30.830
Go, John, go inquire for my master;

513
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.230
I doubt he be not well, that he comes not home.

514
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:40.900
(Singing)

515
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.400
Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys.

516
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.070
Pray you, go and vetch me in my closet

517
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:57.000
un boitier vert, a box, a green-a box:

518
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.570
do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.

519
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.400
Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.

520
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.400
I am glad he went not in himself:

521
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.500
if he had found the young man,

522
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.000
he would have been horn-mad.

523
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.770
Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi,

524
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.330
il fait fort chaud.

525
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:26.930
Je m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.

526
00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.770
Is it this, sir?

527
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:36.030
Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly.

528
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.530
Vere is dat knave Rugby?

529
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.470
What, John Rugby! John!

530
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.370
Here, sir!

531
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:47.770
You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby.

532
00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:48.870
Come, take-a your rapier,

533
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.500
and come after my heel to the court.

534
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.070
'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.

535
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:57.000
By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!

536
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.370
Qu'ai-j'oublie!

537
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.770

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.930

539
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.230
I shall leave behind.

540
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.630
Ay me, he'll find the young man here,

541
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:06.930
and be mad!

542
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:13.970
O diable, diable! vat is in my closet?

543
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.700
Villain! larron!

544
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.070
Rugby, my rapier!

545
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:20.870
Good master, be content.

546
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.200
Wherefore shall I be content-a?

547
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.430
The young man is an honest man.

548
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.500
What shall de honest man do in my closet?

549
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.530
dere is no honest man

550
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:28.570
dat shall come in my closet.

551
00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.430
I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic.

552
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.700
Hear the truth of it:

553
00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:34.530
he came of an errand to me

554
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.800
from Parson Hugh.

555
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.500
Vell.

556
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.730
to desire her to--

557
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.300
Peace-a your tongue.

558
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.730
Speak-a your tale.

559
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:45.370
To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid,

560
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.300
to speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page

561
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.370
for my master in the way of marriage.

562
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.800
This is all, indeed, la!

563
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.870
but I'll ne'er put my finger in the fire,

564
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.430
and need not.

565
00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:05.430
Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.

566
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.730
Tarry you a little-a while.

567
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.870
I am glad he is so quiet:

568
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.930
if he had been thoroughly moved,

569
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:15.970
you should have heard him

570
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.270
so loud and so melancholy.

571
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.800
But notwithstanding, man,

572
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.500
I'll do you your master what good I can:

573
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.700
and the very yea and the no is,

574
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.300
the French doctor, my master,

575
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.100
--I may call him my master, look you,

576
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.770
for I keep his house;

577
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.570
and I wash, wring, brew, bake,

578
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:35.070
scour, dress meat and drink,

579
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.430
make the beds and do all myself,--

580
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.670
'Tis a great charge to come under one body's hand.

581
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:42.900
Are you avised o' that?

582
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.770
you shall find it a great charge:

583
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.430
and to be up early and down late;

584
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.230
but notwithstanding,

585
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.130
--to tell you in your ear;

586
00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.670
I would have no words of it,

587
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.030
--my master himself is in love

588
00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:01.900
with Mistress Anne Page:

589
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.430
but notwithstanding that,

590
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:06.300
I know Anne's mind,--

591
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.930
that's neither here nor there.

592
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:13.970
You jack'nape,

593
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:16.930
give-a this letter to Sir Hugh;

594
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.070
by gar, it is a shallenge:

595
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.870
I will cut his troat in dee park;

596
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.900
and I will teach

597
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.430
a scurvy jack-a-nape priest

598
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.430
to meddle or make.

599
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.600
You may be gone;

600
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.530
it is not good you tarry here.

601
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:38.630
By gar, I will cut all his two stones;

602
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:43.770
he shall not have a stone to throw at his dog:

603
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.600
Alas, he speaks but for his friend.

604
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.100
It is no matter-a ver dat:

605
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.000
do not you tell-a me

606
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.770
dat I shall have Anne Page for myself?

607
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:58.530
By gar, I vill kill de Jack priest;

608
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.000
and I have appointed mine host of de Jarteer

609
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.970
to measure our weapon.

610
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.430
By gar, I will myself have Anne Page.

611
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.570
Sir, the maid loves you,

612
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.500
and all shall be well.

613
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:14.100
We must give folks leave to prate:

614
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.000
what, the good-jer!

615
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.830
Rugby, come to the court with me.

616
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:24.000
By gar, if I have not Anne Page,

617
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.970
I shall turn your head out of my door.

618
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:30.470
Follow my heels, Rugby.

619
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:38.270
You shall have An fool's-head of your own.

620
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.030
No, I know Anne's mind for that:

621
00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.270
never a woman in Windsor

622
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.300
knows more of Anne's mind than I do;

623
00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.030
nor can do more than I do with her,

624
00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.470
I thank heaven.

625
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.200
(from outside) Who's within there? ho!

626
00:30:53.200 --> 00:31:03.830
Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.

627
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.800
How now, good woman? how dost thou?

628
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.670
The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.

629
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:14.130
What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?

630
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.500
In truth, sir, and she is pretty,

631
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.300
and honest, and gentle;

632
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.600
and one that is your friend,

633
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.430
I can tell you that by the way;

634
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.100
I praise heaven for it.

635
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.970
Shall I do any good, thinkest thou?

636
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:27.470
shall I not lose my suit?

637
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.400
Troth, sir, all is in his hands above:

638
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.330
but notwithstanding, Master Fenton,

639
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:36.400
I'll be sworn on a book, she loves you.

640
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.300
Have not your worship a wart above your eye?

641
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.970
Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

642
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.300
Well, thereby hangs a tale:

643
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.800
good faith, it is such another Nan;

644
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.930
but, I detest, an honest maid

645
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.500
as ever broke bread:

646
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.500
we had an hour's talk of that wart.

647
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.270
I shall never laugh

648
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.800
but in that maid's company!

649
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.700
But indeed she is given too much

650
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.430
to allicholy and musing:

651
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:08.070
but for you--well, go to.

652
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.630
Well, I shall see her to-day.

653
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.900
Hold, there's money for thee;

654
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.730
let me have thy voice in my behalf:

655
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:24.100
if thou seest her before me, commend me.

656
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.730
Will I? i'faith, that we will;

657
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.930
and I will tell your worship

658
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.930
more of the wart the next time we have confidence;

659
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.230
and of other wooers.

660
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:40.970
Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.

661
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:46.330
Farewell to your worship.

662
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:57.230
Truly, an honest gentleman:

663
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.830
but Anne loves him not;

664
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.230
for I know Anne's mind

665
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:03.400
as well as another does.

666
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.930
(sniffing)

667
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.600
Out upon't! what have I forgot?

668
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.570
