00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:05.430


2
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.830
To sing a song that oldwas sung,

3
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.900
From ashes ancient Goweris come;

4
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.900
Assuming man'sinfirmities,

5
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.830
To glad your ear, andplease your eyes.

6
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.830
It hath been sung atfestivals,

7
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.130
On ember-eves andholy days;

8
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.530
And lords and ladies intheir lives

9
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.500
Have read it forrestoratives:

10
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.030
The purchase is to makemen glorious;

11
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.470
Et bonum quo antiquius, eomelius.

12
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.100
If you, born in theselatter times,

13
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.930
When wit's more ripe,accept my rhymes.

14
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.800
And that to hear an oldman sing

15
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.370
May to your wishespleasure bring

16
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.170
I life would wish, andthat I might

17
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.070
Waste it for you, liketaper-light.

18
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.270
This Antioch, then,Antiochus the Great

19
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.430
Built up, this city, forhis chiefest seat:

20
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.870
The fairest in all Syria,

21
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.400
I tell you what mineauthors say:

22
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.900
This king unto him took afere,

23
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.130
Who died and left a femaleheir,

24
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.230
So buxom, blithe, and fullof face,

25
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.300
As heaven had lent her allhis grace;

26
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.330
With whom the fatherliking took,

27
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.230
And her to incest didprovoke:

28
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.770
Bad child; worse father!to entice his own

29
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.000
To evil should be done bynone:

30
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.570
But custom what they didbegin

31
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.570
Was with long use accountno sin.

32
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.200
The beauty of this sinfuldame

33
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.130
Made many princes thitherframe,

34
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.600
To seek her as abed-fellow,

35
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.870
In marriage-pleasuresplay-fellow:

36
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.630
Which to prevent he made alaw,

37
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.770
To keep her still, and menin awe,

38
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.700
That whoso ask'd her forhis wife,

39
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.500
His riddle told not, losthis life:

40
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.570
So for her many a wightdid die,

41
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.770
As yon grim looks dotestify.

42
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.070
What now ensues, to thejudgment of your eye

43
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.730
I give, my cause who bestcan justify.

44
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.830
Young prince of Tyre, youhave at large received

45
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.570
The danger of the task youundertake.

46
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.400
I have, Antiochus, and,with a soul

47
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.630
Embolden'd with the gloryof her praise,

48
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.370
Think death no hazard inthis enterprise.

49
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.030
Bring in our daughter,clothed like a bride,

50
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.670
For the embracements evenof Jove himself;

51
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.430
At whose conception, tillLucina reign'd,

52
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.000
Nature this dowry gave, toglad her presence,

53
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The senate-house ofplanets all did sit,

54
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.200
To knit in her their bestperfections.

55
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.070
(â™ª Music)

56
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.830
See where she comes,apparell'd like the spring,

57
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.630
Graces her subjects, andher thoughts the king

58
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.530
Of every virtue givesrenown to men!

59
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.300
Her face the book ofpraises, where is read

60
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.000
Nothing but curiouspleasures, as from thence

61
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.030
Sorrow were ever razed andtesty wrath

62
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.700
Could never be her mildcompanion.

63
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.870
You gods that made me man,and sway in love,

64
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.470
That have inflamed desirein my breast

65
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.570
To taste the fruit of yoncelestial tree,

66
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.400
Or die in the adventure,be my helps,

67
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
As I am son and servant toyour will,

68
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.430
To compass such aboundless happiness!

69
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.300
Prince Pericles,--

70
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.570
That would be son to greatAntiochus.

71
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.600
Before thee stands thisfair Hesperides,

72
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.770
With golden fruit, yetdangerous to be touch'd;

73
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.800
For death-like dragonshere affright thee hard:

74
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.670
Her face, like heaven,enticeth thee to view

75
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.930
Her countless glory, whichdesert must gain;

76
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.070
And which, without desert,because thine eye

77
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.730
Presumes to reach, all thywhole heap must die.

78
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.700
Yon sometimes famousprinces, like thyself,

79
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.130
Drawn by report,adventurous by desire,

80
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.830
Tell thee, with speechlesstongues and semblance pale,

81
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.030
That without covering,save yon field of stars,

82
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.530
Here they stand martyrs,slain in Cupid's wars;

83
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.230
And with dead cheeksadvise thee to desist

84
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.030
For going on death's net,whom none resist.

85
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.170
Antiochus, I thank thee,who hath taught

86
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.300
My frail mortality to knowitself,

87
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.930
And by those fearfulobjects to prepare

88
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.630
This body, like to them,to what I must;

89
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.230
For death remember'dshould be like a mirror,

90
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.000
Who tells us life's butbreath, to trust it error.

91
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.930
I'll make my will then,and, as sick men do

92
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.200
Who know the world, seeheaven, but, feeling woe,

93
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.200
Gripe not at earthly joysas erst they did;

94
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.970
So I bequeath a happypeace to you

95
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.570
And all good men, as everyprince should do;

96
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.870
My riches to the earthfrom whence they came;

97
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.770
But my unspotted fire oflove to you.

98
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.600
Thus ready for the way oflife or death,

99
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.330
I wait the sharpest blow,Antiochus.

100
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:10.270
Scorning advice, read theconclusion then:

101
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.670
Which read and notexpounded, 'tis decreed,

102
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.500
As these before thee thouthyself shalt bleed.

103
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.930
Of all say'd yet, maystthou prove prosperous!

104
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.070
Of all say'd yet, I wishthee happiness!

105
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.300
Like a bold champion, Iassume the lists,

106
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.200
Nor ask advice of anyother thought

107
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.800
But faithfulness andcourage.

108
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.100
I am no viper, yet I feed

109
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.470
On mother's flesh whichdid me breed.

110
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.300
I sought a husband, inwhich labour

111
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.000
I found that kindness in afather:

112
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.800
He's father, son, andhusband mild;

113
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.530
I mother, wife, and yethis child.

114
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.900
How they may be, and yetin two,

115
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.630
As you will live, resolveit you.

116
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:26.430
Sharp physic is the last:but, O you powers

117
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.030
That give heaven countlesseyes to view men's acts,

118
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.230
Why cloud they not theirsights perpetually,

119
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.300
If this be true, whichmakes me pale to read it?

120
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:56.100
Fair glass of light, Iloved you, and could still,

121
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.670
Were not this gloriouscasket stored with ill:

122
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.430
But I must tell you, nowmy thoughts revolt

123
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.370
For he's no man on whomperfections wait

124
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.530
That, knowing sin within,will touch the gate.

125
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.600
You are a fair viol, andyour sense the strings;

126
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.770
Who, finger'd to make manhis lawful music,

127
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.430
Would draw heaven down, andall the gods, to hearken:

128
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.130
But being play'd uponbefore your time,

129
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:29.500
Hell only danceth at soharsh a chime.

130
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.400
Good sooth, I care not foryou.

131
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.170
Prince Pericles, touchnot, upon thy life.

132
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.570
For that's an articlewithin our law,

133
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:45.900
As dangerous as the rest.Your time's expired:

134
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.300
Either expound now, orreceive your sentence.

135
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.200
Great king,

136
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.100
Few love to hear the sinsthey love to act;

137
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.400
'Twould braid yourself toonear for me to tell it.

138
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.930
Who has a book of all thatmonarchs do,

139
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.570
He's more secure to keepit shut than shown:

140
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.470
For vice repeated is likethe wandering wind.

141
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.330
Blows dust in other'seyes, to spread itself;

142
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.430
And yet the end of all isbought thus dear,

143
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.830
The breath is gone, andthe sore eyes see clear:

144
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.470
To stop the air would hurtthem. The blind mole casts

145
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.530
Copp'd hills towards heaven,to tell the earth is throng'd

146
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:28.130
By man's oppression; and thepoor worm doth die for't.

147
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:33.000
Kings are earth's gods; invice their law's their will;

148
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.900
And if Jove stray, whodares say Jove doth ill?

149
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.530
It is enough you know; andit is fit,

150
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.900
What being more known growsworse, to smother it.

151
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.370
All love the womb thattheir first being bred,

152
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.400
Then give my tongue likeleave to love my head.

153
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.600
Would that I had thy head!

154
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.970
He has found the meaning:

155
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.600
But I will gloze with him.--

156
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.300
Young prince of Tyre,

157
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.470
Though by the tenor of ourstrict edict,

158
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.300
Your expositionmisinterpreting,

159
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.600
We might proceed to cancelof your days;

160
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.670
Yet hope, succeeding fromso fair a tree

161
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.700
As your fair self, dothtune us otherwise:

162
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.270
Forty days longer we dorespite you;

163
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.900
If by which time oursecret be undone,

164
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.300
This mercy shows we'll joyin such a son:

165
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.370
And until then yourentertain shall be

166
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.530
As doth befit our honourand your worth.

167
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.700
How courtesy would seem tocover sin,

168
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.470
When what is done is likean hypocrite,

169
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:57.170
The which is good innothing but in sight!

170
00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.230
If it be true that Iinterpret false,

171
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.000
Then were it certain youwere not so bad

172
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.630
As with foul incest toabuse your soul;

173
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:11.600
Where now you're both afather and a son,

174
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.270
By your untimely claspingswith your child,

175
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:20.300
Which pleasure fits anhusband, not a father;

176
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.300
And she an eater of hermother's flesh,

177
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.330
By the defiling of herparent's bed;

178
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.530
And both like serpentsare, who though they feed

179
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:36.570
On sweetest flowers, yetthey poison breed.

180
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:42.370
Antioch, farewell! forwisdom sees, those men

181
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.470
Blush not in actionsblacker than the night,

182
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.470
Will shun no course tokeep them from the light.

183
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.430
One sin, I know, anotherdoth provoke;

184
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.530
Murder's as near to lustas flame to smoke:

185
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.270
Poison and treason are thehands of sin,

186
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:58.500
Ay, and the targets, toput off the shame:

187
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.870
Then, lest my lie becropp'd to keep you clear,

188
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.730
By flight I'll shun thedanger which I fear.

189
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.630
He hath found the meaning,for which I mean

190
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.570
To have his head.

191
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.770
He must not live totrumpet forth my infamy,

192
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:25.330
Nor tell the worldAntiochus doth sin

193
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.000
In such a loathed manner;

194
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.530
And therefore instantlythis prince must die:

195
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.670
For by his fall my honourmust keep high.

196
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.770
Who attends us there?

197
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.430
Doth your highness call?

198
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.600
Thaliard,

199
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.430
You are of our chamber Thaliard,and our mind partakes

200
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.030
Her private actions toyour secrecy;

201
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.930
And for your faithfulnesswe will advance you.

202
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:04.600
Thaliard, behold, here'spoison, and here's gold;

203
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.800
We hate the prince of Tyre,and thou must kill him:

204
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.270
It fits thee not to askthe reason why,

205
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.000
Because we bid it. Say, isit done?

206
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.530
My lord,

207
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.130
'Tis done.

208
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.100
Enough.

209
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.430
Let your breath coolyourself, telling your haste.

210
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.900
My lord, prince Periclesis fled.

211
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.430
As thou wilt live, fly after:

212
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.430
and like an arrow shot

213
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.070
From a well-experiencedarcher hits the mark

214
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.930
His eye doth level at, sothou ne'er return

215
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.130
Unless thou say 'PrincePericles is dead.'

216
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.330
My lord,

217
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.870
If I can get him within mypistol's length,

218
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.600
I'll make him sure enough: so,farewell to your highness.

219
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.630
Thaliard, adieu!

220
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.300
Till Pericles be dead,

221
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.700
My heart can lend nosuccor to my head.

222
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:12.200
(â™ª music)

223
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.200
Let none disturb us.--

224
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.570
Why should thischange of thoughts,

225
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.000
The sad companion,dull-eyed melancholy,

226
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.270
Be my so used a guest asnot an hour,

227
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:48.170
In the day's gloriouswalk, or peaceful night,

228
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:55.570
The tomb where grief shouldsleep, can breed me quiet?

229
00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:01.870
Here pleasures court mineeyes, and mine eyes shun them,

230
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.900
And danger, which Ifear'd, is at Antioch,

231
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.570
Whose aim seems far tooshort to hit me here:

232
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.130
Yet neither pleasure's artcan joy my spirits,

233
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:17.400
Nor yet the other'sdistance comfort me.

234
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.430
Then it is thus: thepassions of the mind,

235
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.800
That have their firstconception by mis-dread,

236
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.700
Have after-nourishment andlife by care;

237
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.300
And what was first butfear what might be done,

238
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:35.270
Grows elder now and caresit be not done.

239
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.130
And so with me: the greatAntiochus,

240
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.030
'Gainst whom I am toolittle to contend,

241
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.970
Since he's so great canmake his will his act,

242
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:48.300
Will think me speaking,though I swear to silence;

243
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.470
Nor boots it me to say Ihonour him.

244
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.870
If he suspect I maydishonour him:

245
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.700
And what may make himblush in being known,

246
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.630
He'll stop the course bywhich it might be known;

247
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.100
With hostile forces he'llo'erspread the land,

248
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.100
And with the ostent of warwill look so huge,

249
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.270
Amazement shall drivecourage from the state;

250
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.800
Our men be vanquish'd erethey do resist,

251
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:17.130
And subjects punish'd thatne'er thought offence:

252
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.370
Which care of them, notpity of myself,

253
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.230
Who am no more but as thetops of trees,

254
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.900
Which fence the roots theygrow by and defend them,

255
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:35.770
Makes both my body pineand soul to languish,

256
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.770
And punish that beforethat he would punish.

257
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.930
Joy and all comfort inyour sacred breast!

258
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.900
And keep your mind,Peaceful and comfortable!

259
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:54.530
Peace, peace, and giveexperience tongue.

260
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.370
They do abuse the kingthat flatter him:

261
00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.700
For flattery is thebellows blows up sin;

262
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.500
Whereas reproof, obedientand in order,

263
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.370
Fits kings, as they aremen, for they may err.

264
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.470
When Signior Sooth heredoes proclaim a peace,

265
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.430
He flatters you, makes warupon your life.

266
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.030
Prince, pardon me, orstrike me, if you please;

267
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.970
I cannot be much lowerthan my knees.

268
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.930
All leave us else; but letyour cares o'erlook

269
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.770
What shipping and whatlading's in our haven,

270
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.430
And then return to us.

271
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.700
Helicanus, thou Hast moved us:

272
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.000
what seest thou in our looks?

273
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.500
An angry brow, dread lord.

274
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.400
If there be such a dart inprinces' frowns,

275
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.600
How durst thy tongue moveanger to our face?

276
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.730
How dare the plants lookup to heaven, from whence

277
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.400
They have theirnourishment?

278
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.130
Thou know'st I have power

279
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:38.270
To take thy life fromthee.

280
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.730
I have ground the axemyself;

281
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:46.700
Do you but strike theblow.

282
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.800
Rise, prithee, rise.

283
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.830
Sit down: thou art noflatterer:

284
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.670
I thank thee for it; andheaven forbid

285
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.570
That kings should let theirears hear their faults hid!

286
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.370
Fit counsellor and servantfor a prince,

287
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.370
Who by thy wisdom makest aprince thy servant,

288
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.100
What wouldst thou have medo?

289
00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.500
To bear with patience

290
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.700
Such griefs as you dolay upon yourself.

291
00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.370
Thou speak'st like aphysician, Helicanus,

292
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.570
That minister'st a potionunto me

293
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:22.730
That thou wouldst trembleto receive thyself.

294
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.370
Attend me, then: I went toAntioch,

295
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.870
Where as thou know'st,against the face of death,

296
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.930
I sought the purchase of aglorious beauty.

297
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.370
From whence an issue Imight propagate,

298
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.470
Are arms to princes, andbring joys to subjects.

299
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:49.930
Her face was to mine eyebeyond all wonder;

300
00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:59.970
The rest--hark in thineear--as black as incest:

301
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:07.430
The rest--hark in thineear--as black as incest:

302
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.970
Which by my knowledgefound, the sinful father

303
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.700
Seem'd not to strike, butsmooth: but thou know'st this,

304
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.500
'Tis time to fear whentyrants seem to kiss.

305
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.770
Such fear so grew in me, Ihither fled,

306
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.470
Under the covering of acareful night,

307
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.930
Who seem'd my goodprotector; and, being here,

308
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.870
Bethought me what waspast, what might succeed.

309
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.100
I knew him tyrannous; andtyrants' fears

310
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.800
Decrease not, but growfaster than the years:

311
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.270
And should he doubt it, asno doubt he doth,

312
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.370
That I should open to thelistening air

313
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.500
How many worthy princes'bloods were shed,

314
00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.470
To keep his bed ofblackness unlaid ope,

315
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.600
To lop that doubt, he'llfill this land with arms,

316
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.800
And make pretence of wrongthat I have done him:

317
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.700
When all, for mine, if Imay call offence,

318
00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:04.070
Must feel war's blow, whospares not innocence:

319
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:06.300
Which love to all, ofwhich thyself art one,

320
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.770
Who now reprovest me forit,--

321
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:08.870
Alas, sir!

322
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.130
Drew sleep out of mineeyes, blood from my cheeks,

323
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.630
Musings into my mind, withthousand doubts

324
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:19.730
How I might stop thistempest ere it came;

325
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.500
And finding little comfortto relieve them,

326
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.530
I thought it princelycharity to grieve for them.

327
00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.330
Well, my lord, since you havegiven me leave to speak.

328
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.900
Freely will I speak.Antiochus you fear,

329
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.800
And justly too, I think,you fear the tyrant,

330
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.700
Who either by public waror private treason

331
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.400
Will take away your life.

332
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.700
Therefore, my lord, gotravel for a while,

333
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.230
Till that his rage andanger be forgot,

334
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.000
Or till the Destinies docut his thread of life.

335
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.170
Your rule direct to any;if to me.

336
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.430
Day serves not light morefaithful than I'll be.

337
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.430
I do not doubt thy faith;

338
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.770
But should he wrong myliberties in my absence?

339
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.070
We'll mingle our bloodstogether in the earth,

340
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:19.170
From whence we had ourbeing and our birth.

341
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:29.730
Tyre, I now look from theethen, and to Tarsus

342
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.200
Intend my travel, whereI'll hear from thee;

343
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.000
And by whose letters I'lldispose myself.

344
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.100
The care I had and have ofsubjects' good

345
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.870
On thee I lay whose wisdom'sstrength can bear it.

346
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:45.330
I'll take thy word forfaith, not ask thine oath:

347
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:49.670
Who shuns not to break onewill sure crack both:

348
00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.670
But in our orbs we'll liveso round and safe,

349
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:57.000
That time of both thistruth shall ne'er convince,

350
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:04.170
Thou show'dst a subject'sshine, I a true prince.

351
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:21.930
(â™ª music)

352
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:38.430
So, this is Tyre,and this the court.

353
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.230
Here must I kill King Pericles;

354
00:23:51.230 --> 00:24:00.730
and if I do it not, I amsure to be hanged at home:

355
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:07.030
'tis dangerous.Well, I perceive

356
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.300
he was a wise fellow, andhad good discretion, that,

357
00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:15.030
being bid to ask what hewould of the king, desired

358
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:19.430
he might know none of hissecrets: now do I see he

359
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.670
had some reason for't; forif a king bid a man be a

360
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.430
villain, he's bound by theindenture of his oath to

361
00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:30.870
be one! Hush! here comethe lords of Tyre.

362
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.670
You shall not need, myfellow peers of Tyre,

363
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.100
Further to question me ofyour king's departure:

364
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.730
His seal'd commission,left in trust with me,

365
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:45.670
Doth speak sufficientlyhe's gone to travel.

366
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.130
How! the king gone!

367
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.830
If further yet you will besatisfied,

368
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.130
Why, as it were unlicensedof your loves,

369
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:56.370
He would depart, I'll givesome light unto you.

370
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.330
Being at Antioch--

371
00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.570
What from Antioch?

372
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.400
Royal Antiochus--on whatcause I know not--

373
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.430
Took some displeasure athim; at least he judged so:

374
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.100
And doubting lest that hehad err'd or sinn'd,

375
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.200
To show his sorrow, he'ldcorrect himself;

376
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.830
So puts himself unto theshipman's toil,

377
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.930
With whom each minutethreatens life or death.

378
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.030
Well, I perceive

379
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:22.600
I shall not be hang'd now,

380
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.270
But since he's gone, theking's seas must please:

381
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.470
He 'scaped the land, toperish at the sea.

382
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:36.630
I'll present myself. Peaceto the lords of Tyre!

383
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.170
Lord Thaliard fromAntiochus is welcome.

384
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.000
From him I come

385
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.370
With message unto princelyPericles;

386
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.870
But since my landing Ihave understood

387
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.200
Your lord has betookhimself to unknown travels,

388
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.930
My message must returnfrom whence it came.

389
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.130
We have no reason todesire it,

390
00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:00.330
Commended to our master,not to us:

391
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.200
Yet, ere you shall depart,this we desire,

392
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.900
As friends to Antioch, wemay feast in Tyre.

393
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:19.630
(â™ª music)

394
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.600
My Dionyza, shall we restus here,

395
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.100
And by relating tales ofothers' griefs,

396
00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.870
See if 'twill teach us toforget our own?

397
00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:01.500
That were to blow at firein hope to quench it;

398
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.930
For who digs hills becausethey do aspire

399
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.130
Throws down one mountainto cast up a higher.

400
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:14.230
O my distressed lord, evensuch our griefs are;

401
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.130
Here they're but felt, andseen with mischief's eyes,

402
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.970
But like to groves, beingtopp'd, they higher rise.

403
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.430
O Dionyza,

404
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.400
Who wanteth food, and willnot say he wants it,

405
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.300
Or can conceal his hungertill he famish?

406
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.470
Our tongues and sorrows force usto sound deep

407
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.470
Our woes into the air; oureyes do weep,

408
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.300
Till tongues fetch breath thatmay proclaim them louder;

409
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.900
That, if heaven slumberwhile their creatures want,

410
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.570
They may awake their helpsto comfort them.

411
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:56.030
I'll then discourse ourwoes, felt several years,

412
00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:00.770
And wanting breath tospeak help me with tears.

413
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.600
I'll do my best, sir.

414
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:09.130
This Tarsus, o'er which Ihave the government,

415
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.600
A city on whom plenty heldfull hand,

416
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.770
For riches strew'd herselfeven in the streets;

417
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:20.730
Whose towers bore heads sohigh they kiss'd the clouds,

418
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.530
And strangers ne'er beheldbut wondered at;

419
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:27.300
Whose men and dames sojetted and adorn'd,

420
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.370
Like one another's glassto trim them by:

421
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.130
Their tables were storedfull, to glad the sight,

422
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.000
And not so much to feed onas delight;

423
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.170
All poverty was scorn'd,and pride so great,

424
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.470
The name of help grewodious to repeat.

425
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.770
O, 'tis too true.

426
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.600
But see what heaven cando! By this our change,

427
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.170
These mouths, who but oflate, earth, sea, and air,

428
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.330
Were all too little tocontent and please,

429
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.200
Although they gave theircreatures in abundance,

430
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.030
As houses are defiled forwant of use,

431
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.500
They are now starved forwant of exercise:

432
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:07.930
Those palates who, not yettwo summers younger,

433
00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.870
Must have inventions todelight the taste,

434
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:15.270
Would now be glad ofbread, and beg for it:

435
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.230
Those mothers who, tonousle up their babes,

436
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.370
Thought nought toocurious, are ready now

437
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.830
To eat those littledarlings whom they loved.

438
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.470
So sharp are hunger'steeth, that man and wife

439
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:29.430
Draw lots who first shalldie to lengthen life:

440
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:32.770
Here stands a lord, andthere a lady weeping;

441
00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.470
Here many sink, yet thosewhich see them fall

442
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:40.570
Have scarce strength leftto give them burial.

443
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.270
Is not this true?

444
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.770
Our cheeks and hollow eyesdo witness it.

445
00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.800
O, let those cities thatof plenty's cup

446
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.370
And her prosperities solargely taste,

447
00:29:51.370 --> 00:30:00.170
With their superfluousriots, hear these tears!

448
00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:04.700
The misery of Tarsus maybe theirs.

449
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.570
Where's the lord governor?

450
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.700
Here.

451
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.600
Speak out thy sorrows whichthou bring'st in haste,

452
00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.930
For comfort is too far forus to expect.

453
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.570
We have descried, upon ourneighbouring shore,

454
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.330
A portly sail of shipsmake hitherward.

455
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.830
I thought as much.

456
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.030
One sorrow never comes butbrings an heir,

457
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:29.270
That may succeed as hisinheritor;

458
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.670
And so in ours: someneighbouring nation,

459
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.570
Taking advantage of ourmisery,

460
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.270
Hath stuff'd these hollowvessels with their power,

461
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.930
To beat us down, the whichare down already;

462
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:49.100
And make a conquest ofunhappy me,

463
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.400
That's the least fear;for, by the semblance

464
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.830
Of their white flags display'd,they bring us peace,

465
00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:00.170
And come to us asfavourers, not as foes.

466
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.530
Thou speak'st like him'suntutor'd to repeat:

467
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.330
Who makes the fairest showmeans most deceit.

468
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.070
But bring they what theywill and what they can,

469
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.470
What need we fear?

470
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:14.600
The ground's the lowest,and we are half way there.

471
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.530
Go tell their general weattend him here,

472
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.800
To know for what he comes,and whence he comes,

473
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.030
And what he craves.

474
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.630
I go, my lord.

475
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:27.300
Welcome is peace, if he onpeace consist;

476
00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.700
If wars, we are unable toresist.

477
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:38.100
(â™ª music)

478
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.830
Lord governor, for so wehear you are,

479
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.870
Let not our ships andnumber of our men

480
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.300
Be like a beacon fired toamaze your eyes.

481
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.130
We have heard yourmiseries as far as Tyre,

482
00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:56.200
And seen the desolation ofyour streets:

483
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.600
Nor come we to add sorrowto your hearts,

484
00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.670
But to relieve them oftheir heavy load;

485
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:03.430
And these our ships, youhappily may think

486
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.770
Are like the Trojan horsewas stuff'd within

487
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.770
With bloody veins,expecting overthrow,

488
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:13.270
Are stored with corn tomake your needy bread,

489
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.870
And give them life whomhunger starved half dead.

490
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:19.100
The gods of Greece protectyou!

491
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.000
And we'll pray for you.

492
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:35.230
Arise, I pray you, rise:

493
00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.870
We do not look forreverence, but for love,

494
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.430
And harbourage for ourself,our ships, and men.

495
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:50.470
The which when any shallnot gratify,

496
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.930
Or pay you withunthankfulness in thought,

497
00:32:53.930 --> 00:33:02.000
Be it our wives, ourchildren, or ourselves,

498
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.470
The curse of heaven andmen succeed their evils!

499
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.670
Till when,--the which Ihope shall ne'er be seen,--

500
00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:15.800
Your grace is welcome toour town and us.

501
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.130
Which welcome we'llaccept; feast here awhile,

502
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:24.900
Until our stars that frownlend us a smile.

503
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:30.270
(â™ª music)

504
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.300
Here have you seen amighty king

505
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.930
His child, I wis, toincest bring;

506
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.630
A better prince and benignlord,

507
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:58.200
That will prove awful bothin deed and word.

508
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.970
Be quiet then as menshould be,

509
00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.070
Till he hath pass'dnecessity.

510
00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:04.900
I'll show you those introubles reign,

511
00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:08.830
Losing a mite, a mountaingain.

512
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.130
The good in conversation,

513
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.400
To whom I give my benison,

514
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.230
Is still at Tarsus, whereeach man

515
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.870
Thinks all is writ hespoken can;

516
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.270
And, to remember what hedoes,

517
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.930
Build his statue to makehim glorious:

518
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.730
But tidings to thecontrary

519
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:31.000
Are brought your eyes;what need speak I?

520
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.270
Good Helicane, hath stay'dat home,

521
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.100
Not to eat honey like adrone

522
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.470
From others' labours; forthough he strive

523
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.370
To killen bad, keep goodalive;

524
00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.200
And to fulfil his prince'desire,

525
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.700
Sends word of all thathaps in Tyre:

526
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.330
How Thaliard came fullbent with sin

527
00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.200
And had intent to murderhim;

528
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.530
And that in Tarsus was notbest

529
00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:01.430
Longer for him to make hisrest.

530
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.430
He, doing so, put forth toseas,

531
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:08.400
Where when men been,there's seldom ease;

532
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.000
For now the wind begins toblow;

533
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.030
Thunder above and deepsbelow

534
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:15.470
Make such unquiet, thatthe ship

535
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:19.270
Should house him safe iswreck'd and split;

536
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.930
And he, good prince,having all lost,

537
00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.530
By waves from coast tocoast is tost:

538
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.730
All perishen of man, ofpelf,

539
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.630
Ne aught escapen buthimself;

540
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.800
Till fortune, tired withdoing bad,

541
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.570
Threw him ashore, to givehim glad:

542
00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:42.670
And here he comes. Whatshall be next,

543
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:47.170
Pardon old Gower,--thislongs the text.

544
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:58.000
Yet cease your ire, youangry stars of heaven!

545
00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.670
Wind, rain, and thunder,remember, earthly man

546
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.300
Is but a substance thatmust yield to you;

547
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.600
And I, as fits my nature,do obey you:

548
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.600
Alas, the sea hath cast meon the rocks,

549
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:27.730
Wash'd me from shore toshore, and left me breath

550
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:33.130
Nothing to think on butensuing death:

551
00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:35.030
Let it suffice thegreatness of your powers

552
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.900
To have bereft a prince ofall his fortunes;

553
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.900
And having thrown him fromyour watery grave,

554
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:48.370
Here to have death inpeace is all he'll crave.

555
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.130
What, ho, Pilch!

556
00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.100
Ha, come and bring awaythe nets!

557
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.200
What, Patch-breech, I say!

558
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.070
What say you, master?

559
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.200
Look how thou stirrestnow! come away, or I'll

560
00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.670
fetch thee with a wanion.

561
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:13.600
Faith, master, I am thinkingof the poor men that

562
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.470
were cast away before useven now.

563
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.970
Alas, poor souls, it grievedmy heart to hear what

564
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.300
pitiful cries they made tous to help them, when,

565
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.700
well-a-day, we couldscarce help ourselves.

566
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.330
Nay, master, said not I asmuch when I saw the

567
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.570
porpus how he bounced andtumbled? they say

568
00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:36.070
they're half fish, halfflesh: a plague on them,

569
00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.900
they ne'er come but I lookto be washed. Master, I

570
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.430
marvel how the fishes livein the sea.

571
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.700
Why, as men do a-land; thegreat ones eat up the

572
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.830
little ones: I can compareyour rich misers to

573
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.270
nothing so fitly as to awhale; a' plays and

574
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.700
tumbles, driving the poorfry before him, and at

575
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.900
last devours them all at amouthful: such whales

576
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.900
have I heard on o' the land,who never leave gaping

577
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.330
till they've swallowed thewhole parish, church,

578
00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.370
steeple, bells, and all.

579
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.900
A pretty moral.

580
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.130
But, master, if I hadbeen the sexton,

581
00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.630
I would have been thatday in the belfry.

582
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.000
Why, man?

583
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.800
Because he should haveswallowed me too: and when I

584
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.170
had been in his belly, Iwould have kept such a

585
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.570
jangling of the bells, thathe should never have left,

586
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.830
till he cast bells,steeple, church,

587
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:32.000
and parish up again. But ifthe good King Simonides

588
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.930
were of my mind,--

589
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.000
Simonides!

590
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.130
We would purge the land ofthese drones, that rob

591
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.330
the bee of her honey.

592
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:40.970
How from the finnysubject of the sea

593
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.930
These fishers tell theinfirmities of men;

594
00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:46.370
And from their wateryempire recollect

595
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:50.500
All that may men approveor men detect!

596
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.900
Peace be at your labour,honest fishermen.

597
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.500
Honest! good fellow, what'sthat? If it be a day fits you,

598
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.430
search out of the calendar,and nobody look after it.

599
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.600
May see the sea hath castupon your coast.

600
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.100
What a drunken knave was thesea to cast thee in our way!

601
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.800
A man whom both thewaters and the wind,

602
00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.370
In that vast tennis-court,have made the ball

603
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:30.730
For them to play upon,entreats you pity him:

604
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:36.100
He asks of you, that neverused to beg.

605
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.400
No, friend, cannot youbeg? Here's them in our

606
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.130
land of Greece getsmore with begging

607
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:45.630
than we can get with working.

608
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.970
Canst thou catch anyfishes, then?

609
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.670
I never practised it.

610
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.870
Nay, then thou wilt starve,sure; for here's nothing

611
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:55.430
to be got now-a-days, unlessthou canst fish for't.

612
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.900
What I have been I haveforgot to know;

613
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:05.100
But what I am, wantteaches me to think on:

614
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:11.600
A man throng'd up withcold: my veins are chill,

615
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.400
And have no more of lifethan may suffice

616
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.330
To give my tongue thatheat to ask your help;

617
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.400
Which if you shall refuse,when I am dead,

618
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.470
For that I am a man, praysee me buried.

619
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:30.230
Die quoth-a? Now godsforbid! I have a coat here;

620
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:36.400
come, put it on; keep theewarm. Now, afore me,

621
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.300
a handsome fellow! Come,thou shalt go home,

622
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.970
and we'll have fleshfor holidays,

623
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:44.030
fish for fasting-days,and moreo'er puddings

624
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.670
and flap-jacks, andthou shalt be welcome.

625
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.670
I thank you, sir.

626
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.800
Hark you, my friend; yousaid you could not beg.

627
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.130
I did but crave.

628
00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.700
But crave! Then I'll turncraver too, and so I

629
00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.400
shall 'scape whipping.

630
00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.070
Why, are all your beggarswhipped, then?

631
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.430
O, not all, my friend, notall; for if all your

632
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.230
beggars were whipped, Iwould wish no better office

633
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:10.800
than to be beadle. But, master,I'll go draw up the net.

634
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.200
How well this honest mirthbecomes their labour!

635
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.730
Hark you, friend, do you knowwhere ye are?

636
00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:21.900
Not well.

637
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:28.800
Why, I'll tell thee: thisis called Pentapolis,

638
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.170
and our king thegood Simonides.

639
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.900
The good Simonides,do you call him.

640
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.070
Ay, sir; and he deservesso to be called for his

641
00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:38.700
peaceable reign and goodgovernment.

642
00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:40.870
He is a happy king, sincehe gains from his subjects

643
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:44.800
the name of good by hisgovernment. How far is his

644
00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.270
court distant from thisshore?

645
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:53.200
Marry, sir, halfa day's journey:

646
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.700
and I'll tell thee, hehath a fair daughter,

647
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.100
and to-morrow is her birth-day;and there be knights

648
00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.130
and princes come from allparts of the world to just

649
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.600
and tourney for her love.

650
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.870
Were my fortunesequal to my desires,

651
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:09.170
I could wish to make one there.

652
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.570
O, sir, things must be asthey may; and what a man

653
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.300
may not get, he may lawfullydeal for--his wife's soul.

654
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:20.100
Help, master, help! here'sa fish hangs in the net,

655
00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:29.770
like a poor man's right in thelaw; 'twill hardly come out.

656
00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:33.800
Ha! bots on't, 'tiscome at last,

657
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.170
and 'tis turned toa rusty armour.

658
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:45.070
An armour, friends! I prayyou, let me see it.

659
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.470
Thanks, fortune, yet, that,after all my crosses,

660
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.730
Thou givest me somewhat torepair myself;

661
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.170
And though it was mineown, part of my heritage,

662
00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.570
Which my dead father didbequeath to me.

663
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.870
With this strict charge,even as he left his life,

664
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.270
'Keep it, my Pericles; ithath been a shield

665
00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.930
Twixt me and death;'--andpointed to this brace;--

666
00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:10.630
'For that it saved me, keepit; in like necessity--

667
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.330
The which the godsprotect thee from!--

668
00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:15.200
may defend thee.'

669
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.730
It kept where I kept, I sodearly loved it;

670
00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:21.770
Till the rough seas, thatspare not any man,

671
00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:27.330
Took it in rage, thoughcalm'd have given't again:

672
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:32.270
I thank thee for't: myshipwreck now's no ill,

673
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:33.970
Since I have here myfather's gift in's will.

674
00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:35.630
What mean you, sir?

675
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.370
To beg of you, kind friends,this coat of worth,

676
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.270
For it was sometime targetto a king;

677
00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:43.330
I know it by this mark. Heloved me dearly,

678
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:45.770
And for his sake I wishthe having of it;

679
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.500
And that you'ld guide meto your sovereign's court,

680
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.970
Where with it I may appeara gentleman;

681
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.930
And if that ever my lowfortune's better,

682
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:55.770
I'll pay your bounties;till then rest your debtor.

683
00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:59.230
Why, wilt thou tourney forthe lady?

684
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.130
I'll show the virtue Ihave borne in arms.

685
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:07.370
Why, do 'e take it, and thegods give thee good on't!

686
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:13.200
Ay, but hark you, my friend;'twas we that made up

687
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.130
this garment through therough seams of the waters:

688
00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.300
there are certaincondolements, certain vails.

689
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.530
I hope, sir, if you thrive,you'll remember from

690
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.570
whence you had it.

691
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.870
Believe 't, I will.

692
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.600
By your furtherance I amclothed in steel;

693
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.070
And, spite of all therapture of the sea,

694
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:30.800
This jewel holds hisbuilding on my arm:

695
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.230
Unto thy value I willmount myself

696
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.200
Upon a courser, whosedelightful steps

697
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.030
Shall make the gazer joyto see him tread.

698
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.800
Only, my friend, I yet amunprovided

699
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.200
Of a pair of bases.

700
00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.130
We'll sure provide: thoushalt have my best gown to

701
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:47.730
make thee a pair; and I'llbring thee to the court myself.

702
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.930
Then honour be but equalto my will,

703
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:58.330
This day I'll rise, orelse add ill to ill.

704
00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:10.830
(â™ª music)

705
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.330
Are the knights ready tobegin the triumph?

706
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:29.600
They are, my liege;

707
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.730
And stay your coming topresent themselves.

708
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.500
Return them, we are ready;and our daughter,

709
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.670
In honour of whose birththese triumphs are,

710
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:39.800
Sits here, like beauty'schild, whom nature gat

711
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:43.570
For men to see, and seeingwonder at.

712
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.500
It pleaseth you, my royalfather, to express

713
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.130
My commendations great,whose merit's less.

714
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:50.830
It's fit it should be so;for princes are

715
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:55.170
A model which heaven makeslike to itself:

716
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.200
As jewels lose their gloryif neglected,

717
00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:02.400
So princes their renownsif not respected.

718
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:05.930
'Tis now your honour,daughter, to entertain

719
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.870
The labour of each knightin his device.

720
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.970
Which, to preserve minehonour, I'll perform.

721
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:16.270
Who is the first that dothprefer himself?

722
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:20.600
A knight of Sparta, myrenowned father;

723
00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.800
And the device he bearsupon his shield

724
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.300
Is a black Ethiopereaching at the sun

725
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.070
The word, 'Lux tua vitamihi.'

726
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.500
He loves you well thatholds his life of you.

727
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:39.130
Who is the second thatpresents himself?

728
00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:43.430
A prince of Macedon, myroyal father;

729
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.370
And the device he bearsupon his shield

730
00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.200
Is an arm'd knight that'sconquer'd by a lady;

731
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.170
The motto thus, in Spanish,

732
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:58.830
'Piu por dulzuraque por fuerza.'

733
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:07.400
Ah, May gentleness, not force,win me the day.

734
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.630
And what's the third?

735
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.300
The third of Antioch;

736
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.030
And his device, a wreathof chivalry;

737
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:17.670
The word, 'Me pompaeprovexit apex.'

738
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:21.070
Desire to gain renoun hath setme on

739
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.630
This is the fourth.

740
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.600
A burning torch that'sturned upside down;

741
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.130
The word, 'Quod me alit,me extinguit.'

742
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:39.170
Which shows that beautyhath his power and will,

743
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:45.230
It can as well inflameas it can kill.

744
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:49.830
The fifth, an handenvironed with clouds,

745
00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:54.370
Holding out gold that's bythe touchstone tried;

746
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:59.170
The motto thus, 'Sicspectanda fides.'

747
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:02.970
Thus can you try unlastingfaithfulness.

748
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:34.770
And what's the sixth and last,

749
00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.030
the which the knight himself

750
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.900
With such a gracefulcourtesy deliver'd?

751
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.070
He seems to be a stranger;but his present is

752
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:48.970
A wither'd branch, that'sonly green at top;

753
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:55.830
The motto, 'In hac spevivo.'

754
00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:57.000
A pretty moral;

755
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.130
In this hope, I live.

756
00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.170
From the dejected statewherein he is,

757
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:07.070
He hopes by you hisfortunes yet may flourish.

758
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:09.070
He had need mean betterthan his outward show

759
00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.470
Can any way speak in hisjust commend;

760
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.430
For by his rusty outsidehe appears

761
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:17.470
To have practised more thewhipstock than the lance.

762
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.000
He well may be a stranger,for he comes

763
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.800
To an honour'd triumphstrangely furnished.

764
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.830
And on set purpose let hisarmour rust

765
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:26.470
Until this day, to scourit in the dust.

766
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.170
Opinion's but a fool, thatmakes us scan

767
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.700
The outward habit by theinward man.

768
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.500
But stay, the knights arecoming: we will withdraw

769
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.600
Into the gallery.

770
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:50.070
(â™ª music and the sound of a crowd)

771
00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.070
(horses hooves and chantingcrowds)

772
00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.170


773
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.730
Knights,

774
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.970
To say you're welcome weresuperfluous.

775
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.430
To place upon the volumeof your deeds,

776
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.930
As in a title-page, yourworth in arms,

777
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:30.630
Were more than you expect,or more than's fit,

778
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.570
Since every worth in showcommends itself.

779
00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:37.170
Prepare for mirth, formirth becomes a feast:

780
00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:44.070
You are princes and myguests.

781
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:46.930
But you, my knight andguest;

782
00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:48.470
To whom this wreath ofvictory I give,

783
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:51.030
And crown you king of thisday's happiness.

784
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:53.000
'Tis more by fortune,lady, than by merit.

785
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.200
Call it by what you will,the day is yours;

786
00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.670
And here, I hope, is nonethat envies it.

787
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.000
In framing an artist, arthath thus decreed,

788
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.200
To make some good, butothers to exceed;

789
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.900
And you are herlabour'd scholar.

790
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:14.230
Come, queen o' the feast,--

791
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:18.930
For, daughter, so you are,--

792
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.330
here take your place:

793
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:33.800
Marshal the rest, as theydeserve their grace.

794
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.600
We are honour'd much bygood Simonides.

795
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.170
Your presence glads ourdays: honour we love;

796
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:42.530
For who hates honour hatesthe gods above.

797
00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.000
Sir, yonder is your place.

798
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.530
Some other is more fit.

799
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:02.230
Contend not, sir; for weare gentlemen

800
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.030
That neither in our heartsnor outward eyes

801
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:07.030
Envy the great nor do thelow despise.

802
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:08.370
You are right courteousknights.

803
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:11.200
Sit, sir, sit.

804
00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:31.430
By Jove, I wonder, that isking of thoughts,

805
00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:35.030
These cates resist me, hebut thought upon.

806
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:38.130
By Juno, that is queen ofmarriage,

807
00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.800
All viands that I eat doseem unsavoury.

808
00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:48.800
Wishing him my meat. Sure,he's a gallant gentleman.

809
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.470
He's but a countrygentleman;

810
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:53.270
Has done no more thanother knights have done;

811
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:58.070
Has broken a staff or so;so let it pass.

812
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.970
To me he seems likediamond to glass.

813
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:05.630
Yon king's to me like tomy father's picture,

814
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.270
Which tells me in thatglory once he was;

815
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:11.070
Had princes sit, likestars, about his throne,

816
00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:13.770
And he the sun, for themto reverence;

817
00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:16.100
None that beheld him, but,like lesser lights,

818
00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:19.170
Did vail their crowns tohis supremacy:

819
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:23.570
Where now his son's like aglow-worm in the night,

820
00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:27.770
The which hath fire indarkness, none in light:

821
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:32.600
Whereby I see that Time'sthe king of men,

822
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.400
He's both their parent,and he is their grave,

823
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:40.400
And gives them what hewill, not what they crave.

824
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.100
What, are you merry,knights?

825
00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.430
Who can be other in thisroyal presence?

826
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:54.530
Here, with a cup that'sstored unto the brim,--

827
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:59.930
As you do love, fill toyour mistress' lips,--

828
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:05.070
We drink this health toyou.

829
00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:06.800
We thank your grace.

830
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.730
Yet pause awhile:

831
00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.130
Yon knight doth sit toomelancholy,

832
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:25.400
As if the entertainment inour court

833
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.800
Had not a show mightcountervail his worth.

834
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.400
Note it not you, Thaisa?

835
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.200
What is't to me, my father?

836
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.200
O, attend, my daughter:

837
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.770
Princes in this shouldlive like gods above,

838
00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:37.130
Who freely give to everyone that comes

839
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.070
To honour them:

840
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:42.370
Therefore to make hisentertain more sweet,

841
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:47.970
Here, say we drink thisstanding-bowl of wine to him.

842
00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.000
Alas, my father, it befitsnot me

843
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.530
Unto a stranger knight tobe so bold:

844
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:02.300
He may my proffer take foran offence,

845
00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.030
Since men take women'sgifts for impudence.

846
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.000
How!

847
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.700
Do as I bid you, or you'llmove me else.

848
00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.100
Now, by the gods, he couldnot please me better.

849
00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.130
And furthermore tell him,we desire to know

850
00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:21.670
Of whence he is, his nameand parentage.

851
00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:36.430
The king my father, sir,has drunk to you.

852
00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.270
I thank him.

853
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.070
Wishing it so much bloodunto your life.

854
00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:45.000
I thank both him and you,and pledge him freely.

855
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:49.270
And further he desires toknow of you,

856
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:52.300
Of whence you are, yourname and parentage.

857
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:56.130
A gentleman of Tyre; myname, Pericles;

858
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.730
My education been in artsand arms;

859
00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:00.130
Who, looking foradventures in the world,

860
00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:03.800
Was by the rough seas reftof ships and men,

861
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.430
And after shipwreck drivenupon this shore.

862
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:28.670
He thanks your grace;names himself Pericles,

863
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:29.670
A gentleman of Tyre,

864
00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:31.270
Who only by misfortune ofthe seas

865
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:34.870
Bereft of ships and men,cast on this shore.

866
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:38.330
Now, by the gods, I pityhis misfortune,

867
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:41.730
And will awake him fromhis melancholy.

868
00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.130
Come, gentlemen, we sittoo long on trifles,

869
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:48.170
And waste the time, whichlooks for other revels.

870
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.100
(laughing)

871
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.070
Even in your armours, asyou are address'd,

872
00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.600
Will very well become asoldier's dance.

873
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:01.000
I will not have excuse,with saying this

874
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.030
Loud music is too harshfor ladies' heads,

875
00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:06.830
Since they love men inarms as well as beds.

876
00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:22.130
(â™ª music)

877
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.370
So, this was well ask'd,'twasso well perform'd.

878
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.530
Come, sir;

879
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:56.400
Here is a lady that wantsbreathing too:

880
00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.870
And I have heard, youknights of Tyre

881
00:58:57.870 --> 00:59:00.300
Are excellent in makingladies trip;

882
00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:04.170
And that their measuresare as excellent.

883
00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:05.970
In those that practisethem they are, my lord.

884
00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:08.400
O, that's as much as youwould be denied

885
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:14.770
Of your fair courtesy.

886
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.270
Unclasp, unclasp:

887
01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:29.530
Thanks, gentlemen, to all;all have done well.

888
01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:34.370
But you the best.Pages and lights,

889
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:38.370
To conduct these knights untotheir several lodgings!

890
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:41.270
Yours, sir, We have givenorder to be next our own.

891
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.970
I am at your grace'spleasure.

892
01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:45.230
Princes, it is too late totalk of love;

893
01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:47.900
And that's the mark I knowyou level at:

894
01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.330
Therefore each one betakehim to his rest;

895
01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.930
To-morrow all for speedingdo their best.

896
01:03:25.930 --> 01:03:28.430
No, Escanes, know this ofme,

897
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:31.800
Antiochus from incestlived not free:

898
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.930
For which, the most highgods not minding longer

899
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:36.870
To withhold the vengeancethat they had in store,

900
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:39.300
Due to this heinouscapital offence,

901
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.600
Even in the height andpride of all his glory,

902
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.000
When he was seated in achariot

903
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.830
Of an inestimable value,and his daughter with him,

904
01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:51.600
A fire from heaven cameand shrivell'd up

905
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.900
Their bodies, even toloathing; for they so stunk,

906
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.100
That all those eyes adoredthem ere their fall

907
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.530
Scorn now their handshould give them burial.

908
01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:04.000
'Twas very strange.

909
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.130
And yet but justice;

910
01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:10.600
for though this king were great,his greatness was no guard

911
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.930
To bar heaven's shaft, butsin had his reward.

912
01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:17.700
'Tis very true.

913
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:25.230
See, not a man in privateconference

914
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:27.270
Or council has respectwith him but he.

915
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:29.500
It shall no longer grievewithout reproof.

916
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.100
And cursed be he that willnot second it.

917
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.970
Follow me, then.

918
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:41.500
Lord Helicane, a word.

919
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.670
With me? and welcome:happy day, my lords.

920
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:48.330
Know that our griefs arerisen to the top,

921
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.570
And now at length theyoverflow their banks.

922
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:55.770
Your griefs! for what? wrongnot your prince you love.

923
01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:58.700
Wrong not yourself, then,noble Helicane;

924
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.900
But if the prince do live,let us salute him,

925
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.270
Or know what ground's madehappy by his breath.

926
01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:09.200
If in the world he live,we'll seek him out;

927
01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.600
If in his grave he rest,we'll find him there;

928
01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.970
And be resolved he livesto govern us,

929
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:17.670
Or dead, give's cause tomourn his funeral,

930
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:21.200
And leave us to our freeelection.

931
01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.730
Whose death indeed's thestrongest in our censure:

932
01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:26.400
And knowing this kingdomis without a head,--

933
01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.030
Like goodly buildings leftwithout a roof

934
01:05:28.030 --> 01:05:30.600
Soon fall to ruin,--yournoble self,

935
01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:33.730
That best know how to ruleand how to reign,

936
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:36.200
We thus submit unto,--oursovereign.

937
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.000
Live, noble Helicane!

938
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.270
By honour's cause,forbear your suffrages:

939
01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:48.200
If that you love PrincePericles, forbear.

940
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:50.900
Take I your wish, I leapinto the seas,

941
01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.870
Where's hourly trouble fora minute's ease.

942
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:56.270
A twelvemonth longer, letme entreat you

943
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:59.870
Further to bear the absence ofyour king:

944
01:05:59.870 --> 01:06:03.330
If in which time expired,he not return,

945
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:08.670
I shall with aged patiencebear your yoke.

946
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:18.270
But if I cannot win you tothis love,

947
01:06:18.270 --> 01:06:24.330
Go search like nobles,like noble subjects,

948
01:06:24.330 --> 01:06:28.430
And in your search spendyour adventurous worth;

949
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:31.670
Whom if you find, and winunto return,

950
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:35.030
You shall like diamondssit about his crown.

951
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.730
To wisdom he's a fool thatwill not yield;

952
01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.330
And since Lord Helicaneenjoineth us,

953
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.670
We with our travels willendeavour it.

954
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:51.970
Then you love us, we you,and we'll clasp hands:

955
01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.430
When peers thus knit, akingdom ever stands.

956
01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:12.500
Good morrow to the goodSimonides.

957
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:17.700
Knights, from my daughterthis I let you know,

958
01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.000
That for this twelvemonthshe'll not undertake

959
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.600
A married life.

960
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.300
Her reason to herself isonly known,

961
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.430
Which from her by nomeans can I get.

962
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:29.970
May we not get access toher, my lord?

963
01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:32.600
'Faith, by no means; shehas so strictly tied

964
01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:38.030
Her to her chamber, that'tis impossible.

965
01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:40.300
One twelve moons moreshe'll wear Diana's livery;

966
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:42.430
This by the eye of Cynthiahath she vow'd

967
01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:45.730
And on her virgin honourwill not break it.

968
01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:59.500
Loath to bid farewell, wetake our leaves.

969
01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:03.700
So, They are well dispatch'd;now to my daughter's letter:

970
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:11.800
She tells me here, she'dwed the stranger knight,

971
01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.070
Or never more to view norday nor light.

972
01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:16.630
'Tis well, mistress; yourchoice agrees with mine;

973
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:22.770
I like that well: nay, howabsolute she's in't,

974
01:08:22.770 --> 01:08:27.900
Not minding whether Idislike or no!

975
01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.700
Well, I do commend herchoice;

976
01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.330
And will no longer have itbe delay'd.

977
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:35.130
Soft! here he comes: Imust dissemble it.

978
01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:44.000
All fortune to the goodSimonides!

979
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.430
To you as much, sir! I ambeholding to you

980
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.230
For your sweet musicthis last night:

981
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:52.230
I do protest my earswere never better fed

982
01:08:52.230 --> 01:08:54.100
With such delightfulpleasing harmony.

983
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.600
It is your grace'spleasure to commend;

984
01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.770
Not my desert.

985
01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.470
Sir, you are music'smaster.

986
01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:00.830
The worst of all herscholars, my good lord.

987
01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:02.570
Let me ask you one thing:

988
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:05.800
What do you think of mydaughter, sir?

989
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.730
A most virtuous princess.

990
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:09.930
And she is fair too, isshe not?

991
01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:12.800
As a fair day in summer,wondrous fair.

992
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.300
Sir, my daughter thinksvery well of you;

993
01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:17.030
Ay, so well, that you mustbe her master,

994
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:19.900
And she will be your scholar:therefore look to it.

995
01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.030
I am unworthy for herschoolmaster.

996
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:30.370
She thinks not so; perusethis writing else.

997
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.500
What's here?

998
01:09:38.230 --> 01:09:41.870
A letter, that she lovesthe knight of Tyre!

999
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:48.370
'Tis the king's subtletyto have my life.

1000
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:52.170
O, seek not to entrap me,gracious lord,

1001
01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.070
A stranger and distressedgentleman,

1002
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:56.430
That never aim'd so highto love your daughter,

1003
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.100
But bent all offices tohonour her.

1004
01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.770
Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter,and thou art a villain.

1005
01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:03.030
By the gods, I have not:

1006
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.530
Never did thought of minelevy offence;

1007
01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:07.430
Nor never did my actionsyet commence

1008
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:10.270
A deed might gain her loveor your displeasure.

1009
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:11.570
Traitor, thou liest.

1010
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:12.470
Traitor!

1011
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.400
Ay, traitor.

1012
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.300
Even in his throat--unlessit be the king--

1013
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.800
That calls me traitor, Ireturn the lie.

1014
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:24.230
Now, by the gods, I doapplaud his courage.

1015
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:26.100
My actions are as noble asmy thoughts,

1016
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.730
That never relish'd of abase descent.

1017
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:31.630
I came unto your court forhonour's cause,

1018
01:10:31.630 --> 01:10:33.870
And not to be a rebel toher state;

1019
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:35.370
And he that otherwiseaccounts of me,

1020
01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:37.600
This sword shall provehe's honour's enemy.

1021
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.300
No?

1022
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.970
Here comes my daughter,she can witness it.

1023
01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:44.200
Then, as you are asvirtuous as fair,

1024
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.170
Resolve your angry father,if my tongue

1025
01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:48.170
Did ere solicit, or myhand subscribe

1026
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:54.270
To any syllable that madelove to you.

1027
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:57.070
Why, sir, say if you had,

1028
01:10:57.070 --> 01:11:01.400
Who takes offence at thatwould make me glad?

1029
01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.770
Yea, mistress, are you soperemptory?

1030
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:06.000
I am glad on't with all myheart.--

1031
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I'll tame you; I'll bringyou in subjection.

1032
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.500
Will you, not having myconsent,

1033
01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.300
Bestow your love and youraffections

1034
01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.730
Upon a stranger?

1035
01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:16.330
who, for aught I know,

1036
01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:17.670
May be, nor can I thinkthe contrary,

1037
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:21.330
As great in blood as Imyself.--

1038
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:24.970
Therefore hear you,mistress; either frame

1039
01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:28.530
Your will to mine,--andyou, sir, hear you,

1040
01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:32.130
Either be ruled by me, orI will make you--

1041
01:11:32.130 --> 01:11:34.630
Man and wife:

1042
01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.230
Nay, come, your hands andlips must seal it too:

1043
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.770
And being join'd, I'llthus your hopes destroy;

1044
01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:45.600
And for a furthergrief,--God give you joy!--

1045
01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:51.230
What, are you bothpleased?

1046
01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:56.470
Yes, if you love me, sir.

1047
01:11:56.470 --> 01:12:00.430
Even as my life, or bloodthat fosters it.

1048
01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:13.470
What, are you both agreed?

1049
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:20.230
Yes, if it please yourmajesty.

1050
01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:24.430
It pleaseth me so well,that I will see you wed;

1051
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:27.930
And then with what hasteyou can get you to bed.

1052
01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.130
Now sleep y-slaked haththe rout;

1053
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:48.270
No din but snores thehouse about,

1054
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:50.370
Made louder by theo'er-fed breast

1055
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:55.000
Of this most pompousmarriage-feast.

1056
01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.600
The cat, with eyne ofburning coal,

1057
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.930
Now crouches fore themouse's hole;

1058
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:03.300
And crickets sing at theoven's mouth,

1059
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.870
E'er the blither for theirdrouth.

1060
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:10.230
Hymen hath brought thebride to bed.

1061
01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:13.270
Where, by the loss ofmaidenhead,

1062
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:18.330
A babe is moulded. Beattent,

1063
01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:22.000
And time that is sobriefly spent

1064
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.400
With your fine fanciesquaintly eche:

1065
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:31.500
What's dumb in show I'llplain with speech.

1066
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:33.870
By many a dern and painfulperch

1067
01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:35.900
Of Pericles the carefulsearch,

1068
01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:37.470
By the four opposingcoigns

1069
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:39.170
Which the world togetherjoins,

1070
01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:41.100
Is made with all duediligence

1071
01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:43.400
That horse and sail andhigh expense

1072
01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.470
Can stead the quest. Atlast from Tyre,

1073
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:50.400
Fame answering the moststrange inquire,

1074
01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.770
To the court of KingSimonides

1075
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:56.670
Are letters brought, thetenor these:

1076
01:13:56.670 --> 01:13:59.070
Antiochus and his daughterdead;

1077
01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:00.400
The men of Tyrus on thehead

1078
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.930
Of Helicanus would set on

1079
01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:05.330
The crown of Tyre, but hewill none:

1080
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:07.400
The mutiny he there hastest' oppress;

1081
01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.600
Says to 'em, if KingPericles

1082
01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:13.030
Come not home in twice sixmoons,

1083
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:14.670
He, obedient to theirdooms,

1084
01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:18.900
Will take the crown. Thesum of this,

1085
01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.400
Brought hither toPentapolis,

1086
01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.130
Y-ravished the regionsround,

1087
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:25.070
And every one with clapscan sound,

1088
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:27.030
'Our heir-apparent is aking!

1089
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:31.100
Who dream'd, who thoughtof such a thing?'

1090
01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.030
Brief, he must hencedepart to Tyre:

1091
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:37.500
His queen with child makesher desire--

1092
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:41.670
Which who shallcross?--along to go:

1093
01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:45.230
Omit we all their dole andwoe:

1094
01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:47.870
Lychorida, her nurse, shetakes,

1095
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:51.170
And so to sea.

1096
01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:56.530
Their vessel shakes on Neptune'sbillow; half the flood

1097
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.000
Hath their keel cut: butfortune's mood

1098
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.270
Varies again; the grislynorth

1099
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:05.000
Disgorges such a tempestforth,

1100
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.270
That, as a duck for lifethat dives,

1101
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:10.400
So up and down the poorship drives:

1102
01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.030
The lady shrieks, andwell-a-near

1103
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:15.970
Does fall in travail withher fear:

1104
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.600
And what ensues in thisfell storm

1105
01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.800
Shall for itself itselfperform.

1106
01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.500
I nill relate, action may

1107
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.970
Conveniently the restconvey;

1108
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:28.630
Which might not what by meis told.

1109
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:30.730
In your imagination hold

1110
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:34.370
This stage the ship, uponwhose deck

1111
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:39.170
The sea-tost Periclesappears to speak.

1112
01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:43.670
Thou god of this greatvast, rebuke these surges,

1113
01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:49.070
Which wash both heaven andhell; and thou, that hast

1114
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:52.770
Upon the winds command,bind them in brass,

1115
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:56.070
Having call'd themfrom the deep!

1116
01:15:56.070 --> 01:16:01.270
O, still thy deafening,dreadful thunders;

1117
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:05.300
gently quench thy nimble,sulphurous flashes!

1118
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:11.400
O, how, Lychorida,How does my queen?

1119
01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.170
Thou stormest venomously;

1120
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:17.330
Wilt thou spit all thyself?The seaman's whistle

1121
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:19.570
Is as a whisper in theears of death,

1122
01:16:19.570 --> 01:16:27.100
Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina,

1123
01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:29.170
O Divinest patroness,and midwife gentle

1124
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:32.870
To those that cry bynight, convey thy deity

1125
01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:37.170
Aboard our dancing boat;make swift the pangs

1126
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.200
Of my queen's travails!

1127
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.370
Here is a thing too youngfor such a place,

1128
01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.170
Who, if it hadconceit, would die,

1129
01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:02.100
as I am like to do: takein your arms this piece

1130
01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:05.100
Of your dead queen.

1131
01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:10.070
How, how, Lychorida!

1132
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.230
Patience, good sir; do notassist the storm.

1133
01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:18.300
Here's all that is leftliving of your queen,

1134
01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.230
A little daughter: for thesake of it,

1135
01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:23.930
Be manly, and takecomfort.

1136
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:28.370
O you gods!

1137
01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.800
Why do you make us loveyour goodly gifts,

1138
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.870
And snatch them straightaway? We here below

1139
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:39.970
Recall not what we give,and therein may

1140
01:17:39.970 --> 01:17:41.730
Use honour with you.

1141
01:17:41.730 --> 01:17:44.200
Patience, good sir,

1142
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.430
Even for this charge.

1143
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:03.430
Now, mild may be thy life!

1144
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:07.370
For a more blustrous birthhad never babe:

1145
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:10.330
Quiet and gentlethy conditions!

1146
01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:13.070
for thou art the rudeliestwelcome to this world

1147
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:18.670
That ever was prince'schild. Happy what follows!

1148
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:23.430
Thou hast as chiding anativity

1149
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:27.070
As fire, air, water, earth,and heaven can make,

1150
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:29.670
To herald thee from the womb:poor itch of nature

1151
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:40.000
even at the first thy loss ismore than can thy portage quit,

1152
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:48.170
With all thou canst findhere. Now, the good gods

1153
01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:51.700
Throw their best eyesupon't!

1154
01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:00.800
What courage, sir? Godsave you!

1155
01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.270
Courage enough: I do notfear the flaw;

1156
01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:07.270
It hath done to me theworst. Yet, for the love

1157
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:13.770
Of this poor infant, thisfresh-new sea-farer,

1158
01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:18.230
I would it would be quiet.

1159
01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.570
Slack the bolins there!Thou wilt not, wilt thou?

1160
01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:27.730
Blow, and split thyself.

1161
01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:32.170
But sea-room, an the brine andcloudy billow kiss the moon,

1162
01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.100
I care not.

1163
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:41.530
Sir, your queen mustoverboard: the sea works high,

1164
01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:43.770
the wind is loud, and willnot lie till the ship be

1165
01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:45.600
cleared of the dead.

1166
01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.400
That's your superstition.

1167
01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.170
Pardon us, sir; with us at seait hath been still observed:

1168
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.170
and we are strong in custom.

1169
01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:59.130
Therefore briefly yield her; forshe must overboard straight.

1170
01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:05.830
As you think meet. Mostwretched queen!

1171
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:16.600
Here she lies, sir.

1172
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:36.070
A terrible childbed hastthou had, my dear;

1173
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:39.500
No light, no fire: theunfriendly elements

1174
01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:44.470
Forgot thee utterly: norhave I time

1175
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:47.330
To give thee hallow'd tothy grave, but straight

1176
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:51.370
Must cast thee, scarcelycoffin'd, in the ooze;

1177
01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:53.470
Where, for a monument uponthy bones,

1178
01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:56.700
And e'er-remaining lamps,the belching whale

1179
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.700
And humming water musto'erwhelm thy corpse,

1180
01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:02.000
Lying with simple shells.

1181
01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:13.100
O Lychorida,

1182
01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:17.730
Bid Nestor bring mespices, ink and paper,

1183
01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:20.030
My casket and my jewels;and bid Nicander

1184
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:24.500
Bring me the satin coffer: laythe babe upon the pillow:

1185
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:27.130
hie thee, whiles I say

1186
01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:32.370
A priestly farewell toher: suddenly, woman.

1187
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:44.030
Sir, we have a chestbeneath the hatches,

1188
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.830
caulked and bitumed ready.

1189
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:51.030
I thank thee. Mariner, saywhat coast is this?

1190
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:52.630
We are near Tarsus.

1191
01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:54.230
Thither, gentle mariner.

1192
01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:57.400
Alter thy course for Tyre.When canst thou reach it?

1193
01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.470
By break of day, if thewind cease.

1194
01:21:59.470 --> 01:22:02.200
O, make for Tarsus!

1195
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.200
There will I visit Cleon,for the babe

1196
01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.370
Cannot hold out to Tyrus:

1197
01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:12.970
there I'll leave itat careful nursing.

1198
01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:15.730
Go thy ways, good mariner:

1199
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:18.130
I'll bring the bodypresently.

1200
01:22:54.130 --> 01:23:01.000
Philemon, ho!

1201
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.370
Doth my lord call?

1202
01:23:02.370 --> 01:23:04.800
Get fire and meat forthese poor men:

1203
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.400
'T has been a turbulentand stormy night.

1204
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:15.170
I have been in many; butsuch a night as this,

1205
01:23:15.170 --> 01:23:17.970
Till now, I ne'er endured.

1206
01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:21.730
Your master will be deadere you return;

1207
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.330
There's nothing can beminister'd to nature

1208
01:23:24.330 --> 01:23:25.900
That can recover him.

1209
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:44.000
Give this to the'pothecary,

1210
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.130
And tell me how it works.

1211
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:57.530
Good morrow.

1212
01:23:57.530 --> 01:23:58.730
Good morrow to yourlordship.

1213
01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:03.630
Gentlemen,

1214
01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:05.600
Why do you stir so early?

1215
01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.900
Sir,

1216
01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.970
Our lodgings, standingbleak upon the sea,

1217
01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:11.500
Shook as the earth didquake;

1218
01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.770
The very principals didseem to rend,

1219
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:17.530
And all-to topple: puresurprise and fear

1220
01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.170
Made me to quit the house.

1221
01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:21.300
That is the cause wetrouble you so early;

1222
01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:22.900
'Tis not our husbandry.

1223
01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:24.400
O, you say well.

1224
01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:26.070
But I much marvel thatyour lordship, having

1225
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:29.000
Rich tire about you, shouldat these early hours

1226
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.470
Shake off the goldenslumber of repose.

1227
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:32.600
'Tis most strange,

1228
01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.400
Nature should be soconversant with pain,

1229
01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:35.900
Being thereto notcompell'd.

1230
01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:36.830
I hold it ever,

1231
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:39.900
Virtue and cunning wereendowments greater

1232
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.000
Than nobleness and riches:careless heirs

1233
01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
May the two latter darkenand expend;

1234
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.370
But immortality attendsthe former.

1235
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:53.330
Making a man a god. 'Tis known,

1236
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:56.500
I ever have studied physic,through which secret art,

1237
01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.530
By turning o'erauthorities, I have,

1238
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.230
Together with my practise,made familiar

1239
01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:06.600
To me and to my aid theblest infusions

1240
01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.400
That dwell in vegetives,in metals, stones;

1241
01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.900
And I can speak of thedisturbances

1242
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:16.870
That nature works, and of hercures; which doth give me

1243
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:18.900
A more content in courseof true delight

1244
01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:22.430
Than to be thirsty aftertottering honour,

1245
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:25.570
Or tie my treasure up insilken bags,

1246
01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:28.070
To please the fool anddeath.

1247
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:30.470
Your honour has throughEphesus pour'd forth

1248
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:32.830
Your charity, and hundredscall themselves

1249
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:34.570
Your creatures, who by youhave been restored:

1250
01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:37.730
And not your knowledge,your personal pain,

1251
01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:40.930
but even your purse, stillopen, hath built Lord Cerimon

1252
01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:44.330
Such strong renown astime shall ne'er raise.

1253
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:47.700
So; lift there.

1254
01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:50.070
What is that?

1255
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:53.500
Sir, even now did the sea tossupon our shore this chest:

1256
01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.070
'Tis of some wreck.

1257
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:57.100
Set 't down, let's lookupon't.

1258
01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.000
'Tis like a coffin, sir.

1259
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.230
Whate'er it be, 'Tiswondrous heavy.

1260
01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:03.100
Wrench it open straight:

1261
01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:05.270
If the sea's stomach beo'ercharged with gold,

1262
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:09.230
'Tis a good constraint offortune it belches upon us.

1263
01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:11.000
'Tis so, my lord.

1264
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.470
How close 'tis caulk'd andbitumed!

1265
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:15.430
Did the sea cast it up?

1266
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:17.270
I never saw so huge abillow, sir,

1267
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:19.300
As toss'd it upon shore.

1268
01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:20.430
Wrench it open;

1269
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.400
Soft! it smells mostsweetly in my sense.

1270
01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.900
A delicate odour.

1271
01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:45.200
As ever hit my nostril.So, up with it.

1272
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:57.800
O you most potent gods!what's here? a corse!

1273
01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.500
Most strange!

1274
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.700
Shrouded in cloth of state;balm'd and entreasured

1275
01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:11.630
With full bags of spices!A passport too!

1276
01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:20.100
Apollo, perfect me in thecharacters!

1277
01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.330
'Here I give tounderstand,

1278
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:25.870
If e'er this coffin drivea-land,

1279
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:30.600
I, King Pericles, havelost this queen,

1280
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:33.570
worth all our mundane cost.

1281
01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:37.430
Who finds her, give herburying;

1282
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:40.270
She was the daughter of aking:

1283
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:43.430
Besides this treasure fora fee,

1284
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:47.070
The gods requite hischarity!'

1285
01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:51.000
O Pericles, If thou livest,thou hast a heart

1286
01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:59.770
That even cracks for woe!This chanced tonight.

1287
01:27:59.770 --> 01:28:00.800
Most likely, sir.

1288
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.800
Nay, certainly to-night;

1289
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:09.130
For look how fresh shelooks! They were too rough

1290
01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:12.930
That threw her in the sea.Make a fire within:

1291
01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:17.200
Fetch hither all my boxesin my closet.

1292
01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.430
Death may usurp on naturemany hours,

1293
01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:26.570
And yet the fire of lifekindle again

1294
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:29.770
The o'erpress'd spirits. Iread of some Egyptians

1295
01:28:29.770 --> 01:28:32.670
Who after four hourse death,have raised impoverished spirits

1296
01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:36.170
Like to this, unto their formerheatlh.

1297
01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:42.730
Well said, well said; thefire and cloths.

1298
01:28:42.730 --> 01:28:46.330
The rough and woeful musicthat we have,

1299
01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:49.400
Cause it to sound, beseechyou.

1300
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.970
The viol once more:

1301
01:31:18.370 --> 01:31:26.230
how thou stirr'st, thou block!

1302
01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:31.330
The music there!--I prayyou, give her air.

1303
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:32.930
Gentlemen.

1304
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:39.370
This queen will live:nature awakes; a warmth

1305
01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:41.070
Breathes out of her: shehath not been entranced

1306
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:46.500
Above five hours: see howshe gins to blow

1307
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500
Into life's flower again!

1308
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.200
The heavens, Through you,increase our wonder

1309
01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:54.100
and set up your fame forever.

1310
01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:55.630
She is alive; behold,

1311
01:31:55.630 --> 01:31:59.100
Her eyelids, cases tothose heavenly jewels

1312
01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.700
Which Pericles hath lost,

1313
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:06.400
Begin to part theirfringes of bright gold;

1314
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.330
The diamonds of a mostpraised water

1315
01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:13.230
Doth appear, to makethe world twice rich.

1316
01:32:13.230 --> 01:32:18.730
Live, and make us weep to hearyour fate, fair creature,

1317
01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:21.930
Rare as you seem to be.

1318
01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.200
O dear Diana,

1319
01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:54.100
Where am I? Where's mylord? What world is this?

1320
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:56.300
Is not this strange?

1321
01:32:56.300 --> 01:32:57.170
Most rare.

1322
01:32:57.170 --> 01:32:58.630
Hush, my gentleneighbours!

1323
01:32:58.630 --> 01:33:01.430
Lend me your hands; to thenext chamber bear her.

1324
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:04.300
Get linen: now this mattermust be look'd to,

1325
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:09.770
For her relapse is mortal.Come, come;

1326
01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:16.630
And AEsculapius guide us!

1327
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.400
Most honour'd Cleon, Imust needs be gone;

1328
01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:59.200
My twelve months areexpired, and Tyrus stands

1329
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:01.770
In a litigious peace. You,and your lady,

1330
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:04.170
Take from my heartall thankfulness!

1331
01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:05.970
The gods make upthe rest upon you!

1332
01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:08.930
Your strokes of fortune, thoughthey hurt you mortally,

1333
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:10.830
Yet glance fullwoundingly on us.

1334
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:14.600
O your sweet queen! That thestrict fates had pleased you

1335
01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:15.630
had brought her hither,

1336
01:34:15.630 --> 01:34:17.770
To have bless'd mine eyeswith her!

1337
01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:20.700
We cannot but obeythe powers above us.

1338
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:25.700
Could I rage and roar as doth the sea she lies in,

1339
01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:28.230
yet the end must be as 'tis.

1340
01:34:37.230 --> 01:34:39.330
My gentle babe Marina, whom,

1341
01:34:39.330 --> 01:34:42.170
For she was born atsea, I have named so,

1342
01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:44.400
here I charge yourcharity withal,

1343
01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:47.570
leaving her the infant ofyour care; beseeching you

1344
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:49.400
To give her princelytraining, that she may be

1345
01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.770
Manner'd as she is born.

1346
01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:53.170
Fear not, my lord, butthink

1347
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:55.530
Your grace, that fed mycountry with your corn,

1348
01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:58.070
For which the people'sprayers still fall upon you,

1349
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.600
Must in your childbe thought on.

1350
01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:04.000
If neglection should thereinmake me vile, the common body,

1351
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.530
By you relieved, wouldforce me to my duty:

1352
01:35:07.530 --> 01:35:10.430
But if to that my natureneed a spur,

1353
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:13.330
The gods revenge it uponme and mine,

1354
01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:15.030
To the end of generation!

1355
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:16.470
I believe you;

1356
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:18.170
Your honour and yourgoodness teach me to't,

1357
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:24.570
Without your vows. Tillshe be married, madam,

1358
01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:26.970
By bright Diana,whom we honour,

1359
01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:31.200
all unscissor'd shall thishair of mine remain,

1360
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:38.330
Though I show ill in't. SoI take my leave.

1361
01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.200
Good madam, make meblessed in your care

1362
01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.330
In bringing up my child.

1363
01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:46.500
I have one myself,

1364
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.000
Who shall not be more dearto my respect

1365
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.730
Than yours, my lord.

1366
01:35:50.730 --> 01:35:53.330
Madam, my thanks andprayers.

1367
01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:56.300
We'll bring your grace e'ento the edge o' the shore,

1368
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.270
Then give you up tothe mask'd Neptune

1369
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:01.200
and the gentlestwinds of heaven.

1370
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.370
I will embrace your offer.

1371
01:36:02.370 --> 01:36:07.130
Come, dearest madam. O, notears, Lychorida, no tears:

1372
01:36:07.130 --> 01:36:09.730
Look to your littlemistress, on whose grace

1373
01:36:09.730 --> 01:36:15.170
You may depend hereafter.Come, my lord.

1374
01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:01.670
Madam, this letter, andsome certain jewels,

1375
01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:02.400
Lay with you in your coffer:

1376
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.530
which are now at your command.

1377
01:37:05.530 --> 01:37:11.600
Know you the character?It is my lord's.

1378
01:37:32.970 --> 01:37:35.770
That I was shipp'd at sea,I well remember,

1379
01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:41.100
Even on my eaning time; butwhether there deliver'd,

1380
01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:44.800
by the holy gods, Icannot rightly say.

1381
01:37:55.930 --> 01:37:58.030
But since King Pericles,

1382
01:37:58.030 --> 01:38:02.370
My wedded lord, I ne'ershall see again,

1383
01:38:02.370 --> 01:38:07.170
A vestal livery will Itake me to,

1384
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:09.830
And never more have joy.

1385
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:13.100
Madam, if this you purposeas ye speak,

1386
01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:16.900
Diana's temple is notdistant far,

1387
01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:20.870
Where you may abide tillyour date expire.

1388
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:24.400
Moreover, if you please, aniece of mine

1389
01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.930
Shall there attend you.

1390
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:31.400
My recompense is thanks,that's all;

1391
01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.500
Yet my good will is great,though the gift small.

1392
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:50.130


1393
01:38:52.530 --> 01:38:56.170
Imagine Pericles arrivedat Tyre,

1394
01:38:56.170 --> 01:38:59.870
Welcomed and settled tohis own desire.

1395
01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:02.700
His woeful queen we leaveat Ephesus,

1396
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:07.500
Unto Diana there avotaress.

1397
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:11.670
Now to Marina bend yourmind,

1398
01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:13.930
Whom our fast-growingscene must find

1399
01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:17.530
At Tarsus, and by Cleontrain'd

1400
01:39:17.530 --> 01:39:19.930
In music, letters; whohath gain'd

1401
01:39:19.930 --> 01:39:22.770
Of education all thegrace,

1402
01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:27.300
Which makes her both the heartand place of general wonder.

1403
01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:31.730
But, alack, That monsterenvy, oft the wrack

1404
01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:35.000
Of earned praise, Marina'slife

1405
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Seeks to take off bytreason's knife.

1406
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.400
And in this kind ourCleon hath one daughter,

1407
01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.900
and a wench full grown,

1408
01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:50.730
Even ripe for marriage-rite;this maid hight Philoten:

1409
01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:52.970
and it is said forcertain in our story,

1410
01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:56.470
she would ever with Marina be:

1411
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:59.470
Be't when she weaved thesleided silk

1412
01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:04.200
With fingers long, small,white as milk;

1413
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.100
Or when she would withsharp needle wound

1414
01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.630
The cambric, which shemade more sound

1415
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:12.130
By hurting it; or when tothe lute

1416
01:40:12.130 --> 01:40:15.830
She sung, and made thenight-bird mute,

1417
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:18.630
That still records with moan;

1418
01:40:18.630 --> 01:40:21.770
or when She would withrich and constant pen

1419
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:25.170
Vail to her mistress Dian;

1420
01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:28.630
Still, this Philotencontends in skill

1421
01:40:28.630 --> 01:40:32.670
With absolute Marina:

1422
01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:37.330
so with the dove ofPaphos might the crow

1423
01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:41.400
Vie feathers white.Marina gets all praises,

1424
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.770
which are paid as debts,

1425
01:40:43.770 --> 01:40:47.900
And not as given. This sodarks

1426
01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.370
In Philoten all gracefulmarks,

1427
01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:53.900
That Cleon's wife, withenvy rare,

1428
01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:58.070
A present murderer doesprepare for good Marina,

1429
01:40:58.070 --> 01:41:03.200
that her daughter might standpeerless by this slaughter.

1430
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:06.230
The sooner her vilethoughts to stead,

1431
01:41:06.230 --> 01:41:09.400
Lychorida, our nurse, isdead:

1432
01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.670
And cursed Dionyza hath

1433
01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:17.430
The pregnant instrument ofwrath prest for this blow.

1434
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:18.800
The unborn event

1435
01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:21.600
I do commend to yourcontent:

1436
01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:24.200
Only I carry winged time

1437
01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:28.030
Post on the lame feet ofmy rhyme;

1438
01:41:28.030 --> 01:41:30.030
Which never could I soconvey,

1439
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:35.200
Unless your thoughts wenton my way.

1440
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.500
Dionyza does appear,

1441
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:41.200
With Leonine, a murderer.

1442
01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:50.100
Thy oath remember; thouhast sworn to do't:

1443
01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:52.830
'Tis but a blow, whichnever shall be known.

1444
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:55.000
Thou canst not do a thingin the world so soon,

1445
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.130
To yield thee so muchprofit. Let not conscience,

1446
01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:01.600
Which is but cold, nor flaminglove thy bosom enslaved

1447
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.630
too nicely; nor let pity,

1448
01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:06.400
which even women havecast off, melt thee,

1449
01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:10.800
but be a soldierto thy purpose.

1450
01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:20.470
I will do't; but yet sheis a goodly creature.

1451
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:24.230
The fitter, then, thegods should have her.

1452
01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:27.800
Here she comes weeping forher only nurses' death.

1453
01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.370
Thou art resolved?

1454
01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:33.730
I am resolved.

1455
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:40.630
No, I will rob Tellus ofher weed,

1456
01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:43.700
To strew thy greenwith flowers:

1457
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:57.730
the yellows, blues, the purpleviolets, and marigolds,

1458
01:42:57.730 --> 01:43:04.700
Shall as a carpet hangupon thy grave,

1459
01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:13.200
While summer-days do last.Ay me! poor maid,

1460
01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.500
Born in a tempest, when mymother died,

1461
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:18.270
This world to me is like alasting storm,

1462
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:21.500
Whirring me from myfriends.

1463
01:43:21.500 --> 01:43:25.870
How now, Marina! why doyou keep alone?

1464
01:43:25.870 --> 01:43:28.900
How chance my daughteris not with you?

1465
01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.570
Do not consume yourblood with sorrowing:

1466
01:43:31.570 --> 01:43:38.170
What, have you a nurse of me.Lord, how your favour's changed

1467
01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:41.130
With this unprofitablewoe!

1468
01:43:41.130 --> 01:43:44.870
Come, give me yourflowers, On the sea march'nt.

1469
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:47.900
Walk with Leonine; the airis quick there,

1470
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:50.300
And it pierces andsharpens the stomach.

1471
01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:53.070
Come Leonine, take her bythe arm, walk with her.

1472
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:54.170
No, I pray you;

1473
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:56.030
I'll not bereave you ofyour servant.

1474
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:58.800
Come, come;

1475
01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:02.100
I love the king yourfather, and yourself,

1476
01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.730
With more than foreignheart. We every day

1477
01:44:05.730 --> 01:44:08.830
Expect him here: when heshall come and see

1478
01:44:08.830 --> 01:44:12.370
Our paragon to all reportsthus blasted,

1479
01:44:12.370 --> 01:44:15.270
He will repent the breadthof his great voyage;

1480
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:17.530
Blame both my lord and me,that we have taken

1481
01:44:17.530 --> 01:44:22.070
No care to your bestcourses. Go, I pray you,

1482
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:25.970
Walk, and be cheerfulonce again;

1483
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:29.070
reserve that excellentcomplexion, which did steal

1484
01:44:29.070 --> 01:44:33.100
The eyes of young andold. Care not for me

1485
01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.170
I can go home alone.

1486
01:44:35.170 --> 01:44:37.330
Well, I will go;

1487
01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:39.070
But yet I have no desireto it.

1488
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:42.330
Come, come, I know 'tisgood for you.

1489
01:44:42.330 --> 01:44:45.670
Walk half an hour,Leonine, at the least:

1490
01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:47.330
Remember what I have said.

1491
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:48.870
I warrant you, madam.

1492
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:51.230
I'll leave you, my sweetlady, for a while:

1493
01:44:51.230 --> 01:44:54.170
Pray, walk softly, do notheat your blood:

1494
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:59.370
What! I must have careof you.

1495
01:44:59.370 --> 01:45:04.730
My thanks, sweet madam.

1496
01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.730
Is this wind westerly thatblows?

1497
01:45:18.730 --> 01:45:19.870
South-west.

1498
01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.370
When I was born, the windwas north.

1499
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:26.730
Was't so?

1500
01:45:26.730 --> 01:45:29.900
My father, as nurse said,did never fear,

1501
01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:33.530
But cried 'Good seaman!'to the sailors, galling

1502
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:35.730
His kingly hands, halingropes;

1503
01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:37.670
And, clasping to the mast,endured a sea

1504
01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:39.930
That almost burst thedeck.

1505
01:45:39.930 --> 01:45:42.670
When was this?

1506
01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:46.070
When I was born:

1507
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:49.430
Never was wind nor wavesmore violent;

1508
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:52.370
And from the ladder-tacklewashes off a canvas-climber.

1509
01:45:52.370 --> 01:45:55.200
'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'

1510
01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:56.870
And with a droppingindustry they skip

1511
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:59.600
From stem to stern: theboatswain whistles,

1512
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.230
and the master calls, andtrebles their confusion.

1513
01:46:02.230 --> 01:46:05.300
Come, say your prayers.

1514
01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:07.930
What mean you?

1515
01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:09.870
If you require a littlespace for prayer,

1516
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:14.730
I grant it: pray; but benot tedious,

1517
01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:16.330
For the gods are quick ofear, and I am sworn

1518
01:46:16.330 --> 01:46:18.100
To do my work with haste.

1519
01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:19.970
Why will you kill me?

1520
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:22.430
To satisfy my lady.

1521
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:24.700
Why would she have mekill'd?

1522
01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:26.230
Now, as I can remember, bymy troth,

1523
01:46:26.230 --> 01:46:28.700
I never did her hurt inall my life:

1524
01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:30.770
I never spake bad word,nor did ill turn

1525
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:33.100
To any living creature:believe me, la,

1526
01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.030
I never kill'd a mouse,nor hurt a fly:

1527
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:36.500
I trod upon a worm againstmy will,

1528
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:39.870
But I wept for it. Howhave I offended,

1529
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:41.470
Wherein my death mightyield her any profit,

1530
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:44.830
Or my life imply her anydanger?

1531
01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:47.930
My commission Is not to reasonof the deed, but do it.

1532
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:50.300
You will not do't for allthe world, I hope.

1533
01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.170
You are well favour'd, andyour looks foreshow

1534
01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:55.170
You have a gentle heart. Isaw you lately,

1535
01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:57.500
When you caught hurt inparting two that fought:

1536
01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.870
Good sooth, it show'd wellin you: do so now:

1537
01:47:01.870 --> 01:47:05.070
Your lady seeks my life;come you between,

1538
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:07.800
And save poor me, theweaker.

1539
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.500
I am sworn,

1540
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:12.370
And will dispatch.

1541
01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:18.300
Hold, villain!

1542
01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:20.330
A prize! a prize!

1543
01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:23.100
Half-part, mates,half-part.

1544
01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:26.630
Come, let's have heraboard suddenly.

1545
01:47:26.630 --> 01:47:32.230
These roguing thieves servethe great pirate Valdes;

1546
01:47:32.230 --> 01:47:38.300
And they have seizedMarina. Let her go:

1547
01:47:38.300 --> 01:47:40.630
There's no hopeshe will return.

1548
01:47:40.630 --> 01:47:44.600
I'll swear she's dead,

1549
01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:51.170
And thrown into the sea.But I'll see further:

1550
01:47:51.170 --> 01:47:54.430
Perhaps they will butplease themselves upon her,

1551
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:58.630
Not carry her aboard. Ifshe remain,

1552
01:47:58.630 --> 01:48:05.900
Whom they have ravish'dmust by me be slain.

1553
01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:54.000
Boult!

1554
01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.100
Sir?

1555
01:48:57.370 --> 01:49:02.130
Search the market narrowly;Mytilene is full of gallants.

1556
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:06.530
We lost too much money thismart by being too wenchless.

1557
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:08.430
We were never so muchout of creatures.

1558
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:10.330
We have but poor three,

1559
01:49:10.330 --> 01:49:12.270
and they can do no morethan they can do;

1560
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:16.300
and they with continual actionare even as good as rotten.

1561
01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:19.800
Therefore let's have fresh ones,whate'er we pay for them.

1562
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.670
If there be not a conscienceto be used in every trade,

1563
01:49:23.670 --> 01:49:25.000
we shall never prosper.

1564
01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.330
Thou sayest true: 'tis not ourbringing up of poor bastards,

1565
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:32.830
--as, I think, I havebrought up some eleven--

1566
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:36.770
Ay, to eleven; andbrought them down again.

1567
01:49:36.770 --> 01:49:38.470
But shall I search the market?

1568
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:42.300
What else, man? The stuffwe have, a strong wind

1569
01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:47.700
will blow it to pieces, theyare so pitifully sodden.

1570
01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:55.100
Thou sayest true; they're toounwholesome, o' conscience.

1571
01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:58.170
The poor Transylvanian is dead,

1572
01:49:58.170 --> 01:50:00.000
that lay with thelittle baggage.

1573
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:05.530
Ay, she quickly pooped him; shemade him roast-meat for worms.

1574
01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:09.270
But I'll go search the market.

1575
01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:16.530
Three or four thousandchequins were as pretty a

1576
01:50:16.530 --> 01:50:22.530
proportion to livequietly, and so give over.

1577
01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:25.770
Why to give over, I prayyou? is it a shame to get

1578
01:50:25.770 --> 01:50:27.730
when we are old?

1579
01:50:27.730 --> 01:50:31.100
O, our credit comes notin like the commodity,

1580
01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:34.400
nor the commodity wagesnot with the danger:

1581
01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:37.770
therefore, if in ouryouths we could pick up

1582
01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:43.670
some pretty estate, 'twere notamiss to keep our door hatched.

1583
01:50:43.670 --> 01:50:48.930
Besides, the sore terms westand upon with the gods

1584
01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:51.970
will be strong with us forgiving over.

1585
01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:53.900
Come, other sorts offendas well as we.

1586
01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:59.170
As well as we! ay, andbetter too; we offend worse.

1587
01:50:59.170 --> 01:51:02.900
Neither is ourprofession any trade;

1588
01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:07.630
it's no calling. Buthere comes Boult.

1589
01:51:07.630 --> 01:51:14.900
Come your ways. My masters,you say she's a virgin?

1590
01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:19.100
O, sir, we doubt it not.

1591
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.030
Master, I have gone throughfor this piece, you see:

1592
01:51:24.030 --> 01:51:27.730
if you like her, so; if not,I have lost my earnest.

1593
01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:32.730
Boult, has she anyqualities?

1594
01:51:32.730 --> 01:51:34.130
She has a goodface, speaks well,

1595
01:51:34.130 --> 01:51:37.270
and has excellent good clothes:there's no further necessity

1596
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:45.570
of qualities can makeher be refused.

1597
01:51:45.570 --> 01:51:47.330
What's her price, Boult?

1598
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:52.730
I cannot be bated one doitof a thousand pieces.

1599
01:51:54.900 --> 01:52:00.900
Well, follow me, my masters,

1600
01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:04.700
you shall have yourmoney presently.

1601
01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:08.970
Wife, take her in; instructher what she has to do,

1602
01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:12.870
that she may not be rawin her entertainment.

1603
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:33.030
Boult, take you the marks ofher, the colour of her hair,

1604
01:52:33.030 --> 01:52:36.800
complexion, height, age, withwarrant of her virginity;

1605
01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.270
and cry 'He that willgive most shall

1606
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:43.270
have her first.' Such amaidenhead were no cheap thing,

1607
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:46.770
if men were as they have been.

1608
01:52:46.770 --> 01:52:50.630
Get this done as I command you.

1609
01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:53.730
Performance shall follow.

1610
01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:55.930
Alack that Leonine was soslack, so slow!

1611
01:52:55.930 --> 01:52:59.930
He should have struck, notspoke; or that these pirates,

1612
01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:03.630
Not enough barbarous, hadnot o'erboard thrown me

1613
01:53:03.630 --> 01:53:07.770
For to seek my mother!

1614
01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:11.070
Why lament you, prettyone?

1615
01:53:11.070 --> 01:53:12.500
That I am pretty.

1616
01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.330
Come, the gods have donetheir part in you.

1617
01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:18.330
I accuse them not.

1618
01:53:18.330 --> 01:53:22.000
You are light into my hands,where you are like to live.

1619
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.370
The more my faultTo scape his hands

1620
01:53:23.370 --> 01:53:24.600
where I was like to die.

1621
01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:25.630
Ay, and you shall live inpleasure.

1622
01:53:25.630 --> 01:53:26.830
No.

1623
01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:29.470
Yes, indeed shall you, and tastegentlemen of all fashions:

1624
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:32.770
you shall fare well;you shall have the

1625
01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:39.330
difference of all complexions.What! do you stop your ears?

1626
01:53:39.330 --> 01:53:40.930
Are you a woman?

1627
01:53:40.930 --> 01:53:42.300
What would you have me be,an I be not a woman?

1628
01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:44.400
An honest woman, or not awoman.

1629
01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:50.070
Marry, whip thee, gosling:I think I shall have

1630
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:56.630
something to do with you. Come,you're a young foolish sapling,

1631
01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:58.830
and must be bowed asI would have you.

1632
01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:01.830
The gods defend me!

1633
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:04.600
If it please the godsto defend you by men,

1634
01:54:04.600 --> 01:54:10.230
then men must comfortyou, men must feed you,

1635
01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.270
men to stir you up.

1636
01:54:18.330 --> 01:54:20.330
Boult's returned.

1637
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:24.370
How now, sir, hast thou criedher through the market?

1638
01:54:24.370 --> 01:54:27.770
I have cried her almost tothe number of her hairs;

1639
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:31.970
I have drawn her picturewith my voice.

1640
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:33.400
And I prithee tell me, how dostthou find the inclination

1641
01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:35.530
of the people, especiallyof the younger sort?

1642
01:54:35.530 --> 01:54:37.230
'Faith, they listened tome as they would have

1643
01:54:37.230 --> 01:54:39.630
hearkened to theirfather's testament.

1644
01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:40.970
There was a Spaniard'smouth so watered,

1645
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:43.630
that he went to bed toher very description.

1646
01:54:43.630 --> 01:54:44.700
We shall have himhere to-morrow

1647
01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:46.730
with his best ruff on.

1648
01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:49.730
To-night, to-night.But, mistress,

1649
01:54:49.730 --> 01:54:52.200
Do you know the French knightthat cowers i' the hams?

1650
01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.670
Who, Monsieur Veroles?

1651
01:54:53.670 --> 01:54:56.730
Ay, he: he offered to cut acaper at the proclamation;

1652
01:54:56.730 --> 01:54:58.800
but he made a groanat it, and swore

1653
01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:01.600
he would see herto-morrow.

1654
01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:06.330
Well, well; as for him, hebrought his disease hither:

1655
01:55:06.330 --> 01:55:07.730
here he does but repair it.

1656
01:55:07.730 --> 01:55:11.070
I know he will comein our shadow,

1657
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:14.700
to scatter hiscrowns in the sun.

1658
01:55:14.700 --> 01:55:18.100
Well, if we had of everynation a traveller,

1659
01:55:18.100 --> 01:55:22.770
we should lodge themwith this sign.

1660
01:55:22.770 --> 01:55:27.430
Pray you, come hither awhile.

1661
01:55:31.770 --> 01:55:42.330
You have fortunes comingupon you. Mark me:

1662
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:45.430
you must seem todo that fearfully

1663
01:55:45.430 --> 01:55:47.270
which you commit willingly,

1664
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:49.170
despise profit whereyou have most gain.

1665
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:53.770
To weep that you live as ye domakes pity in your lovers:

1666
01:55:53.770 --> 01:55:56.870
seldom but that pity begetsyou a good opinion,

1667
01:55:56.870 --> 01:56:03.870
and that opinion a mereprofit. I understand you not.

1668
01:56:03.870 --> 01:56:06.700
O, take her home,mistress, take her home:

1669
01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.500
these blushes of hersmust be quenched

1670
01:56:08.500 --> 01:56:10.130
with some present practise.

1671
01:56:10.130 --> 01:56:12.400
Thou sayest true, i'faith;

1672
01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:16.030
for your bride goesto that with shame

1673
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:19.570
which is her way togo with warrant.

1674
01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:23.300
'Faith, some do, and somedo not. But, mistress,

1675
01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.300
if I have bargainedfor the joint,--

1676
01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.330
Thou mayst cut a morseloff the spit.

1677
01:56:28.330 --> 01:56:29.600
I may so.

1678
01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:36.230
Who should deny it? Come,young one, I like the

1679
01:56:36.230 --> 01:56:38.200
manner of your garmentswell.

1680
01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.030
Ay, by my faith, theyshall not be changed yet.

1681
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:45.470
Boult, spend thou that inthe town: report what a

1682
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:49.630
sojourner we have; you'lllose nothing by custom.

1683
01:56:49.630 --> 01:56:50.570
When nature flamed this piece,

1684
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:51.870
she meant thee a good turn;

1685
01:56:51.870 --> 01:56:54.430
therefore say whata paragon she is,

1686
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:58.370
and thou hast the harvestout of thine own report.

1687
01:56:58.370 --> 01:57:01.770
I warrant you, mistress,thunder shall not so awake

1688
01:57:01.770 --> 01:57:06.070
the beds of eels as mygiving out her beauty

1689
01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:12.070
stir up the lewdly-inclined.I'll bring home some to-night.

1690
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.870
Come your ways; follow me.

1691
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:20.900
If fires be hot, knivessharp, or waters deep,

1692
01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:25.200
Untied I still my virginknot will keep.

1693
01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:29.330
Diana, aid my purpose!

1694
01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:33.100
What have we to do with Diana?

1695
01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:37.170
Pray you, will you go with us?

1696
01:57:58.100 --> 01:58:01.000
Why, are you foolish? Canit be undone?

1697
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.370
O Dionyza, such a piece ofslaughter

1698
01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.400
The sun and moon ne'erlook'd upon!

1699
01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:08.870
I think you'll turna child again.

1700
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:11.170
Were I chief lord of allthis spacious world,

1701
01:58:11.170 --> 01:58:15.370
I'ld give it to undo thedeed. O lady,

1702
01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:18.130
Much less in blood thanvirtue, yet a princess

1703
01:58:18.130 --> 01:58:19.700
To equal any single crowno' the earth

1704
01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:25.870
I' the justice of compare!O villain Leonine!

1705
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:29.100
Whom thou hast poison'dtoo:

1706
01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:30.800
If thou hadst drunk to him,'t had been a kindness

1707
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:33.500
Becoming well thy fact:what canst thou say

1708
01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:36.230
When noble Pericles shalldemand his child?

1709
01:58:36.230 --> 01:58:41.000
That she is dead. Nursesare not the fates,

1710
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.030
To foster it, nor ever topreserve.

1711
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:50.430
She died at night; I'llsay so. Who can cross it?

1712
01:58:50.430 --> 01:58:52.130
Unless you play the piousinnocent,

1713
01:58:52.130 --> 01:58:53.530
And for an honestattribute cry out

1714
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:56.200
'She died by foul play.'

1715
01:58:56.200 --> 01:59:02.800
O, go to. Well, well,

1716
01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:07.030
Of all the faultsbeneath the heavens,

1717
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:08.670
The gods do like this worst.

1718
01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:09.770
Be one of those that think

1719
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:11.670
The petty wrens of Tarsuswill fly hence,

1720
01:59:11.670 --> 01:59:14.170
And open this to Pericles.

1721
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:17.530
I shame to think of whata noble strain you are,

1722
01:59:17.530 --> 01:59:20.600
And of how coward aspirit.

1723
01:59:20.600 --> 01:59:21.830
To such proceeding

1724
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:23.300
Who ever but hisapprobation gave,

1725
01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:24.900
And not his prime consent,

1726
01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:28.770
he did not flow fromhonourable sources.

1727
01:59:29.970 --> 01:59:32.700
Be it so, then:

1728
01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:39.030
Yet none does know, butyou, how she came dead,

1729
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:42.170
Nor none can know, Leoninebeing gone.

1730
01:59:42.170 --> 01:59:46.830
She did disdain my child,and stood between

1731
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:49.970
Her and her fortunes: nonewould look on her,

1732
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:51.600
But cast their gazes onMarina's face;

1733
01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:53.770
Whilst ours was blurted atand held a malkin

1734
01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:58.670
Not worth the time of day.It pierced me through;

1735
01:59:58.670 --> 02:00:01.170
And though you call mycourse unnatural,

1736
02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:04.400
You not your child wellloving, yet I find

1737
02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:07.300
It greets me as anenterprise of kindness

1738
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:12.170
Perform'd to your soledaughter.

1739
02:00:12.670 --> 02:00:15.070
Heavens forgive it!

1740
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:17.470
And as for Pericles,

1741
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:20.700
What should he say? Wewept after her hearse,

1742
02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:25.900
And yet we mourn: hermonument

1743
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.600
Is almost finish'd, andher epitaphs

1744
02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:32.700
In glittering goldencharacters express

1745
02:00:32.700 --> 02:00:36.330
A general praise to her,and care in us

1746
02:00:36.330 --> 02:00:41.130
At whose expense 'tisdone.

1747
02:00:41.130 --> 02:00:43.370
Thou art like the harpy,

1748
02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:48.430
Which, to betray, dost,with thine angel's face,

1749
02:00:48.430 --> 02:00:50.870
Seize with thine eagle'stalons.

1750
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:52.630
You are like one thatsuperstitiously

1751
02:00:52.630 --> 02:00:57.900
Do swear to the gods thatwinter kills the flies:

1752
02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:02.900
But yet I know you'll doas I advise.

1753
02:01:13.770 --> 02:01:17.670
Thus time we waste, andlong leagues make short;

1754
02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:22.200
Sail seas in cockles, havean wish but for't;

1755
02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.330
Making, to take yourimagination,

1756
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:26.970
From bourn to bourn,region to region.

1757
02:01:26.970 --> 02:01:30.770
Where our scenes seem tolive. I do beseech you

1758
02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:33.900
To learn of me, who standi' the gaps to teach you,

1759
02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:35.970
The stages of our story.

1760
02:01:35.970 --> 02:01:40.500
Pericles is now againthwarting the wayward seas,

1761
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:43.100
Attended on by many a lordand knight.

1762
02:01:43.100 --> 02:01:46.570
To see his daughter, allhis life's delight.

1763
02:01:46.570 --> 02:01:48.330
Old Helicanus goes along.

1764
02:01:48.330 --> 02:01:50.470
Behind is left to govern, if you bear in mind,

1765
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:52.800
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late

1766
02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:56.170
Advanced in time togreat and high estate,

1767
02:01:56.170 --> 02:01:59.730
Well-sailing ships andbounteous winds have brought

1768
02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:03.770
This king to Tarsus,--thinkhis pilot thought;

1769
02:02:03.770 --> 02:02:08.330
So with his steerage shallyour thoughts grow on,--

1770
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:11.730
To fetch his daughterhome, who first is gone.

1771
02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:16.970
Like motes and shadows seethem move awhile;

1772
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:21.430
Your ears unto your eyesI'll reconcile.

1773
02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:26.270
See how belief may sufferby foul show!

1774
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:31.100
This borrow'd passionstands for true old woe;

1775
02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:34.930
And Pericles, in sorrowall devour'd,

1776
02:03:34.930 --> 02:03:38.300
With sighs shot through, andbiggest tears o'ershower'd,

1777
02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:43.700
Leaves Tarsus and againembarks. He swears

1778
02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:47.170
Never to wash his face,nor cut his hairs:

1779
02:03:47.170 --> 02:03:50.430
He puts on sackcloth, andto sea. He bears

1780
02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:53.200
A tempest, which hismortal vessel tears,

1781
02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:59.200
And yet he rides it out.Now please you wit.

1782
02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:04.830
The epitaph is for Marinawrit by wicked Dionyza.

1783
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:09.030
'The fairest, sweet'st,and best lies here,

1784
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:11.600
Who wither'd in her springof year.

1785
02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:14.300
She was of Tyrus theking's daughter,

1786
02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:18.500
On whom foul death hathmade this slaughter;

1787
02:04:18.500 --> 02:04:22.800
Marina was she call'd; andat her birth,

1788
02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:26.470
The sea, being proud, swallow'dsome part o' the earth:

1789
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:29.470
Therefore the earth,fearing to be o'erflow'd,

1790
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:33.530
Hath The seas' birth-childon the heavens bestow'd:

1791
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:36.800
Wherefore she does, andswears she'll never stint,

1792
02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:42.830
Make raging battery uponshores of flint.'

1793
02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:45.270
No visor does become blackvillany

1794
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:49.070
So well as soft and tenderflattery.

1795
02:04:49.070 --> 02:04:52.930
Let Pericles believe hisdaughter's dead,

1796
02:04:52.930 --> 02:04:54.600
And bear his courses to beordered

1797
02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:58.500
By Lady Fortune; while ourscene must play

1798
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:00.630
His daughter's woe andheavy well-a-day

1799
02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:05.030
In her unholy service.Patience, then,

1800
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:09.170
And think you now are allin Mytilene.

1801
02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:24.930
Did you ever hear thelike?

1802
02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:28.100
No, nor never shall do insuch a place as this,

1803
02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:29.830
she being once gone.

1804
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:33.400
But to have divinitypreached there!

1805
02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:34.800
did you ever dreamof such a thing?

1806
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:42.930
No, no. Come, I am for nomore bawdy-houses:

1807
02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:46.730
shall's go hear thevestals sing?

1808
02:05:46.730 --> 02:05:49.230
I'll do any thing nowthat is virtuous;

1809
02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:52.530
but I am out of the roadof rutting for ever.

1810
02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:06.900
Well, I had rather thantwice the worth of her she

1811
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:08.570
had ne'er come here.

1812
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:10.500
Fie, fie upon her! she'sable to freeze the god

1813
02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:13.800
Priapus, and undo awhole generation.

1814
02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.630
We must either get herravished, or be rid of her.

1815
02:06:16.630 --> 02:06:18.670
When she should do for clientsher fitment, and do me the

1816
02:06:18.670 --> 02:06:20.970
kindness of our profession,she has me her quirks,

1817
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:24.700
her reasons, her master reasons,her prayers, her knees;

1818
02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:26.230
she would make apuritan of the devil,

1819
02:06:26.230 --> 02:06:28.930
if he should cheapen akiss of her.

1820
02:06:28.930 --> 02:06:31.200
'Faith, I must ravish her,or she'll disfurnish us

1821
02:06:31.200 --> 02:06:35.570
of all our cavaliers, andmake our swearers priests.

1822
02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:38.870
Now, the pox upon hergreen-sickness for me!

1823
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:40.970
'Faith, there's noway to be rid on't

1824
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:44.070
but by the way to the pox.

1825
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:54.570
Here comes the LordLysimachus disguised.

1826
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:06.370
How now! How a dozen ofvirginities?

1827
02:07:06.370 --> 02:07:10.170
Now, the gods to-blessyour honour!

1828
02:07:10.170 --> 02:07:13.800
I am glad to see yourhonour in good health.

1829
02:07:14.370 --> 02:07:16.230
You may so; 'tis thewell for you that your

1830
02:07:16.230 --> 02:07:25.170
resorters stand upon soundlegs. How now!

1831
02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:27.970
wholesome iniquity haveyou that a man may deal

1832
02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:32.100
withal, and defy thesurgeon?

1833
02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:39.730
We have here one, sir, ifshe would--but there never

1834
02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:41.700
came her like in Mytilene.

1835
02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:44.500
If she'ld but do thedeed of darkness,

1836
02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:49.300
thou wouldst say. Your honourknows what 'tis to say

1837
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:54.200
well enough. Well, callforth, call forth.

1838
02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:56.330
For flesh and blood, sir,white and red, you shall

1839
02:07:56.330 --> 02:08:02.830
see a rose; and she were arose indeed, if she had but--

1840
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:05.030
What, prithee?

1841
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:08.870
O, sir, I can be modest.

1842
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:11.230
That dignifies the renownof a bawd, no less than it

1843
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:14.530
gives a good report to anumber to be chaste.

1844
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:20.470
Here comes that whichgrows to the stalk;

1845
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:24.300
never plucked yet,I can assure you.

1846
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:33.730
Is she not a faircreature?

1847
02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:43.670
'Faith, she would serveafter a long voyage at sea.

1848
02:08:43.670 --> 02:08:45.630
Well, here's for you:leave us.

1849
02:08:45.630 --> 02:08:48.170
I beseech your honour,give me leave: a word, and

1850
02:08:48.170 --> 02:08:49.900
I'll have done presently.

1851
02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:51.330
I beseech you, do.

1852
02:08:56.330 --> 02:09:02.000
First, I would have you note,

1853
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.430
this is an honourable man.

1854
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:09.070
I desire to find him so, thatI may worthily note him.

1855
02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:11.530
Next, he's the governorof this country,

1856
02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:14.900
and a man whom I am bound to.

1857
02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:18.130
If he govern the country, youare bound to him indeed;

1858
02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:22.530
but how honourable he isin that, I know not.

1859
02:09:22.530 --> 02:09:27.870
Pray you, without anymore virginal fencing,

1860
02:09:27.870 --> 02:09:33.830
will you use him kindly? He willline your apron with gold.

1861
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:38.630
What he will do graciously,I will thankfully receive.

1862
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:41.370
Ha' you done?

1863
02:09:41.370 --> 02:09:47.130
My lord, she's not pacedyet: you must take some

1864
02:09:47.130 --> 02:09:51.400
pains to work her to yourmanage. Come, we will

1865
02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:55.670
leave his honour and hertogether. Go thy ways.

1866
02:10:07.330 --> 02:10:10.770
Now, pretty one, how longhave you been at this trade?

1867
02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:12.700
What trade, sir?

1868
02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:15.200
Why, I cannot name't but Ishall offend.

1869
02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:20.270
I cannot be offended with mytrade. Please you to name it.

1870
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:24.700
How long have you been ofthis profession?

1871
02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:26.200
E'er since I can remember.

1872
02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.070
Did you go to 't so young?Were you a gamester at

1873
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:29.530
five or at seven?

1874
02:10:29.530 --> 02:10:33.500
Earlier too, sir, if now Ibe one.

1875
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:35.700
Why, the house you dwellin proclaims you to be a

1876
02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:38.100
creature of sale.

1877
02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:40.470
Do you know this house tobe a place of such resort,

1878
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:44.430
and will come into 't? Ihear say you are of

1879
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:50.300
honourable parts, and arethe governor of this place.

1880
02:10:50.300 --> 02:10:53.070
Why, hath your principal madeknown unto you who I am?

1881
02:10:53.070 --> 02:10:55.200
Who is my principal?

1882
02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:58.730
Why, your herb-woman; shethat sets seeds and roots

1883
02:10:58.730 --> 02:11:06.700
of shame and iniquity. O,you have heard something

1884
02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.070
of my power, and so standaloof for more serious

1885
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:15.730
wooing. But I protestto thee, pretty one,

1886
02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:18.900
my authority shall not seethee, or else look friendly

1887
02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:24.100
upon thee. Come, bring meto some private place:

1888
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:25.600
come, come.

1889
02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.600
If you were born tohonour, show it now;

1890
02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.130
If put upon you, make thejudgment good

1891
02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:30.600
That thought you worthy ofit.

1892
02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.670
How's this? how's this?Some more; be sage.

1893
02:11:32.670 --> 02:11:33.800
What reason is therein your justice

1894
02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.100
which hath power over all toundo any?

1895
02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:41.500
Take you mine honour and youmake a gap into fobidden ground

1896
02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:46.030
Where after all may tread.If then with violence

1897
02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:48.030
you mar this workmanshipof heaven

1898
02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:52.030
you will abuse yourjustice, kill you honour

1899
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:57.870
and leave me impoverishedto the world.

1900
02:11:57.870 --> 02:12:00.300
Why this same housewherein thou live'st

1901
02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:03.770
is a receptacle ofall men's sins.

1902
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:08.330
A nurse of wickedness. Howcan'st thou be anything

1903
02:12:08.330 --> 02:12:10.730
but naught that dwells within?

1904
02:12:10.730 --> 02:12:15.000
Know you the roof butstill will enter here?

1905
02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.430
Oh my good lord, ifthere be fire before me

1906
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:21.000
must I straightway run to burnmyself

1907
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.600
or suppose this house,which two too many

1908
02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:27.730
feels such houses are shouldbe the doctor's patromony

1909
02:12:27.730 --> 02:12:30.200
and the surgeons feeding,follows it that I must needs

1910
02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:38.430
infect myself to maintain them.

1911
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:43.500
My yet good lord,make me your servant

1912
02:12:43.500 --> 02:12:48.600
and I will obey you.Let me live honest

1913
02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:54.670
and I am content. Honest.

1914
02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:09.830
How now, even in thisminute let me die.

1915
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:11.100
O, that the gods

1916
02:13:11.100 --> 02:13:14.770
Would set me free fromthis unhallow'd place,

1917
02:13:14.770 --> 02:13:17.800
Though they did change meto the meanest bird

1918
02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:22.900
That flies i' the purerair!

1919
02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:27.870
Now surely this is virtue'simage rather virtue's self.

1920
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:29.930
Come down from heavenawhile to reign on earth

1921
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:33.300
to teach us what we should be.

1922
02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:47.970
I did not think thou couldsthave spoke so well;

1923
02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:51.030
ne'er dream'd thou couldst.

1924
02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:58.430
I hither came with thoughtsintemperate, foul and deformed.

1925
02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:02.970
The which your tears havewashed, till they are white.

1926
02:14:13.030 --> 02:14:18.770
Your speech has mended mycorrupted mind.

1927
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:21.300
Hold, here's gold for thee:

1928
02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:25.130
Persever in that clear waythou goest,

1929
02:14:25.130 --> 02:14:28.230
And the gods strengthenthee!

1930
02:14:28.230 --> 02:14:29.670
The good gods preserveyou!

1931
02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:34.600
Lady, to me the very doors andwindows savour vilely.

1932
02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:39.600
Fare thee well. Thouart a piece of virtue,

1933
02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:44.830
and I doubt not but thytraining hath been noble.

1934
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.230
Hold, here's more gold forthee.

1935
02:14:52.100 --> 02:14:54.730
A curse upon him, die helike a thief,

1936
02:14:54.730 --> 02:15:04.630
That robs thee of thy goodness!

1937
02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:10.500
If thou dost hear from me,it shall be for thy good.

1938
02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:15.230
I beseech your honour, onepiece for me.

1939
02:15:15.230 --> 02:15:18.030
Avaunt, thou damneddoor-keeper!

1940
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:21.400
Your house, but for thisvirgin that doth prop it,

1941
02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.230
Would sink and overwhelmyou. Away!

1942
02:15:31.070 --> 02:15:36.800
How's this? We must takeanother course with you.

1943
02:15:36.800 --> 02:15:39.130
If your peevish chastity,which is not worth a

1944
02:15:39.130 --> 02:15:41.530
breakfast in the cheapestcountry under the cope,

1945
02:15:41.530 --> 02:15:45.600
shall undo a whole household,let me be gelded like

1946
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:48.700
a spaniel. Come your ways.

1947
02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:49.430
Whither would you have me?

1948
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:51.500
How now! what's thematter?

1949
02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:54.670
Worse and worse, mistress;she has here spoken holy

1950
02:15:54.670 --> 02:15:57.100
words to the LordLysimachus.

1951
02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:58.700
O abominable!

1952
02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:01.430
She makes our professionas it were to stink afore

1953
02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:02.670
the face of the gods.

1954
02:16:02.670 --> 02:16:04.400
Marry, hang her up forever!

1955
02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:06.130
The nobleman would havedealt with her like a

1956
02:16:06.130 --> 02:16:09.830
nobleman, and she sent himaway as cold as a snowball;

1957
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:12.630
saying his prayers too.

1958
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:22.670
Boult, take her away; useher at thy pleasure:

1959
02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:25.970
crack the glass ofher virginity,

1960
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:30.030
and make the rest malleable.

1961
02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:32.830
An if she were thornierground than she is,

1962
02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:35.500
she shall be ploughed.

1963
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:38.430
Hark, hark, you gods!

1964
02:16:38.430 --> 02:16:40.430
She conjures: away withher! Would she had never

1965
02:16:40.430 --> 02:16:45.770
come within my doors!Marry, hang you!

1966
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:54.030
She's born to undo us. Will younot go the way of women-kind?

1967
02:16:54.030 --> 02:17:01.330
Marry, come up, mydish of chastity

1968
02:17:01.330 --> 02:17:06.470
with rosemary and bays!

1969
02:17:14.130 --> 02:17:17.930
Come, mistress; I must haveyour maiden head taken off

1970
02:17:17.930 --> 02:17:20.870
or the common hangmanshall execute it.

1971
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:25.830
Come your ways. We'll have nomore gentlemen driven away.

1972
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:28.400
Come your ways, I say!

1973
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:36.530
Whither wilt thou have me?

1974
02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:39.670
To take from you the jewelyou hold so dear.

1975
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:41.900
Prithee, tell me one thingfirst.

1976
02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:44.030
Come now, your one thing.

1977
02:17:45.570 --> 02:17:47.730
Who does thou think thineenemy to be?

1978
02:17:47.730 --> 02:17:52.370
Why, I could wish him to be mymaster, or rather, my mistress.

1979
02:17:52.370 --> 02:17:53.670
Neither of these are sobad as thou art,

1980
02:17:53.670 --> 02:17:56.770
Since they do better theein their command.

1981
02:17:56.770 --> 02:17:58.500
Thou hold'st a place, forwhich the pained'st fiend

1982
02:17:58.500 --> 02:18:01.400
Of hell would not inreputation change:

1983
02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:03.370
Thou art the damneddoorkeeper to every

1984
02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:05.770
Coistrel that comesinquiring for his Tib;

1985
02:18:05.770 --> 02:18:07.670
To the choleric fisting ofevery rogue

1986
02:18:07.670 --> 02:18:10.000
Thy ear is liable; thyfood is such

1987
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:13.500
As hath been belch'd on byinfected lungs.

1988
02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:17.700
What would you have me do?go to the wars, would you?

1989
02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:19.770
Where a man may serveseven years for the loss

1990
02:18:19.770 --> 02:18:21.900
of a leg, and havenot money enough

1991
02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:23.070
to buy him a wooden one?

1992
02:18:23.070 --> 02:18:25.200
Do any thing butthis thou doest.

1993
02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:27.700
Empty old receptacles, orcommon shores, of filth;

1994
02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:29.800
Serve by indenture to thecommon hangman:

1995
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:32.900
Any of these ways are yetbetter than this;

1996
02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:39.970
For what thou professest,a baboon, could he speak,

1997
02:18:39.970 --> 02:18:46.300
Would own a name too dear.O, that the gods

1998
02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:49.500
Would safely deliver mefrom this place!

1999
02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:58.870
Here, here's gold forthee.

2000
02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:01.030
If that thy master wouldgain by thee,

2001
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:05.900
Proclaim that I can sing,weave, sew, and dance,

2002
02:19:05.900 --> 02:19:07.330
With other virtues, whichI'll keep from boast:

2003
02:19:07.330 --> 02:19:10.730
And I will undertake allthese to teach.

2004
02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:18.700
I doubt not but thispopulous city will

2005
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:21.570
Yield many scholars.

2006
02:19:29.500 --> 02:19:34.230
But can you teach all thisyou speak of?

2007
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:37.670
Prove that I cannot, takeme home again,

2008
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:39.930
And prostitute me to thebasest groom

2009
02:19:39.930 --> 02:19:44.200
That doth frequent yourhouse.

2010
02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:56.830
Well, I will see whatI can do for thee:

2011
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:58.470
if I can place thee, I will.

2012
02:19:58.470 --> 02:20:02.170
But amongst honest women.

2013
02:20:02.170 --> 02:20:07.430
'Faith, my acquaintancelies little amongst them.

2014
02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:10.570
But since my master andmistress have bought you,

2015
02:20:10.570 --> 02:20:14.170
there's no going butby their consent:

2016
02:20:14.170 --> 02:20:18.900
therefore I will make themacquainted with your purpose,

2017
02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:23.530
and I doubt not but I shallfind them tractable enough.

2018
02:20:28.570 --> 02:20:36.170
Come, I'll do for thee whatI can; come your ways.

2019
02:20:48.730 --> 02:20:52.470


2020
02:21:16.570 --> 02:21:20.770
Marina thus the brothel'scapes, and enters

2021
02:21:20.770 --> 02:21:24.670
Into an honest house, ourstory says.

2022
02:21:24.670 --> 02:21:28.470
She sings like oneimmortal, and she dances

2023
02:21:28.470 --> 02:21:31.800
As goddess-like to heradmired lays;

2024
02:21:31.800 --> 02:21:37.170
Deep clerks she dumbs; andwith her needle composes

2025
02:21:37.170 --> 02:21:41.970
Nature's own shape, of bud,bird, branch, and berry,

2026
02:21:41.970 --> 02:21:46.230
That even her art sistersthe natural roses;

2027
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:49.430
Her inkle, silk, twin withthe rubied cherry:

2028
02:21:49.430 --> 02:21:52.200
That pupils lacks she noneof noble race,

2029
02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:55.700
Who pour their bounty onher; and her gain

2030
02:21:55.700 --> 02:22:02.030
She gives the cursed bawd.Here we her place;

2031
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:04.870
And to her father turn ourminds again,

2032
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:08.200
Where we left him, on thesea. We there him lost;

2033
02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:11.730
Whence, driven before thewinds, he is arrived

2034
02:22:11.730 --> 02:22:16.230
Here where his daughterdwells; and on this coast

2035
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:20.430
Suppose him now at anchor.The city strived

2036
02:22:20.430 --> 02:22:23.630
God Neptune's annual feastto keep: from whence

2037
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:28.400
Lysimachus our Tyrian shipespies,

2038
02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:32.830
His banners sable, trimm'dwith rich expense;

2039
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:37.330
And to him in his bargewith fervor hies.

2040
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:39.500
Where is lord Helicanus?

2041
02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:40.730
he can resolve you.

2042
02:22:40.730 --> 02:22:41.730
O, here he is.

2043
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:44.270
Sir, there's a barge putoff from Mytilene,

2044
02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:46.170
And in it is Lysimachusthe governor,

2045
02:22:46.170 --> 02:22:47.970
Who craves to come aboard.What is your will?

2046
02:22:47.970 --> 02:22:50.370
That he have his. Call upsome gentlemen.

2047
02:22:50.370 --> 02:22:53.170
Ho, gentlemen! my lordcalls.

2048
02:22:56.730 --> 02:22:59.900
Gentlemen, there's some ofworth would come aboard;

2049
02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:02.370
I pray ye, greet themfairly.

2050
02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:04.800
Sir,

2051
02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:08.130
This is the man that can, inaught you would, resolve you.

2052
02:23:08.130 --> 02:23:11.970
Hail, reverend sir! thegods preserve you!

2053
02:23:11.970 --> 02:23:14.300
And you, sir, to outlivethe age I am,

2054
02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:16.100
And die as I would do.

2055
02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:18.570
You wish me well.

2056
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:22.070
Being on shore, honouringof Neptune's triumphs,

2057
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:24.700
Seeing this goodly vesselride before us,

2058
02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:27.030
I made to it, to know ofwhence you are.

2059
02:23:27.030 --> 02:23:29.300
First, what is your place?

2060
02:23:29.300 --> 02:23:32.330
I am the governor of thisplace you lie before.

2061
02:23:32.330 --> 02:23:34.200
Sir,

2062
02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:39.700
Our vessel is of Tyre, init the king;

2063
02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:42.030
A man who for this threemonths hath not spoken

2064
02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:45.000
To any one, nor takensustenance

2065
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.230
But to prorogue his grief.

2066
02:23:47.230 --> 02:23:49.730
Upon what ground is hisdistemperature?

2067
02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:51.100
'Twould be too tedious torepeat;

2068
02:23:51.100 --> 02:23:52.270
But the main grief springsfrom the loss

2069
02:23:52.270 --> 02:23:55.200
Of a beloved daughter anda wife.

2070
02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:57.030
May we not see him?

2071
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:58.200
You may;

2072
02:23:58.200 --> 02:24:01.230
But bootless is your sight:he will not speak to any.

2073
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:04.230
Yet let me obtain my wish.

2074
02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:16.900
Behold him.

2075
02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:18.730
This was a goodly person,

2076
02:24:18.730 --> 02:24:21.030
Till the disaster that,one mortal night,

2077
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:24.100
Drove him to this.

2078
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:32.300
Sir king, all hail!

2079
02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:36.570
Hail, royal sir!

2080
02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:50.430
The god's preserve you.

2081
02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:57.600
It is in vain; he will notspeak to you.

2082
02:25:02.770 --> 02:25:04.170
Sir,

2083
02:25:04.170 --> 02:25:06.430
We have a maid inMytilene, I durst wager,

2084
02:25:06.430 --> 02:25:09.000
Would win some words ofhim.

2085
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.200
'Tis well bethought.

2086
02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:12.070
She questionless with hersweet harmony

2087
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:14.370
And other chosenattractions, would allure,

2088
02:25:14.370 --> 02:25:16.570
And make a battery throughhis deafen'd parts,

2089
02:25:16.570 --> 02:25:20.400
Which now are midwaystopp'd:

2090
02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:22.770
She is all happy as thefairest of all,

2091
02:25:22.770 --> 02:25:24.730
And, with her fellow maidsis now upon

2092
02:25:24.730 --> 02:25:26.670
The leafy shelter thatabuts against

2093
02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:28.100
The island's side.

2094
02:25:28.100 --> 02:25:30.630
Sure, all's effectless;yet nothing we'll omit

2095
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:33.370
That bears recovery's name.But, since your kindness

2096
02:25:33.370 --> 02:25:35.700
We have stretch'd thusfar, let us beseech you

2097
02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:38.470
That for our gold we mayprovision have,

2098
02:25:38.470 --> 02:25:40.330
Wherein we are notdestitute for want,

2099
02:25:40.330 --> 02:25:43.430
But weary for thestaleness.

2100
02:25:43.430 --> 02:25:44.530
O, sir, a courtesy

2101
02:25:44.530 --> 02:25:46.900
Which if we should deny,the most just gods

2102
02:25:46.900 --> 02:25:48.870
For every graff would senda caterpillar,

2103
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:55.500
And so afflict ourprovince. Yet once more

2104
02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:58.200
Let me entreat to know atlarge the cause

2105
02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:00.570
Of your king's sorrow.

2106
02:26:00.570 --> 02:26:03.870
Sit, sir, I will recountit to you:

2107
02:26:09.570 --> 02:26:12.170
But, see, I am prevented.

2108
02:26:12.170 --> 02:26:13.200
O, here is

2109
02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.930
The lady that I sent for.Welcome, fair one!

2110
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:21.000
Is't not a goodlypresence?

2111
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.370
She's a gallant lady.

2112
02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:27.030
She's such a one, that,were I well assured

2113
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:30.100
Came of a gentle kind andnoble stock,

2114
02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:34.500
I'ld wish no better choice,and think me rarely wed.

2115
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:48.230
Fair one, all goodnessthat consists in bounty

2116
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:53.970
Expect even here, where isa kingly patient:

2117
02:26:55.970 --> 02:26:58.270
If that thy prosperous andartificial feat

2118
02:26:58.270 --> 02:27:01.630
Can draw him but to answerthee in aught,

2119
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:04.700
Thy sacred physic shallreceive such pay

2120
02:27:04.700 --> 02:27:07.200
As thy desires can wish.

2121
02:27:07.200 --> 02:27:08.500
Sir, I will use

2122
02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:10.970
My utmost skillin his recovery,

2123
02:27:10.970 --> 02:27:13.700
Provided that none but Iand my companion maid

2124
02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:16.130
Be suffer'd to come nearhim.

2125
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:19.470
Come, let us leave her;

2126
02:27:19.470 --> 02:27:21.770
And the gods make herprosperous!

2127
02:27:43.570 --> 02:27:53.200
â™ª sings

2128
02:29:58.630 --> 02:30:00.670
Mark'd he your music?

2129
02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:06.800
No, nor look'd on us.

2130
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:15.700
See, she will speak tohim.

2131
02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:37.930
Hail, sir! my lord, lendear.

2132
02:30:40.730 --> 02:30:41.730
I am a maid,

2133
02:30:41.730 --> 02:30:43.470
My lord, that ne'er beforeinvited eyes,

2134
02:30:43.470 --> 02:30:48.130
But have been gazed onlike a comet: she speaks,

2135
02:30:48.130 --> 02:30:50.330
My lord, that, may be,hath endured a grief

2136
02:30:50.330 --> 02:30:55.070
Might equal yours, if bothwere justly weigh'd.

2137
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:57.330
Though wayward fortune didmalign my state,

2138
02:30:57.330 --> 02:30:59.100
My derivation was fromancestors

2139
02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:03.930
Who stood equivalent withmighty kings:

2140
02:31:03.930 --> 02:31:06.800
But time hath rooted outmy parentage,

2141
02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:08.600
And to the world andawkward casualties

2142
02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:14.030
Bound me in servitude.

2143
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:18.470
I will desist;

2144
02:31:18.470 --> 02:31:20.470
But there is somethingglows upon my cheek,

2145
02:31:20.470 --> 02:31:24.330
And whispers in mine ear,'Go not till he speak.'

2146
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:35.000
My fortunes--parentage--goodparentage--

2147
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:43.700
To equal mine!--was it notthus? what say you?

2148
02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:45.170
I said, my lord, if youdid know my parentage,

2149
02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:48.130
You would not do meviolence.

2150
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:56.270
I do think so. Pray you,turn your eyes upon me.

2151
02:31:56.270 --> 02:32:06.130
You are like somethingthat--What country-woman?

2152
02:32:06.130 --> 02:32:07.900
Here of these shores?

2153
02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:10.770
No, nor of any shores:

2154
02:32:10.770 --> 02:32:12.530
Yet I was mortally broughtforth, and am

2155
02:32:12.530 --> 02:32:13.970
No other than I appear.

2156
02:32:13.970 --> 02:32:20.670
I am great with woe, andshall deliver weeping.

2157
02:32:20.670 --> 02:32:24.770
My dearest wife was likethis maid, and such a one

2158
02:32:24.770 --> 02:32:34.000
My daughter might have been:my queen's square brows;

2159
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.830
Her stature to an inch; aswand-like straight;

2160
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:42.330
As silver-voiced; her eyesas jewel-like

2161
02:32:42.330 --> 02:32:49.030
And cased as richly; inpace another Juno;

2162
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:51.330
Who starves the ears shefeeds, and makes them hungry,

2163
02:32:51.330 --> 02:33:01.370
The more she gives themspeech. Where do you live?

2164
02:33:01.370 --> 02:33:03.730
Where I am but a stranger:

2165
02:33:03.730 --> 02:33:05.470
From the deck you maydiscern the place.

2166
02:33:05.470 --> 02:33:08.230
Where were you bred?

2167
02:33:08.230 --> 02:33:11.470
And how achieved you theseendowments, which

2168
02:33:11.470 --> 02:33:13.570
You make more rich to owe?

2169
02:33:13.570 --> 02:33:15.170
If I should tell myhistory, it would seem

2170
02:33:15.170 --> 02:33:18.570
Like lies disdain'd in thereporting.

2171
02:33:18.570 --> 02:33:20.970
Prithee, speak:

2172
02:33:20.970 --> 02:33:24.130
Falseness cannot come fromthee; for thou look'st

2173
02:33:24.130 --> 02:33:28.300
Modest as Justice, andthou seem'st a palace

2174
02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:33.200
For the crown'd Truth to dwellin: I will believe thee,

2175
02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:35.070
And make my senses creditthy relation

2176
02:33:35.070 --> 02:33:41.600
To points that seemimpossible; for thou look'st

2177
02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:53.230
Like one I loved indeed.What were thy friends?

2178
02:33:53.230 --> 02:33:54.970
Didst thou not say, when Idid push thee back--

2179
02:33:54.970 --> 02:33:56.970
Which was when I perceivedthee--that thou camest

2180
02:33:56.970 --> 02:33:58.500
From good descending?

2181
02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:00.200
So indeed I did.

2182
02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:03.600
Report thy parentage. Ithink thou said'st

2183
02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:06.670
Thou hadst been toss'dfrom wrong to injury,

2184
02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:09.430
And that thou thought'st thygriefs might equal mine,

2185
02:34:09.430 --> 02:34:11.000
If both were open'd.

2186
02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:11.970
Some such thing

2187
02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:14.730
I said, and said no morebut what my thoughts

2188
02:34:14.730 --> 02:34:16.170
Did warrant me was likely.

2189
02:34:16.170 --> 02:34:18.870
Tell thy story;

2190
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:21.570
If thine consider'd provethe thousandth part

2191
02:34:21.570 --> 02:34:23.930
Of my endurance, thou arta man, and I

2192
02:34:23.930 --> 02:34:29.130
Have suffer'd like a girl:yet thou dost look

2193
02:34:29.130 --> 02:34:33.330
Like Patience gazing onkings' graves, and smiling

2194
02:34:33.330 --> 02:34:41.200
Extremity out of act. Whatwere thy friends?

2195
02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:48.130
How lost thou them? Thyname, my most kind virgin?

2196
02:34:48.130 --> 02:34:51.770
Recount, I do beseechthee: come, sit by me.

2197
02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:00.400
My name is Marina.

2198
02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:06.430
O, I am mock'd,

2199
02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:09.400
And thou by some incensedgod sent hither

2200
02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:12.700
To make the world to laughat me.

2201
02:35:12.700 --> 02:35:14.370
Patience, good sir,

2202
02:35:14.370 --> 02:35:16.430
Or here I'll cease.

2203
02:35:16.430 --> 02:35:24.800
Nay, I'll be patient.

2204
02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:26.970
Thou little know'st howthou dost startle me,

2205
02:35:26.970 --> 02:35:30.600
To call thyself Marina.

2206
02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:33.530
The name was given me byone that had some power,

2207
02:35:33.530 --> 02:35:37.800
My father, and a king.

2208
02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:39.700
How! a king's daughter?

2209
02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:42.070
And call'd Marina?

2210
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:44.800
You said you would believeme;

2211
02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:47.230
But, not to be a troubler ofyour peace, I will end here.

2212
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:49.530
But are you flesh andblood?

2213
02:35:49.530 --> 02:35:52.730
Have you a working pulse?and are no fairy?

2214
02:35:58.430 --> 02:36:10.070
Motion! Well; speak on.Where were you born?

2215
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:13.200
And wherefore call'dMarina?

2216
02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.730
Call'd Marina For Iwas born at sea.

2217
02:36:15.730 --> 02:36:20.800
At sea! what mother?

2218
02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:23.170
My mother was the daughterof a king;

2219
02:36:23.170 --> 02:36:26.130
Who died the minute I wasborn,

2220
02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:28.000
As my good nurse Lychoridahath oft

2221
02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.230
Deliver'd weeping.

2222
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:35.100
O, stop there a little!

2223
02:36:35.100 --> 02:36:37.130
This is the rarest dreamthat e'er dull sleep

2224
02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:45.600
Did mock sad fools withal:this cannot be:

2225
02:36:45.600 --> 02:37:00.470
My daughter's buried.Well: where were you bred?

2226
02:37:00.470 --> 02:37:02.130
I'll hear you more, to thebottom of your story,

2227
02:37:02.130 --> 02:37:03.700
And never interrupt you.

2228
02:37:03.700 --> 02:37:06.870
You scorn: believe me,'twere best I did give o'er.

2229
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:09.330
I will believe you by thesyllable

2230
02:37:09.330 --> 02:37:16.000
Of what you shall deliver.Yet, give me leave:

2231
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:22.370
How came you in theseparts? where were you bred?

2232
02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:26.670
The king my father did inTarsus leave me;

2233
02:37:26.670 --> 02:37:27.830
Till cruel Cleon, with hiswicked wife,

2234
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:30.100
Did seek to murder me: andhaving woo'd

2235
02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:32.030
A villain to attempt it,who having drawn to do't,

2236
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:33.970
A crew of pirates came andrescued me;

2237
02:37:33.970 --> 02:37:37.000
Brought me to Mytilene.But, good sir,

2238
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.800
Whither will you have me?Why do you weep?

2239
02:37:40.800 --> 02:37:43.630
It may be, You thinkme an impostor:

2240
02:37:43.630 --> 02:37:44.600
no, good faith;

2241
02:37:44.600 --> 02:37:49.000
I am the daughter to KingPericles,

2242
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.470
If good King Pericles be.

2243
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:59.700
Ho, Helicanus!

2244
02:37:59.700 --> 02:38:01.070
Calls my lord?

2245
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:02.600
Thou art a grave and noblecounsellor,

2246
02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:07.130
Most wise in general: tellme, if thou canst,

2247
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:11.670
What this maid is, or whatis like to be,

2248
02:38:11.670 --> 02:38:13.130
That thus hath made meweep?

2249
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:14.270
I know not; but

2250
02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:15.970
Here is the regent, sir,of Mytilene

2251
02:38:15.970 --> 02:38:17.170
Speaks nobly of her.

2252
02:38:17.170 --> 02:38:18.530
She would never tell

2253
02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:19.930
Her parentage; beingdemanded that,

2254
02:38:19.930 --> 02:38:22.870
She would sit still andweep.

2255
02:38:22.870 --> 02:38:33.030
O Helicanus, strike me,royal'd sir;

2256
02:38:33.030 --> 02:38:37.470
Give me a gash, put me topresent pain;

2257
02:38:37.470 --> 02:38:43.130
Lest this great sea ofjoys rushing upon me

2258
02:38:43.130 --> 02:38:44.870
O'erbear the shores of mymortality,

2259
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:56.370
And drown me with theirsweetness. O, come hither,

2260
02:38:56.370 --> 02:39:04.730
Thou that beget'st himthat did thee beget;

2261
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:11.500
Thou that wast born atsea, buried at Tarsus,

2262
02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:16.600
And found at sea again! OHelicanus,

2263
02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:19.830
Down on thy knees, thankthe holy gods as loud

2264
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:30.770
As thunder threatens us:this is Marina.

2265
02:39:30.770 --> 02:39:34.730
What was thy mother'sname? tell me but that,

2266
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:36.330
For truth can never beconfirm'd enough,

2267
02:39:36.330 --> 02:39:37.500
Though doubts did eversleep.

2268
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:38.730
First, sir, I pray,

2269
02:39:38.730 --> 02:39:39.770
What is your title?

2270
02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:43.130
I am Pericles of Tyre: buttell me now

2271
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:44.630
My drown'd queen's name,as in the rest you said

2272
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:47.100
Thou hast been godlikeperfect,

2273
02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:49.130
The heir of kingdoms andanother like

2274
02:39:49.130 --> 02:39:53.730
To Pericles thy father.

2275
02:39:53.730 --> 02:39:55.030
Is it no more to be yourdaughter than

2276
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:57.970
To say my mother's namewas Thaisa?

2277
02:39:57.970 --> 02:40:00.530
Thaisa was my mother, whodid end

2278
02:40:00.530 --> 02:40:02.300
The minute I began.

2279
02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:14.370
Now, blessing on thee!rise; thou art my child.

2280
02:40:17.170 --> 02:40:22.700
Give me fresh garments.Mine own, Helicanus;

2281
02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:25.130
She is not dead at Tarsus,as she should have been,

2282
02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:28.900
By savage Cleon: she shalltell thee all;

2283
02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:30.800
When thou shalt kneel, andjustify in knowledge

2284
02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:35.630
She is thy very princess.Who is this?

2285
02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:37.600
Sir, 'tis the governor ofMytilene,

2286
02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:38.970
Who, hearing of yourmelancholy state,

2287
02:40:38.970 --> 02:40:40.130
Did come to see you.

2288
02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:42.530
I embrace you.

2289
02:40:42.530 --> 02:40:46.770
Give me my robes. I amwild in my beholding.

2290
02:40:46.770 --> 02:40:53.500
O heavens bless my girl!But, hark, what music?

2291
02:40:53.500 --> 02:40:56.700
Tell Helicanus, my Marina,tell him

2292
02:40:56.700 --> 02:40:58.700
O'er, point by point, foryet he seems to doubt,

2293
02:40:58.700 --> 02:41:02.430
How sure you are mydaughter. But, what music?

2294
02:41:02.430 --> 02:41:03.930
(â™ª music)

2295
02:41:03.930 --> 02:41:05.430
My lord, I hear none.

2296
02:41:05.430 --> 02:41:10.170
(â™ª music)

2297
02:41:10.170 --> 02:41:15.830
None!

2298
02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:26.870
The music of the spheres!List, my Marina.

2299
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:30.070
It is not good to crosshim; give him way.

2300
02:41:30.070 --> 02:41:36.670
Rarest sounds! Do ye nothear?

2301
02:41:36.670 --> 02:41:39.530
Music, my lord, I hear.

2302
02:41:40.170 --> 02:41:44.670
Most heavenly music!

2303
02:41:45.730 --> 02:41:50.630
It nips me unto listening,and thick slumber

2304
02:41:50.630 --> 02:41:58.600
Hangs upon mine eyes: letme rest.

2305
02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.430
A pillow for his head:

2306
02:42:06.430 --> 02:42:08.270
So, leave him.

2307
02:42:17.830 --> 02:42:20.970
Well, mycompanion friends,

2308
02:42:20.970 --> 02:42:23.300
If this but answer to myjust belief,

2309
02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:25.530
I'll well remember you.

2310
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:44.800
My temple stands inEphesus: hie thee thither,

2311
02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:50.100
And do upon mine altarsacrifice.

2312
02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:54.600
There, when my maidenpriests are met together,

2313
02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:56.770
Before the people all,

2314
02:42:56.770 --> 02:43:02.000
Reveal how thou at seadidst lose thy wife:

2315
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.700
To mourn thy crosses, withthy daughter's, call

2316
02:43:04.700 --> 02:43:09.100
And give them repetitionto the life.

2317
02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:14.430
Perform my bidding, orthou livest in woe;

2318
02:43:14.430 --> 02:43:20.630
Do it, and happy; by mysilver bow!

2319
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:26.630
Awake, and tell thy dream.

2320
02:43:26.630 --> 02:43:34.300
Celestial Dian, goddessargentine,

2321
02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:37.930
I will obey thee.

2322
02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:55.470
Helicanus!

2323
02:43:55.470 --> 02:43:57.570
Sir?

2324
02:43:57.570 --> 02:44:00.070
My purpose was for Tarsus,there to strike

2325
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:02.830
The inhospitable Cleon;but I am

2326
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:05.170
For other service first:toward Ephesus

2327
02:44:05.170 --> 02:44:09.500
Turn our blown sails;eftsoons I'll tell thee why.

2328
02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:14.430
Shall we refresh us, sir,upon your shore,

2329
02:44:14.430 --> 02:44:16.070
And give you gold for suchprovision

2330
02:44:16.070 --> 02:44:17.170
As our intents will need?

2331
02:44:17.170 --> 02:44:20.200
Sir, With all my heart;and, when you come ashore,

2332
02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:23.570
I have another suit.

2333
02:44:26.170 --> 02:44:29.130
You shall prevail,

2334
02:44:29.130 --> 02:44:32.030
Were it to woo mydaughter; for it seems

2335
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:35.030
You have been nobletowards her.

2336
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:40.000
Sir, lend me your arm.

2337
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:45.630
Come, my Marina.

2338
02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:13.270
Now our sands are almostrun;

2339
02:45:13.270 --> 02:45:17.800
More a little, and thendumb.

2340
02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:19.500
This, my last boon, giveme,

2341
02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:22.870
For such kindness mustrelieve me,

2342
02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:24.330
That you aptly willsuppose

2343
02:45:24.330 --> 02:45:29.400
What pageantry, whatfeats, what shows,

2344
02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:30.600
What minstrelsy, andpretty din,

2345
02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:32.200
The regent made inMytilene

2346
02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:36.100
To greet the king. So hethrived,

2347
02:45:36.100 --> 02:45:38.170
That he is promised to bewived

2348
02:45:38.170 --> 02:45:40.800
To fair Marina; but in nowise

2349
02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:42.830
Till he had done hissacrifice,

2350
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:46.030
As Dian bade: wheretobeing bound,

2351
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:49.470
The interim, pray you, allconfound.

2352
02:45:49.470 --> 02:45:54.070
In feather'd briefnesssails are fill'd,

2353
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:57.630
And wishes fall out asthey're will'd.

2354
02:45:57.630 --> 02:46:01.030
At Ephesus, the templesee,

2355
02:46:01.030 --> 02:46:04.270
Our king and all hiscompany.

2356
02:46:05.530 --> 02:46:07.130
That he can hither come sosoon,

2357
02:46:07.130 --> 02:46:10.970
Is by your fancy'sthankful doom.

2358
02:46:19.400 --> 02:46:24.770
Hail, Dian! to perform thyjust command,

2359
02:46:24.770 --> 02:46:27.970
I here confess myself theking of Tyre;

2360
02:46:27.970 --> 02:46:29.570
Who, frighted from mycountry, did wed

2361
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:33.670
At Pentapolis the fairThaisa.

2362
02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:38.900
At sea in childbed diedshe, but brought forth

2363
02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:41.930
A maid-child call'dMarina; who, O goddess,

2364
02:46:41.930 --> 02:46:47.800
Wears yet thy silverlivery. She at Tarsus

2365
02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:51.430
Was nursed with Cleon; whoat sixteen years

2366
02:46:51.430 --> 02:46:54.470
He sought to murder: buther better stars

2367
02:46:54.470 --> 02:46:57.830
Brought her to Mytilene;'gainst whose shore

2368
02:46:57.830 --> 02:47:00.300
Riding, her fortunesbrought the maid aboard us,

2369
02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:04.430
Where, by her own mostclear remembrance, she

2370
02:47:04.430 --> 02:47:08.230
Made known herself mydaughter.

2371
02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:20.570
Voice and favour!

2372
02:47:20.570 --> 02:47:30.870
You are, you are--O royalPericles!

2373
02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:32.170
She dies! help, gentlemen!

2374
02:47:32.170 --> 02:47:33.800
To the lady.

2375
02:47:37.430 --> 02:47:39.270
Noble sir,

2376
02:47:39.270 --> 02:47:41.770
If you have told Diana'saltar true,

2377
02:47:41.770 --> 02:47:44.770
This is your wife.

2378
02:47:44.770 --> 02:47:47.900
Reverend appearer, no;

2379
02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:50.130
I threw her overboard withthese very arms.

2380
02:47:50.130 --> 02:47:53.630
Upon this coast, I warrantyou.

2381
02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:57.570
'Tis most certain.

2382
02:47:57.830 --> 02:48:03.630
O, she's but o'erjoy'd.

2383
02:48:03.630 --> 02:48:07.530
Early one blustering mornthis lady was

2384
02:48:07.530 --> 02:48:13.270
Thrown upon this shore. Ioped the coffin,

2385
02:48:13.270 --> 02:48:17.270
Found her richjewels; recover'd her,

2386
02:48:17.270 --> 02:48:20.070
and placed her herein Diana's temple.

2387
02:48:20.970 --> 02:48:22.470
May we see them?

2388
02:48:22.470 --> 02:48:24.400
Great sir, they shall bebrought you to my house,

2389
02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:29.600
Whither I invite you.Look, Thaisa is recovered.

2390
02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:33.570
O, let me look!

2391
02:48:33.570 --> 02:48:36.200
If he be none of mine, mysanctity

2392
02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:38.970
Will to my sense bend nolicentious ear,

2393
02:48:38.970 --> 02:48:45.400
But curb it, spite ofseeing. O, my lord,

2394
02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:53.430
Are you not Pericles? Likehim you spake,

2395
02:48:53.430 --> 02:48:59.470
Like him you are: did younot name a tempest,

2396
02:48:59.470 --> 02:49:01.400
A birth, and death?

2397
02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:05.930
The voice of dead Thaisa!

2398
02:49:05.930 --> 02:49:11.300
That Thaisa am I, supposeddead

2399
02:49:11.300 --> 02:49:13.570
And drown'd.

2400
02:49:13.570 --> 02:49:15.870
Immortal Dian!

2401
02:49:15.870 --> 02:49:17.370
Now I know you better.

2402
02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:19.070
When we with tears partedPentapolis,

2403
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:21.600
The king my father gaveyou such a ring.

2404
02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:32.530
This, this: no more, yougods! your present kindness

2405
02:49:32.530 --> 02:49:38.900
Makes my past miseriessports: you shall do well,

2406
02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:43.600
That on the touching ofher lips I may

2407
02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:50.000
Melt and no more be seen.O, come, be buried

2408
02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.870
A second time within thesearms.

2409
02:49:54.500 --> 02:50:00.000
My heart Leaps to be goneinto my mother's bosom.

2410
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:04.630
Look, who kneels here!Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;

2411
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:07.830
Thy burden at the sea, andcall'd Marina

2412
02:50:07.830 --> 02:50:10.600
For she was yielded there.

2413
02:50:10.600 --> 02:50:20.630
Blest, and mine own!

2414
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:26.170
Blest, and mine own!

2415
02:50:26.170 --> 02:50:31.530
Hail, madam, and my queen!

2416
02:50:31.530 --> 02:50:34.300
I know you not.

2417
02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:37.000
You have heard me say,when I did fly from Tyre,

2418

Of monstrous lust the dueand just reward:

In Pericles, his queen anddaughter, seen,

2459
02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:24.170
Although assail'd withfortune fierce and keen,

That he and his they inhis palace burn;
