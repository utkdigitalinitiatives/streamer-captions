00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300


2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.870
Was that the King that spurredhis horse so hard

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.370
Against the steep uprisingof the hill?

4
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.230
I know not; but I think itwas not he.

5
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.470
Whoe'er a' was, a' show'da mounting mind.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.930
Well, lords, to-day weshall have our dispatch:

7
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.600
On Saturday we will returnto France.

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.070
Then, forester, my friend,where is the bush

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.730
That we must stand andplay the murderer in?

10
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.770
Hereby, upon the edge ofyonder coppice;

11
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.930
A stand where you may makethe fairest shoot.

12
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.600
But come, the bow: nowmercy goes to kill,

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.630
The poor deer's blood, thatmy heart means no ill.

14
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.600
Here comes a member of thecommonwealth.

15
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.900
God dig-you-den all! Prayyou, which is the head lady?

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.400
Thou shalt know her, fellow, bythe others that have no heads.

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.570
Which is the greatestlady, the highest?

18
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.630
The thickest and thetallest.

19
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.770
The thickest and the tallest!it is so; truth is truth.

20
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.030
An your waist, mistress,were as slender as my wit,

21
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.200
One o' these maids' girdlesfor your waist should be fit.

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.930
Are not you the chief woman?you are the thickest here.

23
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.630
What's your will, sir?what's your will?

24
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.900
I have a letter from MonsieurBiron to one Lady Rosaline.

25
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.700
O, thy letter, thy letter!he's a good friend of mine:

26
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.300
Stand aside, good bearer.Boyet, you can carve;

27
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.670
Break up this capon.

28
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.470
I am bound to serve.

29
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.800
This letter is mistook, itimporteth none here;

30
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.900
It is writ to Jaquenetta.

31
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.500
We will read it, I swear.

32
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.700
Break the neck of the wax,and every one give ear.

33
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.270
'By heaven, that thou artfair, is most infallible;

34
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.970
true, that thou artbeauteous; truth itself,

35
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.300
that thou art lovely.More fairer than fair,

36
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.270
beautiful than beauteous,truer than truth itself,

37
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.230
have commiseration onthy heroical vassal!

38
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.770
The magnanimous and mostillustrate king Cophetua set

39
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.300
eye upon the pernicious andindubitate beggar Zenelophon;

40
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.200
and he it was thatmight rightly say,

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.800
Veni, vidi, vici; which toannothanize in the vulgar,

42
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.370
--O base and obscurevulgar!--videlicet,

43
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.530
He came, saw, and overcame:he came, one; saw two;

44
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.370
overcame, three. Whocame? the king:

45
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.430
why did he come? to see: whydid he see? to overcome:

46
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.370
to whom came he? to thebeggar: what saw he?

47
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.270
the beggar: who overcamehe? the beggar.

48
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.470
The conclusion is victory:on whose side? the king's.

49
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.570
The captive is enriched:on whose side?

50
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.170
the beggar's. The catastropheis a nuptial: on whose side?

51
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:44.870
the king's: no, on bothin one, or one in both.

52
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.870
I am the king; for sostands the comparison:

53
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.400
thou the beggar; for sowitnesseth thy lowliness.

54
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.170
What shalt thouexchange for rags? robes;

55
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.400
for tittles? titles;for thyself? me.

56
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.100
Thus, expecting thy reply, Iprofane my lips on thy foot,

57
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:18.170
my eyes on thy picture. andmy heart on thy every part.

58
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.530
Thine, in the dearestdesign of industry,

59
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.070
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

60
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.200
What plume of feathers is hethat indited this letter?

61
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.670
What vane? what weathercock?did you ever hear better?

62
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.470
I am much deceived but Iremember the style.

63
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.300
Else your memory is bad,going o'er it erewhile.

64
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.170
This Armado is a Spaniard,that keeps here in court;

65
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.270
A phantasime, a Monarcho,and one that makes sport

66
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.470
To the prince and hisbookmates.

67
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.700
Thou fellow, a word:

68
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.430
Who gave thou this letter?

69
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.770
I told you; my lord.

70
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.930
To whom shouldst thou giveit?

71
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.500
From my lord to my lady.

72
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.970
From which lord to whichlady?

73
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.030
From my lord Biron, a goodmaster of mine,

74
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.970
To a lady of France thathe call'd Rosaline.

75
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.270
Thou hast mistaken hisletter. Come, lords, away.

76
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.270
Here, sweet, put up this:'twill be thine another day.

77
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.370
Who is the suitor? who isthe suitor?

78
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.800
Shall I teach you to know?

79
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.670
Ay, my continent ofbeauty.

80
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.900
Why, she that bears thebow.

81
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.500
Finely put off!

82
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.230
My lady goes to killhorns; but, if thou marry,

83
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.230
Hang me by the neck, ifhorns that year miscarry.

84
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.570
Finely put on!

85
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.930
Well, then, I am theshooter.

86
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.000
And who is your deer?

87
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.430
If we choose by the horns,yourself come not near.

88
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.230
Finely put on, indeed!

89
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.200
You still wranglewith her, Boyet,

90
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.370
and she strikes at the brow.

91
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.530
But she herself is hitlower: have I hit her now?

92
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.070
Shall I come upon theewith an old saying,

93
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.800
that was a man when King Pepinof France was a little boy,

94
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.900
as touching the hit it?

95
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.200
So I may answer theewith one as old,

96
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.270
that was a woman when QueenGuinover of Britain was

97
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.070
a little wench, astouching the hit it.

98
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.070
Thou canst not hit it, hitit, hit it,

99
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.230
Thou canst not hit it, mygood man.

100
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.030
An I cannot, cannot,cannot,

101
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.470
An I cannot, another can.

102
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.470
O' my troth, most sweet jests!most incony vulgar wit!

103
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.870
When it comes so smoothlyoff, so obscenely,

104
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.000
as it were, so fit.

105
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.870
Very reverend sport, truly;

106
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.270
and done in the testimonyof a good conscience.

107
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.500
The deer was, as youknow, sanguis, in blood;

108
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.470
ripe as the pomewater, whonow hangeth like a jewel in

109
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.730
the ear of caelo, the sky,the welkin, the heaven;

110
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.300
and anon falleth like acrab on the face of terra,

111
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.470
the soil, the land, theearth.

112
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.730
Truly, Master Holofernes,the epithets are sweetly

113
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.830
varied, like a scholarat the least:

114
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.400
but, sir, I assure ye, it wasa buck of the first head.

115
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.570
Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.

116
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.100
'Twas not a haud credo;'twas a pricket.

117
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.800
Most barbarous intimation!yet a kind of insinuation,

118
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.000
as it were, in via, inway, of explication;

119
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.100
facere, as it were, replication,or rather,

120
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.400
ostentare, as itwere, to show, his inclination,

121
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.870
after his undressed,unpolished,

122
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.370
uneducated, unpruned,untrained, or rather,

123
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.670
unlettered, or ratherest,unconfirmed fashion,

124
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.730
to insert again my haudcredo for a deer.

125
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.730
I said the deer was not ahaud credo; twas a pricket.

126
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.830
Twice-sod simplicity, hiscoctus!

127
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.370
O thou monster Ignorance,how deformed dost thou look!

128
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.470
Sir, he hath never fed ofthe dainties that are bred

129
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.830
in a book; he hath noteat paper, as it were;

130
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.870
he hath not drunk ink: hisintellect is not replenished;

131
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.930
he is only an animal, onlysensible in the duller parts:

132
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.200
And such barren plantsare set before us,

133
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.600
that we thankful should be,

134
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.130
Which we of taste and knowledgeare, for those parts which

135
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.570
do fructify in us morethan he.

136
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.200
For as it would illbecome me to be vain,

137
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.030
indiscreet, or a fool,

138
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.270
So were there a patchset on learning,

139
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.730
to see him in a school:But omne bene, say I;

140
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.500
being of an old father's mind,

141
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.770
Many can brook the weatherthat love not the wind.

142
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.900
You two are book-men: canyou tell me by your wit

143
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.100
What was a month oldat Cain's birth,

144
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.970
that's not fiveweeks old as yet?

145
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.970
Dictynna, goodman Dull;Dictynna, goodman Dull.

146
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.070
What is Dictynna?

147
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.470
A title to Phoebe, toLuna, to the moon.

148
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:53.930
The moon was a month oldwhen Adam was no more,

149
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.630
And raught not to five weekswhen he came to five-score.

150
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.030
The allusion holds in theexchange.

151
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.430
'Tis true indeed; the collusionholds in the exchange.

152
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.230
God comfort thycapacity! I say,

153
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.500
the allusion holdsin the exchange.

154
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.830
And I say, the pollusionholds in the exchange;

155
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.630
for the moon is neverbut a month old:

156
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.000
and I say beside that,

157
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.400
'twas a pricket thatthe princess killed.

158
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.170
Sir Nathaniel, will youhear an extemporal epitaph

159
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.030
on the death of the deer?

160
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.400
And, to humour the ignorant,

161
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.270
call I the deer theprincess killed a pricket.

162
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.000
Perge, good MasterHolofernes, perge;

163
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so it shall please youto abrogate scurrility.

164
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.730
I will something affect theletter, for it argues facility.

165
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.030
The preyful princessprick'd and pierced

166
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.670
a prettypleasing pricket;

167
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.530
Some say a sore;but not a sore,

168
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.200
till now made sorewith shooting.

169
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.330
The dogs did yell:put L to sore,

170
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.270
then sorel jumps from thicket;

171
00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.000
Or pricket sore, or else sorel;the people fall a-hooting.

172
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.770
If sore be sore, then L to soremakes fifty sores one sorel.

173
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.400
Of one sore I an hundred makeby adding but one more L.

174
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.800
A rare talent!

175
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.300
This is a gift that Ihave, simple, simple;

176
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.600
a foolish extravagant spirit,full of forms, figures,

177
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.770
shapes, objects, ideas,apprehensions, motions,

178
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.870
revolutions: these are begotin the ventricle of memory,

179
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.270
nourished in thewomb of pia mater,

180
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.730
and delivered upon themellowing of occasion.

181
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.700
But the gift is good inthose in whom it is acute,

182
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.070
and I am thankful for it.

183
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:47.570
Sir, I praise the Lord for you;and so may my parishioners;

184
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.270
for their sons arewell tutored by you,

185
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.870
and their daughters profitvery greatly under you:

186
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.330
you are a good memberof the commonwealth.

187
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.870
Mehercle, if theirsons be ingenuous,

188
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.130
they shall want no instruction;if their daughters be capable,

189
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:07.630
I will put it to them: but virsapit qui pauca loquitur;

190
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.530
Good master Parson, be sogood as read me this letter:

191
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.970
it was given me by Costard,and sent me from Don Armado:

192
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.930
I beseech you, read it.

193
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:25.730
Fauste, precor gelida quandopecus omne sub umbra

194
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.770
Ruminat,--and so forth.Ah, good old Mantuan!

195
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.000
I may speak of thee as thetraveller doth of Venice;

196
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Venetia, Venetia,

197
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.670
Chi non ti vede non tipretia.

198
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.330
Old Mantuan, old Mantuan!who understandeth thee not,

199
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:48.570
loves thee not. Ut,re, sol, la, mi, fa.

200
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.830
Under pardon, sir, whatare the contents?

201
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.630
or rather, as Horace says inhis--What, my soul, verses?

202
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.900
Ay, sir, and very learned.

203
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:03.400
Let me hear a staff, a stanze,a verse; lege, domine.

204
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.830
If knowledge be the mark,to know thee shall suffice;

205
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.270
Well learned is that tonguethat well can thee commend,

206
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:19.170
All ignorant that soul thatsees thee without wonder;

207
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.830
Which is to me some praisethat I thy parts admire:

208
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:28.330
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears,thy voice his dreadful thunder,

209
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.300
Which not to anger bent,is music and sweet fire.

210
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.400
Celestial as thou art, O,pardon, love, this wrong,

211
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:39.970
That sings heaven's praisewith such an earthly tongue.

212
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.170
You do not find the apostraphas,and so miss the accent:

213
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.400
let me supervise the canzonet.

214
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.930
Here are only numbers ratified;but, for the elegancy,

215
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.430
facility, and goldencadence of poesy, caret.

216
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:06.300
Ovidius Naso was the man:and why, indeed, Naso,

217
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.400
Don't know.

218
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.700
For smelling out theodouriferous flowers of fancy,

219
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.830
the jerks of invention?Imitari is nothing:

220
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.100
so doth the hound hismaster, the ape his keeper,

221
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.270
the tired horse his rider.But, damosella virgin,

222
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.270
was this directed to you?

223
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.600
Ay, sir.

224
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.630
I will overglancethe superscript:

225
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:33.800
'To the snow-white hand of themost beauteous Lady Rosaline.'

226
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.730
I will look again on theintellect of the letter,

227
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.130
for the nomination ofthe party writing

228
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.470
to the person written unto:

229
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:43.030
'Your ladyship's in alldesired employment, .'

230
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.930
Biron.

231
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.870
Ohhh

232
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:51.500
Sir Nathaniel, this Biron is oneof the votaries with the king;

233
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.170
and here he hathframed a letter

234
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.370
to a sequent of thestranger queen's,

235
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.600
which accidentally, or bythe way of progression,

236
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.330
hath miscarried. Tripand go, my sweet;

237
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.100
deliver this paper into theroyal hand of the king:

238
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.730
it may concern much. Staynot thy compliment;

239
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.500
I forgive thy duty; adieu.

240
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.130
Sir, you have done this in thefear of God, very religiously;

241
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.630
and, as a certainfather saith,--

242
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:15.470
Sir tell me not of thefather;

243
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.500
But to return to theverses:

244
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.800
Sir Nathaniel. Did they pleaseyou?

245
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.930
Marvellous well for thepen.

246
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.130
I do dine to-day at the father'sof a certain pupil of mine;

247
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.830
where, if, beforerepast, it shall please

248
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.630
you to gratify thetable with a grace,

249
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.900
I will undertake,

250
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.670
on my privilege I have with theparents of the foresaid child

251
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.270
or pupil, your ben venuto;

252
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.630
where I will show thoseverses to be very unlearned,

253
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:47.400
savouring neither of poetry,wit, nor invention:

254
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.370
I beseech your society.

255
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:57.200
And thank you too; forsociety, saith the text,

256
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.970
is the happiness of life.

257
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.270


258
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.930
I will not love:

259
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:21.470
if I do, hang me; i' faith,I will not. O, but her eye,

260
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:25.200
--by this light, but for hereye, I would not love her;

261
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.670
yes, for her two eyes.Well, I do nothing

262
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.300
in the world but lie,and lie in my throat.

263
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.330
By heaven, I do love: andit hath taught me to rhyme

264
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.430
and to be melancholy; andhere is part of my rhyme,

265
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.200
and here my melancholy.Here comes one with a paper:

266
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.030
Ay me!

267
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.670
Shot, by heaven!

268
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.030
So sweet a kiss the golden sun

269
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.970
gives not to those freshmorning drops upon the rose,

270
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.800
As thy eye-beams, whentheir fresh rays have smote

271
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:11.430
The night of dew that onmy cheeks down flows:

272
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.900
Nor shines the silver moonone half so bright

273
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.800
Through the transparentbosom of the deep,

274
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.100
As doth thy face throughtears of mine give light;

275
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.330
What, Longaville! andreading! listen, ear.

276
00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.230
Now, in thy likeness, onemore fool appear!

277
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.770
Ay me, I am forsworn!

278
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.670
In love, I hope: sweetfellowship in shame!

279
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:40.300
O sweet Maria, empress ofmy love!

280
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.000
Did not the heavenlyrhetoric of thine eye,

281
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.170
'Gainst whom the worldcannot hold argument,

282
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.230
Persuade my heart to thisfalse perjury?

283
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:04.200
Vows for thee brokedeserve not punishment.

284
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.370
A woman I forswore; but Iwill prove,

285
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:17.730
Thou being a goddess, Iforswore not thee:

286
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.030
My vow was earthly, thou aheavenly love;

287
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.430
Thy grace being gain'dcures all disgrace in me.

288
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.670
Vows are but breath, andbreath a vapour is:

289
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.800
Then thou, fair sun, whichon my earth dost shine,

290
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.330
Exhalest this vapour-vow;in thee it is:

291
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:42.470
If broken then, it is nofault of mine:

292
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.430
If by me broke, what foolis not so wise

293
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.870
To lose an oath to win aparadise?

294
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.100
This is the liver-vein,which makes flesh a deity,

295
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:59.670
A green goose a goddess:pure, pure idolatry.

296
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:07.030
By whom shall I sendthis?--Company! stay.

297
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.430
All hid, all hid; an oldinfant play.

298
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.300
O most divine Kate!

299
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.370
O most profane coxcomb!

300
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.230
O that I had my wish!

301
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.230
And I had mine!

302
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:20.800
And I mine too, good Lord!

303
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.070
Amen, so I had mine: isnot that a good word?

304
00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.630
Like a fever shereigns in my blood

305
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.900
and will remember'd be.

306
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.170
Once more I'll read theode that I have writ.

307
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:39.400
Once more I'll mark howlove can vary wit.

308
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.330
On a day--alack the day!--

309
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.470
Love, whose month is everMay,

310
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:45.730
Spied a blossom passingfair

311
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.530
Playing in the wanton air:

312
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.200
Through the velvet leavesthe wind,

313
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.800
All unseen, can passagefind;

314
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.600
That the lover, sick todeath,

315
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.870
Wish himself the heaven'sbreath.

316
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.600
Air, quoth he, thy cheeksmay blow;

317
00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.070
Air, would I might triumphso!

318
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.670
But, alack, my hand issworn

319
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.000
Ne'er to pluck thee fromthy thorn;

320
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.500
Vow, alack, for youthunmeet,

321
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.030
Youth so apt to pluck asweet!

322
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.500
Do not call it sin in me,

323
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.570
That I am forsworn forthee;

324
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.230
Thou for whom Jove wouldswear

325
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:27.530
Juno but an Ethiope were;

326
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:30.670
And deny himself for Jove,

327
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.800
Turning mortal for thylove.

328
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:41.430
This will I send, andsomething else more plain,

329
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.700
That shall express my truelove's fasting pain.

330
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.500
O, would the king, Biron,and Longaville,

331
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.930
Were lovers too! Ill, toexample ill,

332
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.670
Would from my foreheadwipe a perjured note;

333
00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.230
For none offend where allalike do dote.

334
00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:03.700
Dumain, thy love isfar from charity

335
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.370
that in love's griefdesires a society.

336
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.630
You may look pale, but Ishould blush, I know,

337
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.470
To be o'erheard andtaken napping so.

338
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:20.570
You blush; ashis your case is such;

339
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:24.200
You chide at him,offending twice as much;

340
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.800
You do not love Maria;Longaville

341
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.730
Did never sonnet for hersake compile,

342
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.630
Nor never lay his wreathedarms athwart

343
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.430
His loving bosom to keepdown his heart.

344
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.770
I have been closelyshrouded in this book

345
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.400
And mark'd you both andfor you both did look:

346
00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:48.800
I heard your guilty rhymes,noted well your fashion,

347
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.170
Saw sighs reek from you,observed your passion:

348
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.670
Ay me! says one; O Jove!the other cries;

349
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:02.500
One, her hairs were gold,crystal the other's eyes:

350
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.830
You would for paradisebreak faith, and troth;

351
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.700
And Jove, for your love,would infringe an oath.

352
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:12.100
What will Biron say whenthat he shall hear

353
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.500
Faith so infringed, whichsuch zeal did swear?

354
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.200
How will he scorn! howwill he spend his wit!

355
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.930
How will he triumph, leapand laugh at it!

356
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.030
For all the wealth thatever I did see,

357
00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.770
I would not have him knowso much by me.

358
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.530
Now step I forth to whiphypocrisy.

359
00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:32.100
Ah, good my liege, I praythee, pardon me!

360
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.870
Good heart, what gracehast thou, thus to reprove

361
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:40.300
These worms for loving,that art most in love?

362
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.300
Your eyes do make nocoaches; in your tears

363
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.030
There is no certainprincess that appears;

364
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.200
You'll not be perjured,'tis a hateful thing;

365
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.400
Tush, none but minstrelslike of sonneting!

366
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.200
But are you not ashamed?nay, are you not,

367
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.370
All three of you, to bethus much o'ershot?

368
00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.970
You found his mote; theking your mote did see;

369
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:05.100
But I a beam do find ineach of three.

370
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.530
O, what a scene of fooleryhave I seen,

371
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.630
Of sighs, of groans, ofsorrow and of teen!

372
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.800
O me, with what strictpatience have I sat,

373
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.230
To see a king transformedto a gnat!

374
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:19.900
To see great Herculeswhipping a gig,

375
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.700
And profound Solomon totune a jig,

376
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.230
And Nestor play atpush-pin with the boys,

377
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.100
And critic Timon laugh atidle toys!

378
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.700
Where lies thy grief, O,tell me, good Dumain?

379
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.970
And gentle Longaville,where lies thy pain?

380
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.370
And where my liege's? allabout the breast:

381
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.800
A caudle, ho!

382
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800
Too bitter is thy jest.

383
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.330
Are we betray'd thus tothy over-view?

384
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.270
Not you to me, but Ibetray'd by you:

385
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:50.030
I, that am honest; I, thathold it sin

386
00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.170
To break the vow I amengaged in;

387
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.870
I am betray'd, by keepingcompany

388
00:21:54.870 --> 00:22:01.400
With moon like men, men ofinconstancy.

389
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.900
When shall you see mewrite a thing in rhyme?

390
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.330
Or groan for Joan? orspend a minute's time

391
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.370
In pruning me? When shallyou hear that I

392
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.270
Will praise a hand, afoot, a face, an eye,

393
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.200
A gait, a state, a brow, abreast, a waist,

394
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.400
A leg, a limb?

395
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.830
Soft! whither away sofast?

396
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.570
A true man or a thief thatgallops so?

397
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.670
I post from love: goodlover, let me go.

398
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.870
God bless the king!

399
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.130
What present hast thouthere?

400
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.070
Some certain treason.

401
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.470
What makes treason here?

402
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.730
I beseech your grace, letthis letter be read:

403
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.000
Our parson misdoubts it;'twas treason, he said.

404
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:37.970
Biron, read it over.

405
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.370
Where hadst thou it?

406
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.230
Of Costard.

407
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.800
How now! what is in you?why dost thou tear it?

408
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.930
A toy, my liege, a toy: yourgrace needs not fear it.

409
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.370
It did move him to passion,and therefore let's hear it.

410
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.000
It is Biron's writing,and here is his name.

411
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.230
Ah, you whoreson loggerhead!

412
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.030
you were born to do me shame.

413
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:04.670
Guilty, my leige, guilty! Iconfess, I confess.

414
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.900
What?

415
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.700
That you three fools lack'dme fool to make up the mess:

416
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.670
He, he, and you, and you,my liege, and I,

417
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.830
Are pick-purses in love,and we deserve to die.

418
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.000
O, dismiss this audience,and I shall tell you more.

419
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.330
Now the number is even.

420
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.530
True, true; we are four.

421
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:23.570
Will these turtles begone?

422
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.230
Hence, sirs; away!

423
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:32.170
Walk aside the true folk,and let the traitors stay.

424
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:48.700
Sweet lords, sweet lovers,O, let us embrace!

425
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.600
As true we are as fleshand blood can be:

426
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.370
The sea will ebb and flow,heaven show his face;

427
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.470
Young blood can not obeyan old decree:

428
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.270
What, did these rent linesshow some love of thine?

429
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:05.670
Did they, quoth you? Whosees the heavenly Rosaline,

430
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.100
That, like a rude andsavage man of Inde,

431
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.200
At the first opening ofthe gorgeous east,

432
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.570
Bows not his vassal headand strucken blind

433
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.230
Kisses the base groundwith obedient breast?

434
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.030
What peremptoryeagle-sighted eye

435
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.600
Dares look upon the heavenof her brow,

436
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.730
That is not blinded by hermajesty?

437
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.000
What zeal, what fury hathinspired thee now?

438
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.130
My love, her mistress, isa gracious moon;

439
00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.430
She an attending star,scarce seen a light.

440
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.100
My eyes are then no eyes,nor I Biron:

441
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.130
O, but for my love, daywould turn to night!

442
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.600
O, 'tis the sun thatmaketh all things shine.

443
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.370
By heaven, thy love isblack as ebony.

444
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.930
Is ebony like her? O wooddivine!

445
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.270
A wife of such wood werefelicity.

446
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.430
O, who can give an oath?where is a book?

447
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.100
That I may swear beautydoth beauty lack,

448
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.570
If that she learn not ofher eye to look:

449
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.600
No face is fair that isnot full so black.

450
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.930
O paradox! Black is thebadge of hell,

451
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:56.970
The hue of dungeons andthe school of night;

452
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.500
And beauty's crest becomesthe heavens well.

453
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.570
To look like her arechimney-sweepers black.

454
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.500
And since her time arecolliers counted bright.

455
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.200
And Ethiopes of theirsweet complexion crack.

456
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.730
Dark needs no candles now,for dark is light.

457
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.800
Your mistresses dare nevercome in rain,

458
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.030
For fear their coloursshould be wash'd away.

459
00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.070
'Twere good, yours did; for,sir, to tell you plain,

460
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.870
I'll find a fairer facenot wash'd to-day.

461
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.200
I'll prove her fair, ortalk till doomsday here.

462
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.830
No devil will fright theethen so much as she.

463
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.030
I never knew man hold vilestuff so dear.

464
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:31.470
Look, here's thy love: myfoot and her face see.

465
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.870
O, if the streets werepaved with thine eyes,

466
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.100
Her feet were much toodainty for such tread!

467
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.970
O, vile! then, as shegoes, what upward lies

468
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.070
The street should see asshe walk'd overhead.

469
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:49.630
But what of this? are wenot all in love?

470
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:54.830
Nothing so sure; andtherefore all forsworn.

471
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.700
Then leave this chat; and,good Biron, now prove

472
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.570
Our loving lawful, and ourfaith not torn.

473
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.400
Ay, marry, there; someflattery for this evil.

474
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.630
O, some authority how toproceed;

475
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.630
Some tricks, some quillets,how to cheat the devil.

476
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.470
Some salve for perjury.

477
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.170
'Tis more than need.

478
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.870
Have at you, then,affection's men at arms.

479
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.530
Consider what you firstdid swear unto,

480
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.100
To fast, to study, and tosee no woman;

481
00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.530
Flat treason 'gainst thekingly state of youth.

482
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:37.130
Say, can you fast? yourstomachs are too young;

483
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.170
And abstinence engendersmaladies.

484
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.630
O, we have made a vow to study,lords,

485
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.730
And in that vow we haveforsworn our books.

486
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.100
For when would you, myliege, or you, or you,

487
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.370
In leaden contemplationhave found out

488
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.630
Such fiery numbers as theprompting eyes

489
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.000
Of beauty's tutors haveenrich'd you with?

490
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.170
Other slow arts entirelykeep the brain;

491
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.570
And therefore, findingbarren practisers,

492
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.530
Scarce show a harvest oftheir heavy toil:

493
00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:06.230
But love, first learned ina lady's eyes,

494
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.970
Lives not alone immured inthe brain;

495
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:12.800
But, with the motion ofall elements,

496
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.430
Courses as swift asthought in every power,

497
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.570
And gives to every power adouble power,

498
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.300
Above their functions andhis offices.

499
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.330
It adds a precious seeingto the eye;

500
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.200
A lover's eyes will gazean eagle blind;

501
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.900
A lover's ear will hearthe lowest sound,

502
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.970
When the suspicious headof theft is stopp'd:

503
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.230
Love's feeling is moresoft and sensible

504
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:38.570
Than are the tender hornsof cockl'd snails;

505
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:43.400
Love's tongue proves daintyBacchus gross in taste:

506
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:46.130
For valour, is not Love aHercules,

507
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.470
Still climbing trees inthe Hesperides?

508
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.000
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweetand musical

509
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.700
As bright Apollo's lute,strung with his hair:

510
00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.200
And when Love speaks, thevoice of all the gods

511
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.030
Makes heaven drowsy withthe harmony.

512
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.730
Never durst poet touch apen to write

513
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.430
Until his ink were temper'dwith Love's sighs;

514
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.470
O, then his lines wouldravish savage ears

515
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.130
And plant in tyrants mildhumility.

516
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.730
From women's eyes thisdoctrine I derive:

517
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.830
They sparkle still theright Promethean fire;

518
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.330
They are the books, thearts, the academes,

519
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:31.030
That show, contain andnourish all the world:

520
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:36.670
Else none at all in oughtproves excellent.

521
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.530
Then fools you were thesewomen to forswear,

522
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:43.030
Or keeping what is sworn,you will prove fools.

523
00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.070
For wisdom's sake, a wordthat all men love,

524
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.730
Or for love's sake, a wordthat loves all men,

525
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:50.830
Or for men's sake, theauthors of these women,

526
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.730
Or women's sake, by whomwe men are men,

527
00:28:54.730 --> 00:29:02.200
Let us once lose our oathsto find ourselves,

528
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.370
Or else we lose ourselvesto keep our oaths.

529
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:10.430
It is religion to be thusforsworn,

530
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.030
For charity itselffulfills the law,

531
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.900
And who can sever lovefrom charity?

532
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.100
Saint Cupid, then! and,soldiers, to the field!

533
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.670
Advance your standards,and upon them, lords;

534
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.530
Pell-mell, down with them!but be first advised,

535
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:31.930
In conflict that you getthe sun of them.

536
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.070
Now to plain-dealing; laythese glozes by:

537
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.530
Shall we resolve to woothese girls of France?

538
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.200
And win them too:therefore let us devise

539
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.430
Some entertainment forthem in their tents.

540
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.330
First, from the park letus conduct them thither;

541
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.900
Then homeward every manattach the hand

542
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.930
Of his fair mistress: inthe afternoon

543
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.800
We will with some strangepastime solace them,

544
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.130
Such as the shortness ofthe time can shape;

545
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.030
For revels, dances, masksand merry hours

546
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:04.330
Forerun fair Love, strewingher way with flowers.

547
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.330
