00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830


2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.570
Lord bishop, set the crownupon his head.

3
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.970
God save King Henry, ofthat name the sixth!

4
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.800
Crowd: God save King Henry, ofthat name the sixth!

5
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.030
Now, governor of Paris,take your oath,

6
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.970
That you elect no otherking but him;

7
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.570
Esteem none friends butsuch as are his friends,

8
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.900
And none your foes butsuch as shall pretend

9
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.470
Malicious practisesagainst his state:

10
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.600
This shall ye do, so helpyou righteous God!

11
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.270
This shall I do, so helpme righteous God!

12
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.530
My gracious sovereign, asI rode from Calais,

13
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.730
To haste unto yourcoronation,

14
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.970
A letter was deliver'd tomy hands,

15
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.000
Writ to your grace fromthe Duke of Burgundy.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.470
Shame to the Duke ofBurgundy and thee!

17
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.070
I vow'd, base knight, whenI did meet thee next,

18
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.300
To tear the garter fromthy craven's leg,

19
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.900
Which I have done, becauseunworthily

20
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.770
Thou wast installed inthat high degree.

21
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.700
Pardon me, princely Henry,and the rest

22
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.870
This dastard, at thebattle of Patay,

23
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.430
When but in all I was sixthousand strong

24
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.270
And that the French werealmost ten to one,

25
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.370
Before we met or that astroke was given,

26
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.430
Like to a trusty squiredid run away:

27
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.430
In which assault we losttwelve hundred men;

28
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670
Myself and diversgentlemen beside

29
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.370
Were there surprised andtaken prisoners.

30
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.570
Then judge, great lords,if I have done amiss;

31
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.900
Or whether that suchcowards ought to wear

32
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900
This ornament ofknighthood, yea or no.

33
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.730
To say the truth, thisfact was infamous

34
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.230
And ill beseeming anycommon man,

35
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.700
Much more a knight, acaptain and a leader.

36
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.770
When first this order wasordain'd, my lords,

37
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.530
Knights of the garter wereof noble birth,

38
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.470
Valiant and virtuous, fullof haughty courage,

39
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.930
Such as were grown tocredit by the wars;

40
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.270
Not fearing death, norshrinking for distress,

41
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.700
But always resolute inmost extremes.

42
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.730
He then that is notfurnish'd in this sort

43
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.470
Doth but usurp the sacredname of knight,

44
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.070
Profaning this mosthonourable order,

45
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.070
And should, if I wereworthy to be judge,

46
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.830
Be quite degraded, like ahedge-born swain

47
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.470
That doth presume to boastof gentle blood.

48
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.470
Stain to thy countrymen,thou hear'st thy doom!

49
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.370
Be packing, therefore,thou that wast a knight:

50
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.670
Henceforth we banish thee,on pain of death.

51
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.970
And now, my lordprotector, view the letter

52
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.170
Sent from our uncle Dukeof Burgundy.

53
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.430
What means his grace, thathe hath changed his style?

54
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.830
No more but, plain andbluntly, 'To the king!'

55
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.330
Hath he forgot he is hissovereign?

56
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.000
Or doth this churlishsuperscription

57
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.230
Pretend some alteration ingood will?

58
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.370
What's here?

59
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.000
'I have, upon especialcause,

60
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.470
Moved with compassion ofmy country's wreck,

61
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.170
Together with the pitifulcomplaints

62
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.330
Of such as your oppressionfeeds upon,

63
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.470
Forsaken your perniciousfaction

64
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.300
And join'd with Charles, therightful King of France.'

65
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.600
O monstrous treachery! canthis be so,

66
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.530
That in alliance, amityand oaths,

67
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.730
There should be found suchfalse dissembling guile?

68
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.300
What! doth my uncleBurgundy revolt?

69
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.370
He doth, my lord, and isbecome your foe.

70
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.300
Is that the worst thisletter doth contain?

71
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.600
It is the worst, and all,my lord, he writes.

72
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.400
Why, then, Lord Talbotthere shall talk with him

73
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.670
And give him chastisementfor this abuse.

74
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.900
How say you, my lord? areyou not content?

75
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.330
Content, my liege! yes,but that I am prevented,

76
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
I should have begg'd Imight have been employ'd.

77
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.070
Then gather strength andmarch unto him straight:

78
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.330
Let him perceive how illwe brook his treason

79
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.400
And what offence it is toflout his friends.

80
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.230
I go, my lord, in heartdesiring still

81
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.300
You may behold confusionin your foes.

82
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.100
Grant me the combat,gracious sovereign.

83
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.200
And me, my lord, grant methe combat too.

84
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.400
This is my servant: hearhim, noble prince.

85
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.270
And this is mine: sweetHenry, favour him.

86
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.930
Be patient, lords; andgive them leave to speak.

87
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.400
Say, gentlemen, what makesyou thus exclaim?

88
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.700
And wherefore crave youcombat? or with whom?

89
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.530
With him, my lord; for hehath done me wrong.

90
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.000
And I with him; for hehath done me wrong.

91
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.900
What is that wrong whereofyou both complain?

92
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.870
First let me know, andthen I'll answer you.

93
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.270
Crossing the sea fromEngland into France,

94
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.530
This fellow here, withenvious carping tongue,

95
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.100
Upbraided me about therose I wear;

96
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.930
Saying, the sanguinecolour of the leaves

97
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.800
Did represent my master'sblushing cheeks,

98
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.900
When stubbornly he didrepugn the truth

99
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.400
About a certain questionin the law

100
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.070
Argued betwixt the Duke ofYork and him;

101
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.730
In confutation of whichrude reproach

102
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.500
And in defence of mylord's worthiness,

103
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
I crave the benefit of lawof arms.

104
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.130
And that is my petition,noble lord:

105
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.270
For though he seem withforged quaint conceit

106
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.630
To set a gloss upon hisbold intent,

107
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.330
Yet know, my lord, I wasprovoked by him;

108
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.900
And he first tookexceptions at this badge,

109
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.530
Pronouncing that thepaleness of this flower

110
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.730
Bewray'd the faintness ofmy master's heart.

111
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.330
Will not this malice,Somerset, be left?

112
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.000
Your private grudge, myLord of York, will out,

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.130
Though ne'er so cunninglyyou smother it.

114
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.000
Good Lord, what madnessrules in brainsick men,

115
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.500
When for so slight andfrivolous a cause

116
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.330
Such factious emulationsshall arise!

117
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.670
Good cousins both, of Yorkand Somerset,

118
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.630
Quiet yourselves, I pray,and be at peace.

119
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.100
Let this dissension firstbe tried by fight,

120
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.430
And then your highnessshall command a peace.

121
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.030
The quarrel toucheth nonebut us alone;

122
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.600
Betwixt ourselves let usdecide it then.

123
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.700
There is my pledge; acceptit, Somerset.

124
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.870
Nay, let it rest where itbegan at first.

125
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.000
Confirm it so, minehonourable lord.

126
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.470
Confirm it so! Confoundedbe your strife!

127
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.330
And perish ye, with youraudacious prate!

128
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.500
Presumptuous vassals, areyou not ashamed

129
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.030
With this immodestclamorous outrage

130
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.230
To trouble and disturb theking and us?

131
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.100
And you, my lords,methinks you do not well

132
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.130
To bear with theirperverse objections;

133
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.600
Much less to take occasionfrom their mouths

134
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.600
To raise a mutiny betwixtyourselves:

135
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.230
Let me persuade you take abetter course.

136
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.270
It grieves his highness:good my lords, be friends.

137
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.770
Come hither, you thatwould be combatants:

138
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.370
Henceforth I charge you,as you love our favour,

139
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:59.900
Quite to forget thisquarrel and the cause.

140
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:10.930
And you, my lords,remember where we are,

141
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.530
In France, amongst afickle wavering nation:

142
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.270
If they perceivedissension in our looks

143
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.130
And that within ourselveswe disagree,

144
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.400
How will their grudgingstomachs be provoked

145
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.830
To wilful disobedience,and rebel!

146
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.600
Beside, what infamy willthere arise,

147
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.430
When foreign princes shallbe certified

148
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.900
That for a toy, a thing ofno regard,

149
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.430
King Henry's peers andchief nobility

150
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.030
Destroy'd themselves, andlost the realm of France!

151
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.900
O, think upon the conquestof my father,

152
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.500
My tender years, and letus not forego

153
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.900
That for a trifle that wasbought with blood

154
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:58.070
Let me be umpire in thisdoubtful strife.

155
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:06.570
I see no reason, if I wearthis rose,

156
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.830
That any one shouldtherefore be suspicious

157
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.400
I more incline to Somersetthan York:

158
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.170
Both are my kinsmen, and Ilove them both:

159
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.400
As well they may upbraidme with my crown,

160
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.130
Because, forsooth, theking of Scots is crown'd.

161
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.700
But your discretionsbetter can persuade

162
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.870
Than I am able to instructor teach:

163
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.900
And therefore, as wehither came in peace,

164
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.330
So let us still continuepeace and love.

165
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.500
Cousin of York, weinstitute your grace

166
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.770
To be our regent in theseparts of France:

167
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.500
And, good my Lord ofSomerset, unite

168
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.830
Your troops of horsemenwith his bands of foot;

169
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.200
And, like true subjects,sons of your progenitors,

170
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.270
Go cheerfully together anddigest

171
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.730
Your angry choler on yourenemies.

172
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.770
Ourself, my lord protectorand the rest

173
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.530
After some respite willreturn to Calais;

174
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.370
From thence to England;where I hope ere long

175
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.900
To be presented, by yourvictories,

176
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.330
With Charles, Alencon andthat traitorous rout.

177
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.770
My Lord of York, I promiseyou, the king

178
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.500
Prettily, methought, didplay the orator.

179
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.100
And so he did; but yet Ilike it not,

180
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.100
In that he wears the badgeof Somerset.

181
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.400
Tush, that was but hisfancy, blame him not;

182
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.130
I dare presume, sweetprince, he thought no harm.

183
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:08.000
An if I wist he did,--butlet it rest;

184
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.300
Other affairs must now bemanaged.

185
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.430
Well didst thou, Richard,to suppress thy voice;

186
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.430
For, had the passions ofthy heart burst out,

187
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.430
I fear we should have seendecipher'd there

188
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.270
More rancorous spite, morefurious raging broils,

189
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.030
Than yet can be imaginedor supposed.

190
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.630
But howsoe'er, no simpleman that sees

191
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.070
This jarring discord ofnobility,

192
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.470
This shouldering of eachother in the court,

193
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.930
This factious bandying oftheir favourites,

194
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:52.070
But sees it doth presagesome ill event.

195
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.030
'Tis much when sceptresare in children's hands;

196
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.330
But more when envy breedsunkind division;

197
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.770
There comes the ruin,there begins confusion.

198
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.130
Go to the gates ofBourdeaux, trumpeter:

199
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.370
Summon their general untothe wall.

200
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:41.300
Trumpet sounds. EnterGeneral and others, aloft

201
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.530
English John Talbot,captains, calls you forth,

202
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.130
Servant in arms to HarryKing of England;

203
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.700
And thus he would: Openyour city gates;

204
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.500
Be humble to us; call mysovereign yours,

205
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.330
And do him homage asobedient subjects;

206
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.830
And I'll withdraw me andmy bloody power:

207
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.630
But, if you frown uponthis proffer'd peace,

208
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.400
You tempt the fury of mythree attendants,

209
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.630
Lean famine, quarteringsteel, and climbing fire;

210
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.770
Who in a moment even withthe earth

211
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.970
Shall lay your stately andair-braving towers,

212
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.330
If you forsake the offerof their love.

213
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Thou ominous and fearfulowl of death,

214
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.030
Our nation's terror andtheir bloody scourge!

215
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.570
The period of thy tyrannyapproacheth.

216
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.130
On us thou canst not enterbut by death;

217
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.530
For, I protest, we arewell fortified

218
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.330
And strong enough to issueout and fight:

219
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.270
If thou retire, theDauphin, well appointed,

220
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.700
Stands with the snares ofwar to tangle thee:

221
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.200
On either hand thee thereare squadrons pitch'd,

222
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.770
To wall thee from theliberty of flight;

223
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.500
And no way canst thou turnthee for redress,

224
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.630
But death doth front theewith apparent spoil

225
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.130
And pale destruction meetsthee in the face.

226
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.500
Ten thousand French haveta'en the sacrament

227
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.600
To rive their dangerousartillery

228
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.300
Upon no Christian soul butEnglish Talbot.

229
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.900
Lo, there thou stand'st, abreathing valiant man,

230
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.270
Of an invincibleunconquer'd spirit!

231
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.430
This is the latest gloryof thy praise

232
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.370
That I, thy enemy, duethee withal;

233
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.400
For ere the glass, thatnow begins to run,

234
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.330
Finish the process of hissandy hour,

235
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.330
These eyes, that see theenow well coloured,

236
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:48.430
Shall see thee wither'd,bloody, pale and dead.

237
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.130
Hark! hark! the Dauphin'sdrum, a warning bell,

238
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.770
Sings heavy music to thytimorous soul;

239
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.370
And mine shall ring thydire departure out.

240
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:16.670
He fables not; I hear theenemy:

241
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.500
Out, some light horsemen,and peruse their wings.

242
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:32.070
O, negligent and heedlessdiscipline!

243
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:40.870
How are we park'd andbounded in a pale,

244
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.370
A little herd of England'stimorous deer,

245
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:51.430
Mazed with akennel of French curs!

246
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:57.770
If we be English deer, bethen in blood;

247
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.530
Not rascal-like, to falldown with a pinch,

248
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.930
But rather, moody-mad anddesperate stags,

249
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.500
Turn on the bloody houndswith heads of steel

250
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.600
And make the cowards standaloof at bay:

251
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.300
Sell every man his life asdear as mine,

252
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.800
And they shall find deardeer of us, my friends.

253
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.430
God and Saint George,England and England's right,

254
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.870
Prosper our colours inthis dangerous fight!

255
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.000
Are not the speedy scoutsreturn'd again,

256
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.030
That dogg'd the mightyarmy of the Dauphin?

257
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.130
They are return'd, mylord, and give it out

258
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.330
That he is march'd toBourdeaux with his power,

259
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.470
To fight with Talbot: ashe march'd along,

260
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.170
By your espials werediscovered

261
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.900
Two mightier troops thanthat the Dauphin led,

262
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.200
Which join'd with him and madetheir march for Bourdeaux.

263
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.670
A plague upon that villainSomerset,

264
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.270
That thus delays mypromised supply

265
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.530
Of horsemen, that werelevied for this siege!

266
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.930
Renowned Talbot dothexpect my aid,

267
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.570
And I am lowted by atraitor villain

268
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.770
And cannot help the noblechevalier:

269
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.230
God comfort him in thisnecessity!

270
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.530
If he miscarry, farewellwars in France.

271
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.500
Thou princely leader ofour English strength,

272
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.330
Never so needful on theearth of France,

273
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.800
Spur to the rescue of thenoble Talbot,

274
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.630
Who now is girdled with awaist of iron

275
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.330
And hemm'd about with grimdestruction:

276
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.900
To Bourdeaux, warlikeduke! to Bourdeaux, York!

277
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.430
Else, farewell Talbot,France, and England's honour.

278
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.330
O God, that Somerset, whoin proud heart

279
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:43.570
Doth stop my cornets, werein Talbot's place!

280
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.470
So should we save avaliant gentleman

281
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.100
By forfeiting a traitorand a coward.

282
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.830
Mad ire and wrathful furymakes me weep,

283
00:18:54.830 --> 00:19:00.470
That thus we die, whileremiss traitors sleep.

284
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:07.030
O, send some succor to thedistress'd lord!

285
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:16.330
He dies, we lose; I breakmy warlike word;

286
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:25.770
We mourn, France smiles;we lose, they daily get;

287
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.870
All 'long of this viletraitor Somerset.

288
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.270
Then God take mercy onbrave Talbot's soul;

289
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.130
And on his son young John,who two hours since

290
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.600
I met in travel toward hiswarlike father!

291
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.270
This seven years did notTalbot see his son;

292
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:52.130
And now they meet whereboth their lives are done.

293
00:19:53.670 --> 00:20:00.430
Alas, what joy shall nobleTalbot have

294
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:07.770
To bid his young sonwelcome to his grave?

295
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.500
Away! vexation almoststops my breath,

296
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:17.670
That sunder'd friends greetin the hour of death.

297
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:23.000
Lucy, farewell; no more myfortune can,

298
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.130
But curse the cause Icannot aid the man.

299
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:37.030
Maine, Blois, Poictiers,and Tours, are won away,

300
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:43.830
'Long all of Somerset andhis delay.

301
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.570
Thus, while the vulture ofsedition

302
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.330
Feeds in the bosom of suchgreat commanders,

303
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.500
Sleeping neglection dothbetray to loss

304
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.900
The conquest of our scarcecold conqueror,

305
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.630
That ever living man ofmemory,

306
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:11.700
Henry the Fifth: whilesthey each other cross,

307
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.330
Lives, honours, lands andall hurry to loss.

308
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.830
It is too late; I cannotsend them now:

309
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.970
This expedition was byYork and Talbot

310
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.400
Too rashly plotted: Your daring Talbot

311
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.130
Hath sullied all his glossof former honour

312
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.500
By this unheedful,desperate, wild adventure:

313
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.770
York set him on to fightand die in shame,

314
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.630
That, Talbot dead, greatYork might bear the name.

315
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.270
Here is Sir William Lucy,who with me

316
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.800
Set from our o'ermatch'dforces forth for aid.

317
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.670
How now, Sir William!whither were you sent?

318
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:54.130
Whither, my lord? frombought and sold Lord Talbot;

319
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.230
Who, ring'd about withbold adversity,

320
00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.800
Cries out for noble Yorkand Somerset,

321
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.400
To beat assailing deathfrom his weak legions:

322
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.170
And whiles the honourablecaptain there

323
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.730
Drops bloody sweat fromhis war-wearied limbs,

324
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.300
And, in advantage lingering,looks for rescue,

325
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.170
You, his false hopes, thetrust of England's honour,

326
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.270
Keep off aloof withworthless emulation.

327
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.900
Let not your privatediscord keep away

328
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.200
The levied succors thatshould lend him aid,

329
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.530
While he, renowned noblegentleman,

330
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.830
Yields up his life unto aworld of odds:

331
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.400
Orleans the Bastard,Charles, Burgundy,

332
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.800
Alencon, Reignier, compasshim about,

333
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.630
And Talbot perisheth byyour default.

334
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:45.730
York set him on; Yorkshould have sent him aid.

335
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.070
And York as fast upon yourgrace exclaims;

336
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.470
Swearing that you withholdhis levied horse,

337
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.500
Collected for thisexpedition.

338
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.430
York lies; he might havesent and had the horse;

339
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.170
I owe him little duty, andless love;

340
00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.530
And take foul scorn tofawn on him by sending.

341
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.830
The fraud of England, notthe force of France,

342
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.570
Hath now entrapp'd thenoble-minded Talbot:

343
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.430
Never to England shall hebear his life;

344
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:21.230
But dies, betray'd tofortune by your strife.

345
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.870
Come, go; I will dispatchthe horsemen straight:

346
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.500
Within six hours they willbe at his side.

347
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.200
Too late comes rescue: heis ta'en or slain;

348
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.700
For fly he could not, ifhe would have fled;

349
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.770
And fly would Talbotnever, though he might.

350
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:49.300
If he be dead, braveTalbot, then adieu!

351
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:56.530
His fame lives in theworld, his shame in you.

352
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:10.270
(crowd chants together) ATalbot.

353
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:24.730
Drums beating. Swordsclanging.

354
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.700
O young John Talbot! I didsend for thee

355
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.830
To tutor thee instratagems of war,

356
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.230
That Talbot's name mightbe in thee revived

357
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.070
But, O malignant andill-boding stars!

358
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.100
Now thou art come unto afeast of death,

359
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.570
A terrible and unavoideddanger:

360
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.830
Therefore, dear boy, mounton my swiftest horse;

361
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.600
And I'll direct thee howthou shalt escape

362
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.300
By sudden flight: come,dally not, be gone.

363
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.130
Is my name Talbot? and amI your son?

364
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.470
And shall I fly? O if youlove my mother,

365
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.700
Dishonour not herhonourable name,

366
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.300
To make a bastard and aslave of me!

367
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.570
The world will say, he isnot Talbot's blood,

368
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.630
That basely fled whennoble Talbot stood.

369
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.300
Fly, to revenge my death,if I be slain.

370
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.070
He that flies so willne'er return again.

371
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.330
If we both stay, we bothare sure to die.

372
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.630
Then let me stay; and,father, do you fly:

373
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.400
Your loss is great, soyour regard should be;

374
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.530
My worth unknown, no lossis known in me.

375
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.730
Upon my death the Frenchcan little boast;

376
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.030
In yours they will, in youall hopes are lost.

377
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.130
Flight cannot stain thehonour you have won;

378
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.770
But mine it will, that noexploit have done:

379
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.030
You fled for vantage,everyone will swear;

380
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.070
But, if I bow, they'll sayit was for fear.

381
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.600
There is no hope that everI will stay,

382
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.470
If the first hour I shrinkand run away.

383
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.830
Here on my knee I begmortality,

384
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.900
Rather than life preservedwith infamy.

385
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.470
Shall all thy mother'shopes lie in one tomb?

386
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.700
Ay, rather than I'll shamemy mother's womb.

387
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.400
Upon my blessing, Icommand thee go.

388
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.600
To fight I will, but notto fly the foe.

389
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.900
Part of thy father may besaved in thee.

390
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.330
No part of him but will beshame in me.

391
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.370
Thou never hadst renown,nor canst not lose it.

392
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.500
Yes, your renowned name:shall flight abuse it?

393
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.970
Thy father's charge shallclear thee from that stain.

394
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.130
You cannot witness for me,being slain.

395
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.970
If death be so apparent,then both fly.

396
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.400
And leave my followershere to fight and die?

397
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.670
My age was never taintedwith such shame.

398
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:03.100
And shall my youth beguilty of such blame?

399
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.870
No more can I be sever'dfrom your side,

400
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.900
Than can yourself yourselfin twain divide:

401
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.400
Stay, go, do what youwill, the like do I;

402
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.330
For live I will not, if myfather die.

403
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:30.570
Then here I take my leaveof thee, fair son,

404
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:37.570
Born to eclipse thy lifethis afternoon.

405
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:44.570
Come, side by sidetogether live and die.

406
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.730
And soul with soul fromFrance to heaven fly.

407
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.000
(Drums beating, bugle blaring)

408
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.600
Saint George and victory!fight, soldiers, fight.

409
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.230
The regent hath withTalbot broke his word

410
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.970
And left us to the rage ofFrance his sword.

411
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:19.470
(swords clanging)

412
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.570
(screaming)

413
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:31.900
Where is John Talbot? (repeated)

414
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:41.800
Speak, thy father's care,

415
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.100
Art thou not weary, John?how dost thou fare?

416
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.030
Wilt thou yet leave thebattle, boy, and fly,

417
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.330
Now thou art seal'd theson of chivalry?

418
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.000
Fly, to revenge my deathwhen I am dead:

419
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.970
The help of one stands mein little stead.

420
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.970
O, too much folly is it,well I wot,

421
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.630
To hazard all our lives inone small boat!

422
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.370
If I to-day die not withFrenchmen's rage,

423
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.400
To-morrow I shall die withmickle age:

424
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.700
By me they nothing gain anif I stay;

425
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.730
'Tis but the shortening ofmy life one day:

426
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.270
In thee thy mother dies,our household's name,

427
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:26.270
My death's revenge, thyyouth, and England's fame:

428
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.030
All these and more wehazard by thy stay;

429
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.170
All these are saved ifthou wilt fly away.

430
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.930
The sword of Orleans hathnot made me smart;

431
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:43.630
These words of yours drawlife-blood from my heart:

432
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.700
On that advantage, boughtwith such a shame,

433
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.270
To save a paltry life andslay bright fame,

434
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.930
Before young Talbot fromold Talbot fly,

435
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:59.530
The coward horse thatbears me fall and die!

436
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.170
And like me to the peasantboys of France,

437
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:10.130
To be shame's scorn andsubject of mischance!

438
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:17.300
Surely, by all the gloryyou have won,

439
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.400
An if I fly, I am notTalbot's son:

440
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.630
Then talk no more offlight, it is no boot;

441
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:35.170
If son to Talbot, die atTalbot's foot.

442
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:40.370
Then follow thou thydesperate sire of Crete,

443
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:48.900
Thou Icarus; thy life tome is sweet:

444
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:57.470
If thou wilt fight, fightby thy father's side;

445
00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:04.800
And, commendable proved,let's die in pride.

446
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:16.330
(Sounds of the fight.Bugle blaring)

447
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.230
Where is my other life?mine own is gone;

448
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:19.330
O, where's young Talbot?where is valiant John?

449
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:25.370
Triumphant death, smear'dwith captivity,

450
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:32.230
Young Talbot's valourmakes me smile at thee:

451
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.270
When he perceived meshrink and on my knee,

452
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.400
His bloody sword hebrandish'd over me,

453
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.530
And, like a hungry lion,did commence

454
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:48.270
Rough deeds of rage andstern impatience;

455
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.130
But when my angry guardantstood alone,

456
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.500
Tendering my ruin andassail'd of none,

457
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.200
Dizzy-eyed fury and greatrage of heart

458
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.230
Suddenly made him from myside to start

459
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.530
Into the clustering battleof the French;

460
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:17.430
And in that sea of bloodmy boy did drench

461
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:26.000
His over-mounting spirit,and there died,

462
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:38.400
My Icarus, my blossom, inhis pride.

463
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.370
O, my dear lord, lo, whereyour son is borne!

464
00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:02.700
Thou antic death, whichlaugh'st us here to scorn,

465
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.830
Anon, from thy insultingtyranny,

466
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.100
Coupled in bonds ofperpetuity,

467
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.970
Two Talbots, wingedthrough the lither sky,

468
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:25.430
In thy despite shall'scape mortality.

469
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:34.770
O, thou, whose woundsbecome hard-favour'd death,

470
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:42.030
Speak to thy father erethou yield thy breath!

471
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:48.530
Brave death by speaking,whether he will or no;

472
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:55.170
Imagine him a Frenchmanand thy foe.

473
00:35:55.170 --> 00:36:01.600
Poor boy! he smiles,methinks, as who should say,

474
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:09.100
Had death been French, thendeath had died to-day.

475
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:21.900
Come, come and lay him inhis father's arms:

476
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.900
My spirit can no longerbear these harms.

477
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:41.900
Soldiers, adieu! I havewhat I would have,

478
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:50.030
Now my old arms are youngJohn Talbot's grave.

479
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.000
Had York and Somersetbrought rescue in,

480
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.730
We should have found abloody day of this.

481
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.530
How the young whelp ofTalbot's, raging-wood,

482
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.330
Did flesh his puny swordin Frenchmen's blood!

483
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:10.830
Doubtless he would havemade a noble knight;

484
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.500
See, where he liesinhearsed in the arms

485
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.570
Of the most bloody nurserof his harms!

486
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:32.430
Hew them to pieces, hacktheir bones asunder

487
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.030
Whose life was England'sglory, Gallia's wonder.

488
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.000
O, no, forbear! for thatwhich we have fled

489
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.330
During the life, let usnot wrong it dead.

490
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.300
Herald, conduct me to theDauphin's tent,

491
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.500
To know who hath obtainedthe glory of the day.

492
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.930
On what submissive messageart thou sent?

493
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.930
Submission, Dauphin! 'tisa mere French word;

494
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.530
We English warriors wotnot what it means.

495
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.700
I come to know whatprisoners thou hast ta'en

496
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.400
And to survey the bodiesof the dead.

497
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:12.530
For prisoners ask'st thou?hell our prison is.

498
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.370
But tell me whom thouseek'st.

499
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.230
But where's the greatAlcides of the field,

Stinking and fly-blownlies here at our feet.

513
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.330
Is Talbot slain?

514
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.800
O, were mine eyeballs intobullets turn'd,

515
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.900
That I in rage might shootthem at your faces!

516
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.130
O, that I could but callthese dead to life!

517
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.030
It were enough to frightthe realm of France:

Were but his picture leftamongst you here,

519
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.900
It would amaze theproudest of you all.

Give me their bodies, thatI may bear them hence

521
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.770
And give them burial asbeseems their worth.

522
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.130
For God's sake let him have'em; to keep them here,

523
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.000
They would but stink, andputrefy the air.

524
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.030
Go, take their bodieshence.

525
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:55.570
I'll bear them hence; but fromtheir ashes shall be rear'd

526
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.930
A phoenix that shall makeall France afeard.

527
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:05.370
So we be rid, dowith 'em what thou wilt.

528
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.030
A success unto ourvalley general

529
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.530
and happiness tohis accomplices.

530
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.700
What tidings send us scouts? Iprithy, speak.

531
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.630
The English army, that dividedwas it to two parties

532
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.200

533
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.400
and means to give youbattle presently.

534
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.000
Somewhat to sudden says thewarning is

535
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.600
but we will presently providefor them

536
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.530
I trust the ghost of Talbot isnot there.

537
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:32.370
Haha. Now he is gone my lord.You need not fear.

538
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:39.030
Of all based passions, fear ismost accursed.

539
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.530
Command the conquest Charles.It shall by thine.

540
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.130
Let Henry fret and allthe world repine.

541

And on my lords. AndFrance be fortunate.

542
00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:01.200
Amen.
