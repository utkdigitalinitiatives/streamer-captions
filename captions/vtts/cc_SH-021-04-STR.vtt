00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830


2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.570
Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.

3
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.970
God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!

4
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.800
Crowd: God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!

5
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.030
Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,

6
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.970
That you elect no other king but him;

7
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.570
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,

8
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.900
And none your foes but such as shall pretend

9
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.470
Malicious practises against his state:

10
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.600
This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!

11
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.270
This shall I do, so help me righteous God!

12
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.530
My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,

13
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.730
To haste unto your coronation,

14
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.970
A letter was deliver'd to my hands,

15
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.000
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.

16
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.470
Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!

17
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.070
I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,

18
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.300
To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,

19
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.900
Which I have done, because unworthily

20
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.770
Thou wast installed in that high degree.

21
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.700
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest

22
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.870
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,

23
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.430
When but in all I was six thousand strong

24
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.270
And that the French were almost ten to one,

25
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.370
Before we met or that a stroke was given,

26
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.430
Like to a trusty squire did run away:

27
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.430
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;

28
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.670
Myself and divers gentlemen beside

29
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.370
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.

30
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.570
Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;

31
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.900
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear

32
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900
This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.

33
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.730
To say the truth, this fact was infamous

34
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.230
And ill beseeming any common man,

35
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.700
Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.

36
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.770
When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,

37
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.530
Knights of the garter were of noble birth,

38
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.470
Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,

39
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.930
Such as were grown to credit by the wars;

40
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.270
Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,

41
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.700
But always resolute in most extremes.

42
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.730
He then that is not furnish'd in this sort

43
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.470
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,

44
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.070
Profaning this most honourable order,

45
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.070
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,

46
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.830
Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain

47
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.470
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.

48
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.470
Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!

49
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.370
Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:

50
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.670
Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.

51
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.970
And now, my lord protector, view the letter

52
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.170
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.

53
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.430
What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?

54
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.830
No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'

55
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.330
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?

56
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.000
Or doth this churlish superscription

57
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.230
Pretend some alteration in good will?

58
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:51.370
What's here?

59
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.000
'I have, upon especial cause,

60
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.470
Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,

61
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.170
Together with the pitiful complaints

62
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.330
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,

63
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.470
Forsaken your pernicious faction

64
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.300
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'

65
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.600
O monstrous treachery! can this be so,

66
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.530
That in alliance, amity and oaths,

67
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.730
There should be found such false dissembling guile?

68
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.300
What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?

69
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.370
He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.

70
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.300
Is that the worst this letter doth contain?

71
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.600
It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.

72
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.400
Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him

73
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.670
And give him chastisement for this abuse.

74
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:42.900
How say you, my lord? are you not content?

75
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.330
Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,

76
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.

77
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.070
Then gather strength and march unto him straight:

78
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.330
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason

79
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.400
And what offence it is to flout his friends.

80
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.230
I go, my lord, in heart desiring still

81
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.300
You may behold confusion in your foes.

82
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.100
Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.

83
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.200
And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.

84
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.400
This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.

85
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.270
And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.

86
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.930
Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.

87
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.400
Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?

88
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.700
And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?

89
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.530
With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.

90
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.000
And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.

91
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.900
What is that wrong whereof you both complain?

92
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.870
First let me know, and then I'll answer you.

93
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.270
Crossing the sea from England into France,

94
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.530
This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,

95
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.100
Upbraided me about the rose I wear;

96
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.930
Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves

97
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.800
Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,

98
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.900
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth

99
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.400
About a certain question in the law

100
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.070
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;

101
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.730
In confutation of which rude reproach

102
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.500
And in defence of my lord's worthiness,

103
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
I crave the benefit of law of arms.

104
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.130
And that is my petition, noble lord:

105
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.270
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit

106
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.630
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,

107
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.330
Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;

108
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.900
And he first took exceptions at this badge,

109
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.530
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower

110
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.730
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.

111
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.330
Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?

112
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.000
Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,

113
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.130
Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.

114
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.000
Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,

115
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.500
When for so slight and frivolous a cause

116
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.330
Such factious emulations shall arise!

117
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.670
Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,

118
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.630
Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.

119
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.100
Let this dissension first be tried by fight,

120
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.430
And then your highness shall command a peace.

121
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.030
The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;

122
00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.600
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.

123
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.700
There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.

124
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.870
Nay, let it rest where it began at first.

125
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.000
Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.

126
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.470
Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!

127
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.330
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!

128
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.500
Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed

129
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.030
With this immodest clamorous outrage

130
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.230
To trouble and disturb the king and us?

131
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.100
And you, my lords, methinks you do not well

132
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.130
To bear with their perverse objections;

133
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.600
Much less to take occasion from their mouths

134
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.600
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:

135
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.230
Let me persuade you take a better course.

136
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:44.270
It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.

137
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.770
Come hither, you that would be combatants:

138
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.370
Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,

139
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:59.900
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.

140
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:10.930
And you, my lords, remember where we are,

141
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.530
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:

142
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.270
If they perceive dissension in our looks

143
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.130
And that within ourselves we disagree,

144
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.400
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked

145
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.830
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!

146
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.600
Beside, what infamy will there arise,

147
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.430
When foreign princes shall be certified

148
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.900
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,

149
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.430
King Henry's peers and chief nobility

150
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.030
Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!

151
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.900
O, think upon the conquest of my father,

152
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.500
My tender years, and let us not forego

153
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.900
That for a trifle that was bought with blood

154
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:58.070
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.

155
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:06.570
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,

156
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.830
That any one should therefore be suspicious

157
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.400
I more incline to Somerset than York:

158
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.170
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:

159
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.400
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,

160
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.130
Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.

161
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.700
But your discretions better can persuade

162
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.870
Than I am able to instruct or teach:

163
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.900
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,

164
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.330
So let us still continue peace and love.

165
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.500
Cousin of York, we institute your grace

166
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.770
To be our regent in these parts of France:

167
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.500
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite

168
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:51.830
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;

169
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.200
And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,

170
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.270
Go cheerfully together and digest

171
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.730
Your angry choler on your enemies.

172
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.770
Ourself, my lord protector and the rest

173
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.530
After some respite will return to Calais;

174
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.370
From thence to England; where I hope ere long

175
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.900
To be presented, by your victories,

176
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.330
With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.

177
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.770
My Lord of York, I promise you, the king

178
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.500
Prettily, methought, did play the orator.

179
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:50.100
And so he did; but yet I like it not,

180
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.100
In that he wears the badge of Somerset.

181
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.400
Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;

182
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.130
I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.

183
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:08.000
An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;

184
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.300
Other affairs must now be managed.

185
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.430
Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;

186
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.430
For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,

187
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.430
I fear we should have seen decipher'd there

188
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.270
More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,

189
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.030
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.

190
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.630
But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees

191
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.070
This jarring discord of nobility,

192
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.470
This shouldering of each other in the court,

193
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.930
This factious bandying of their favourites,

194
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:52.070
But sees it doth presage some ill event.

195
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.030
'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;

196
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.330
But more when envy breeds unkind division;

197
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.770
There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.

198
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.130
Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:

199
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.370
Summon their general unto the wall.

200
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:41.300
Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft

201
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.530
English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,

202
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.130
Servant in arms to Harry King of England;

203
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.700
And thus he would: Open your city gates;

204
00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.500
Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,

205
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.330
And do him homage as obedient subjects;

206
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.830
And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:

207
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.630
But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,

208
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.400
You tempt the fury of my three attendants,

209
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.630
Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;

210
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.770
Who in a moment even with the earth

211
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.970
Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,

212
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.330
If you forsake the offer of their love.

213
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.330
Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,

214
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.030
Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!

215
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.570
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.

216
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.130
On us thou canst not enter but by death;

217
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.530
For, I protest, we are well fortified

218
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.330
And strong enough to issue out and fight:

219
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:50.270
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,

220
00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.700
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:

221
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.200
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,

222
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.770
To wall thee from the liberty of flight;

223
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.500
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,

224
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.630
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil

225
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.130
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.

226
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.500
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament

227
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.600
To rive their dangerous artillery

228
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.300
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.

229
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.900
Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,

230
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.270
Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!

231
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.430
This is the latest glory of thy praise

232
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.370
That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;

233
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.400
For ere the glass, that now begins to run,

234
00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.330
Finish the process of his sandy hour,

235
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.330
These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,

236
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:48.430
Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.

237
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.130
Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,

238
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:58.770
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;

239
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:03.370
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.

240
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:16.670
He fables not; I hear the enemy:

241
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.500
Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.

242
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:32.070
O, negligent and heedless discipline!

243
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:40.870
How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,

244
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.370
A little herd of England's timorous deer,

245
00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:51.430
Mazed with a kennel of French curs!

246
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:57.770
If we be English deer, be then in blood;

247
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.530
Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,

248
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:03.930
But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,

249
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.500
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel

250
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.600
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:

251
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.300
Sell every man his life as dear as mine,

252
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.800
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.

253
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.430
God and Saint George, England and England's right,

254
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:29.870
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!

255
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.000
Are not the speedy scouts return'd again,

256
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.030
That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?

257
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.130
They are return'd, my lord, and give it out

258
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.330
That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,

259
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.470
To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,

260
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:46.170
By your espials were discovered

261
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.900
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,

262
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.200
Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.

263
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.670
A plague upon that villain Somerset,

264
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.270
That thus delays my promised supply

265
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.530
Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!

266
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.930
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,

267
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.570
And I am lowted by a traitor villain

268
00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.770
And cannot help the noble chevalier:

269
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.230
God comfort him in this necessity!

270
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.530
If he miscarry, farewell wars in France.

271
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.500
Thou princely leader of our English strength,

272
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.330
Never so needful on the earth of France,

273
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.800
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,

274
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.630
Who now is girdled with a waist of iron

275
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.330
And hemm'd about with grim destruction:

276
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.900
To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!

277
00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.430
Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.

278
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.330
O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart

279
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:43.570
Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!

280
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.470
So should we save a valiant gentleman

281
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.100
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.

282
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.830
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,

283
00:18:54.830 --> 00:19:00.470
That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.

284
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:07.030
O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!

285
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:16.330
He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;

286
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:25.770
We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;

287
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.870
All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.

288
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:35.270
Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;

289
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.130
And on his son young John, who two hours since

290
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.600
I met in travel toward his warlike father!

291
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.270
This seven years did not Talbot see his son;

292
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:52.130
And now they meet where both their lives are done.

293
00:19:53.670 --> 00:20:00.430
Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have

294
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:07.770
To bid his young son welcome to his grave?

295
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.500
Away! vexation almost stops my breath,

296
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:17.670
That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.

297
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:23.000
Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,

298
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.130
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.

299
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:37.030
Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,

300
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:43.830
'Long all of Somerset and his delay.

301
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.570
Thus, while the vulture of sedition

302
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.330
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,

303
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.500
Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss

304
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.900
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror,

305
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.630
That ever living man of memory,

306
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:11.700
Henry the Fifth: whiles they each other cross,

307
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.330
Lives, honours, lands and all hurry to loss.

308
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:20.830
It is too late; I cannot send them now:

309
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.970
This expedition was by York and Talbot

310
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.400
Too rashly plotted:  Your daring Talbot

311
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.130
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour

312
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.500
By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:

313
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.770
York set him on to fight and die in shame,

314
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.630
That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.

315
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.270
Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me

316
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:41.800
Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.

317
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:47.670
How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?

318
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:54.130
Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;

319
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.230
Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,

320
00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.800
Cries out for noble York and Somerset,

321
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.400
To beat assailing death from his weak legions:

322
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.170
And whiles the honourable captain there

323
00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.730
Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,

324
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.300
And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,

325
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:19.170
You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,

326
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.270
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.

327
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.900
Let not your private discord keep away

328
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.200
The levied succors that should lend him aid,

329
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.530
While he, renowned noble gentleman,

330
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.830
Yields up his life unto a world of odds:

331
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.400
Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,

332
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.800
Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,

333
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.630
And Talbot perisheth by your default.

334
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:45.730
York set him on; York should have sent him aid.

335
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.070
And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;

336
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.470
Swearing that you withhold his levied horse,

337
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:52.500
Collected for this expedition.

338
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.430
York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;

339
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.170
I owe him little duty, and less love;

340
00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.530
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.

341
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:06.830
The fraud of England, not the force of France,

342
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.570
Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:

343
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.430
Never to England shall he bear his life;

344
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:21.230
But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.

345
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.870
Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:

346
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.500
Within six hours they will be at his side.

347
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.200
Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;

348
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.700
For fly he could not, if he would have fled;

349
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.770
And fly would Talbot never, though he might.

350
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:49.300
If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!

351
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:56.530
His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.

352
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:10.270
(crowd chants together) A Talbot.

353
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:24.730
Drums beating. Swords clanging.

354
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.700
O young John Talbot! I did send for thee

355
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.830
To tutor thee in stratagems of war,

356
00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.230
That Talbot's name might be in thee revived

357
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.070
But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!

358
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.100
Now thou art come unto a feast of death,

359
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.570
A terrible and unavoided danger:

360
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.830
Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;

361
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.600
And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape

362
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.300
By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.

363
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.130
Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?

364
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.470
And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,

365
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.700
Dishonour not her honourable name,

366
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.300
To make a bastard and a slave of me!

367
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.570
The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,

368
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.630
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.

369
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.300
Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.

370
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.070
He that flies so will ne'er return again.

371
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:51.330
If we both stay, we both are sure to die.

372
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.630
Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:

373
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.400
Your loss is great, so your regard should be;

374
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.530
My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.

375
00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.730
Upon my death the French can little boast;

376
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.030
In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.

377
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.130
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;

378
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.770
But mine it will, that no exploit have done:

379
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.030
You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;

380
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:17.070
But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.

381
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.600
There is no hope that ever I will stay,

382
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.470
If the first hour I shrink and run away.

383
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:24.830
Here on my knee I beg mortality,

384
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.900
Rather than life preserved with infamy.

385
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.470
Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?

386
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.700
Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.

387
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.400
Upon my blessing, I command thee go.

388
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.600
To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.

389
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.900
Part of thy father may be saved in thee.

390
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.330
No part of him but will be shame in me.

391
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.370
Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.

392
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.500
Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?

393
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.970
Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.

394
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:51.130
You cannot witness for me, being slain.

395
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.970
If death be so apparent, then both fly.

396
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.400
And leave my followers here to fight and die?

397
00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.670
My age was never tainted with such shame.

398
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:03.100
And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?

399
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.870
No more can I be sever'd from your side,

400
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.900
Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:

401
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:14.400
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;

402
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:20.330
For live I will not, if my father die.

403
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:30.570
Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,

404
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:37.570
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.

405
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:44.570
Come, side by side together live and die.

406
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:49.730
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.

407
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.000
(Drums beating, bugle blaring)

408
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.600
Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.

409
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.230
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word

410
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:11.970
And left us to the rage of France his sword.

411
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:19.470
(swords clanging)

412
00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.570
(screaming)

413
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:31.900
Where is John Talbot?  (repeated)

414
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:41.800
Speak, thy father's care,

415
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.100
Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?

416
00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.030
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,

417
00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:52.330
Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?

418
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.000
Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:

419
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.970
The help of one stands me in little stead.

420
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.970
O, too much folly is it, well I wot,

421
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:06.630
To hazard all our lives in one small boat!

422
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.370
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,

423
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.400
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:

424
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.700
By me they nothing gain an if I stay;

425
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.730
'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:

426
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.270
In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,

427
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:26.270
My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:

428
00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.030
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;

429
00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:34.170
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.

430
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.930
The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;

431
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:43.630
These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:

432
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.700
On that advantage, bought with such a shame,

433
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:52.270
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,

434
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.930
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,

435
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:59.530
The coward horse that bears me fall and die!

436
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.170
And like me to the peasant boys of France,

437
00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:10.130
To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!

438
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:17.300
Surely, by all the glory you have won,

439
00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.400
An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:

440
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.630
Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;

441
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:35.170
If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.

442
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:40.370
Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,

443
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:48.900
Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:

444
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:57.470
If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;

445
00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:04.800
And, commendable proved, let's die in pride.

446
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:16.330
(Sounds of the fight. Bugle blaring)

447
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.230
Where is my other life? mine own is gone;

448
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:19.330
O, where's young Talbot? where is valiant John?

449
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:25.370
Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,

450
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:32.230
Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:

451
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.270
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,

452
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.400
His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,

453
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.530
And, like a hungry lion, did commence

454
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:48.270
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;

455
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.130
But when my angry guardant stood alone,

456
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:56.500
Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,

457
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.200
Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart

458
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:05.230
Suddenly made him from my side to start

459
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.530
Into the clustering battle of the French;

460
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:17.430
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench

461
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:26.000
His over-mounting spirit, and there died,

462
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:38.400
My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

463
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.370
O, my dear lord, lo, where your son is borne!

464
00:34:55.370 --> 00:35:02.700
Thou antic death, which laugh'st us here to scorn,

465
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:07.830
Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,

466
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:12.100
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,

467
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.970
Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,

468
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:25.430
In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.

469
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:34.770
O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,

470
00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:42.030
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!

471
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:48.530
Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;

472
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:55.170
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.

473
00:35:55.170 --> 00:36:01.600
Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,

474
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:09.100
Had death been French, then death had died to-day.

475
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:21.900
Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:

476
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.900
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.

477
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:41.900
Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,

478
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:50.030
Now my old arms are young John Talbot's grave.

479
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.000
Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,

480
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.730
We should have found a bloody day of this.

481
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.530
How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,

482
00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.330
Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!

483
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:10.830
Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;

484
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.500
See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms

485
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.570
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!

486
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:32.430
Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder

487
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.030
Whose life was England's glory, Gallia's wonder.

488
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.000
O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled

489
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.330
During the life, let us not wrong it dead.

490
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.300
Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent,

491
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.500
To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.

492
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.930
On what submissive message art thou sent?

493
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.930
Submission, Dauphin! 'tis a mere French word;

494
00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.530
We English warriors wot not what it means.

495
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.700
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en

496
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.400
And to survey the bodies of the dead.

497
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:12.530
For prisoners ask'st thou? hell our prison is.

498
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:15.370
But tell me whom thou seek'st.

499
00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:18.230
But where's the great Alcides of the field,

500
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.700
Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,

501
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.600
Created, for his rare success in arms,

502
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.000
Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;

503
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.600
Lord of Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,

504
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.730
Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,

505
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.200
Cromwell of Wingfield, Furnival of Sheffield,

506
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.800
The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;

507
00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.530
Knight of the noble order of Saint George,

508
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.730
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;

509
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.000
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth

510
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.400
Of all his wars within the realm of France?

511
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.530
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles

512
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:59.530
Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.

513
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.330
Is Talbot slain?

514
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.800
O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,

515
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.900
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!

516
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.130
O, that I could but call these dead to life!

517
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:30.030
It were enough to fright the realm of France:

518
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:31.300
Were but his picture left amongst you here,

519
00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.900
It would amaze the proudest of you all.

520
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.400
Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence

521
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.770
And give them burial as beseems their worth.

522
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.130
For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,

523
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.000
They would but stink, and putrefy the air.

524
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.030
Go, take their bodies hence.

525
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:55.570
I'll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear'd

526
00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.930
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.

527
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:05.370
So we be rid, do with 'em what thou wilt.

528
00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:08.030
A success unto our valley general

529
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.530
and happiness to his accomplices.

530
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.700
What tidings send us scouts? I prithy, speak.

531
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.630
The English army, that divided was it to two parties

532
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.200
is now conjoined in one

533
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.400
and means to give you battle presently.

534
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.000
Somewhat to sudden says the warning is

535
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.600
but we will presently provide for them

536
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.530
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there.

537
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:32.370
Haha. Now he is gone my lord. You need not fear.

538
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:39.030
Of all based passions, fear is most accursed.

539
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.530
Command the conquest Charles. It shall by thine.

540
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.130
Let Henry fret and all the world repine.

541
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:55.170
And on my lords. And France be fortunate.

542
00:40:55.170 --> 00:41:01.200
Amen.

543
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.200
