PUBERTY MAKES HORMONES RAGE,

SHE'S TAKING PICTURES

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000

HER OWN CLOTHING BUSINESS.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000

Reporter: AND SOME SAY SHE'S

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000

HER YOUNG MIND IS MORE OPEN

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000

JONNY LANG FILLS CONCERT HALLS

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
WITH FANS WHO CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
HE CAN DO.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I THINK HE'S GREAT.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.000
AMAZING FO

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000

ALBUM.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
HE SAYS WHEN HE WAS 13,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
HE PLAYED HIS GUITAR 12 HOURS

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
*

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
ELSE BUT PLAYING, YOU KNOW,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000

ASSUMES HE'LL HAVE THIS ENERGY

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ALL HIS LIFE.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU'LL JUST

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
GET LESS INSPIRED IN 10 YEARS,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
20 YEARS?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000
LESS ENERGETIC?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I ALWAYS USE B.B. KING

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
AS AN EXAMPLE FOR THIS, LIKE,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
YOU WATCH HIM AND THAT.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
HE'S 74 NOW, AND HE DOESN'T LOOK

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
LIKE HE'S LOST AN OUNCE

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
OF ANYTHING.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Reporter: IF WE ASKED

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
B.B. KING, YOU'D THINK HE'D SAY

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
HE'S AS PASSIONATE NOW AS HE WAS

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
WHEN HE WAS YOUR AGE?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S LESS

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
OF AN ENERGY.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
OH, WHAT A WONDERFUL GUY.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
BUT NO, I DO NOT HAVE THE ENERGY

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
TODAY THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS 17.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
* I'VE BEEN AROUND

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:52.000
A LONG TIME,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.000
A PERFECT 10!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Reporter: I THINK YOU CAN

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
EVEN SEE THE DIFFERENCE

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
IN THE SMILES.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
WE ADULTS RARELY LET IT OUT LIKE

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
THIS, OUR SMILES AREN'T

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.000
THIS BIG.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
IT'S WONDERFUL TO WATCH

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
A TEENAGER LIKE VENUS WILLIAMS

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
WIN A MATCH.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
AND TEENS HAVE BEEN SETTING ALL

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
ASTER THAN

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
WHEN HE WAS A TEEN.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
SOME SAY THE TEENS SET RECORDS

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
BECAUSE THEIR PASSION MAKES THEM

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
WORK HARDER.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
18-YEAR-OLD AL HARRINGTON LOVES

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
BASKETBALL SO MUCH, HE WORKS OUT

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
SEVEN HOURS A DAY.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
HE CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
AL!

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Reporter: BECAUSE HE GETS

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
SO MUCH JOY OUT OF THE GAME.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
ONCE I GO PAST A PERSON, IT'S

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
JUST LIKE SUNSHINE.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
YOU JUST SEE THE SUN UP THERE.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
AND IT'S ALL LIT UP.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
HARRINGTON, ALL ALONE,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
BADA BOOM!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Reporter: THIS YEAR, HE WAS

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
A FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
IN THE NBA, AHEAD OF HUNDREDS

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
OF COLLEGE PLAYERS.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
MAYBE HE GOT THIS GOOD

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
BECAUSE HE WAS TAKING

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
2,000 PRACTICE SHOTS EVERY DAY.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
JUST HOW MUCH MORE ENERGY DO

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
TEENS HAVE?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
WE RAN SOME TESTS AT THIS SPORTS

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
MEDICINE CLINIC.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
BEN, YOUR TASK TODAY IS

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
TO KEEP UP WITH THE TREADMILL.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Reporter: FIRST, WE INVITED

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
18-YEAR-OLD BEN MULLIGAN TO TAKE

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
AN AEROBIC TEST.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
IT MEASURES HOW MUCH OXYGEN

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
YOU DELIVER TO YOUR MUSCLES.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
WHILE THE TESTERS MAKE YOU RUN

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
FASTER AND MORE UPHILL.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
THAT'S IT, HANG IN A LITTLE

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
BIT MORE.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
COME ON.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Reporter: THE RESEARCHERS

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
HERE SAY SIMPLY BECAUSE BEN'S

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
A TEENAGER, HIS HEART CAN PUMP

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
MORE BLOOD AND PROCESS MORE

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
OXYGEN THAN MINE.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THEY HAVE HIM RUN UNTIL HE CAN'T

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
RUN ANYMORE.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
REALLY GOOD TEST.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
THAT WAS A REAL MAXIMAL TEST.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Reporter: NOW, I EXERCISE

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.000
REGULARLY.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I THOUGHT I COULD DO AS WELL

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
AS A TEEN ON THIS TEST,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
BUT THE PHYSIOLOGIST HERE SAYS,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
"NO WAY."

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
YOU ASSUME HIS BODY WILL JUST DO

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
THINGS MINE CAN'T.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Reporter: SURE ENOUGH, WHEN

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
IT WAS MY TURN ON THE MACHINE,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
THEY COULD SEE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
JOHN, YOU'RE SOUNDING

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
ON YOUR FEET THAN BEN DID

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
AT THIS POINT.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000

MINUTES SOONER THAN BEN DID.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
KEEP WALKING.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
COME ON, KEEP WALKING.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.000
DON'T STOP.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
IT'S ONLY ONE MILE AN HOUR.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
INEFFICIENT MY BLOOD AND OXYGEN

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
USE IS COMPARED TO BEN'S.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
ON A QUICK LOOK-SEE,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
ABOUT 66% OF WHAT BEN DID.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Reporter: I COULD HAVE

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
TOUGHED IT OUT LONGER,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
WORKS BETTER.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000

SHE CAN TAKE IT IN.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
SHE CAN MOVE IT AROUND THE BODY

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
FASTER, AND SHE CAN UTILIZE IT

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
BETTER.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
WELL, FOR MEN, THE PEAKING

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
SEEMS TO OCCUR SOMEPLACE BETWEEN

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
THE AGES OF 17 TO 20,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TRAINING.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
FOR WOMEN, THAT HAPPENS EARLIER,

YEAH.

AND THAT'S WHY AL HARRINGTON IS

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
NERVOUSLY LIFTING WEIGHTS.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
PASSION IS NOT ENOUGH.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
YOU SEEN THEM GUYS ON THE NBA

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
FLOOR?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I MEAN, THEY ARE HUGE!

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
THEY'RE GROPE MEN.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
MOST OF 'EM, YOU KNOW, 25 AND

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
OLDER AND I'M ONLY 18.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Reporter: STILL AT 18,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
IN MANY WAYS, WE'RE AS FULL

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
OF PASSION AND ENERGY AS WE'LL

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
EVER BE.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
IT HELPS EXPLAIN WHY SOME

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
OF THE FIERCEST WARRIORS, LIKE

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND JOAN

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
OF ARC, WERE TEENAGERS, AND WHY

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
MILITARY RECRUITING STARTS

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
AT 17.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
TEENS ARE READY TO FIGHT.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
HE TOOK ME IN THE BACKYARD.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
IT WAS LIKE BA-BA

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.000
IN THE BACKYARD RIGHT THERE.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, SHOOTIN'

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
OFF THE NINE.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
IT WAS CHILLING.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Reporter: OF COURSE, THIS

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
PASSION CAN BE TURNED TO BAD

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
ENDS.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
TEENAGERS ALSO COMMIT THREE

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
TIMES AS MANY CRIMES AS ADULTS.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
THESE THREE IN BROOKLYN CLAIM

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
TO HAVE REFORMED.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
I MEAN, IF WE ALL KEEP

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
ON FIGHTING LIKE THIS, WE'RE ALL

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
GOING TO BE DEAD.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Reporter: JASON SHOWED US HOW

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
TO CHOKE PEOPLE TILL THEY PASS

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
OUT SO YOU CAN STEAL

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
THEIR MONEY.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
DOING BAD THINGS IS JUST FUN.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
WHO CARES ABOUT ANYBODY?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
WE'RE JUST DOING IT JUST

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
TO HAVE FUN.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
IT WAS JUST AN ADRENALINE RUSH.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:53.000
GOING OFF FOR CHASES

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
WITH THE POLICE.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THEY CAN'T CATCH YOU.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
IT'S MAD FUN.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Reporter: KEEN IS 18.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
WE USED TO JUST ROB THEM,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.000
TAKE THEIR MONEY.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
ROB ANOTHER PERSON,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
AND THAT'S IT.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
GET ZOOTED, GO LOOK FOR GIRLS

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Reporter: DO YOU OWE SOCIETY

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
ANYTHING?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
NOTHING.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
WHAT DO I OWE THEM?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Reporter: PASSION FOR BAD,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
OR GOOD.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
EITHER WAY, TEENS TEND TO HAVE

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
MORE OF IT THAN WE ADULTS.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
NOW, DON'T TAKE ME WRONG,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
BUT I THINK ADULTS DON'T

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
ENJOY LIFE REALLY AS MUCH

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
AS CHILDREN DO AND THEY TAKE

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
LIFE FOR GRANTED.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I DON'T THINK ADULTS REALLY KNOW

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
WHAT TRUE PASSION IS.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Reporter: HMM.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
SOME OF US ADULTS MIGHT WANT

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
TO ARGUE ABOUT THAT.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
BUT IT IS TRUE THAT TEENS ARE

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
DIFFERENT, IN MANY WAYS.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
HERE AGAIN, JOHN STOSSEL.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
IT'S EASY TO GENERALIZE

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
ABOUT TEENS.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
TALKING ABOUT THEM AS IF THEY'RE

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
ALL ALIKE, WHEN, OF COURSE,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
EVERYONE'S AN INDIVIDUAL.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
AND TEENS HATE BEING LABELED

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
A "TYPE."

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
THOUGH THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
THE RESEARCHERS DO HERE,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
AND THEY EARN A GOOD LIVING

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
DOING IT.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I HAVEN'T HEARD

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000

RESEARCH FIRM, THEY WATCH TEENS

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
FROM BEHIND ONE-WAY GLASS.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
THE RESEARCHERS ARE COLLECTING

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
DATA FOR COMPANIES THAT WANT

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.000
TO KNOW WHAT KIDS WILL BUY.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
NO!

THEY'LL WEAR --

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
THOSE ARE PRETTY BAGGY.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
CONCLUSIONS ABOUT

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
THEIR PERSONALITIES.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
WE ACTUALLY SEGMENT TEENS

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
INTO FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
ONE OF THE GROUPS WE CALL

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
INFLUENCERS, WHO ARE THOSE TEENS

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
WHO ARE KIND OF AT THE TOP

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
OF THE TEENAGE SOCIAL HIERARCHY.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000

IMITATE AND WANT TO JOIN.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
BUT SORRY, MEMBERSHIP IS

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
BY INVITATION ONLY.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
FOLLOWING THE INFLUENCERS,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
THERE IS A GROUP WE CALL

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
THE CONFORMERS.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
ALMOST ALL TEENAGERS, HALF

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
OF TEENAGERS, ARE CONFORMERS.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
THEY'RE LOOKING PARTICULARLY

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
UPWARD TOWARDS THE INFLUENCERS

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
FOR WHAT TO DO, AS FAR AS BEING

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
THE -- DOING THE LATEST

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.000

ASPECT OF THIS LIFE STAGE.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
HOWEVER, A LOT OF THESE PASSIVES

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
ARE HIGH ACHIEVERS IN SCHOOLS.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
AND WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE A LOT

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
OF VERY SUCCESSFUL ADULTS CAME

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
FROM THIS GROUP.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
THEY'RE NOT AS INVESTED

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
IN THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AS ARE

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
OTHER TEENS.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I CAN EVEN DRESS MYSELF.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
SCHOOL LATER THIS YEAR, HE'S

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
STILL GOING TO WEAR HIS COWBOY

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
BOOTS NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
SAYS.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I SURE AIN'T GONNA CHANGE

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
BECAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE SAYS,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
"BOY, THAT LOOKS DUMB."

**

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
THE NEW IDEAS GENERALLY COME

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
FROM TEENAGE CATEGORY FOUR, WHAT

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
ZOLLO CALLS THE EDGE KIDS,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
AS IN CUTTING EDGE.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
THE TEENS THEMSELVES MAY CALL

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
THEMSELVES PUNKS, OR GOTHS,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000

WHERE THEY ARE.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
THESE ARE THE MOST REBELLIOUS

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
THE TRENDS.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000

FOLLOWED.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000

SHE'S SO LAID BACK!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000

THIS IS NATURAL, SAY

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, ADOLESCENTS NEED

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
FROM THEIR PARENTS

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
AS CHILDREN, THEY WERE

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
SO ATTACHED.

I GREW UP IN THE '60s.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
WE DID LOTS OF THINGS THAT

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
BUGGED OUR PARENTS.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
BEFORE THAT, THERE WAS GOLDFISH

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
SWALLOWING AND CRAMMING PHONE

NEW PERSONALITIES.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
IF IT APPALLS YOUR PARENTS,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
SO MUCH THE BETTER, BECAUSE THAT

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
PROVES YOU'RE BECOMING

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AN INDIVIDUAL.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
WHEN WE COME BACK, SCIENCE SHEDS

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
SOME LIGHT ON TEEN BEHAVIOR.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
WE LOOK INSIDE A TEENAGE BRAIN.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
WHY ARE SO MANY TEENAGERS

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
SO WEIRD?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
IT'S A COMMON COMPLAINT WE HEAR.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
THE WAY THEY LOOK, THE WAY

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
THEY ACT.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
WHAT IT'S ABOUT, SAY

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
PSYCHOLOGISTS, IS A NECESSARY

BREAKING AWAY FROM US PARENTS,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
A SEPARATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
DURING ADOLESCENCE IF THE TEEN

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
HI, MOM.

TEENS, ESPECIALLY THE YOUNGER

THEY ARE REALLY FEELING

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000
A CLOSENESS TO THEIR PARENTS,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
MORE SO THAN WE'VE SEEN

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000

BOTH MY PARENTS.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
MOSTLY MY FATHER.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
WHY'S THAT?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
BECAUSE OF HIS INFLUENCE ON ME.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
MY MOM DID A TERRIFIC JOB.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I REALLY APPRECIATE

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
MY PARENTS.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
PARENTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
JUST TO GUIDE YOU AND TELL

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
BUT THEN WHY DO SO MANY PARENTS

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
COMPLAIN ABOUT SCREAMING FIGHTS

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
OR SILENCES AND SLAMMED DOORS?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
IF TEENS REALLY WANT PARENTS

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES, MANY

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
TO HER ROOM AND SLAMS THE DOOR."

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000

WHAT CAN A PARENT DO?

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
SO I'M NOT GETTING THE MONEY

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
TOMORROW?

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
NOPE.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
LOTS OF PARENTS MAKE

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
THEIR KIDS SORRY THEY OPENED

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
THEIR MOUTHS WHEN THEY TALK

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
TO THEM.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
AND THOSE ARE THE KIDS WHO LIE.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
**

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
MATT, MATT, COME HERE.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Reporter: MANY FAMILY

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
THERAPISTS SAY THE MORE RULES

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:35.000
YOU HAVE, THE MORE YOU GET

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
LIED TO.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
IF I SAY I'M GOING

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
TO SOMEONE'S HOUSE, YOU DON'T

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000
BELIEVE ME.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
BECAUSE YOU'VE LIED TO ME

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
SEVERAL OCCASIONS.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Reporter: FRANCINE WENZEL HAS

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
LOTS OF RULES FOR 15-YEAR-OLD

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
MATT, LIKE A 9:30 CURFEW

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
ON WEEKENDS.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
CURFEW IS A PRIVILEGE WHICH

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
YOU DON'T DESERVE, PERIOD.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
9:30 AND I'M 15.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
COME ON NOW.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
IT TO BE?

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
PEOPLE, MOM -- PEOPLE DON'T

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
GO OUT TILL 8:30.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
YOU'RE STILL CHILDREN.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
THERE ARE CRAZY PEOPLE OUT

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
THERE.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
YOU KNOW THIS.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
BUT I FORGOT, YOU'RE

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
JESUS CHRIST.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
NOTHING HAPPENS TO YOU, RIGHT?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
YOU'RE INVINCIBLE, RIGHT?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
SHE SAYS, "YOU DON'T MAKE

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
GOOD DECISIONS.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD JUDGMENT.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
YOU'RE A CHILD.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
YOU'RE A MESS."

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
THE OLDER YOU GET, THE MORE

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
RESPONSIBILITIES YOU GET,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
THE MORE MATURE YOU GET.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
BUT YOU CAN'T SPELL THAT WORD.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
KEEP RIPPIN' ME.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
KEEP RIPPIN' ME.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I'M NOT TRYING TO RIP YOU.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
WELL, SHE MIGHT AS WELL JUST

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
BUILD A FIRE AND THEN POUR

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
GASOLINE ON IT.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
BECAUSE SHE'S SAYING, "I DON'T

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
YOU'RE JUST A KID."

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
IT'S THAT ATTITUDE WHICH IS

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000
PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
TO A 5-YEAR-OLD, MEANS THAT

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
SHE'S STRUGGLING NOW THAT

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
HER KID IS 15.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
SHE SHOULD BE SAYING TO HIM, "I

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
KNOW YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE."

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
YOU'RE MY BABY.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
AND YOU'RE 14.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Reporter: LORI'S AWARE THAT

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000
SHE INSTINCTIVELY TREATS

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
HER YOUNG ADULT LIKE SHE'S STILL

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
A CHILD.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I THINK PARENTS SHOULD JUST

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
UNDERSTAND THAT WE WANT TO GROW

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
UP AND BE OUR OWN PEOPLE.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
TO HAVE A SELF, TO KNOW WHO

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
YOU ARE IS AN ENORMOUS TASK.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
AND IN THE 5,000 DAYS

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
OF ADOLESCENCE, EVERY TEENAGER

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
IS TRYING TO LEAVE HOME.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
AND THE ONLY WAY SHE CAN LEAVE

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
HOME IS IF SHE ACCOMPLISHES

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000
THAT.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
TO CONTROL HER, THEN YOU'RE

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
MAKING IT A BATTLE BETWEEN

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
LISTENING TO YOU OR LISTENING

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
TO HERSELF.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
WHY IS IT EVRY TIME YOU ASK

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
ME A QUESTION AND I TELL YOU NO,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
YOU GOTTA ASK ME WHY?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
THE REASON IS BECAUSE

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I SAID NO.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Reporter: "BECAUSE I SAID NO"

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
WAS A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER WHEN

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
YOUR CHILD WAS 5.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
BUT NOT FOR TEENS, WHO SHOULD

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
NOW BE LEARNING HOW TO MAKE

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
THEIR OWN DECISIONS.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
WHAT ABOUT DATING?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
NOPE.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Reporter: CINDY TELLS

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
THE FAMILY THERAPIST WHY SHE HAS

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
STRICT RULES FOR DAWN -- RULES

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
LIKE FORBIDDING HER TO DATE.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
BECAUSE I FOUND OUT THAT

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
SHE HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ACTIVE

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
AND I DIDN'T REALIZE IT.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
AND SHE CAN'T STOP

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
YOU FROM BEING SEXUALLY ACTIVE,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
CAN SHE?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
UH-UH.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
BASICALLY, I REALLY CAN'T

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
STOP HER FROM DOING ANYTHING.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Reporter: PARENTS TRY TO USE

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000
RULES TO PROTECT THEIR KIDS.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.000
BUT PARENTS OF TEENS HAVE

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
WITH YOUR TEENAGER ALL THE TIME.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
YEAH!

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
85% OF THE TIME, KIDS ARE

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
ALONE OR WITH THEIR FRIENDS.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Reporter: YOU BOTH ARGUE THAT

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
WE SHOULD HAVE FEWER RULES.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A RULE THAT

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
YOU CAN'T ENFORCE, YOU CAN'T

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
POLICE AND YOU CAN'T MONITOR?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Reporter: BUT MY KID SHOULD

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
LISTEN TO ME.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I SHOULD TELL HIM WHAT TO DO

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
UNTIL HE'S AN ADULT.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
TELL HIM WHAT TO DO UNTIL HE'S

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
WHEN, 25?

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
35?

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
AND THEN WHAT?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
THIS IS A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
NOT LEARNED TO LISTEN

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
TO HIMSELF.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
IF YOU'VE BEEN CONTROLLING

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
YOUR KID, THEN YOU HAVE CREATED

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
TO NAVIGATE.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
IF WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
OUR OWN CHOICES, MAYBE

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
IN THE FUTURE WE'RE NEVER GOING

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
TO BE ABLE TO.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Reporter: SO YOU HAVE TO LET

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
YOUR 14-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DATE?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
AND WHAT IF SHE COMES HOME --

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
WITH A GUY WHOSE TONGUE IS

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
PIERCED AND HAS SOMETHING GROSS

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
PRINTED ON HIS T-SHIRT?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
YOU SAY, "WELCOME, KIDS"?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
IF YOU'RE A SMART PARENT,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
WHEN SHE COMES HOME WITH THIS

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
GUY WITH THE DISGUSTING MESSAGE

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
ON HIS T-SHIRT AND HIS TONGUE IS

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
PIERCED AND HE HAS AN ARROW

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
THROUGH HIS HEAD OR WHATEVER,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
YOU SAY, "HEY, SCAR, WELCOME

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
TO OUR FAMILY."

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
BECAUSE THE FACT IS, IN SPITE

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
OF THE WAY HE LOOKS, YOU DON'T

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
KNOW THE TRUTH ABOUT SCAR.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Reporter: WELL, I DO.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I DON'T LIKE THIS KID

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
IN MY HOUSE.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA SAY,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
"BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM."

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "WELL

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HIM

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE LOOKS."

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA SAY, "WELL,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
YOU'RE CLOSE-MINDED."

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
YOU'RE SETTING UP A ROMEO

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
AND JULIET SCENARIO,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
BECAUSE THEN SHE GOES

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
UNDERGROUND WITH IT

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
AND SHE FALLS MORE AND MORE

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH HIM.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
YOU ARE GOING TO CLEAN

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
YOUR ROOM!

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.000
NO, I'M NOT.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
YES, YOU ARE!

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
NO, I'M NOT.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Reporter: NOW, TEENS DO NEED

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
RULES.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
CLEANING HER ROOM IS ONE

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
HER MOTHER CAN POLICE.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
BUT THE EXPERTS SAY FIGHTING

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
OVER SUCH SMALL STUFF ISN'T

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
WORTH IT.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
INSTEAD, FOCUS ON A FEW

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
IMPORTANT RULES --

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
SAY, DON'T DRIVE DRUNK, CALL

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
WHEN YOU'RE LATE, DON'T CHEAT.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
WHATEVER'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
AFTER THAT, GET OFF YOUR KID'S

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
BACK.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
YOU HAVE VALUES.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
YOUR VALUES ARE GOOD AND IT'S

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
GOOD THAT YOU COMMUNICATE

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
YOUR VALUES.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
THE PROBLEM ENTERS WHEN YOU HAVE

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
A BUNCH OF LITTLE RULES THAT

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000
POISON YOUR RELATIONSHIP

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
WITH YOUR TEENAGER.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
DAWN!

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
SO YOUR KID GETS SO FED UP

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
DEALING WITH YOU, SHE JUST

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
WRITES YOU OUT.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
DAWN!

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
I'M COMING!

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
WHEN?

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
NEXT YEAR?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
YOU EVER FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
JUST POLICING, DETECTING?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
CONSTANTLY.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.000
CONSTANTLY.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
BECAUSE I CAN'T TRUST HER.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
WELL, HOW DO YOU REACT

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
TO THAT?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
REBELS.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I PULL AWAY.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
LIKE HOW?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I DON'T TELL HER ANYTHING.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
I DON'T DO WHAT I'M SUPPOSED

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
TO DO.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I RUN AWAY.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
DO WHATEVER I FEEL LIKE,

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
TEENAGERS, THAT'S THE ESSENCE

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
OF ADOLESCENCE.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
THEY HAVE AN ALLERGIC REACTION

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
TO ANY ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THEM.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
THEY HATE IT, THEY SMELL IT,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
AND THEY RUN AWAY FROM IT.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT IT?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
WE'LL LOOK

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
BY THE TIME OUR KIDS ARE

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
TEENS, SOME OF US PARENTS FEEL

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
AS IF WE NO LONGER HAVE MUCH

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
INFLUENCE, THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
OUR KIDS WILL REALLY LISTEN

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
TO ARE THEIR PEERS.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:32.000
YOU MAKE YOUR FRIENDS MORE

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING ELSE

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
IN YOUR LIFE.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.000
WELL, WHEN I NEED THEM,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
THEY'RE THERE FOR ME MORE THAN

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
ANYTHING IN MY LIFE.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
OH, NOBODY ELSE DOES NOTHING

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.000
FOR YOU, RIGHT?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
HELL, NO.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
WHAT'S UP, YO.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
MAD LOVE.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Reporter: 15-YEAR-OLD MATT

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:50.000
CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
OF THE HOUSE SO HE CAN BE

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
WITH HIS FRIENDS.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:52.000
HE SAYS HIS FRIENDS ARE THERE

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
FOR HIM.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
THEY ARE!

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
FROM FRIENDS.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU BELONG.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
IF HE CAN'T GET IT AT HOME,

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
HIS FRIENDS WILL BECOME MORE

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
AND MORE IMPORTANT TO HIM.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
THE FRIENDS LISTEN TO YOU.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
WHAT YOU SAY IS OKAY.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Reporter: MATT AGREES THAT

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
HIS FRIENDS REALLY PAY

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
ATTENTION.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
MOM DOESN'T.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
SHE DOESN'T LISTEN

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
TO ANYTHING I HAVE TO SAY.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
SHE HAS NO TIME TO BE LISTENING

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
TO ME.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
IF YOU WERE HOME MORE OFTEN,

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
YOU COULD SIT AND TALK TO ME.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
ONE NIGHT A WEEK, I DON'T WORK,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.000
SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TRY TO STAY

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:23.000
HOME?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
YEAH, RIGHT, SATURDAY NIGHT.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
NOW, YOU REALLY -- NOW, YOU'RE

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
SMOKING CRACK.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
SHE WANTS TO SPEND MORE TIME

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
WITH HIM.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
PLEASE!

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
ONE NIGHT A WEEK.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
AND SHE CAN'T GET HIM TO DO IT.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.000
WHAT DO THEY DO WHEN THEY SPEND

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
TIME TOGETHER?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
THEY FIGHT!

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO PUT

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
UP THROUGH?

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
MY NERVES ARE SHOT.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I'M GONNA EXPLODE ONE DAY

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
IF I DON'T GET AWAY.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
I'M LEAVING!

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
HE'S A REALLY GOOD KID.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
HE WANTS TO WORK IT OUT

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
WITH HER.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Reporter: THE FIRST THING

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
TO DO, SAY THE EXPERTS, IS

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
FOR PARENTS TO LECTURE LESS.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.000
WHEN I SAY, "I KNOW, DAD,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I KNOW."

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
HE SAYS, "YOU THINK YOU KNOW

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
YOU DON'T KNOW!"

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.000
AND I'M LIKE, "BUT DAD, I --

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I KNOW."

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
HE SAYS, "NO, YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
'CAUSE IF YOU KNEW, YOU WOULDN'T

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
HAVE DONE IT!"

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
YOU KNOW, I'M REALLY MORE

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
AFRAID OF BEING LECTURED THAN

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
BEING PUNISHED, BECAUSE IT'S

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
JUST REALLY REDUNDANT

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
AND TEDIOUS AND ALL.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
ASK YOURSELF AS A PARENT, WHY

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
DON'T YOU LISTEN TO PEOPLE?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
WELL, YOU DON'T LISTEN

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000
TO SOMEONE FOR ONE REASON,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
BECAUSE THEY TELL YOU THE SAME

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
YOU'VE HEARD IT 20 TIMES.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
WHY WOULD YOU LISTEN TO IT

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
THE 21st TIME?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
DOES, LIKE, LECTURING JUST

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000

A PARENT, YOU LIKE TO LECTURE?

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Reporter: I THINK I KNOW MORE

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.000
THAN YOU.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
YOU'RE A KID.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
AS KIDS, WE THINK WE KNOW

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
MORE THAN YOU.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Reporter: BUT YOU DON'T.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
BUT WE DON'T.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
BUT BY YOU TELLING US WHAT WE DO

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
AND DON'T KNOW ISN'T GONNA

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.000
HELP US.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Reporter: IT ISN'T GOING

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
TO HELP THEM FORM THEIR OWN

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
IDENTITIES.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
AND IT MAY PUSH THEM AWAY.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
INSTEAD OF MAKING THIS POCKET

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
FLAT --

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Reporter: AURA'S PARENTS

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
PUSHED HER AWAY BY ATTACKING

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
THE VERY THING THAT TURNED OUT

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
TO MAKE HER SUCCESSFUL.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
MY PARENTS HATED THE WAY

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
I DRESSED, HATED IT.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Reporter: WHAT DID THEY SAY?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
THEY HATED THE MAKEUP.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
THEY HATED LIKE THE CRAZY

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
HAIRSTYLES.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Reporter: THE RESULT?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
SHE MOVED IN WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
MIRA KIRSHENBAUM SAYS RATHER

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
THAN LECTURE YOUR TEEN --

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
ASK QUESTIONS.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Reporter: WELL, I'M

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
THE PARENT, WHAT CAN

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
SHE TELL ME?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I'M SUPPOSED TO TEACH HER.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
WHY SHOULD SHE LISTEN TO YOU?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
YOU HAVEN'T EARNED THE RIGHT.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Reporter: WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.000
EARN IT?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I'M HER PARENT.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
I DON'T HAVE TO EARN IT.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
IF YOU ASK HER THE QUESTIONS

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
ABOUT HOW SHE FELT AND WHY

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
SHE DID IT AND WHAT IT MEANT,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
SHE'S GOING TO FEEL THAT YOU ARE

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
A SAFE PERSON TO TELL THINGS TO.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
THEN YOU CAN SAY, "CAN I TELL

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
YOU HOW I FEEL?"

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
WELL, YOU -- FIRST OF ALL,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
YOU'VE EARNED THE RIGHT NOW

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
BECAUSE SHE'S OPENED UP.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
AND THAT'S HOW PARENTS WHO

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
REALLY DO HAVE INFLUENCE

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
WITH THEIR KIDS GET INFLUENCE,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
IS BY LISTENING TO

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
THEIR TEENAGERS TALK FIRST.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
WHY DID I DO IT?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T WANT

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Reporter: THEN YOU CAN SAY

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
WHAT YOU WOULD DO, WHAT

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
YOUR VALUES ARE.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
WITHOUT SCHOOL?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
NOWHERE.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Reporter: THE TEENS MAY NOT

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
ACT LIKE THEY HEAR IT,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
BUT THE EXPERTS SAY THEY DO,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
AND IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
LATER.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
AFTER ALL, SURVEYS SHOW MOST

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
YOUNG ADULTS EVENTUALLY DO ADOPT

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
THEIR PARENTS' VALUES.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
YOU JUST CAN'T FORCE IT.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHILE BEING

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
VERY STRICT, TOO CONTROLLING,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
CAUSES PROBLEMS, THE OPPOSITE

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
CAUSES PROBLEMS, TOO.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
REMEMBER BEN MULLIGAN,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
THE 18-YEAR-OLD WHO BEAT ME

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
ON THE AEROBIC TEST?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
WE FIRST MET HIM HERE IN MAINE,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
AT THE HYDE SCHOOL, A SCHOOL

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
THAT SPECIALIZES IN HELPING

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
TEENAGERS WHO ARE HAVING

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
PROBLEMS.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
BEN'S PARENTS BROUGHT HIM HERE

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
BECAUSE HE'D BEEN GETTING STONED

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
AND HIS GRADES HAD FALLEN.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
BEN WAS EXTREMELY UNHAPPY

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
AND HE WAS VERY REBELLIOUS.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000
LIKE A LOT OF DRINKING

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
OVER THAT SUMMER, SMOKED A LOT

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
OF POT.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
YOU KNOW, MY FAULT IN THAT

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
WAS I DISENGAGED.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Reporter: BEN'S FATHER FEARED

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
THE TRUTH, SO HE DIDN'T ASK.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T ASK THOSE

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
HARD QUESTIONS, EVER.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I BECAME LAZY.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
ABDICATING JUST BASICALLY

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
SAYS TO YOUR KID, "YOU KNOW,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
I DON'T CARE."

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
AND THAT'S TERRIBLE.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
ONE OF THE MARKS OF A REALLY

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
GOOD PARENT IS THAT YOU ASK

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
QUESTIONS THAT GET BAD NEWS.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
IF YOU'RE NOT HEARING BAD NEWS,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
YOUR KID'S NOT TELLING

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
YOU THE WHOLE TRUTH.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Reporter: BUT HOW MUCH

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
INFLUENCE DO WE HAVE OVER THESE

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
KIDS ANYWAY?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
YOU HAVE AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
OF INFLUENCE FOR A COUPLE

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
OF REASONS.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
DEEP DOWN YOUR KID IS FEELING

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
UNLOVED AND SCARED.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SO SCARED

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT AM I GONNA DO

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
WITH MY LIFE?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
I REALLY WISH I WAS, LIKE,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
A LOT CLOSER WITH MY DAD

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
ESPECIALLY, BECAUSE HE, LIKE,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
GETS HOME FROM WORK AT, LIKE,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
5:00 OR 6:00 AND THEN HE GOES

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
INTO HIS, LIKE, ROOM AND WATCHES

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
OR WHATEVER SEASON IT IS.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Reporter: IS THE MOST

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
IN YOUR LIFE WITH YOUR PARENTS?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
YES?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
TEENAGERS MAY NOT SHOW IT,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
BUT THEY DO WANT QUESTIONS,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
INTEREST, LIMITS.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
IT MAKES THEM FEEL SAFE

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
AND LOVED.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I WISH

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE STRICT,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
LIKE, YOU KNOW, SET A LITTLE

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
MORE RULES.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
I KNOW I'M GOING TO REGRET THIS

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
IN TWO MONTHS, BUT STILL --

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Reporter: I WAS SURPRISED HOW

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
MANY TEENS TOLD ME THEY LIKED IT

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
WHEN THEIR PARENTS SET LIMITS.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
WHY WOULD YOU WANT THEM TO BE

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000
MORE STRICT?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
YOUR FREEDOM.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE MORE

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
STRICT, THEN, LIKE,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.000
THEY PARTICIPATE MORE

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
IN MY LIFE.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Reporter: AND PARTICIPATION

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
ISN'T JUST SETTING LIMITS.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
ONE TRICK, SAY THE EXPERTS, IS

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
CATCH YOUR CHILD DOING SOMETHING

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
RIGHT.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
IN OTHER WORDS, SEEK OUT THINGS

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
TO PRAISE.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
THANKS SO MUCH.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IT MEANT A LOT

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
TO ME WHEN YOU TOOK OUT

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
THE GARBAGE WITHOUT MY EVEN

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
ASKING.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
THANKS.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.000
IT MAKES MY LIFE EASIER.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Reporter: BUT HE OUGHT

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
I HAVE TO PRAISE HIM FOR TAKING

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
OUT THE GARBAGE?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
YEAH.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Reporter: IT'S NOT REALLY

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
NATURAL TO DO THAT.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
IT'S MUCH MORE NATURAL TO SPEAK

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
UP WHEN HE DOESN'T TAKE OUT

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
THE GARBAGE.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
TOUGH NOOGIES.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
IF YOU KEEP FOCUSING

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
ON THE CRITICISM, THAT'S ALL

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
YOUR KID WILL HEAR, THAT'S ALL

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
THE WHOLE -- YOU'RE POLLUTING

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
YOUR FAMILY ENVIRONMENT.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Reporter: AT THE HYDE SCHOOL,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
PARENTS MUST ATTEND PERIODIC

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
MEETINGS WHERE THEY'RE TAUGHT

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD THIS

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
HOUR.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
YES, THERE MUST BE RULES,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
BUT THE RULES SHOULD BE FEW,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
TO ALLOW TEENS ROOM TO MAKE

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
THEIR OWN MISTAKES.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
ABOVE ALL, THEY SAY, LECTURE

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
LESS AND LISTEN MORE.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
LORI BROUGHT ASHLEY HERE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
FOR ME, IT'S LEARNING

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
TO LISTEN WITH MY MOUTH CLOSED

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
AND MY EARS OPEN, AND THAT

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
SHE MAY HAVE A LOT MORE WISDOM

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
THAN I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Reporter: BEN'S MOM NOW

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
ADMITS THAT SHE'D FORGOTTEN

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
THE REAL GOAL IN PARENTING

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
A TEEN.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
THEY WILL BE INDIVIDUALS

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
WITHOUT ME, AND THAT AFTER ALL

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
IS THE GOAL IS TO RAISE

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
OUR CHILDREN TO BE

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
SELF-SUFFICIENT.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Reporter: THEY'RE ALMOST

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
ADULTS, PARENTS ARE REMINDED.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
YOU CAN SHOW THEM WHAT

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
YOUR VALUES ARE, BUT YOU CAN'T

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
CONTROL THEM ANYMORE.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
SO JUST LOVE THEM AND LISTEN

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
TO THEM, AND WITH LUCK, THEY'LL

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
LET YOU INTO THEIR LIVES.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
A SUCCESSFUL PARENT --

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
IF YOUR KID WILL TELL

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
YOU ANYTHING.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
THAT SAVES KIDS' LIVES.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
YOU SHOULD PUT UP A BANNER

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM THAT SAYS,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
"WE CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
HERE."

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
I'LL BE BACK WITH SOME FINAL

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
THOUGHTS, AFTER THIS.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
AS I LISTENED TO THE FAMILY

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
THERAPISTS TALK ABOUT GIVING

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
OUR TEENS ROOM, NOT BEING

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
SO STRICT, IT SOUNDED LIKE WE'RE

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
SUPPOSED TO BE OUR TEENS'

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
FRIENDS.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
BUT THE EXPERTS SAID, "NO, WHY

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
WOULD YOU WANT TO BE YOUR KID'S

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
FRIEND?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
AND THEIR MUSIC'S LOUSY."

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
INSTEAD, THEY SAID, BE AN ALLY.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
SOMEONE WHO OFFERS HELP,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
BUT DOESN'T TRY TO CONTROL.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
FINALLY, THEY SAID, IF THEY'RE

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
DISOBEDIENT DURING THESE YEARS,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
REMEMBER, THEY'LL USUALLY GROW

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
OUT OF IT.

ALWAYS WANT TO BE PART

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
