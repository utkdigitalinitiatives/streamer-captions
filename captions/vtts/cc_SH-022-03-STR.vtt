00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.400


2
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.870
I muse my Lord ofGloucester is not come:

3
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.270
'Tis not his wont to bethe hindmost man,

4
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.000
Whate'er occasion keepshim from us now.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.400
Can you not see? or willye not observe

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.870
The strangeness of hisalter'd countenance?

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.900
With what a majesty heholds himself,

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.400
How insolent of late he isbecome,

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.930
How proud, how peremptory,and unlike himself?

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.430
We know the time since hewas mild and affable,

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.430
And if we did but glance afar-off look,

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.330
Immediately he was uponhis knee,

13
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.530
That all the court admiredhim for submission:

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.700
But meet him now, and, beit in the morn,

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
When every one will givethe time of day,

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900
He knits his brow andshows an angry eye,

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.970
And passeth by with stiffunbowed knee,

18
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.970
Disdaining duty that to usbelongs.

19
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.130
Small curs are notregarded when they grin;

20
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.270
But great men tremble whenthe lion roars;

21
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.300
And Humphrey is no littleman in England.

22
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.900
First note that he is nearyou in descent,

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.000
And should you fall, he asthe next will mount.

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.630
Me seemeth then it is nopolicy,

25
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230
Respecting what arancorous mind he bears

26
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.630
And his advantagefollowing your decease,

27
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.470
That he should come aboutyour royal person

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.800
Or be admitted to yourhighness' council.

29
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
By flattery hath he wonthe commons' hearts,

30
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.600
And when he please to makecommotion,

31
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.330
'Tis to be fear'd they allwill follow him.

32
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.200
Now 'tis the spring, andweeds are shallow-rooted;

33
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.030
Suffer them now, andthey'll o'ergrow the garden

34
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.270
And choke the herbs forwant of husbandry.

35
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.200
The reverent care I bearunto my lord

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.200
Made me collect thesedangers in the duke.

37
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.730
If it be fond, call it awoman's fear;

38
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.500
Which fear if betterreasons can supplant,

39
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.300
I will subscribe and say Iwrong'd the duke.

40
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.800
My Lord of Suffolk,Buckingham, and York,

41
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.070
Reprove my allegation, ifyou can;

42
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.630
Or else conclude my wordseffectual.

43
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.430
Well hath your highnessseen into this duke;

44
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.330
And, had I first been putto speak my mind,

45
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.400
I think I should have toldyour grace's tale.

46
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.630
The duchess, by hissubornation,

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.470
Upon my life, began herdevilish practises:

48
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.030
Smooth runs the waterwhere the brook is deep;

49
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.870
And in his simple show heharbours treason.

50
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.130
The fox barks not when hewould steal the lamb.

51
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.830
No, no, my sovereign;Gloucester is a man

52
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.470
Unsounded yet and full ofdeep deceit.

53
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.100
Did he not, contrary toform of law,

54
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.270
Devise strange deaths forsmall offences done?

55
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.500
And did he not, in hisprotectorship,

56
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.430
Levy great sums of moneythrough the realm

57
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.670
For soldiers' pay inFrance, and never sent it?

58
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.070
By means whereof the townseach day revolted.

59
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.670
Tut, these are pettyfaults to faults unknown.

60
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.500
Which time will bring tolight in smooth

61
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.870
Duke Humphrey.

62
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.200
My lords, at once: thecare you have of us,

63
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.400
To mow down thorns thatwould annoy our foot,

64
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.070
Is worthy praise: but, shallI speak my conscience,

65
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.600
Our kinsman Gloucester isas innocent

66
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.100
From meaning treason toour royal person

67
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.300
As is the sucking lamb orharmless dove:

68
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.430
The duke is virtuous, mildand too well given

69
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.770
To dream on evil or towork my downfall.

70
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.570
Ah, what's more dangerousthan this fond affiance!

71
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.000
Seems he a dove? hisfeathers are but borrowed,

72
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.770
For he's disposed as thehateful raven:

73
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.570
Is he a lamb? his skin issurely lent him,

74
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.400
For he's inclined as isthe ravenous wolves.

75
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.130
Take heed, my lord; thewelfare of us all

76
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.600
Hangs on the cutting shortthat fraudful man.

77
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.700
All health unto mygracious sovereign!

78
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.530
Welcome, Lord Somerset.What news from France?

79
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.130
That all your interest inthose territories

80
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.600
Is utterly bereft you; allis lost.

81
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.430
Cold news, Lord Somerset:but God's will be done!

82
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:35.300
Cold news for me; for Ihad hope of France

83
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.370
As firmly as I hope forfertile England.

84
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.000
Thus are my blossomsblasted in the bud

85
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.170
And caterpillars eat myleaves away;

86
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.230
But I will remedy thisgear ere long,

87
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.700
Or sell my title for aglorious grave.

88
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.170
All happiness unto my lordthe king!

89
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.130
Pardon, my liege, that Ihave stay'd so long.

90
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.630
Nay, Gloucester, know thatthou art come too soon,

91
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.100
Unless thou wert moreloyal than thou art:

92
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.070
I do arrest thee of hightreason here.

93
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.300
Well, Suffolk's Duke, thou shaltnot see me blush

94
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.830
Nor change my countenancefor this arrest:

95
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.170
The purest spring is notso free from mud

96
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.730
As I am clear from treasonto my sovereign:

97
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.470
Who can accuse me? whereinam I guilty?

98
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.830
'Tis thought, my lord, thatyou took bribes of France,

99
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.500
And, being protector,stayed the soldiers' pay;

100
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.370
By means whereof hishighness hath lost France.

101
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.870
Is it but thought so? whatare they that think it?

102
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.630
I never robb'd thesoldiers of their pay,

103
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.800
Nor ever had one pennybribe from France.

104
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.700
No; many a pound of mineown proper store,

105
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.800
Because I would not taxthe needy commons,

106
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.530
Have I disbursed to thegarrisons,

107
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.130
And never ask'd forrestitution.

108
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.430
It serves you well, mylord, to say so much.

109
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.570
I say no more than truth,so help me God!

110
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.200
In your protectorship youdid devise

111
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.830
Strange tortures foroffenders never heard of,

112
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.870
That England was defamedby tyranny.

113
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.630
Why, 'tis well known that,whiles I was protector,

114
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.870
Pity was all the faultthat was in me;

115
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.730
For I should melt at anoffender's tears,

116
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.800
And lowly words wereransom for their fault.

117
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.500
My lord, these faults areeasy, quickly answered:

118
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.200
But mightier crimes arelaid unto your charge,

119
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.100
Whereof you cannot easilypurge yourself.

120
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.400
I do arrest you in hishighness' name;

121
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.000
And here commit you to mylord cardinal

122
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.900
To keep, until yourfurther time of trial.

123
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.230
My lord of Gloucester,'tis my special hope

124
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.300
That you will clearyourself from all suspense:

125
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.030
My conscience tells me youare innocent.

126
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.630
Ah, gracious lord, thesedays are dangerous:

127
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:33.070
Virtue is choked with foulambition

128
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.670
And charity chased henceby rancour's hand;

129
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.400
Foul subornation ispredominant

130
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.430
And equity exiled yourhighness' land.

131
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.830
I know their complot is tohave my life,

132
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.670
And if my death might makethis island happy,

133
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.800
And prove the period oftheir tyranny,

134
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.730
I would expend it with allwillingness:

135
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.430
But mine is made theprologue to their play;

136
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.230
For thousands more, thatyet suspect no peril,

137
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.330
Will not conclude theirplotted tragedy.

138
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.570
Beaufort's red sparkling eyesblab his heart's malice,

139
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.500
And Suffolk's cloudy browhis stormy hate;

140
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.470
Sharp Buckinghamunburthens with his tongue

141
00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.930
The envious load that liesupon his heart;

142
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.030
And dogged York, thatreaches at the moon,

143
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.000
Whose overweening arm Ihave pluck'd back,

144
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
By false accuse doth levelat my life:

145
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.170
And you, my sovereignlady, with the rest,

146
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.070
Causeless have laiddisgraces on my head,

147
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.170
And with your bestendeavour have stirr'd up

148
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:53.730
My liefest liege to bemine enemy:

149
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.500
Ay, all you have laid yourheads together--

150
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.430
Myself had notice of yourconventicles--

151
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.670
And all to make away myguiltless life.

152
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:08.100
I shall not want falsewitness to accuse me,

153
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.470
Nor store of treasons toaugment my guilt;

154
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.700
The ancient proverb willbe well effected:

155
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.930
'A staff is quickly foundto beat a dog.'

156
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.200
My liege, his raging isintolerable:

157
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.070
He'll wrest the sense andhold us here all day:

158
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.830
Lord cardinal, he is yourprisoner.

159
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:29.000
Sirs, take away the duke,and guard him sure.

160
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.200
Ah! thus King Henry throwsaway his crutch

161
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.870
Before his legs be firm tobear his body.

162
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.370
Thus is the shepherdbeaten from thy side,

163
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:50.930
And wolves are gnarlingwho shall gnaw thee first.

164
00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.270
Ah, that my fear werefalse! ah, that it were!

165
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:08.000
For, good King Henry, thydecay I fear.

166
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.100
My lords, what to yourwisdoms seemeth best,

167
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.930
Do or undo, as if ourselfwere here.

168
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.500
What, will your highnessleave the parliament?

169
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.670
Ay, Margaret; my heart isdrown'd with grief,

170
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.330
Whose flood begins to flowwithin mine eyes,

171
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.000
My body round engirt withmisery,

172
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.230
For what's more miserablethan discontent?

173
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.900
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thyface I see

174
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.600
The map of honour, truthand loyalty:

175
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.400
What louring star nowenvies thy estate,

176
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.800
That these great lords andMargaret our queen

177
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.130
Do seek subversion of thyharmless life?

178
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.500
Thou never didst themwrong, nor no man wrong;

179
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.970
And as the butcher takesaway the calf

180
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.070
And binds the wretch, andbeats it when it strays,

181
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.400
Bearing it to the bloodyslaughter-house,

182
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.830
Even so remorseless havethey borne him hence;

183
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.300
And as the dam runs lowingup and down,

184
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.970
Looking the way herharmless young one went,

185
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.830
And can do nought but wailher darling's loss,

186
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.500
Even so myself bewailsgood Gloucester's case

187
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.000
With sad unhelpful tears,and with dimm'd eyes

188
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.770
Look after him and cannotdo him good,

189
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.900
So mighty are his vowedenemies.

190
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.830
His fortunes I will weep;and, 'twixt each groan

191
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.170
Say 'Who's a traitor?Gloucester he is none.'

192
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:52.500
Free lords, cold snow meltswith the sun's hot beams.

193
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.930
Henry my lord is cold ingreat affairs,

194
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.200
Too full of foolish pity,and Gloucester's show

195
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.270
Beguiles him as themournful crocodile

196
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.170
With sorrow snaresrelenting passengers,

197
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:12.470
Believe me, lords, werenone more wise than I--

198
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.930
And yet herein I judgemine own wit good--

199
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.100
This Gloucester should bequickly rid the world,

200
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.670
To rid us of the fear wehave of him.

201
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.430
That he should die isworthy policy;

202
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.270
But yet we want a colourfor his death:

203
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.970
'Tis meet he be condemn'dby course of law.

204
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.230
But, in my mind, that wereno policy:

205
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.800
The king will labour stillto save his life,

206
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.730
The commons haply rise, tosave his life;

207
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.070
And yet we have buttrivial argument,

208
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.900
More than mistrust, thatshows him worthy death.

209
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.300
So that, by this, youwould not have him die.

210
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:58.300
Ah, York, no man alive sofain as I!

211
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.230
'Tis York that hath morereason for his death.

212
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.400
But, my lord cardinal, andyou, my Lord of Suffolk,

213
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.570
Say as you think, andspeak it from your souls,

214
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.770
Were't not all one, anempty eagle were set

215
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.170
To guard the chicken froma kite,

216
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:19.030
As place Duke Humphrey forthe king's protector?

217
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:25.130
So the poor chicken shouldbe sure of death.

218
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.530
Madam, 'tis true; andwere't not madness, then,

219
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.700
To make the fox surveyorof the fold?

220
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.530
No; let him die, in thathe is a fox,

221
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.000
By nature proved an enemyto the flock,

222
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.330
And do not stand onquillets how to slay him:

223
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.230
Be it by gins, by snares,by subtlety,

224
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.730
Sleeping or waking, 'tisno matter how,

225
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.370
So he be dead; for that isgood deceit

226
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.870
Which mates him first thatfirst intends deceit.

227
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.300
Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tisresolutely spoke.

228
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.570
Not resolute, except somuch were done;

229
00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.170
For things are often spokeand seldom meant:

230
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.330
But that my heartaccordeth with my tongue,

231
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.170
Seeing the deed ismeritorious,

232
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.200
And to preserve mysovereign from his foe,

233
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.570
Say but the word, and Iwill be his priest.

234
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.100
But I would have him dead,my Lord of Suffolk,

235
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.600
Ere you can take dueorders for a priest:

236
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.230
Say you consent andcensure well the deed,

237
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.630
And I'll provide hisexecutioner,

238
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.430
I tender so the safety ofmy liege.

239
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:36.630
Here is my hand, the deedis worthy doing.

240
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.070
And so say I.

241
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.300
And I and now we threehave spoke it,

242
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.930
It skills not greatly whoimpugns our doom.

243
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.270


244
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.930
From Irelandam I come amain,

245
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.630
To signify that rebelsthere are up

246
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.730
And put the Englishmenunto the sword:

247
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.200
Send succors, lords, andstop the rage betime,

248
00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.600
Before the wound do growuncurable;

249
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.270
For, being green, there isgreat hope of help.

250
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.970
A breach that craves aquick expedient stop!

251
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.300
What counsel give you inthis weighty cause?

252
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.370
That Somerset be sent asregent thither:

253
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.400
'Tis meet that lucky rulerbe employ'd;

254
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.970
Witness the fortune hehath had in France.

255
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.400
If York, with all hisfar-fet policy,

256
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.130
Had been the regent thereinstead of me,

257
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.500
He never would have stay'din France so long.

258
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.670
No, not to lose it all, asthou hast done:

259
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.700
I rather would have lostmy life betimes

260
00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.730
Than bring a burthen ofdishonour home

261
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:43.570
By staying there so longtill all were lost.

262
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:48.830
Show me one scarcharacter'd on thy skin:

263
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.700
Men's flesh preserved sowhole do seldom win.

264
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.430
Nay, then, this spark willprove a raging fire,

265
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.370
If wind and fuel bebrought to feed it with:

266
00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.930
No more, good York; sweetSomerset, be still:

267
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:05.970
Thy fortune, York, hadstthou been regent there,

268
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.770
Might happily have provedfar worse than his.

269
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.570
What, worse than nought?nay, then, a shame take all!

270
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.230
And, in the number, theethat wishest shame!

271
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:21.430
My Lord of York, try whatyour fortune is.

272
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.730
The uncivil kerns ofIreland are in arms

273
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.900
And temper clay with bloodof Englishmen:

274
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.870
To Ireland will you lead aband of men,

275
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.030
Collected choicely, fromeach county some,

276
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:37.130
And try your hap againstthe Irishmen?

277
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.630
I will, my lord, so pleasehis majesty.

278
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.300
Why, our authority is hisconsent,

279
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.070
And what we do establishhe confirms:

280
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.070
Then, noble York, takethou this task in hand.

281
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.100
I am content: provide mesoldiers, lords,

282
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.330
Whiles I take order formine own affairs.

283
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.900
A charge, Lord York, thatI will see perform'd.

284
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.400
But now return we to thefalse Duke Humphrey.

285
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.430
No more of him; for I willdeal with him

286
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.870
That henceforth he shalltrouble us no more.

287
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.570
And so break off; the dayis almost spent:

288
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.670
Lord, you and Imust talk of that event.

289
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.930
My Lord of Suffolk, withinfourteen days

290
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.500
At Bristol I expect mysoldiers;

291
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.100
For there I'll ship themall for Ireland.

292
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.970
I'll see it truly done, myLord of York.

293
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:37.230
Now, York, or never, steelthy fearful thoughts,

294
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.500
And change misdoubt intoresolution:

295
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:45.230
Be that thou hopest to be, orwhat thou art resign to death;

296
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.770
it is not worth the enjoying:

297
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.600
Let pale-faced fear keepwith the mean-born man,

298
00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:00.200
And find no harbour in aroyal heart.

299
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.800
Faster than spring-time showerscomes thought on thought,

300
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:09.730
And not a thought butthinks on dignity.

301
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.330
My brain more busy thanthe labouring spider

302
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.570
Weaves tedious snares totrap mine enemies.

303
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.430
Well, nobles, well, 'tispoliticly done,

304
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.030
To send me packing with anhost of men:

305
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.570
I fear me you but warm thestarved snake,

306
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:35.130
Who, cherish'd in your breasts,will sting your hearts.

307
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.970
'Twas men I lack'd and youwill give them me:

308
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:45.530
I take it kindly; and yetbe well assured

309
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:51.400
You put sharp weapons in amadman's hands.

310
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:08.670
Whiles I in Irelandnourish a mighty band,

311
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.730
I will stir up in Englandsome black storm

312
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:17.000
Shall blow ten thousandsouls to heaven or hell;

313
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.530
And this fell tempestshall not cease to rage

314
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.600
Until the golden circuiton my head,

315
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.270
Like to the glorious sun'stransparent beams,

316
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:32.930
Do calm the fury of thismad-bred flaw.

317
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.330
And, for a minister of myintent,

318
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.930
I have seduced aheadstrong Kentishman,

319
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.200
John Cade of Ashford,

320
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.470
To make commotion, as fullwell he can,

321
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.230
Under the title of JohnMortimer.

322
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.330
That devil here shall bemy substitute;

323
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.830
For that John Mortimer,which now is dead,

324
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.670
In face, in gait, inspeech, he doth resemble:

325
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:03.430
By this I shall perceivethe commons' mind,

326
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.930
How they affect the houseand claim of York.

327
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.700
Say that he be taken, rack'dand tortured,

328
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.130
I know no pain they caninflict upon him

329
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.600
Will make him say I movedhim to these arms.

330
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.230
Say that he thrive, as'tis great like he will,

331
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:27.030
Why, then from Irelandcome I with my strength

332
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.800
And reap the harvest whichthat rascal sow'd;

333
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.730
For Humphrey being dead,as he shall be,

334
00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:44.030
And Henry put apart, thenext for me.

335
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.470
Run to my Lord of Suffolk;let him know

336
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.300
We have dispatch'd theduke, as he commanded.

337
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.770
O that it were to do! Whathave we done?

338
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.270
Didst ever hear a man sopenitent?

339
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.770
Here comes my lord.

340
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.430
Now, sirs, have youdispatch'd this thing?

341
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.000
Ay, my good lord, he'sdead.

342
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.870
Why, that's well said. Go,get you to my house;

343
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.300
I will reward you for thisventurous deed.

344
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.570
The king and all the peersare here at hand.

345
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.130
Have you laid fair thebed? Is all things well,

346
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:15.200
According as I gavedirections?

347
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.470
'Tis handsome, my lord.

348
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.570
Away! be gone.

349
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:26.270
(trumpets playing)

350
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.370
Go, call our uncle to ourpresence straight;

351
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.230
Say we intend to try hisgrace to-day.

352
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.400
If he be guilty, as 'tispublished.

353
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.800
I'll call him presently,my noble lord.

354
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.130
Lords, take your places;and, I pray you all,

355
00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.570
Proceed no straiter 'gainstour uncle Gloucester

356
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.870
Than from true evidence ofgood esteem

357
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.870
He be approved in practiseculpable.

358
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:51.970
God forbid any maliceshould prevail,

359
00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.230
That faultless may condemna nobleman!

360
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:58.300
Pray God he may acquit himof suspicion!

361
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.470
I thank thee, Meg; thesewords content me much.

362
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.800
How now! why look'st thoupale? why tremblest thou?

363
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.970
Where is our uncle? what'sthe matter, Suffolk?

364
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.800
Dead in his bed, my lord;Gloucester is dead.

365
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.670
Marry, God forfend!

366
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.270
God's secret judgment: Idid dream to-night

367
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.800
The duke was dumb andcould not speak a word.

368
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.930
How fares my lord? Help,lords! the king is dead.

369
00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:39.930
Rear up his body; wringhim by the nose.

370
00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:45.870
Go, run, help, help! OHenry, ope thine eyes!

371
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.870
He doth revive again:madam, be patient.

372
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.530
O heavenly God!

373
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:51.200
How fares my gracious lord?

374
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.470
Comfort, my sovereign!gracious Henry, comfort!

375
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.470
What, doth my Lord ofSuffolk comfort me?

376
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.830
Came he right now to singa raven's note,

377
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.800
Whose dismal tune bereftmy vital powers;

378
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.630
And thinks he that thechirping of a wren,

379
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.670
By crying comfort from ahollow breast,

380
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.030
Can chase away thefirst-conceived sound?

381
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.000
Hide not thy poison withsuch sugar'd words;

382
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.470
Lay not thy hands on me;forbear, I say;

383
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.200
Their touch affrights meas a serpent's sting.

384
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.670
Thou baleful messenger,out of my sight!

385
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.670
Look not upon me, forthine eyes are wounding:

386
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.970
Yet do not go: come,basilisk,

387
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.230
And kill the innocentgazer with thy sight;

388
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.430
For in the shade of deathI shall find joy;

389
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.100
In life but double death,now Gloucester's dead.

390
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.800
Why do you rate my Lord ofSuffolk thus?

391
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:42.200
Although the duke wasenemy to him,

392
00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.530
Yet he most Christian-likelaments his death:

393
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.900
And for myself, foe as hewas to me,

394
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.970
Might liquid tears orheart-offending groans

395
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.830
Or blood-consuming sighsrecall his life,

396
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.300
I would be blind withweeping, sick with groans,

397
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.800
Look pale as primrose withblood-drinking sighs,

398
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.100
And all to have the nobleduke alive.

399
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:13.200
What know I how the worldmay deem of me?

400
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.930
For it is known we werebut hollow friends:

401
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:19.700
It may be judged I madethe duke away;

402
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.170
So shall my name withslander's tongue be wounded,

403
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.970
And princes' courts befill'd with my reproach.

404
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.170
This get I by his death:ay me, unhappy!

405
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.100
To be a queen, and crown'dwith infamy!

406
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.000
Ah, woe is me forGloucester, wretched man!

407
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.370
Be woe for me, morewretched than he is.

408
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:44.170
What, dost thou turn awayand hide thy face?

409
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:49.330
I am no loathsome leper;look on me.

410
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.430
What! art thou, like theadder, waxen deaf?

411
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:57.330
Be poisonous too and killthy forlorn queen.

412
00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:06.730
Is all thy comfort shut inGloucester's tomb?

413
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.970
Why, then, dame Margaretwas ne'er thy joy.

414
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.130
Erect his statue andworship it,

415
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.970
And make my image but analehouse sign.

416
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.870
Was I for this nighwreck'd upon the sea

417
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.530
And twice by awkward windfrom England's bank

418
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:29.370
Drove back again unto mynative clime?

419
00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:33.530
What boded this, but wellforewarning wind

420
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:38.130
Did seem to say 'Seek nota scorpion's nest,

421
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:43.200
Nor set no footing on thisunkind shore'?

422
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.870
What did I then, butcursed the gentle gusts

423
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.930
And he that loosed themforth their brazen caves:

424
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:56.230
And bid them blow towardsEngland's blessed shore,

425
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.170
Or turn our stern upon adreadful rock

426
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.900
Yet AEolus would not be amurderer,

427
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.000
But left that hatefuloffice unto thee:

428
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.500
The pretty-vaulting searefused to drown me,

429
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.330
Knowing that thou wouldsthave me drown'd on shore,

430
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:16.470
With tears as salt as sea,through thy unkindness:

431
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.730
The splitting rocks cower'din the sinking sands

432
00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.670
And would not dash me withtheir ragged sides,

433
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:28.070
Because thy flinty heart,more hard than they,

434
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:33.400
Might in thy palace perishMargaret.

435
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.400
As far as I could ken thychalky shores,

436
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.570
When from thy shore thetempest beat us back,

437
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.100
I stood upon the hatchesin the storm,

438
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.370
And when the dusky skybegan to rob

439
00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:53.600
My earnest-gaping sight ofthy land's view,

440
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.230
I took a costly jewel frommy neck,

441
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.870
A heart it was, bound inwith diamonds,

442
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:06.600
And threw it towards thyshore: the sea received it,

443
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.630
And so I wish'd thy bodymight my heart:

444
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:17.470
And even with this I lostfair England's view

445
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.670
And bid mine eyes bepacking with my heart

446
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.200
And call'd them blind anddusky spectacles,

447
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.830
For losing ken of Albion'swished coast.

448
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.970
How often have I temptedSuffolk's tongue,

449
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.430
The agent of thy foulinconstancy,

450
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:41.070
To sit and witch me, asAscanius did

451
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:43.500
When he to madding Didowould unfold

452
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.370
His father's actscommenced in burning Troy!

453
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:54.870
Am I not witch'd like her?or thou not false like him?

454
00:27:54.870 --> 00:28:03.000
Ay me, I can no more! die,Margaret!

455
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.900
For Henry weeps that thoudost live so long.

456
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:18.130
(angry crowd makes noiseoutside)

457
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.870
It is reported, mightysovereign,

458
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.970
That good Duke Humphreytraitorously is murder'd

459
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.900
By Suffolk and theCardinal Beaufort's means.

460
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.400
(crowd) Ay!

461
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.530
The commons, like an angryhive of bees

462
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.830
That want their leader,scatter up and down

463
00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.930
And care not who theysting in his revenge.

464
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.670
Myself have calm'd theirspleenful mutiny,

465
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:50.970
Until they hear the orderof his death.

466
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.070
That he is dead, goodWarwick, 'tis too true;

467
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.370
But how he died God knows,not Henry:

468
00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.700
his chamber, view hisbreathless corpse,

469
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.030
And comment then upon hissudden death.

470
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.900
That shall I do, my liege.Stay, Salisbury,

471
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.200
With the rude multitudetill I return.

472
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.830
O Thou that judgest allthings, stay my thoughts,

473
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.830
My thoughts, that labourto persuade my soul

474
00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:23.600
Some violent hands werelaid on Humphrey's life!

475
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.800
If my suspect be false,forgive me God,

476
00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.330
For judgment only dothbelong to thee.

477
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:37.130
Come hither, gracioussovereign, view this body.

478
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.130
That is to see how deep mygrave is made;

479
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.370
For with his soul fled allmy worldly solace,

480
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.630
For seeing him I see mylife in death.

481
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.730
As surely as my soul intendsto live with that dread King

482
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.670
that took our state upon him

483
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:24.270
To free us from hisfather's wrathful curse,

484
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.800
I do believe that violenthands were laid

485
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.300
Upon the life of thisthrice-famed duke.

486
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.830
A dreadful oath, swornwith a solemn tongue!

487
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.130
What instance gives LordWarwick for his vow?

488
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.500
See how his face is black andfull of blood.

489
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.770
His eye-balls further outthan when he lived,

490
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.570
Staring full ghastly likea strangled man;

491
00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:02.630
His hair uprear'd, his nostrilsstretched with struggling;

492
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:05.630
His hands abroad display'd,as one that grasp'd

493
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:11.070
And tugg'd for life andwas by strength subdued:

494
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:20.230
Look, on the sheets hishair you see, is sticking;

495
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.470
His well-proportion'd beardmade rough and rugged,

496
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.900
Like to the summer's cornby tempest lodged.

497
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.170
It cannot be but he wasmurder'd here;

498
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.770
The least of all thesesigns were probable.

499
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.370
Why, Warwick, who shoulddo the duke to death?

500
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:42.100
Myself and Beaufort hadhim in protection;

501
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.930
And we, I hope, sir, areno murderers.

502
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.170
But both of you were vow'dDuke Humphrey's foes,

503
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.000
And you, forsooth, had thegood duke to keep:

504
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:52.900
'Tis like you would notfeast him like a friend;

505
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.030
And 'tis well seen hefound an enemy.

506
00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:58.570
Then you, belike, suspectthese noblemen

507
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.630
As guilty of DukeHumphrey's timeless death.

508
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.700
Who finds the heifer deadand bleeding fresh

509
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.470
And sees fast by a butcherwith an axe,

510
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:13.330
But will suspect 'twas hethat made the slaughter?

511
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.200
Who finds the partridge inthe puttock's nest,

512
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.700
But may imagine how thebird was dead,

513
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.570
Although the kite soarwith unbloodied beak?

514
00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.430
Are you the butcher,Suffolk? Where's your knife?

515
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:30.070
Is Beaufort term'd a kite?Where are his talons?

516
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.570
I wear no knife toslaughter sleeping men;

517
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.100
But here's a vengefulsword, rusted with ease,

518
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.630
That shall be scoured inhis rancorous heart

519
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.430
That slanders me withmurder's crimson badge.

520
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.400
Say, if thou darest, proudLord of Warwick-shire,

521
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.500
That I am faulty in DukeHumphrey's death.

522
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.970
What dares not Warwick, iffalse Suffolk dare him?

523
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.600
He dares not calm hiscontumelious spirit

524
00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.170
Nor cease to be anarrogant controller,

525
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.300
Though Suffolk dare himtwenty thousand times.

526
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:03.530
Madam, be still; withreverence may I say;

527
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.900
For every word you speakin his behalf

528
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:10.170
Is slander to your royaldignity.

529
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.100
Blunt-witted lord, ignoblein demeanor!

530
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.070
If ever lady wrong'd herlord so much,

531
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.630
Thy mother took into herblameful bed

532
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:22.570
Some stern untutor'dchurl, and noble stock

533
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.930
Was graft with crab-treeslip; whose fruit thou art,

534
00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.300
And never of the Nevils'noble race.

535
00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.430
But that the guilt ofmurder bucklers thee

536
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.330
And I should rob thedeathsman of his fee,

537
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.200
Quitting thee thereby often thousand shames,

538
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.300
And that my sovereign'spresence makes me mild,

539
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.270
I would, false murderouscoward, on thy knee

540
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.370
Make thee beg pardon forthy passed speech,

541
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.730
And say it was thy motherthat thou meant'st

542
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.370
That thou thyself was bornin bastardy;

543
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.630
And after all this fearfulhomage done,

544
00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.730
Give thee thy hire andsend thy soul to hell,

545
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:02.770
Pernicious blood-sucker ofsleeping men!

546
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.430
Thou shall be waking wellI shed thy blood,

547
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.370
If from this presence thoudarest go with me.

548
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.100
Away even now, or I willdrag thee hence:

549
00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.770
Unworthy though thou art,I'll cope with thee

550
00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:18.730
And do some service toDuke Humphrey's ghost.

551
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.500
What stronger breastplatethan a heart untainted!

552
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.130
Thrice is he armed thathath his quarrel just,

553
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:32.630
And he but naked, thoughlock'd up in steel

554
00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.200
Whose conscience withinjustice is corrupted.

555
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.870
(crowd makes noise inbackground)

556
00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.430
What noise is this?

557
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.700
Why, how now, lords!

558
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.130
Your wrathful weapons drawnHere in our presence!

559
00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.100
Dare you be so bold?

560
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.200
The traitorous Warwickwith the men of Bury

561
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.630
Set all upon me, mightysovereign.

562
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.370
[To the Commons, entering]Sirs, stand apart;

563
00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.730
The king shall know yourmind.

564
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:08.530
Dread lord, the commonssend you word by me,

565
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.600
Unless false Suffolkstraight be done to death,

566
00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.700
Or banished fair England'sterritories,

567
00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.230
They will by violence tearhim from your palace

568
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:20.870
And torture him withgrievous lingering death.

569
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:24.570
They say, by him the goodDuke Humphrey died;

570
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.570
They say, in him they fearyour highness' death;

571
00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:30.370
And mere instinct of loveand loyalty,

572
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.770
Makes them thus forward inhis banishment.

573
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.970
They say, in care of yourmost royal person,

574
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.970
That if your highnessshould intend to sleep

575
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.870
And charge that no manshould disturb your rest

576
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.230
In pain of your dislike orpain of death,

577
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.170
Yet, notwithstanding sucha strait edict,

578
00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:49.470
Were there a serpent seen,with forked tongue,

579
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.270
That slily glided towardsyour majesty,

580
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.330
It were but necessary youwere waked,

581
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.370
And therefore do they cry,though you forbid,

582
00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.500
That they will guard you,whether you will or no,

583
00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.870
From such fell serpents asfalse Suffolk is,

584
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.770
With whose envenomed andfatal sting,

585
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.630
Your loving uncle, twentytimes his worth,

586
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.370
They say, is shamefullybereft of life.

587
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:16.970
(crowd chants) An answer fromthe king, my Lord of Salisbury!

588
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:20.200
'Tis like the commons,rude unpolish'd hinds,

589
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.470
Could send such message totheir sovereign:

590
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.600
But you, my lord, wereglad to be employ'd,

591
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.230
To show how quaint anorator you are:

592
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.200
But all the honourSalisbury hath won

593
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.830
Is that he was the lordambassador

594
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.430
Sent from a sort oftinkers to the king.

595
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.330
(crowd chants) Ananswer from the king,

596
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.770
or we will all break in!

597
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.130
Go, Salisbury, and tellthem all from me.

598
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.070
I thank them for theirtender loving care;

599
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:46.900
And had I not been citedso by them,

600
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.900
Yet did I purpose as theydo entreat;

601
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.530
For, sure, my thoughts dohourly prophesy

602
00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.930
Mischance unto my state bySuffolk's means:

603
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:58.930
And therefore, by Hismajesty I swear,

604
00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.800
Whose far unworthy deputyI am,

605
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.700
He shall not breatheinfection in this air

606
00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.470
But three days longer, onthe pain of death.

607
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:13.470
O Henry, let me plead forgentle Suffolk!

608
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.900
Ungentle queen, to callhim gentle Suffolk!

609
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.370
No more, I say: if thoudost plead for him,

610
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.170
Thou wilt but add increaseunto my wrath.

611
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:23.070
Had I but said, I wouldhave kept my word,

612
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.900
But when I swear, it isirrevocable.

613
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.600
If, after three days' space,thou here be'st found

614
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.200
On any ground that I amruler of,

615
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.900
The world shall not beransom for thy life.

616
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:41.900
Come, Warwick, come, goodWarwick, go with me;

617
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.200
I have great matters toimpart to thee.

618
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.070
Mischance and sorrow goalong with thee!

619
00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:53.830
Heart's discontent andsour affliction

620
00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:57.700
Be playfellows to keep youcompany!

621
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.070
There's two of you; thedevil make a third!

622
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:06.470
And threefold vengeancetend upon your steps!

623
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.400
Cease, gentle queen, theseexecrations,

624
00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.600
And let thy Suffolk takehis heavy leave.

625
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:15.170
Fie, coward woman andsoft-hearted wretch!

626
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.430
Hast thou not spirit tocurse thine enemy?

627
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.370
A plague upon them! whereforeshould I curse them?

628
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.930
Would curses kill, as doththe mandrake's groan,

629
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:29.900
I would invent asbitter-searching terms,

630
00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.800
As curst, as harsh andhorrible to hear,

631
00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.770
Deliver'd strongly throughmy fixed teeth,

632
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.330
With full as many signs ofdeadly hate,

633
00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:42.800
As lean-faced Envy in herloathsome cave:

634
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.430
My tongue should stumblein mine earnest words;

635
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.970
Mine eyes should sparklelike the beaten flint;

636
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.330
Mine hair be fixed on end,as one distract;

637
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:58.070
Ay, every joint shouldseem to curse and ban:

638
00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.530
And even now my burthen'dheart would break,

639
00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:06.800
Should I not curse them.Poison be their drink!

640
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.770
Gall, worse than gall, thedaintiest that they taste!

641
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:17.530
Their softest shade agrove of cypress trees!

642
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:22.100
Their chiefest prospectmurdering basilisks!

643
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.430
Their softest touch assmart as lizards' sting!

644
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:29.330
Their music frightful asthe serpent's hiss,

645
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:34.070
And boding screech-owlsmake the concert full!

646
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:37.630
All the foul terrors indark-seated hell--

647
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:41.630
Enough, sweet Suffolk;thou torment'st thyself;

648
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.030
And these dread curses, likethe sun 'gainst glass,

649
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.400
Or like an overchargedgun, recoil,

650
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.470
And turn the force of themupon thyself.

651
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.730
You bade me ban, and willyou bid me leave?

652
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:59.730
Ay entreat theecease. O give me thy hand,

653
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.530
That I may dew it with mymournful tears;

654
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:13.330
O, could this kiss beprinted in thy hand,

655
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:17.930
That thou mightst thinkupon these by the seal,

656
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:24.800
Through whom a thousandsighs are breathed for thee!

657
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:32.400
So, get thee gone, that Imay know my grief;

658
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.870
'Tis but surmised whilesthou art standing by,

659
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:40.870
I will repeal thee, or, bewell assured,

660
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.870
Adventure to be banishedmyself:

661
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:48.030
And banished I am, if butfrom thee.

662
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:55.000
No; speak not to me; evennow be gone.

663
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.330
No. O' go not yet!

664
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:19.130
And yet farewell; andfarewell life with thee!

665
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:24.430
Thus is poor Suffolk tentimes banished;

666
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.270
Once by the king, and threetimes thrice by thee.

667
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:33.300
'Tis not the land I carefor, wert thou thence;

668
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.900
A wilderness is populousenough,

669
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.430
So Suffolk had thyheavenly company:

670
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:42.200
For where thou art, thereis the world itself,

671
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.170
With every severalpleasure in the world,

672
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:51.030
And where thou art not,desolation.

673
00:41:53.630 --> 00:42:00.430
I can no more: live thouto joy thy life;

674
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:05.030
Myself no joy in noughtbut that thou livest.

675
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.230
Wither goes Vaux so fast?what news, I prithee?

676
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.230
To signify unto hismajesty

677
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.430
That Cardinal Beaufort isat point of death;

678
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:19.500
For suddenly a grievoussickness took him,

679
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:24.200
That makes him gasp andstare and grasp the air,

680
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.370
Blaspheming God andcursing men on earth.

681
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:29.270
Sometimes he talks as ifDuke Humphrey's ghost

682
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.170
Were by his side; sometimehe calls the king,

683
00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.030
And whispers to hispillow, as to him,

684
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.170
The secrets of hisovercharged soul;

685
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.370
And I am sent to tell hismajesty

686
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.830
That even now he criesaloud for him.

687
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:45.570
Go tell this heavy messageto the king.

688
00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:59.470
Ay me! what is this world!what news are these!

689
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:06.430
Now get thee hence: the king,thou know'st, is coming;

690
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.570
If thou be found by me,thou art but dead.

691
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.970
If I depart from thee, Icannot live;

692
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.430
And in thy sight to die,what were it else

693
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.070
But like a pleasantslumber in thy lap?

694
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:19.830
Here could I breathe mysoul into the air,

695
00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:23.470
As mild and gentle as thecradle-babe

696
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:26.970
Dying with mother's dugbetween its lips:

697
00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:31.330
To die by thee were but todie in jest;

698
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:36.600
From thee to die weretorture more than death:

699
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:42.670
O, let me stay, befallwhat may befall!

700
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.530
Away! though parting be afretful corrosive,

701
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:50.270
It is applied to adeathful wound.

702
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:54.300
To France, sweet Suffolk:let me hear from thee;

703
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.470
For wheresoe'er thou artin this world's globe,

704
00:43:56.470 --> 00:44:01.570
I'll have an Iris thatshall find thee out. Away!

705
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:04.830
I go.

706
00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:06.430
And take my heart withthee.

707
00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.730
A jewel, lock'd into thewofull'st cask

708
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.370
That ever did contain athing of worth.

709
00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.500
Even as a splitted bark,so sunder we

710
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:29.130
This way fall I to death.

711
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:33.500
This way for me.

712
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.330
(horns sounding)

713
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:56.430
How fares my lord? speak,Beaufort, to thy sovereign.

714
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:03.530
If thou be'st death, I'll givethee England's treasure,

715
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:08.570
Enough to purchase suchanother island,

716
00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:16.300
So thou wilt let me live,and feel no pain.

717
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.100
Ah, what a sign it is ofevil life,

718
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.600
Where death's approach isseen so terrible!

719
00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:33.530
Beaufort, it is thysovereign speaks to thee.

720
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:40.470
Bring me unto my trialwhen thou will.

721
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.800
Died he not in his bed?where should he die?

722
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:52.970
Can I make men live,whether they will or not?

723
00:45:52.970 --> 00:46:01.030
O, torture me no more! Iwill confess.

724
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:11.700
Alive again? then show mewhere he is:

725
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:20.270
I'll give a thousand poundto look upon him.

726
00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:34.500
He hath no eyes, the dusthath blinded them.

727
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:40.730
Comb down his hair; look,look! it stands upright,

728
00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:48.730
Like lime-twigs set tocatch my winged soul.

729
00:46:52.200 --> 00:47:02.300
Give me some drink; andbid the apothecary

730
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:19.230
Bring the strong poisonthat I bought of him.

731
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.400
O thou eternal Mover ofthe heavens.

732
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.530
Look with a gentle eyeupon this wretch!

733
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.600
O, beat away the busymeddling fiend

734
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.070
That lays strong siegeunto this wretch's soul.

735
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.100
And from his bosom purgethis black despair!

736
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.670
See, how the pangs ofdeath do make him grin!

737
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:39.430
Disturb him not; let himpass peaceably.

738
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:44.170
Peace to his soul, ifGod's good pleasure be!

739
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:47.200
Lord cardinal, if thouthink'st on heaven's bliss,

740
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.930
Hold up thy hand, makesignal of thy hope.

741
00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:03.400
He dies, and makes nosign. O God, forgive him!

742
00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.000
So bad a death argues amonstrous life.

743
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.900
Forbear to judge, for weare sinners all.

744
00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.470
Close up his eyes and drawthe curtain close;

745
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.830
And let us all tomeditation.

746
00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:29.500
