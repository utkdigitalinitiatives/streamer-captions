00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.970
Farwell young lords --these warlike principles

3
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.630
Do not throw from you:

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.970
and you, my lords,farewell:

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.230
Share the advicebetwixt you;

6
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.200
if both gain, all

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.070
The gift doth stretchitself as 'tis received,

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.870
And is enough for both.

9
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.930
'Tis our hope, sir, afterwell enter'd soldiers,

10
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.170
to return and find yourgrace in health.

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.500
No, no, it cannot be; andyet my heart

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.600
Will not confess he owesthe malady

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.770
That doth my life besiege.

14
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.200
Farewell, young lords;

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.130
Whether I live or die,

16
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.730
be you the sons of worthyFrenchmen:

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
Health, at your bidding,serve your majesty!

18
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.700
Those girls of Italy, takeheed of them:

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.170
They say, our French lacklanguage to deny,

20
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:19.600
If they demand: beware ofbeing captives,

21
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.200
Before you serve.

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.930
Our hearts receive yourwarnings.

23
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670
Farewell. Farwell,my lord.

24
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.930
O, my sweet lord, that youwill stay behind us!

25
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.500
'Tis not his fault,the spark.

26
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.800
O, 'tis brave wars!

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.530
Most admirable: I haveseen those wars.

28
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.330
I am commanded here, andkept a coil

29
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.230
with 'Too young' and 'thenext year'

30
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.530
and ''tis too early.'

31
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.070
An thy mind stand to't,boy, steal away bravely.

32
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.470
I shall stay here theforehorse to a smock,

33
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.570
Creaking my shoes on theplain masonry,

34
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.170
Till honour be bought upand no sword worn

35
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.530
But one to dance with! Byheaven, I'll steal away.

36
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.070
There's honour inthe theft.

37
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.200
Commit it, count.

38
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.470
I am your accessary; andso, farewell.

39
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.230
I grow to you, and ourparting

40
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.330
is a tortured body.

41
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.830
Farewell, captain.

42
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.170
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

43
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.070
Noble heroes, my sword andyours are kin.

44
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.700
Good sparks and lustrous,a word, good metals:

45
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.870
you shall find inthe regiment

46
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.370
of the Spinii one CaptainSpurio,

47
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.370
with his cicatrice, anemblem of war,

48
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.030
here on his sinistercheek;

49
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.570
it was this very swordentrenched it:

50
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.670
say to him, I live;

51
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.730
and observe his reportsfor me.

52
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.470
We shall, noble captain.

53
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.600
Mars dote on you for hisnovices!

54
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.200
what will ye do?

55
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.930
Stay: the king.

56
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.700
But, my good lord 'tisthus;

57
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.830
Will you be cured of yourinfirmity?

58
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.400
No.

59
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.300
O, will you eat no grapes,my royal fox?

60
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.730
Yes, but you will my noblegrapes,

61
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.930
an if my royal fox couldreach them:

62
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.200
I have seen a medicine

63
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.100
that's able to breathelife into a stone,

64
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.630
Quicken a rock, and makeyou dance canary

65
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.500
With spritely fireand motion;

66
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.800
whose simple touch,

67
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.970
Is powerful to araise KingPepin,

68
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.770
Nay, to give greatCharlemain a pen in's hand,

69
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.300
And write to her alove-line.

70
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.930
What 'her' is this?

71
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.930
Why, Doctor She: my lord,there's one arrived,

72
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.330
If you will see her:

73
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.630
now, by my faith andhonour,

74
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.630
If seriously I may conveymy thoughts

75
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.470
In this my lightdeliverance,

76
00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.470
I have spoke with onethat,

77
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.170
in her sex, her years,profession,

78
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.330
Wisdom and constancy, hathamazed me more

79
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.600
Than I dare blame myweakness: will you see her

80
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.030
For that is her demand,and know her business?

81
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.800
That done, laugh well atme.

82
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.900
Now, good Lafeu,

83
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.530
Bring in the admiration;

84
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.970
that we with thee mayspend our wonder too,

85
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.800
or take off thine by wonderinghow thou took'st it.

86
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.670
Nay, I'll fit you, and notbe all day neither.

87
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.030
Thus he his specialnothing ever prologues.

88
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.600
This is his majesty; sayyour mind to him:

89
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.930
A traitor you dolook like;

90
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.730
but such traitors hismajesty seldom fears:

91
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.400
I am Cressid's uncle, thatdare leave two together;

92
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.000
Fare you well.

93
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.600
Now, fair one, does yourbusiness follow us?

94
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.770
Ay, my good lord.

95
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.300
Gerard de Narbon was myfather;

96
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.170
In what he did profess,well found.

97
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.730
I knew him.

98
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.930
The rather will I spare mypraises towards him:

99
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.330
Knowing him is enough.

100
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.070
On's bed of death manyreceipts he gave me:

101
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.470
chiefly one.

102
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.530
Which, as the dearestissue of his practise,

103
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.000
And of his old experiencethe oily darling,

104
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.930
He bade me store up, as atriple eye,

105
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.100
Safer than mine own two,more dear; I have so;

106
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.600
And hearing your highmajesty is touch'd

107
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.130
With that malignant causewherein the honour

108
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.100
Of my dear father's giftstands chief in power,

109
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.170
I come to tender it and myappliance

110
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.070
With all bound humbleness.

111
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.430
We thank you, maiden;

112
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.770
But may not be socredulous of cure,

113
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.100
When our most learneddoctors leave us and

114
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.830
The congregated collegehave concluded

115
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.570
That labouring art cannever ransom nature

116
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.170
From her inaidible estate;

117
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.930
I say we must not so stainour judgment,

118
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.170
or corrupt our hope,

119
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.170
to prostitute our past-curemalady

120
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.770
To empirics, or todissever so

121
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.200
Our great self and ourcredit, to esteem

122
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.370
A senseless help when helppast sense we deem.

123
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.600
My duty then shall pay mefor my pains:

124
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.700
I will no more enforcemine office on you.

125
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.500
Humbly entreating fromyour royal thoughts

126
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.430
A modest one, to bear meback a again.

127
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.470
I cannot give thee less,to be call'd grateful:

128
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.030
Thou thought'st to helpme; and such thanks I give

129
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:04.430
As one near death to thosethat wish him live:

130
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.670
But what at full I know,thou know'st no part,

131
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.030
I knowing all my peril,thou no art.

132
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.100
What I can do can do nohurt to try,

133
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.330
Since you set up your rest'gainst remedy.

134
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.030
He that of greatest worksis finisher

135
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.300
Oft does them by theweakest minister:

136
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.700
So holy writ in babes hathjudgment shown,

137
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.530
When judges have beenbabes;

138
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.830
great floods have flown

139
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.630
From simple sources, andgreat seas have dried

140
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.730
When miracles have by thegreatest been denied.

141
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.200
Oft expectation fails andmost oft there

142
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.970
Where most it promises,and oft it hits

143
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.500
Where hope is coldest anddespair most fits.

144
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.100
I must not hear thee; farethee well, kind maid;

145
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.230
Thy pains not used must bythyself be paid:

146
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.070
Dear sir, to my endeavoursgive consent;

147
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.170
Of heaven, not me, make anexperiment.

148
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.230
I am not an impostor thatproclaim

149
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.630
Myself against the levelof mine aim;

150
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.430
But know I think and thinkI know most sure

151
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.430
My art is not past powernor you past cure.

152
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.270
Are thou so confident?

153
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.530
Within what space hopestthou my cure?

154
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.300
The great'st grace lendinggrace

155
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.000
Ere twice the horses ofthe sun shall bring

156
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.870
Their fiery torcher hisdiurnal ring,

157
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.400
Ere twice in murk andoccidental damp

158
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.600
Moist Hesperus hathquench'd his sleepy lamp,

159
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.670
Or four and twenty timesthe pilot's glass

160
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:52.030
Hath told the thievishminutes how they pass,

161
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.100
What is infirm from yoursound parts shall fly,

162
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.930
Health shall live free andsickness freely die.

163
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.870
Upon thy certainty andconfidence

164
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.770
What darest thou venture?

165
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.130
Tax of impudence,

166
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.900
A strumpet's boldness, adivulged shame

167
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.100
Traduced by odiousballads: my maiden's name

168
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.800
Sear'd otherwise; nay,worse--if worse--extended

169
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.430
With vilest torture let mylife be ended.

170
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:34.930
Methinks in thee someblessed spirit doth speak

171
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.500
His powerful sound withinan organ weak:

172
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.170
And what impossibilitywould slay

173
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:49.400
In common sense, sensesaves another way.

174
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.400
Thy life is dear; for allthat life can rate

175
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.630
Worth name of life in theehath estimate,

176
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:08.770
Youth, beauty, wisdom,courage, all

177
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:14.370
That happiness and primecan happy call:

178
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.570
Thou this to hazard needsmust intimate

179
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:27.500
Skill infinite ormonstrous desperate.

180
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.900
Sweet practiser, thyphysic I will try,

181
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.270
That ministers thine owndeath if I die.

182
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.430
If I break time, or flinchin property

183
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.870
Of what I spoke, unpitiedlet me die,

184
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.500
And well deserved: nothelping, death's my fee;

185
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:52.370
But, if I help, what doyou promise me?

186
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.670
Make thy demand.

187
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.430
But will you make it even?

188
00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.870
Ay, by my sceptre and myhopes of heaven.

189
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.270
Then shalt thou give mewith thy kingly hand

190
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:08.270
What husband in thy powerI will command:

191
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.630
Exempted be from me thearrogance

192
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.800
To choose from forth theroyal blood of France,

193
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.430
My low and humble name topropagate

194
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.630
With any branch or imageof thy state;

195
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.170
But such a one, thyvassal, whom I know

196
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.770
Is free for me to ask,thee to bestow.

197
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:33.300
Here is my hand; thepremises observed,

198
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:39.170
Thy will by my performanceshall be served:

199
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.970
So make the choice of thyown time, for I,

200
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:49.070
Thy resolved patient, onthee still rely.

201
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.400
More should I questionthee, and more I must,

202
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.870
Though more to know couldnot be more to trust,

203
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:03.000
From whence thou camest,how tended on: but rest

204
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Unquestion'd welcome andundoubted blest.

205
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.200
I shall now put you to theheight of your breeding.

206
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.170
I will show myself highlyfed and lowly taught:

207
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.200
I know my business is butto the court.

208
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.770
To the court! why, whatplace make you special,

209
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.170
when you put off that withsuch contempt?

210
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.470
But to the court!

211
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.200
Truly, madam, if God havelent a man any manners,

212
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.430
he may easily put it offat court:

213
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.870
he that cannot make a leg,put off's cap,

214
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.270
kiss his hand and saynothing,

215
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.330
has neither leg, hands,lip, nor cap;

216
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.970
and indeed such a fellow,to say precisely,

217
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.000
were not for the court;but for me,

218
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.670
I have an answer willserve all men.

219
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.670
Marry, that's a bountifulanswer that fits all questions.

220
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:07.230
From below your duke tobeneath your constable,

221
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.170
Ask me if I am a courtier:

222
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.430
it shall do you no harm tolearn.

223
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.670
To be young again, if wecould:

224
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:16.800
I will be a fool inquestion,

225
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.770
hoping to be the wiser byyour answer.

226
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.830
I pray you, sir, are you acourtier?

227
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.970
O Lord, sir! There's asimple putting off

228
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.530
More, more, a hundred ofthem.

229
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.100
I am a poor friend ofyours, that loves you.

230
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.170
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick,spare not me.

231
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.500
I think, sir, you can eatnone of this homely meat.

232
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.870
O Lord, sir! Nay, put meto't, I warrant you.

233
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.030
You were lately whipped,sir, as I think.

234
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:45.430
O Lord, sir! spare not me.

235
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.170
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!'at your whipping,

236
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.600
and 'spare not me?' Indeedyour 'Spare not me,!'

237
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.130
is very sequent to yourwhipping:

238
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.800
you would answer very wellto a whipping,

239
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.000
if you were but boundto't.

240
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.070
I ne'er had worse luck in mylife in my 'O Lord, sir!'

241
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.000
I see things may servelong, but not serve ever.

242
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.200
I play the noble housewifewith the time

243
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.600
To entertain't so merrilywith a fool.

244
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.670
O Lord, sir! why, there'tserves well again.

245
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.230
An end, sir; to yourbusiness.

246
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:18.400
Give Helen this, And urge herto a present answer back:

247
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.400
Commend me to my kinsmenand my son:

248
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.930
This is not much.

249
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.270
Not much commendation tothem.

250
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.200
Not much employment foryou: you understand me?

251
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.200
Most fruitfully:

252
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.630
I am there before my legs.

253
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.170
They say miracles arepast;

254
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.330
and we have ourphilosophical persons,

255
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.730
to make modern andfamiliar,

256
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.470
things supernatural andcauseless.

257
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.830
Hence is it that we maketrifles of terrors,

258
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.130
ensconcing ourselves intoseeming knowledge,

259
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.630
when we should submitourselves

260
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.830
to an unknown fear.

261
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.500
Why, 'tis the rarestargument of wonder

262
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.330
that hath shot out in ourlatter times.

263
00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:55.200
And so 'tis.

264
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.630
To be relinquish'd of theartists,--

265
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:57.400
So I say.

266
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.870
Both of Galen andParacelsus.

267
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.900
Of all the learned andauthentic fellows,--

268
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.170
Right; so I say.

269
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.570
That gave him outincurable,--

270
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.100
Why, there 'tis; so say Itoo.

271
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.030
Not to be helped,--

272
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.800
Right; as 'twere, a manassured of a--

273
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.700
Uncertain life, and suredeath.

274
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.230
Just, you say well; sowould I have said.

275
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.000
I may truly say, it is anovelty to the world.

276
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.170
It is, indeed: if you willhave it in showing,

277
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:20.370
you shall read it in--whatdo you call there?

278
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.770
A showing of a heavenlyeffect in an earthly actor.

279
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:26.830
That's it; I would havesaid the very same.

280
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.600
Why, your dolphin is notlustier:

281
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.570
'fore me, I speak inrespect--

282
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.600
Nay, 'tis strange, 'tisvery strange,

283
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.200
that is the brief and thetedious of it;

284
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.670
and he's of a mostfacinerious spirit

285
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.370
that will not acknowledgeit to be the--

286
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.470
Very hand of heaven.

287
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.630
Ay, so I say.

288
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.430
In a most weak--

289
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.400
and debile minister, greatpower,

290
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.230
great transcendence:

291
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.130
which should, indeed,

292
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.530
give us a further use tobe made

293
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.800
than alone the recovery ofthe king, as to be--

294
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.800
generally thankful.

295
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.370
I would have said it; yousay well.

296
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.230
Here comes the king.

297
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.300
Lustig, as the Dutchmansays:

298
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.200
I'll like a maid thebetter,

299
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.130
whilst I have a tooth inmy head:

300
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.630
why, he's able to lead hera coranto.

301
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.530
Mort du vinaigre! is notthis Helen?

302
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.500
'Fore God, I think so.

303
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.000

sure, they are bastards tothe English;

353
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.400
the French ne'er got 'em.

354
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.000
You are too young, toohappy, and too good,

355
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.330
To make yourself a son outof my blood.

356
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.870
Fair one, I think not so.

357
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.500
There's one grape yet;

358
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.130
I am sure thy father drunkwine:

359
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.300
but if thou be'st not anass,

360
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:30.870
I am a youth of fourteen;

361
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.870
I have known thee already.

362
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:45.130
I dare not say I take you;but I give

363
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.670
Me and my service, everwhilst I live,

364
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:55.930
Into your guiding power.This is the man.

365
00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.870
Why, then, young Bertram,take her; she's thy wife.

366
00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:15.530
My wife, my liege! I shallbeseech your highness,

367
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.970
In such a business give meleave to use

368
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.230
The help of mine own eyes.

369
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.930
Know'st thou not, Bertram,what she has done for me?

370
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.100
Yes, my good lord;

371
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.970
but never hope to know whyI should marry her.

372
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.330
Thou know'st she hasraised me

373
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.400
from my sickly bed.

374
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.600
But follows it, my lord,to bring me down

375
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.100
Must answer for yourraising?

376
00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.200
I know her well:

377
00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.770
She had her breeding at myfather's charge.

378
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.100
A poor physician'sdaughter my wife!

379
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.930
Disdain rather corrupt meever!

380
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.370
'Tis only title thoudisdain'st in her,

381
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.470
the which I can build up.

382
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.370
Strange is it thatour bloods,

383
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:58.600
In colour, weight, andheat, pour'd all together,

384
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.630
Would quite confounddistinction,

385
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.170
yet stand off indifferences so mighty.

386
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.070
If she be all that isvirtuous,

387
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.730
save what thou dislikest,

388
00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:10.200
A poor physician'sdaughter,

389
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.830
thou dislikest of virtuefor the name:

390
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.300
but do not so:

391
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.770
From lowest place whenvirtuous things proceed,

392
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:24.170
The place is dignified bythe doer's deed:

393
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.600
Where great additionsswell's, and virtue none,

394
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.030
It is a dropsied honour.Good alone

395
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.870
Is good without a name.Vileness is so:

396
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.900
The property by what it isshould go,

397
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:41.130
Not by the title. She isyoung, wise, fair;

398
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.170
In these to nature she'simmediate heir,

399
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.600
And these breed honour:

400
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.330
the mere word's a slave

401
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.630
Debosh'd on every tomb, onevery grave

402
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.370
A lying trophy, and as oftis dumb

403
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.630
Where dust and damn'doblivion is the tomb

404
00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:02.600
Of honour'd bones indeed.What should be said?

405
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.470
If thou canst like thiscreature as a maid,

406
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.830
I can create the rest:virtue and she

407
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:19.030
Is her own dower; honourand wealth from me.

408
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:22.800
I cannot love her, norwill strive to do't.

409
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.170
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thoushouldst strive to choose.

410
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.600
That you are well restored,my lord, I'm glad:

411
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600
Let the rest go.

412
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.270
My honour's at the stake;

413
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.670
which to defeat, I mustproduce my power.

414
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.230
Here, take her hand,

415
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.400
Proud scornful boy,unworthy this good gift;

416
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.430
That dost in vilemisprision shackle up

417
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:45.200
My love and her desert;that canst not dream,

418
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.400
We, poising us in herdefective scale,

419
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.170
Shall weigh thee to thebeam; that wilt not know,

420
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.870
It is in us to plant thinehonour where

421
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:59.070
We please to have it grow.Cheque thy contempt:

422
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.870
Obey our will, whichtravails in thy good:

423
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.600
Believe not thy disdain,but presently

424
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.800
Do thine own fortunes thatobedient right

425
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:13.170
Which both thy duty owesand our power claims;

426
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.370
Or I will throw thee frommy care for ever

427
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.100
Into the staggers and thecareless lapse

428
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.200
Of youth and ignorance;both my revenge and hate

429
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.700
Loosing upon thee, in thename of justice,

430
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.470
Without all terms of pity.

431
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.370
Speak; thine answer.

432
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:42.670
Pardon, my gracious lord;for I submit

433
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.300
My fancy to your eyes:when I consider

434
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.930
What great creation andwhat dole of honour

435
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:52.230
Flies where you bid it, Ifind that she, which late

436
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.300
Was in my nobler thoughtsmost base, is now

437
00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.770
The praised of the king;who, so ennobled,

438
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:03.570
Is as 'twere born so.

439
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.930
Take her by the hand,

440
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.930
And tell her she is thine:to whom I promise

441
00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.330
A counterpoise, if not tothy estate

442
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:14.000
A balance more replete.

443
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.830
I take her hand.

444
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.970
Good fortune and thefavour of the king

445
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.030
Smile upon this contract;whose ceremony

446
00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.130
Shall seem expedient onthe now-born brief,

447
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:29.770
And be perform'd to-night:the solemn feast

448
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.670
Shall more attend upon thecoming space,

449
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:37.200
Expecting absent friends.As thou lovest her,

450
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:43.200
Thy love's to mereligious; else, does err.

451
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.270
Your lord and masterdid well

452
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.200
to make his recantation.

453
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.770
Recantation! My lord! mymaster!

454
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.600
Ay; is it not a language Ispeak?

455
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.370
A most harsh one, and notto be understood

456
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.200
without bloody succeeding.My master!

457
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.130
Are you companion to theCount Rousillon?

458
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.430
To any count, to allcounts, to what is man.

459
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.800
To what is count's man:

460
00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.730
count's master is ofanother style.

461
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.200
You are too old, sir;

462
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.500
let it satisfy you, youare too old.

463
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.700
I must tell thee, sirrah,I write man;

464
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.270
to which title age cannotbring thee.

465
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.070
What I dare too well do, Idare not do.

466
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.270
I did think thee, for twoordinaries,

467
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.000
to be a pretty wisefellow;

468
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.600
thou didst make tolerablevent of thy travel;

469
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.770
it might pass: yet thescarfs and the

470
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.570
bannerets about thee

471
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.270
did manifoldly dissuademe

472
00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.800
from believing thee a vessel oftoo great a burthen.

473
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.270
I have now found thee;when I lose thee again,

474
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.430
I care not:

475
00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.670
Hadst thou not the privilegeof antiquity upon thee,--

476
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.570
Do not plunge thyself toofar in anger,

477
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.170
lest thou hasten thytrial; which if

478
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:02.200
Lord have mercy on theefor a hen!

479
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.800
So, my good window oflattice, fare thee well:

480
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.170
thy casement I need notopen,

481
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.130
for I look through thee.

482
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.670
Give me thy hand.

483
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.800
My lord, you give me mostegregious indignity.

484
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.700
Ay, with all my heart; andthou art worthy of it.

485
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.070
I have not, my lord,deserved it.

486
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.830
Yes, good faith, everydram of it;

487
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.400
and I will not bate thee ascruple.

488
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.400
Well, I shall be wiser.

489
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.230
Even as soon as thoucanst,

490
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.830
If ever thou be'st boundin thy scarf and beaten,

491
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.770
thou shalt find what it is

492
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.430
to be proud of thybondage.

493
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:36.070
My lord, you do me mostinsupportable vexation.

494
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.630
I would it were hell-painsfor thy sake,

495
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:42.600
and my poor doing eternal:for doing I am past:

496
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.970
as I will by thee,

497
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.970
in what motion age will giveme leave.

498
00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.570
Well, thou hast a son

499
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.070
shall take this disgraceoff me;

500
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:58.530
scurvy, old, filthy,scurvy lord!

501
00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.330
Well, I must be patient;

502
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.530
there is no fettering ofauthority.

503
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.400
I'll beat him, by my life,

504
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.830
if I can meet him with anyconvenience,

505
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.370
an he were double anddouble a lord.

506
00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.430
I'll have no more pity ofhis age than I would of--

507
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.270
I'll beat him, an if Icould but meet him again.

508
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:20.300
Sirrah, your lord andmaster's married;

509
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.730
there's news for you: youhave a new mistress.

510
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.970
I most unfeignedly beseechyour lordship

511
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.970
to make some reservationof your wrongs:

512
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.870
he is my good lord: whom Iserve above is my master.

513
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:32.030
Who? God?

514
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:32.830
Ay, sir.

515
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.900
The devil it is that's thymaster.

516
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.370
Why dost thou garter upthy arms o' this fashion?

517
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:45.070
dost make hose of sleeves?do other servants so?

518
00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:46.570
Thou wert best set thylower part

519
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:48.930
where thy nose stands.

520
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.870
By mine honour, if I werebut two hours younger,

521
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.030
I'ld beat thee:

522
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.700
methinks, thou art ageneral offence,

523
00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:55.870
and every man should beatthee:

524
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.130
I think thou wast createdfor men

525
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.300
to breathe themselvesupon thee.

526
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.270
This is hard and undeservedmeasure, my lord.

527
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.500
Go to, you are a vagabondand no true traveller:

528
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.430
you are more saucy with noblesand honourable personages

529
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:11.530
than the commission ofyour birth

530
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.930
and virtue gives youheraldry.

531
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.570
You are not worth anotherword,

532
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.570
else I'ld call you knave.

533
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.900
Undone, and forfeited tocares for ever!

534
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.900
What's the matter,sweet-heart?

535
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.770
Although before the solemnpriest I have sworn,

536
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.630
I will not bed her.

537
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.470
What, what, sweet-heart?

538
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:39.070
O my Parolles, they havemarried me!

539
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.600
I'll to the Tuscan wars,and never bed her.

540
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.470
France is a dog-hole, andit no more merits

541
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.600
The tread of a man's foot:to the wars!

542
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.770
There's letters from mymother:

543
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.630
what the import is, I knownot yet.

544
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:52.600
Ay, that would be known.

545
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.000
To the wars, my boy, tothe wars!

546
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.070
He wears his honour in abox unseen,

547
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.470
That hugs his kicky-wickyhere at home,

548
00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.000
Spending his manly marrowin her arms,

549
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.600
Which should sustain thebound and high curvet

550
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.600
Of Mars's fiery steed. Toother regions

551
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.370
France is a stable; wethat dwell in't jades;

552
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.970
Therefore, to the war!

553
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.400
It shall be so: I'll sendher to my house,

554
00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.270
Acquaint my mother with myhate to her,

555
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.230
And wherefore I am fled;write to the king

556
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.970
That which I durst notspeak; his present gift

557
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.870
Shall furnish me to thoseItalian fields,

558
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.470
Where noble fellowsstrike: war is no strife

559
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.370
To the dark house and thedetested wife.

560
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.530
Will this capriccio holdin thee? art sure?

561
00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:36.630
I'll send her straightaway: to-morrow

562
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.470
I'll to the wars, she toher single sorrow.

563
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:44.600
Why, these balls bound;there's noise in it.

564
00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.830
'Tis hard:

565
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.330
A young man married is aman that's marr'd:

566
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.270
My mother greets mekindly; is she well?

567
00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.330
She is not well; but yetshe has her health:

568
00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.000
she's very merry; but yetshe is not well:

569
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.030
but thanks be given,

570
00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:04.070
she's very well andwants nothing

571
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.930
in the world; but yet sheis not well.

572
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.130
If she be very well, whatdoes she ail,

573
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.530
that she's not very well?

574
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.830
Truly, she's very wellindeed,

575
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.630
but for two things.

576
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:16.930
What two things?

577
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.000
One, that she's not inheaven,

578
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.970
whither God send herquickly!

579
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.370
the other that she'sin earth,

580
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.770
from whence God send herquickly!

581
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.430
Bless you, my fortunatelady!

582
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.670
I hope, sir, I have yourgood will

583
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.430
to have mine own goodfortunes.

584
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.100
You had my prayers to leadthem on;

585
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:37.470
and to keep them on, havethem still.

586
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.000
O, my knave, how does myold lady?

587
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.300
So that you had herwrinkles and I her money,

588
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.530
I would she did asyou say.

589
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:46.000
Why, I say nothing.

590
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Marry, you are the wiserman;

591
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.400
for many a man's tongue shakesout his master's undoing:

592
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.700
to say nothing, to donothing, to know nothing,

593
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.330
and to have nothing,

594
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.830
is to be a great part ofyour title;

595
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.830
which is within a verylittle of nothing.

596
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.600
Away! thou'rt a knave.

597
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.070
You should have said, sir,before a knave

598
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.700
thou'rt a knave; that's,before me thou'rt a knave:

599
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.130
this had been truth, sir.

600
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:14.000
Go to, thou art a wittyfool; I have found thee.

601
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.600
Did you find me inyourself, sir?

602
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.930
or were you taught to findme?

603
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.030
The search, sir, wasprofitable;

604
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.030
and much fool may you findin you,

605
00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.700
even to the world'spleasure

606
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.700
and the increaseof laughter.

607
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:39.900
A good knave, i' faith,and well fed.

608
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.500
Madam, my lord will goaway to-night;

609
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.070
A very serious businesscalls on him.

610
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.070
The great prerogative andrite of love,

611
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.600
Which, as your due, timeclaims,

612
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.930
he does acknowledge;

613
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.670
But puts it off to acompell'd restraint;

614
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:55.500
Whose want, and whosedelay,

615
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.970
is strew'd with sweets,

616
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:00.070
Which they distil now inthe curbed time,

617
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.500
To make the coming houro'erflow with joy

618
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.530
And pleasure drownthe brim.

619
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.400
What's his will else?

620
00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.270
That you will take yourinstant leave o' the king

621
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.830
And make this haste asyour own good proceeding,

622
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.500
Strengthen'd with whatapology you think

623
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.330
May make it probable need.

624
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:15.800
What more commands he?

625
00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:17.430
That, having thisobtain'd, you presently

626
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.730
Attend his furtherpleasure.

627
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.970
In every thing I wait uponhis will.

628
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.970
I shall report it so.

629
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.970
But I hope your lordshipthinks not him a soldier.

630
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.330
Yes, my lord, and of veryvaliant approof.

631
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.800
You have it from his owndeliverance.

632
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.670
And by other warrantedtestimony.

633
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.870
Then my dial goes nottrue:

634
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.430
I took this lark fora bunting.

635
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.130
I do assure you, my lord,

636
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.700
he is very great inknowledge

637
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.000
and accordingly valiant.

638
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.600
I have then sinned againsthis experience and

639
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.370
transgressed against hisvalour;

640
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.770
and my state that way isdangerous,

641
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:51.570
since I cannot yet find inmy heart to repent.

642
00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.600
Here he comes: I pray you,make us friends;

643
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.100
I will pursue the amity.

644
00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.070
Pray you, sir, who's histailor?

645
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.070
Sir?

646
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.700
O, I know him well, I,sir; he, sir,

647
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.000
he's a good workman, avery good tailor.

648
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:08.800
Is there any unkindness

649
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.730
between my lord and you,monsieur?

650
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.400
I know not how I havedeserved

651
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.900
to run into my lord'sdispleasure.

652
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.030
It may be you havemistaken him, my lord.

653
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.070
And shall do so ever,

654
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.530
though I took him at 'sprayers.

655
00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:23.630
Believe this of me,

656
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:27.170
there can be no kernel inthis light nut;

657
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.270
the soul of this man ishis clothes.

658
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.030
Trust him not in matter ofheavy consequence;

659
00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.370
Farewell, monsieur:

660
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.400
I have spoken better ofyou

661
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.500
than you have or will todeserve at my hand;

662
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500
but we must do goodagainst evil.

663
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.300
An idle lord. I swear.

664
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.570
I think not so.

665
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.930
Why, do you not know him?

666
00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.900
Yes, I do know him well,

667
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.170
and common speech giveshim a worthy pass.

668
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.130
Is she gone to the king?

669
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.170
She is.

670
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.370
Will she away tonight?

671
00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.070
As you will have her.

672
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.130
I have writ my letters,casketed my treasure,

673
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.330
Given order for ourhorses; and to-night,

674
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.530
When I should takepossession of the bride,

675
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:13.430
End ere I do begin.

676
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:16.100
Here comes my clog.

677
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:20.730
I have, sir, as I wascommanded from you,

678
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.500
Spoke with the king andhave procured his leave

679
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.670
For present parting;

680
00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.900
only he desires someprivate speech with you.

681
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.900
I shall obey his will.

682
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:33.230
You must not marvel,Helen, at my course,

683
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.170
Which holds not colourwith the time, nor does

684
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.600
The ministration andrequired office

685
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.200
On my particular. PreparedI was not

686
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.000
For such a business;therefore am I found

687
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.330
So much unsettled: thisdrives me to entreat you

688
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:48.830
That presently you takeour way for home;

689
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:50.970
And rather muse than askwhy I entreat you,

690
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:52.630
For my respects are betterthan they seem

691
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.270
And my appointments havein them a need

692
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:56.330
Greater than shows itselfat the first view

693
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.330
To you that know them not.

694
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.200
This to my mother:

695
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.470
'Twill be two days ere Ishall see you, so

696
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.770
I leave you to yourwisdom.

697
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.030
Sir, I can nothing say,

698
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:10.430
But that I am your mostobedient servant.

699
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:11.400
Come, come, no more ofthat.

700
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.330
And ever shall

701
00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:13.970
With true observance seekto eke out that

702
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.370
Wherein toward me myhomely stars have fail'd

703
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:18.000
To equal my great fortune.

704
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.970
Let that go:

705
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.370
My haste is very great:farewell; hie home.

706
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.970
Pray, sir, your pardon.

707
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.870
Well, what would you say?

708
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.370
I am not worthy of thewealth I owe,

709
00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:32.400
Nor dare I say 'tis mine,and yet it is;

710
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.900
But, like a timorousthief,

711
00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.600
most fain would steal

712
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.600
What law does vouchmine own.

713
00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.930
What would you have?

714
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:49.070
Something; and scarce somuch: nothing, indeed.

715
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.900
I would not tell you whatI would, my lord:

716
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.330
Faith yes;

717
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.870
Strangers and foes dosunder, and not kiss.

718
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.600
I pray you, stay not, butin haste to horse.

719
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:18.430
I shall not break yourbidding, good my lord.

720
00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.970
Go thou toward home; whereI will never come

721
00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:31.600
Whilst I can shake mysword or hear the drum.

722
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.800
Great Mars, I put myselfinto thy file

723
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.270
Make me but like mythoughts

724
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.130
and I shall prove a loverof thy drum,

725
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.300
hater of love

726
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:51.200
