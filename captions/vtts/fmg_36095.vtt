00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Narrator:
 PERHAPS THE MOST
 GROUND-BREAKING DISCOVERY

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
IN THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
WAS THE DEVELOPMENT
 OF PENICILLIN,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
ASUBSTANCE,
 WHICH UPON ITS DISCOVERY,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
WAS CALLED A TRUE MIRACLE.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
FINALLY,
 A DRUG HAD BEEN FOUND

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
WHICH COULD CURE PEOPLE

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
OF THE MOST DREADED
 INFECTIONS.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
AND ALTHOUGH
 SEVERAL PATHOGENIC BACTERIA

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
BECAME RESISTANT
 TO PENICILLIN,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
NEW TYPES OF ANTIBIOTICS
 WERE FOUND

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
TO SUPPRESS THESE ILLNESSES.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
HOWEVER, DUE TO ABUSE

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
AND AN OVER-CONSUMPTION
 OF PENICILLIN,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
MANY PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
 SOON OUTWITTED

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
THE MIRACLE DRUG.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
RESISTANT BACTERIA
 ARE GAINING GROUND,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
AND IN THE MEANWHILE,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
THE DEVELOPMENT
 OF NEW MEDICINES

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
HAS PRACTICALLY
 COME TO A HALT.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Man: ALLIED CASUALTIES
 IN NORMANDY

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
RECEIVED THE MOST EXPERT
 MEDICAL CARE

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
SCIENCE CAN PROVIDE.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
TWO MODERN TREATMENTS,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
PENICILLIN
 AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
HAVE CHEATED DEATH
 IN THOUSANDS OF CASES.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
GANGRENE, FROM WHICH MILLIONS
 HAVE PERISHED IN PAST WARS,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
HAS BEEN CONQUERED
 BY THE MIRACLE OF PENICILLIN.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
THOUSANDS OF MEN,
 THANKS TO PENICILLIN,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
WILL COME HOME
 TO THEIR THANKFUL FAMILIES.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
A WHOLE WORLD
 OF PEACE-TO-COME

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
WILL REAP THE BENEFITS

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
OF THIS GREAT, WARTIME,
 MEDICAL DISCOVERY.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
SCIENCE HAS WON
 ANOTHER VICTORY
 OVER DEATH.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
THROUGHOUT MOST
 OF HUMAN HISTORY,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
INFECTIOUS GERMS HAVE CAUSED
 DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
FOR CENTURIES,
 DEADLY DISEASES,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
SUCH AS THE PLAGUE,
 TUBERCULOSIS, AND GANGRENE

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
HAD BEFALLEN PEOPLE
 ALL OVER THE WORLD--

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE,
 IN CITIES,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
AND ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Robert Bud:
IF YOU GO BACK 100 YEARS,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
TO THE MID-19th CENTURY,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
MANY MORE SOLDIERS
DIED OF INFECTION

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
THAN DIED DIRECTLY
FROM THE EXPLOSIONS
OF CANNONS.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
BY WORLD WAR I,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
ALREADY THE SYSTEM
WAS CHANGING

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
BECAUSE THERE WAS
A PROCESS FOR HANDLING

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
INJURED SOLDIERS.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
BUT YOU COULDN'T
CURE INFECTION.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
YOU COULD PREVENT IT

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
BY BANDAGING SOLDIERS
QUICKLY.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
BUT OFTEN
THEY SUFFERED GANGRENE,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
AND MANY SOLDIERS
DIED FROM INFECTION.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
UNTIL THE BEGINNING
 OF THE 20th CENTURY,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
THE RISK OF INFECTION
 HAD MADE IT DIFFICULT

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
TO TREAT
 MANY TYPES OF DISEASES.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Glenn Morris:
THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEMS WITH INFECTIONS

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
THAT REALLY LIMITED A LOT

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
OF WHAT WE COULD DO
IN MEDICINE.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
FOR EXAMPLE,
STAPH INFECTIONS CAUSED

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
SIGNIFICANT INFECTIONS
IN CHILDREN AND NEWBORNS.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
THEY CONTAMINATED WOUNDS.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
SO, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
WHEN YOU WERE
IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
THERE WAS ALWAYS
THIS GREAT CONCERN

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
THAT THERE
WOULD BE INFECTION.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
AND SO, IN SOME CASES,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
YOU'D ALMOST RATHER
AMPUTATE THE LEG

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
THAN TAKE THE RISK THAT
THE INFECTION WOULD TAKE OFF.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
THE HUNT FOR MEDICINE

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
THAT CAN CURE
 DREADED DISEASES,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
SUCH AS SYPHILIS,
 GONORRHEA, AND PNEUMONIA,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE
 THE BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL
 THE END OF THE 19th CENTURY

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
THAT THE DISCOVERY OF HOW
 INFECTIOUS DISEASES ARE SPREAD

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
CAME ABOUT.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Stuart Levy:
IT WAS A BIG TURNING POINT
THAT IT WAS DISCOVERED

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
THAT SINGLE MICROBES
WOULD CAUSE THE DISEASE.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
AND THE THOUGHT WAS THERE
THAT IF WE COULD FIND

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
WHAT WAS THEN
CALLED BY PAUL EHRLICH,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
"A MAGIC BULLET"--

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
SOMETHING THAT
WOULD ENTER THE BODY

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
AND SEEK OUT THE INVADERS,
NAMELY, THE BACTERIA--

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
THEN WE COULD CURE
THE PATIENT

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
WITHOUT HARMING THE PATIENT.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
AT THE BEGINNING
 OF THE 20th CENTURY,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
GERMAN DOCTOR PAUL EHRLICH
 DEVELOPED A SUBSTANCE

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
SIMILAR TO ARSENIC
 WITH WHICH TO TREAT

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
PATIENTS WITH SYPHILIS.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
HOWEVER, THIS PROVED
 TO BE TOXIC

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
AND HAD STRONG SIDE-EFFECTS.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
THEN, IN 1928,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
SCOTTISH DOCTOR
 ALEXANDER FLEMING

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
ACCIDENTALLY STUMBLED UPON
 A COMPLETELY NEW MEDICINE.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
ONE DAY, WHILST WORKING
 WITH BACTERIAL CULTURES,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
FLEMING DISCOVERED
 A SPOT OF MOLD.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
IT WASN'T UNUSUAL
 FOR PETRI DISHES

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
TO BE POLLUTED BY FUNGUS,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
BUT THE ODD THING
 WAS THAT THE BACTERIA

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
AROUND THE MOLD
 HAD DISAPPEARED.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
FLEMING FOUND, THIS FUNGUS
 KNOWN AS PENICILLIN,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
COULD PREVENT THE GROWTH
 OF DANGEROUS BACTERIA,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
SUCH AS STAPHYLOCOCCI
 AND ANTHRAX.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
EXPERIMENTS ON RABBITS
 SHOWED THAT PENICILLIN

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
WAS APPARENTLY HARMLESS,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
BUT FLEMING
 DIDN'T SUCCEED IN PROVING

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
THAT THE SUBSTANCE HAD
 A CURATIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLE.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
THIS HAPPENED
 OVER 13 YEARS LATER,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
AND PENICILLIN WAS THEN
 MASS-PRODUCED

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Man: THROUGH
 MASS-PRODUCTION METHODS,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
AMERICA IS CONTINUALLY
 INCREASING ITS OUTPUT

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
OF PENICILLIN,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
THE NEW DRUG THAT EFFECTS
 ALMOST MIRACULOUS CURES.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
THE LIQUID MEDIUM
 IN THESE BOTTLES

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
WILL GROW THE MOLD
 THAT FORMS PENICILLIN.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
ALL PENICILLIN PRODUCED

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
IS USED BY
 THE ALLIED FIGHTING FORCES.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THE LIQUID,
 NOW CHARGED WITH PENICILLIN,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
IS POURED FROM THE BOTTLES,
 TURNED INTO A POWDER...

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
IT IS READY FOR USE.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THE MANUFACTURE OF PENICILLIN

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
HAD GREAT SIGNIFICANCE
 DURING WORLD WAR II.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ON THE COVER OF TIME MAGAZINE
 IN MAY 1944,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
IT SAID
 THAT FLEMING'S MEDICINE

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
"WOULD SAVE MORE LIVES
 THAN THE WAR COULD SPEND."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
PENICILLIN WAS WIDELY USED
 TO SAVE THE LIVES OF SOLDIERS

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
SUFFERING FROM SEPTICEMIA,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
BUT ALSO TO CURE
 DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISEASE

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
AMONG SOLDIERS.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
EVERY TIME
THERE'S A WAR,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
THE VENEREAL DISEASE
RATE TAKES A JUMP.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
IN PEACE TIME, BUT...

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
NOW IT'S
LIKE A FOREST FIRE.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
NO ORGANIZATION
OF SABOTEURS COULD DO

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
HALF THIS DAMAGE
TO OUR ARMY.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTIC
DISEASES... OF SOLDIERS

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
ARE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED
DISEASES.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
IF YOU IMAGINE
EUROPE IN 1945,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
STARVING WOMEN,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
MILLIONS OF SOLDIERS--

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
YOUNG MEN SEPARATED
FROM THEIR GIRLFRIENDS,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
FROM THEIR WIVES--

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
THERE WAS THE BEGINNING
OF A TERRIBLE SYPHILIS EPIDEMIC.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
WE AVERAGE 30 VENEREAL
DISEASE CASES EACH YEAR

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
OUT OF EVERY
1,000 MEN
IN UNIFORM.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
THAT MEANS 300,000 MEN
PUT OUT OF ACTION EACH YEAR

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
IN A 10-MILLION-MAN ARMY.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
( chuckles )
THINK OF THAT,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
300,000 CASUALTIES
WITHOUT EVEN A BATTLE.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Robert: YOU COULD
REASONABLY SAY,
I'M SUR--

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
AND I BELIEVE THIS
TO BE SURE,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
THAT HAD THERE
 NOT BEEN PENICILLIN,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
THEN SYPHILIS
WOULD'VE BEEN FOR EUROPE

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
WHAT AIDS LATER BECAME
FOR AFRICA.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
AND THAT MEMORY
OF THIS WONDER DRUG

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
IS VERY IMPORTANT
IN UNDERSTANDING WHY LATER,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
WE CAME TO ASSUME
THAT PENICILLIN

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
WOULD SOLVE EVERY
ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
IN THE POST-WAR ERA,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
A LONG LINE
 OF NEW ANTIBIOTICS

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
THAT COULD CURE
 MANY MAJOR DISEASES

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
WAS DEVELOPED.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
STREPTOMYCIN, FOR EXAMPLE,
 CURES TUBERCULOSIS,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
AND TETRACYCLINE
 IS USED TO TREAT PNEUMONIA.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
IN JUST UNDER 30 YEARS,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
THE MORTALITY RATE
 OF YOUNG PATIENTS

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
SUFFERING FROM PNEUMONIA
 FELL TENFOLD.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Stuart: WHEN ANTIBIOTICS
WERE INTRODUCED,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THERE WAS A SHARP DECLINE

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
IN THE LOSS OF LIFE

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
AND HOSPITALIZATION
OF PATIENTS

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
WITH PNEUMONIAS,
URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
SKIN INFECTIONS...

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I THINK IT HAD A ENORMOUS,
ENORMOUS EFFECT,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
AND I THINK THIS IS WHY

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
MANY IN THE
CLINICAL MEDICINE FIELD

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
BELIEVE THAT ANTIBIOTICS
ARE ONE OF THE TREASURES

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
THAT WE HAVE
IN OUR ARMAMENTARIUM
TO TREAT PATIENTS.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
OF COURSE,
THEN IT IS USED

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
NOT JUST
FOR THE GRAVELY ILL,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
BUT FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
THOSE IRRITATING ILLNESSES
WHICH WE HAVE EVERY DAY.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
THE IRRITATING INFECTIONS,
THE SORE THROATS,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
THE SORE FINGERS,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
AND OF COURSE,
MAYBE EVEN...

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
WE THINK THESE
WILL NOT ONLY

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
MAKE MY LIFE LONGER,
BUT ALSO HAPPIER.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
( David Rose's
"The Stripper" plays )

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Woman: NOXZEMA MEDICATED SHAVE.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Stuart: IN FACT,
YOU COULD GET PENICILLIN
IN FACE CREAMS.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
YOU COULD GET IT
IN COSMETICS.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
AND THE EFFECT OF THAT,
OF COURSE,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
WAS IF YOU HAD
A SMALL INFECTION,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
IT WOULD WORK,
BUT BASICALLY,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
THE WHOLE IDEA
THAT WAS CONCEIVED

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
WAS THAT THIS
WAS A MIRACLE DRUG

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
FOR MANY DIFFERENT AILMENTS.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
IN THE LATE 1940s,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
A NEW PROPERTY OF ANTIBIOTICS
 WAS DISCOVERED

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
WHICH HAD GREAT INFLUENCE
 ON THE PRODUCTION

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
OF PIGS, CHICKENS,
 AND OTHER LIVESTOCK.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Stuart:
ONE OF THE MANUFACTURERS

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
OF A TETRACYCLINE,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
WHICH COMES
FROM A SOIL ORGANISM,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
HAD THIS HUGE POUNDS
AND POUNDS AND POUNDS

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
OF THE PROTEIN LEFT OVER
FROM THE ORGANISM

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
AFTER THEY HAD EXTRACTED
THEIR TETRACYCLINE.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
AND THEY WONDERED

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
IF IT COULDN'T BE
PUT TO SOME USE,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
SUCH AS BEING USED
AS FEED FOR CHICKENS

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
AND OTHER ANIMALS.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
WHEN THEY ADDED THIS...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
CARCASSES OF BACTERIA
TO THE NORMAL FEED,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
THEY FOUND THAT THE ANIMALS
GREW BIGGER FOR LESS FEED.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
AND THE DISCOVERERS
THOUGHT THEY HAD FOUND

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
A NEW VITAMIN.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
( chickens clucking )

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Henrik Wegener:
RATHER EARLY ON,
THEY REALIZED THAT

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
IT WAS ACTUALLY
THE FACT THAT
THERE WAS STILL

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
ANTIBIOTICS LEFT
IN THIS PRODUCT

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
THAT MADE THE ANIMALS
GROW FASTER.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
AND I-IT
WAS THEN REALIZED

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
THAT IF THEY JUST ADDED,
UH, LOW AMOUNTS--

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
FAIRLY LOW AMOUNTS
OF ANTIBIOTICS TO THE FEED

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
THROUGHOUT THE LIFE
OF THE ANIMAL,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
IT WOULD GROW FASTER

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
THAN WOULD
OTHERWISE BE THE CASE.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
SO, ANTIBIOTICS
VERY QUICKLY BECAME
A PRODUCTION TOOL.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
NOT A MEDICINE.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
IT WAS NOT
EVEN TALKED ABOUT

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
OR SEEN AS A MEDICINE.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Stuart: IT CHANGED
THE INDUSTRY OVERNIGHT.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
ANIMAL PRODUCERS WORLDWIDE

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
BEGAN TO SEEK OUT

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
ANTIBIOTICS TO ADD
BACK TO THE FEED

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
OR BUY IT ALREADY IN IT.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
AND NO ONE WAS
PARTICULARLY CONCERNED

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE DOING

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
OUTSIDE THE ANIMAL.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
( chickens clucking )

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
IN THE 1950s,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
THE SALES OF ANTIBIOTICS
 BECAME BIG BUSINESS,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
AND THOUSANDS OF TONS
 WERE USED TO COMBAT DISEASES.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
AND IN LIVESTOCK,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
IT WAS USED
 AS A GROWTH PROMOTER.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
THE MIRACLE DRUG,
 HOWEVER,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
BEGAN TO HAVE ITS DRAWBACKS.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Glenn: FAIRLY SOON
AFTER THEIR INTRODUCTION,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
THERE WAS A SMALL CLOUD
ON THE HORIZON,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
IN THAT, INITIALLY,
STAPHYLOCOCCI,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
UM, WHICH
WERE ONE OF THE...

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
BACTERIA--
ONE OF THE GROUPS
OF BACTERIA

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THAT ONE WAS
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
IN TERMS OF SERIOUS WOUNDS
AND WOUND INFECTIONS,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
BEGAN TO SHOW
RESISTANCE TO PENICILLIN.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
 COULD APPARENTLY

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
BECOME RESISTANT
 TO PENICILLIN.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
BACK IN 1945,
 IN THE NEW YORK TIMES,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ALEXANDER FLEMING
 WARNED AGAINST

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
THE UNCONTROLLED USE
 OF PENICILLIN,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
AND ALSO POINTED OUT
 THAT TAKING TOO SMALL A DOSE

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
MADE A GOOD BREEDING GROUND,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
AS BACTERIA COULD SURVIVE
 SMALL DOSES.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
NO ONE TOOK NOTICE
 OF FLEMING'S WARNING,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE 1960's

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
THAT PEOPLE REALIZED
 THE MIRACLE DRUG COULD FAIL.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Robert: LATE IN 1967,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
THERE WAS A SMALL OUTBREAK

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
OF AN E. COLI
IN THE CHILDREN'S WARD

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
IN A HOSPITAL
IN NORTHEAST OF ENGLAND
IN MIDDLESBROUGH.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
ELEVEN CHILDREN DIED.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
ALMOST ALL OF THEM,
VERY WEAK.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
THEY HAD BEEN BORN
PREMATURELY.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
AND AS FAR AS THE MEDICAL
PROFESSION WAS CONCERNED,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
THIS WAS NOT EITHER UNUSUAL
OR TERRIFYING.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
IT WAS DISTURBING
BECAUSE THE E. COLI

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
WHICH KILLED THESE CHILDREN
WAS RESISTANT TO ANTIBIOTICS.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
AND THE PRESS IN 1967

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
REALIZED
THE PUBLIC DID NOT KNOW

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
THAT CHILDREN WERE DYING
IN BRITISH HOSPITALS
OF E. COLI.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
THIS BECAME
A TERRIBLE SCANDAL.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
AND E. S. ANDERSON,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
A VERY ACTIVE SCIENTIST
WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH
LABORATORY,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
WARNED THAT IT
WAS CONCEIVABLE--

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
HE COULDN'T PROVE IT--
BUT IT WAS POSSIBLE

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
THAT THE RESISTANCE
WHICH E. COLI HAD ACQUIRED

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
HAD BEEN DEVELOPED
IN ANIMALS.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
SO, THAT,
HERE WAS AN EXAMPLE

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
POSSIBLY A WARNING

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
OF A MUCH WORSE
EPIDEMIC TO COME.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
DUE TO PUBLIC CONCERN,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT
 SET UP A COMMITTEE

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE USE
 OF ANTIBIOTICS IN LIVESTOCK

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
COULD INCREASE THE GROWTH

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
OF RESISTANT
 PATHOGENIC BACTERIA.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Henrik:
THE SWAN COMMITTEE

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
CAME UP WITH SOME
VERY BOLD CONCLUSIONS

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
THAT ANIMALS
WERE A SOURCE

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
OF RESISTANT
BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
IN HUMANS,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
AND THAT THE USE
OF ANTIBIOTICS
IN THE ANIMALS

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
DID MAKE THE BACTERIA
IN THE ANIMALS
RESISTANT.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
SO THEY...

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
ACTUALLY CLAIMED,
AND TO SOME EXTENT,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
PROVED A LINK BETWEEN
THE USE OF ANTIBIOTICS
IN ANIMALS

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
AND RESISTANT BACTERIA
IN HUMANS.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
THE SWAN COMMITTEE'S
 RECOMMENDATIONS

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
BROUGHT ABOUT A BAN,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
FIRST, IN ENGLAND,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
AND LATER,
 IN OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
IN HUSBANDRY,
 FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
OF ANTIBIOTICS WERE BANNED,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
AS THEY ARE VITAL
 IN COMBATING HUMAN DISEASES.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
BUT THE USE OF OTHER TYPES
 OF ANTIBIOTICS

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
AS GROWTH PROMOTERS
 IN LIVESTOCK

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
CONTINUED TO RISE.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
IN THE EARLY 1970's,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
MORE AND MORE RESISTANT
 BACTERIA TYPES WERE FOUND.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
THE AGGRESSIVE STAPHYLOCOCCUS

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
HAD LONG SINCE
 SURVIVED PENICILLIN,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
BUT UP UNTIL THEN,
 NEW TYPES OF ANTIBIOTICS

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
HAD MANAGED TO SUPPRESS
 THIS MOST DANGEROUS BACTERIA.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Glenn:
BY THE TIME I RECEIVED
MY MEDICAL TRAINING

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
IN THE EARLY 1970's,
THERE WAS GENERAL ACCEPTANCE

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
THAT ONE NEVER USED
PENICILLIN FOR STAPHYLOCOCCI.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
ONE WOULD OCCASIONALLY
GET A PATIENT

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
WHO CAME IN
FROM THE COMMUNITY

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
WITH A STAPHYLOCOCCAL
INFECTION,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
THAT WAS
PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
BUT THAT WAS ALWAYS
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
THAT WAS REMARKABLE,
THAT YOU WOULD COMMENT ON...

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
"OH, LOOK!
WE GOT AN OLD, UH...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
"STAPHYLOCOCCI STRAIN
THAT, YOU KNOW,
IS STILL PEN-SENSITIVE."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
BUT WE HAD ANOTHER DRUG
THAT WAS, UH, YOU KNOW,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL
PENICILLIN DESIGN.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
AND SO, CONSEQUENTLY,
PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK
TOO MUCH ABOUT IT.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
BUT THERE WERE GROUNDS
 FOR CONCERN,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
FOR IN THE 1970's,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
DISEASES WHICH PREVIOUSLY
 HAD BEEN PARTLY SUPPRESSED

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
RETURNED.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
THE NUMBER OF CASES
 OF TUBERCULOSIS BEGAN TO RISE,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
AND GONORRHEA
 COULD NO LONGER BE CURED

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
BY MANY TYPES OF ANTIBIOTICS.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
MANY PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
 BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
OF MULTI-RESISTANCE.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Stuart: WELL, IF YOU HAVE
A COMMUNITY OF BACTERIA,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
OF WHICH ONE OR TWO
HAVE PICKED UP
A RESISTANCE TRAIT,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AND YOU ADD
THE ANTIBIOTIC,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
ONLY THOSE
WITH THE RESISTANCE
WILL SURVIVE,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
AND THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY
OF RESISTANT BACTERIA.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
AND YEAH, THEY ARE
KIND OF TRADING WEAPONS.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
IT'S ALMOST, YOU KNOW,
LIKE TRADING BASEBALL CARDS,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
IN WHICH YOU GIVE ME YOURS,
I GIVE YOU YOURS.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
BUT OFTEN, THEY DON'T
LOSE THE ONE THEY GIVE.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
THEY JUST MAKE ANOTHER COPY

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
AND GIVE IT
TO A NEXT BACTERIUM.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
THERE'S NO PURPOSE IN IT.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I MEAN, THIS IS ALL
EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
BUT YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT MILLIONS OF BACTERIA,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
YOU KNOW,
SITTING ON THE SPACE
OF A TIP OF A PIN!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
THEY CAN EXCHANGE
LOTS OF THINGS.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
AND THEN THEY SEPARATE OUT,
GROW AGAIN,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
AND IF THEY'RE CONFRONTED
WITH AN ANTIBIOTIC,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
THEY'LL SURVIVE
IF THEY'RE RESISTANT.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
AND THEY'LL DIE
IF THEY DON'T.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
ONE OF THE MOST DREADED
 BACTERIA,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
THE GOLDEN STAPHYLOCOCCUS
 AUREUS,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
HAD ALSO BECOME
 MULTI-RESISTANT.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
FOR SEVERAL YEARS,
 STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
WAS RESISTANT TO PENICILLIN,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
BUT NOW, THE BACTERIA
 COULD NOT BE SUPPRESSED

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
BY PENICILLIN'S SUCCESSOR,
 METHICILLIN.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
MRSA, OR "THE SUPER BUG,"
 AS IT'S ALSO CALLED,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
IS DREADED IN EVERY HOSPITAL,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
BECAUSE IT CAN SPREAD INFECTION
 DURING OPERATIONS,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
AND THEREBY DISRUPT
 PATIENT TREATMENT.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Glenn: YOU HAVE PATIENTS WHO
GO IN FOR WHAT SHOULD'VE--

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
SOMETHING THEY
LOOK FORWARD TO--

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
WHICH SHOULD
BE A HIP SURGERY,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
WHICH WILL LET THEM
WALK AGAIN WITH EASE,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
AND INSTEAD, THEY EMERGE,
YOU KNOW, MONTHS LATER,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
AFTER, YOU KNOW,
MONTHS OF ANTIBIOTICS,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
HOSPITALIZATION, THERAPY,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
WITH A TOTALLY
DYSFUNCTIONAL JOINT

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
AND COMPLETE DISABILITY.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I MEAN,
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
THESE ARE
DEVASTATING INFECTIONS,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AND THE INCREASING
PROBLEMS WITH TREATING THEM

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
CAN PARTICULARLY
FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS--

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
CAN BE DEVASTATING.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Man: ON TOP OF
 A MOTORCYCLE ACCIDENT,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
MRSA IS SOMETHING BOB RICE
 REALLY DIDN'T NEED.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
THE GERM, UM,
ALSO CAUSED INFECTIONS

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
IN OTHER AREAS
ON MANY OF THESE SITES

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
WHERE WE HAVE WHAT WE CALL

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
"THE DONOR SITES"
FOR PLASTIC SURGERY...

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
PLUS OTHER OPEN AREAS.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
AND INCLUDING, UM,
THE INTRAVENOUS, UH,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
ACCESS SITE THAT HE NEEDED,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
SO HE COULD RECEIVE
FLUIDS AND DRUGS,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
AND HE GOT AN INFECTION
ON WHAT WE CALL
"THE CENTRAL LINE,"

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
WHICH IS PLACED UP HERE,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
AND INTO ONE
OF THE LARGE VEINS.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
AND THEN HE DEVELOPED, UM,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
INFECTION IN HIS BLOODSTREAM
FROM THAT

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
THAT, UH,
REQUIRED ONGOING

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
AND QUITE PROLONGED
ANTIBIOTICS.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
ROGER PUDNEY
 WAS NOT SO LUCKY.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
AN ABSCESS IN ONE LEG

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
FROM A SUSPECTED
 SPIDER BITE

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
CHANGED HIS LIFE
 FOR THE WORST.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
FOR SIX MONTHS,
 HE WAS ISOLATED

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AND PUMPED FULL
 OF ANTIBIOTICS.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
BUTROGER PUDNEY
 LOST THE FIGHT.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
THE ONLY RECOURSE
 WAS AMPUTATION.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
MRSA BACTERIA QUICKLY SPREAD
 AROUND THE WORLD,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
MUCH TO THE CONCERN
 OF HEALTH AUTHORITIES,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
AS THERE WAS NOW
 A DIMINISHING NUMBER

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
OF NEW TYPES OF ANTIBIOTICS

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
WHICH COULD SUBSTITUTE
 PREVIOUS ONES.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
THE DRUG INDUSTRY
 HAD PRACTICALLY GIVEN UP

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
ON FINDING NEW TYPES
 OF ANTIBIOTICS.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
IT'S RISKY.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
I MEAN, THEY'VE
ALREADY LOOKED VERY HARD

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WITHOUT FINDING ANYONE,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
SO THE CHANCE THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO FIND

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
SOMETHING VERY EFFECTIVE

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
IS NOT AS HIGH
AS IT WAS IN THE PAST.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
AND ALSO, EVEN IF
THEY FIND A DRUG,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
GETTING IT APPROVED
IS A VERY LENGTHY

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
AND VERY COSTLY PROCESS

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
THAT ALSO HAS
A VERY HIGH RISK

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
OF NOT LEADING
TO A PRODUCT

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
THAT GOES TO MARKET
AT THE END OF THE DAY.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
SO INDUSTRY IS--IS PRONE
TO GO ANOTHER DIRECTION

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
WHERE THERE
IS MORE CHANCE
OF MAKING A PROFIT.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
THE DREADED
 MULTI-RESISTANT MRSA

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
COULD STILL BE WIPED OUT
 BY ONE ANTIBIOTIC,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
VANCOMYCIN,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
WHICH WAS ONE OF MEDICAL
 SCIENCE'S LAST BIG GUNS

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
TO BE FIRED
 AT ADVANCING BACTERIA.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
VANCOMYCIN, HOWEVER,
 ALSO HAD DRAWBACKS

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
WHEN TREATING
 ANOTHER BACTERIA STRAIN,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
NAMELY, THE LESS AGGRESSIVE
 ENTEROCOCCUS BACTERIA--

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT
 ENTEROCOCCI,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
OR VRE.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Glenn: WE PICKED UP
THE FIRST STRAIN
OF VRE IN 1989,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
AND WE SORT OF THOUGHT,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
YOU KNOW, AGAIN,
WHEN THESE THINGS SHOW UP,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
IT'S SORT OF AN ODDITY.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
YOU KNOW,
THE DIRECTOR OF THE LAB--

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
OF THE CLINICAL
MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
CALLED ME UP AND SAID,
"YOU KNOW, GUESS WHAT
WE FOUND?"

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
IT WAS SORT OF EXCITING,
FUN, NOVEL.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
UM, AND WE DIDN'T THINK
THAT MUCH ABOUT IT.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
UH, BUT THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
YOU KNOW,
OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
WE STARTED SEEING
MORE OF THEM,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
AND MORE OF THEM,
AND MORE OF THEM.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
AND IT STOPPED BEING
A NOVELTY,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
AND STARTED TO BECOME
A VERY SERIOUS MEDICAL PROBLEM.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Stuart:
UP TO THIS TIME,
VANCOMYCIN

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
WAS BEGINNING TO BE USED
TO TREAT THE STAPH AUREUS,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
WHICH WAS RESISTANT
TO MOST OTHER ANTIBIOTICS.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
SO, IT WAS A LIFE-SAVING
ANTIBIOTIC.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
SO, NOW, YOU SEE
ANOTHER BACTERIUM

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
CARRYING
VANCOMYCIN RESISTANCE.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
THAT WAS NOT GOOD.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
AND I CAN REMEMBER

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
THAT THERE WERE HOSPITALS
THAT HAD THE PROBLEM,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
BUT MANY THAT DID NOT.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
BUT BY THE MID-1990's,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
VIRTUALLY EVERY HOSPITAL
HAD VRE.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
WE HAD DEATHS
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
DUE TO VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT
ENTEROCOCCI.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
DEATHS WHERE
IF THE PATIENT
HAD BEEN INFECTED

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
WITH A SUSCEPTIBLE
ENTEROCOCCI,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
WE COULD'VE SAVED THEM.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
THESE WERE PATIENTS WHO

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
WE HAD DONE
HORRENDOUS THINGS TO,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
IN THE SENSE OF, YOU KNOW,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
THESE WERE PATIENTS WHO HAD
HAD CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
OR A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT,
OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
BUT AGAIN, WE HAD DONE
THE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
WITH THE ASSUMPTION
THAT WE COULD ALWAYS TREAT

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
WHATEVER INFECTION RESULTED.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
AND NOW SUDDENLY,
WE CAN NO LONGER GIVE PATIENTS

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
THAT REASSURANCE.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
WE CAN
NO LONGER TELL THEM,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
"DON'T WORRY
IF YOU BECOME INFECTED.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
WE CAN TREAT IT."

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
AND SO WE HAD DEATHS.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
IN JUST A FEW YEARS,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
VRE BACTERIA WERE WIDESPREAD.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
A STUDY OF
 AMERICAN HOSPITALS IN 1989

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
SHOWED THAT
 UNDER A HALF PERCENT

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
OF BACTERIA WERE RESISTANT,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
A FIGURE WHICH WOULD RISE,
 FOUR YEARS LATER,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
TO AN ASTOUNDING 
 TEN PERCENT.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
THE SPREAD OF VRE
 CAUSED MUCH CONCERN,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
EVEN MORE SO WHEN
 DANISH STUDIES SHOWED

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
THAT VRE BACTERIA DEVELOPED

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
DURING PIG AND CHICKEN
 PRODUCTION

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
BY A GROWTH PROMOTER THAT
 IS RELATED TO VANCOMYCIN.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
SO, RESISTANT BACTERIA
 IN ANIMALS

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
WERE RUINING THE EFFECT
 OF A VITAL DRUG FOR HUMANS.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Henrik:
THE USE OF AVOPARCIN

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
DID SELECT FOR...

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT
ENTEROCOCCI

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
IN SWINE PRODUCTION
AND IN POULTRY PRODUCTION,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
AND WE PROVED
THAT RESISTANCE GENES

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
THAT ENCODE RESISTANCE
IN THE BACTERIA

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
WERE THE SAME
IN THOSE ANIMALS

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
THAT COULD BE FOUND
IN THE FOOD

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
AND IN THE HUMANS.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
AND WE ALSO SHOWED
THAT RESISTANT
ENTEROCOCCI

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
COULD TRANSMIT
FROM ANIMALS TO FOOD,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
AND MOST LIKELY,
ALSO TO HUMANS.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
THE DANISH STUDIES
 RESULTED IN A BAN

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
BY THE EUROPEAN UNION.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
FIRST, AVOPARCIN
 WAS BANNED IN 1996,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
AND DURING THE NEXT TEN YEARS,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
ALL GROWTH PROMOTERS
 WERE SIMILARLY BANNED

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
NEVERTHELESS, THE DEVELOPMENT

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
OF RESISTANT BACTERIA
 DIDN'T STOP,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
WHICH FOR HOSPITALS
 PROVED TO BE A GRAVE PROBLEM.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
THE AMERICAN
 HEALTH AUTHORITIES ESTIMATED

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
THAT 1 IN EVERY 20 PATIENTS

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
BECAME INFECTED
 BY PATHOGENIC BACTERIA

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
WHILST IN HOSPITAL.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
RESISTANT BACTERIA
 QUICKLY SPREAD IN COUNTRIES

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
WHERE ANTIBIOTICS
 WERE ADMINISTERED

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
WITHOUT DOCTOR-CONSULTATION.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
AND IN COUNTRIES
 WHERE ANTIBIOTICS

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
WERE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
PATIENTS PRESSURED DOCTORS
 TO PRESCRIBE ANTIBIOTICS

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
EVEN WHEN
 IT WASN'T NECESSARY.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
 ESTIMATED THAT

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
IN THE TREATING
 OF BRONCHIAL INFECTIONS,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
UP TO 80% OF 
 ANTIBIOTIC USE

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
WAS COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Stuart: OVERUSE AND MISUSE

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
DOES NO PURPOSE

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
THERAPEUTICALLY.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
AND ALL IT DOES
IS RECRUIT MORE RESISTANCE.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
TREAT THE PATIENT,
GET HIM WELL,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
THAT'S IT.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
BUT IF YOU USE IT
FOR FIVE TIMES MORE
THAN IT'S NEEDED,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
OR YOU USE IT WHEN
THERE'S A COLD VIRUS

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
AND THERE'S NO BACTERIUM,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
IT'S A MISUSE THAT
DOES HAVE AN IMPACT,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
BECAUSE YOU WIPE OUT
THE SUSCEPTIBLE KINDS
OF BACTERIA,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
AND YOU ALLOW
THE RESISTANT ONES
TO TAKE OVER.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
( coughs )

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
RESISTANT PATHOGENIC BACTERIA
 HAVE RECENTLY BEEN CLASSIFIED

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S THREE
 GREATEST HEALTH PROBLEMS.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
ASTHE WORLD HEALTH
 ORGANIZATION STATES,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
"THE PIPELINE OF NEW DRUGS
 IS RUNNING DRY."

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
TODAY, OLD DISEASES ARE
 REEMERGING WITH A VENGEANCE,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
TUBERCULOSIS, FOR INSTANCE,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
IS NOW ONE OF THE WORLD'S
 BIGGEST KILLERS,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
WITH OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE
 DYING FROM IT EVERY YEAR,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
AND SOME OF THEM DYING

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
OF A NEW, MULTI-RESISTANT,
 TUBERCULOSIS BACTERIA.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Eva Nathanson:
WE THINK THAT THERE
ARE ABOUT HALF A MILLION

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
MULTI-DRUG-RESISTANT
TB CASES EVERY YEAR

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
AND THE ABSOLUTE
MOST DIFFICULT AREAS

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
IS THE COUNTRIES OF
THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
THE PROBLEM
IS MDRTB IN PRISONS.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
AND ONE OF THE REASONS
IS THAT PRISONERS,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
UH, ARE MALNOURISHED.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
THEY ARE VULNERABLE.
THEY MAY HAVE HIV.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
SO, THEY ARE VULNERABLE
TO GET TB.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
PRISONS ARE OVERCROWDED.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I MEAN, PEOPLE
LIVE IN SO SMALL AREAS,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
SO THEY HAVE
TO SLEEP IN SHIFTS.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
AND THAT MEANS THAT
IF SOMEONE HAS MDRTB,

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
IT IS TRANSMITTED
VERY RAPIDLY TO OTHERS.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
SO, THE PRISONS
IN THESE COUNTRIES

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
HAVE REALLY BEEN
THE SOURCE

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
OF THE MDRTB EPIDEMIC.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
THE SITUATION
IS REALLY, REALLY SCARY

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
IN THE FORMER
SOVIET UNION,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
AND ALSO
PLACES IN CHINA,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
WHERE THE RATES
ARE VERY, VERY HIGH.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
BUT WE MUST BE CAREFUL
ALL AROUND THE WORLD

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
BECAUSE TB DOESN'T STOP
AT BORDERS.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Glenn: FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
THE AGE OF ANTIBIOTICS,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
WE HAVE HAD,
UH, IF YOU WILL,
A FREE RIDE.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN
IS THAT

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
WE WILL BE MOVING INTO
WHAT HAS BEEN TERMED

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
THE POST-ANTIBIOTIC ERA,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
WHERE SUDDENLY
WE GO BACK TO THE WAY

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
WE WERE IN THE 1920s
AND 1930s,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
WHERE INFECTION
WAS THE KILLER.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Stuart:
FINDING NEW ANTIBIOTICS
IS NOT EASY.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
THE COMPANIES
THAT COULD DO IT

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
ARE NOT DOING IT.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
AND SO AS
RESISTANCE GETS WORSE,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
NEW DRUGS
ARE LAGGING BEHIND.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
THAT MAKES THE PROBLEM
EVEN WORSE.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Glenn: THE CONCERN
THAT I HAVE IS THAT

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
WHILE TODAY
I MAY BE TELLING YOU

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000
WE'RE HANGING
BY OUR FINGERNAILS,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I MAY BE TELLING YOU,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
HANGING ON ANYMORE.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
SUDDENLY,
I HAVE MICROORGANISMS

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
WHICH ARE NOT
ABLE TO BE TREATED

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
WITH THAT ONE LAST ANTIBIOTIC
THAT I HAVE LEFT.
