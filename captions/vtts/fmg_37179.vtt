Moyers: I'M BILL MOYERS.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
WELCOME TO THIS SPECIAL EDITION

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
OF THE JOURNAL ON AIR AND ON

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
LINE.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
FOUR YEARS AGO THE BUSH

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
ADMINISTRATION TOOK LEAVE OF

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
REALITY AND PLUNGED OUR COUNTRY

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
INTO A WAR SO POORLY PLANNED IT

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
SOON TURNED INTO A DISASTER.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
THE STORY OF HOW HIGH OFFICIALS

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
MISLED THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
TOLD, BUT THEY COULDN'T HAVE

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
DONE IT ON THEIR OWN.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
THEY NEEDED A COMPLIANT PRESS,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
TO PASS ON THEIR PROPAGANDA AS

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
NEWS AND CHEER THEM ON.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
SINCE THEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
HAVE DIED, AND MORE ARE DYING TO

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
THIS DAY.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
YET THE STORY OF HOW THE MEDIA

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
BOUGHT WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE WAS

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
SELLING HAS NOT BEEN TOLD IN

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
DEPTH ON TELEVISION.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
AS THE WAR RAGES INTO ITS FIFTH

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
YEAR, WE LOOK BACK AT THOSE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
INVASION, WHEN OUR PRESS LARGELY

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
SURRENDERED ITS INDEPENDENCE AND

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
SKEPTICISM TO JOIN WITH OUR

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
GOVERNMENT IN MARCHING TO WAR.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
OUR REPORT WAS PRODUCED AND

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
DIRECTED BY KATHLEEN HUGHES AND

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
EDITED BY ALISON AMRON.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
GOOD EVENING, I'M PLEASED TO

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS TONIGHT.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Moyers: TWO WEEKS BEFORE HE

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
WILL ORDER AMERICA TO WAR,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
PRESIDENT BUSH CALLS A PRESS

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
CONFERENCE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
DISARMING SADDAM HUSSEIN.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
IRAQ IS A PART OF THE WAR ON

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
TERROR.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
IT'S A COUNTRY THAT TRAINS

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
TERRORISTS, IT'S A COUNTRY THAT

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
CAN ARM TERRORISTS.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN AND HIS WEAPONS

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
ARE A DIRECT THREAT TO THIS

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
COUNTRY.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Moyers: FOR MONTHS NOW, HIS

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
DETERMINED TO LINK IRAQ TO 9/11.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
SEPTEMBER 11 SHOULD SAY TO

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE'RE

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
NOW A BATTLEFIELD.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Moyers: AT LEAST A DOZEN

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
TIMES DURING THIS PRESS

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
CONFERENCE, HE WILL INVOKE 9/11

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
AND AL QAEDA TO JUSTIFY A

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
PREEMPTIVE ATTACK ON A COUNTRY

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
THAT HAS NOT ATTACKED AMERICA.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
DECIDE...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Moyers: BUT THE WHITE HOUSE

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
PRESS CORPS WILL ASK NO HARD

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
QUESTIONS TONIGHT ABOUT THOSE

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
CLAIMS.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
LISTEN TO WHAT THE PRESIDENT

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
SAYS.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
THIS IS A SCRIPTED...

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
( LAUGHS )

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT...

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Moyers: "SCRIPTED."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
SURE ENOUGH, THE PRESIDENT'S

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
STAFF HAS GIVEN HIM A LIST OF

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
REPORTERS TO CALL ON.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
LET'S SEE HERE.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
ELIZABETH?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
GREGORY?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
APRIL?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR DID I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
CALL UPON YOU COLD?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
NO, I HAVE A QUESTION.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
OKAY.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I'M SURE YOU DO HAVE A QUESTION.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
HE SORT OF GIGGLED AND

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
LAUGHED, AND THE REPORTERS SORT

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
OF LAUGHED.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS OUT

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
OF EMBARRASSMENT FOR HIM OR

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
EMBARRASSMENT FOR THEM, BECAUSE

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
THEY STILL CONTINUED TO PLAY

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
ALONG.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
AFTER HIS QUESTION WAS DONE,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
THEY ALL SHOT UP THEIR HANDS AND

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
PRETENDED THEY HAD A CHANCE OF

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
BEING CALLED ON.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
HOW IS YOUR FAITH GUIDING

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
YOU?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
MY FAITH SUSTAINS ME BECAUSE

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I PRAY DAILY.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I PRAY FOR GUIDANCE.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I THINK IT JUST CRYSTALLIZED

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE PRESS

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
COVERAGE DURING THE RUN-UP TO

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
WAR.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I THINK THEY FELT LIKE THE WAR

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
AND THEY... THE BEST THING FOR

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
THEM TO DO WAS TO GET OUT OF THE

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
WAY.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Moyers: OUR STORY BEGINS WITH

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
THE HORROR OF 9/11.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
OH, MY GOD.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
OH, MY GOD.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
OH, MY GOD.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
THAT LOOKS LIKE A SECOND

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
PLANE.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Moyers: LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
JOURNALISTS WERE STUNNED BY THE

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
DEATH AND DEVASTATION.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE CAN

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
GET TO THE BASE OF THE WORLD

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
TRADE CENTER.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
YOU CAN SEE THE FIREMEN

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
ASSEMBLED HERE.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
THE POLICE OFFICERS, F.B.I.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
AGENTS.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
AND YOU CAN SEE THE TWO TOWERS,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
A HUGE EXPLOSION NOW RAINING

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
DEBRIS ON ALL OF US.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
WE BETTER GET OUT OF THE WAY.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
AND THERE, AS YOU CAN SEE,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
PERHAPS THE SECOND TOWER, THE

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
FRONT TOWER, THE TOP PORTION OF

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
WHICH IS COLLAPSING.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
GOOD LORD.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
IF THERE IS A WAR, IT'S A WAR

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
AGAINST TERRORISM THAT

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
STARTED... RATHER ONGOING RIGHT

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
NOW, IT STARTED HERE AT ABOUT

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
QUARTER TO 9:00 THIS MORNING.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT CAN

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
DESCRIBE THIS.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I WAS DEEPLY MOVED BY 9/11.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY AMERICAN WHO

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
WASN'T.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I THINK WE ALL BOUGHT INTO THAT

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
THE WORLD HAD CHANGED.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I THINK THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
UNITED STATES AFTER SEPTEMBER 11

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
WAS SO OVERWHELMINGLY PATRIOTIC,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
AND OVERWHELMINGLY: "WE MUST DO

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNOCKED

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
THESE BUILDINGS DOWN WILL HEAR

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
ALL OF US SOON.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
U.S.A.!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
U.S.A.!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
U.S.A.!

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
U.S.A.!

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
GEORGE BUSH IS THE PRESIDENT.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
HE MAKES THE DECISIONS, AND, YOU

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
KNOW, AS JUST ONE AMERICAN

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
WHEREVER HE WANTS ME TO LINE UP,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
JUST TELL ME WHERE.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I DIDN'T MEAN IT IN A

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
JOURNALISTIC SENSE.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I KNOW IT MAY HAVE COME ACROSS

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
THAT WAY.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I MEANT IT IN A SENSE AS AN

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
"MR. PRESIDENT, IF YOU NEED ME,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
IF YOU NEED ME TO GO TO HELL AND

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
BACK FOR MY COUNTRY, I WILL DO

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
IT. "

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.000
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS, IF THEY

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
COULD GO DOWN TO GROUND ZERO

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
HERE IN LOWER MANHATTAN-- AND

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
YOU REFERRED TO IT EARLIER-- AND

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
SEE THE FOLLOWING, SEE THOSE

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
FIREMAN...

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
GO TO BREAK.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I CAN FINISH IT.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
NO, NO.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
DAN, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK HERE WITH

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
DAN RATHER.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
( APPLAUSE )

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Moyers: WHAT I WAS WRESTLING

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
WITH THAT NIGHT LISTENING TO YOU

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
IS ONCE WE LET OUR EMOTIONS OUT

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
AS JOURNALISTS ON THE AIR, ONCE

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
WE SAY WE'LL LINE UP WITH THE

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
PRESIDENT, CAN WE EVER REALLY

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
SAY TO THE COUNTRY THE

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
PRESIDENT'S OUT OF LINE?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
YES, OF COURSE YOU CAN.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
NO JOURNALIST SHOULD TRY TO BE A

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
ROBOT AND SAY, "THEY'VE ATTACKED

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
MY COUNTRY, THEY'VE KILLED

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, BUT I DON'T

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
FEEL IT."

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO, AND WHAT

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
WAKE OF THAT, IS SUCK IT UP AND

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
SAY, "OKAY, THAT'S THE WAY I

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
FEEL.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL AS A

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
CITIZEN.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
BY BEING THE BEST JOURNALIST IT

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
CAN BE.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
THAT'S THE WAY I CAN BE

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
PATRIOTIC."

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
BY THE WAY, BILL, THIS IS NOT AN

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
EXCUSE.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
EXCUSE FOR, YOU KNOW, MY

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
PERFORMANCE AND THE PERFORMANCE

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
OF THE PRESS, IN GENERAL, IN THE

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
ROLL UP TO THE WAR.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
THERE WERE EXCEPTIONS.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO I

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THINK DID A BETTER JOB THAN

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
OTHERS.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.000
BUT OVERALL, AND IN THE MAIN,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Moyers: AS AMERICANS REACTED

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
TO THE ATROCITIES OF A SNEAK

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
ATTACK, A POWERFUL SURGE OF

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
SOLIDARITY SWEPT ACROSS THE

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
COUNTRY.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SEEMS

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
TO BE BINDING ALL AMERICANS

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
THESE DAYS, NO MATTER THEIR

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
BACKGROUNDS, IN THE AFTERMATH OF

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THIS TRAGEDY IS A RENEWED SENSE

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
OF PATRIOTISM.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
TO SEE SO MANY REPORTERS JUST

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
WEARING A LITTLE AMERICAN FLAG

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
ON THE LAPELS, TO SEE TIM

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
RUSSERT ON "MEET THE PRESS..."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
YEAH.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
...WITH THE RED, WHITE AND

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
BLUE RIBBONS.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I THINK IT'S A HUMAN EMOTION

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THERE.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Moyers: AND AS THE

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
ADMINISTRATION ORGANIZED TO

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
STRIKE BACK AT THE TERRORISTS,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
THERE WAS LITTLE TOLERANCE FOR

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
CRITICAL SCRUTINY FROM

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
JOURNALISTS.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
THERE WAS A PATRIOTIC FERVOR,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
AND THE ADMINISTRATION USED IT.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
SO THAT IF YOU CHALLENGED

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
ANYTHING, YOU WERE MADE TO FEEL

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
WITH THAT.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Moyers: WALTER ISAACSON WAS

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
THEN CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CNN.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
AND THERE WAS EVEN ALMOST A

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
PATRIOTISM POLICE WHICH, YOU

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
KNOW, THEY'D BE UP THERE ON THE

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
INTERNET SORT OF PICKING

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
ANYTHING A CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
OR SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD SAY AS IF

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
IT WERE DISLOYAL.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Moyers: WE INTERVIEWED A

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
FORMER REPORTER AT CNN WHO HAD

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
BEEN THERE THROUGH THAT PERIOD.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
AND THIS REPORTER SAID THIS

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
QUOTE: "EVERYBODY ON STAFF JUST

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
SORT OF KNEW NOT TO PUSH TOO

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
HARD TO DO STORIES CRITICAL OF

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION."

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
ESPECIALLY RIGHT AFTER 9/11,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WAR IN

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
AFGHANISTAN IS GOING ON, THERE

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
WAS A REAL SENSE THAT YOU DON'T

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
GET THAT CRITICAL OF A

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
GOVERNMENT THAT'S LEADING US IN

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
WARTIME.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
MOVE OUT!

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Moyers: WHEN AMERICAN FORCES

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
WENT AFTER THE TERRORIST BASES

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
IN AFGHANISTAN, NETWORK AND

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
CABLE NEWS REPORTED THE CIVILIAN

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
CASUALTIES.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
THE PATRIOT POLICE CAME

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
KNOCKING.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
WE'D PUT IT ON THE AIR, AND

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
BY NATURE OF A 24-HOUR TV

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
NETWORK, IT WAS REPLAYING OVER

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
SO, YOU WOULD GET PHONE CALLS.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
YOU WOULD GET ADVERTISERS.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
YOU WOULD GET THE

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
ADMINISTRATION.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Moyers: YOU SAID PRESSURE

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
FROM ADVERTISERS?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
NOT DIRECT PRESSURE FROM

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
ADVERTISERS, BUT BIG PEOPLE IN

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
CORPORATIONS WERE CALLING UP AND

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
SAYING, "YOU'RE BEING ANTI-

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
AMERICAN HERE."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Moyers: SO ISAACSON SENT HIS

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
STAFF A MEMO LEAKED TO THE

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
"WASHINGTON POST."

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
"IT SEEMS PERVERSE," HE SAID,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
"TO FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
CASUALTIES OR HARDSHIP IN

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
AFGHANISTAN."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
THERE'S A BODY UP HERE.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Moyers: AND HE ORDERED HIS

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
REPORTERS AND ANCHORS TO BALANCE

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
THE IMAGES OF CIVILIAN

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
DEVASTATION WITH REMINDERS OF

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
SEPTEMBER 11.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I FELT IF WE PUT INTO

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
CONTEXT, WE COULD ALLEVIATE THE

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
PRESSURE OF PEOPLE SAYING,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
"DON'T EVEN SHOW WHAT'S

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
HAPPENING IN AFGHANISTAN."

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Moyers: NEWSPAPERS WERE

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
SQUEEZED, TOO.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
THIS ONE IN FLORIDA TOLD ITS

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
EDITORS: "DO NOT USE PHOTOS ON

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
PAGE 1A SHOWING CIVILIAN

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
CASUALTIES.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
OUR SISTER PAPER HAS DONE SO AND

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
RECEIVED HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
OF THREATENING E-MAILS."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
AND THEN THERE WAS FOX NEWS,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
WHOSE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, THE

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
VETERAN REPUBLICAN OPERATIVE AND

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
MEDIA STRATEGIST ROGER AILES,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
HAD PRIVATELY URGED THE WHITE

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
HOUSE TO USE THE HARSHEST

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
MEASURES POSSIBLE AFTER 9/11.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
SO WE WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THIS PATRIOTIC FERVOR AND A

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
COMPETITOR WHO WAS USING THAT TO

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
THEIR ADVANTAGE.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
THEY WERE PUSHING THE FACT THAT

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
CNN WAS TOO LIBERAL, THAT WE

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
WERE SORT OF VAGUELY ANTI-

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
AMERICAN.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Moyers: EVEN AS AMERICAN

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
TROOPS WERE STILL CHASING OSAMA

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
BIN LADEN THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
OF AFGHANISTAN, WASHINGTON WAS

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
MOVING TOWARD A WIDER WAR.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
WITHIN HOURS AFTER THE ATTACKS

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
ON 9/11, DEFENSE SECRETARY

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
RUMSFELD PUT SADDAM HUSSEIN ON

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
THE HIT LIST.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
AN AIDE TOOK NOTES.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I KNEW BEFORE 9/11 THAT MANY

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
OF THE PEOPLE WHO CAME INTO THE

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
ADMINISTRATION WERE COMMITTED TO

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
TOPPLING SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
DOING IT WITH MILITARY FORCE IF

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
NECESSARY.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Moyers: DAN RATHER IS TALKING

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
ABOUT PROMINENT WASHINGTON

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
FIGURES IN AND OUTSIDE OF

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
GOVERNMENT KNOWN AS

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
NEOCONSERVATIVES.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
THEY HAD LONG WANTED TO

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
TRANSFORM THE MIDDLE EAST,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
BEGINNING WITH THE REMOVAL OF

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
THE TERRORIST ATTACKS GAVE THEM

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
THE CHANCE THEY WANTED, AND THE

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
MEDIA GAVE THEM A PLATFORM.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
RICHARD PERLE, NEXT PHASE:

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
ONE PERSON CLOSE TO THE

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
DEBATE SAID TO ME THIS WEEK THAT

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IT'S NO LONGER A QUESTION OF

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000
"IF," IT'S A QUESTION OF "HOW"

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
WE GO AFTER SADDAM HUSSEIN.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Moyers: IN THE WEEKS AFTER

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
9/11, THEY SEEMED TO BE ON EVERY

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
CHANNEL, GUNNING FOR HUSSEIN.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
YOU ARE PROBABLY THE HAWKIEST

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
OF THE HAWKS ON THIS.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
WHY?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
WELL, I DON'T KNOW THAT I

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
ACCEPT THAT CHARACTERIZATION,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT TOO FAR

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
OFF.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I THINK THAT THE BAGHDAD REGIME

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
IS A SERIOUS DANGER TO WORLD

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
PEACE.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
IN THE HANDS OF SADDAM HUSSEIN,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
PLUS HIS KNOWN CONTACT WITH

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
TERRORISTS, INCLUDING AL QAEDA

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
TERRORISTS, IS SIMPLY A THREAT

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
TOO LARGE TO CONTINUE TO

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
TOLERATE.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Moyers: AMONG THEIR LEADING

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
SPOKESMEN WERE RICHARD PERLE AND

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
JAMES WOOLSEY.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
BOTH SAT ON THE DEFENSE POLICY

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
BOARD ADVISING DONALD RUMSFELD.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
AND THEY USED THEIR INSIDE

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
STATUS TO ASSURE THE PRESS THAT

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
OVERTHROWING HUSSEIN WOULD BE

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
EASY.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
WE WOULD BE SEEN AS

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
LIBERATORS IN IRAQ.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Moyers: MAJOR NEWSPAPERS AND

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
MAGAZINES GAVE THEM PRIME SPACE

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
TO MAKE THEIR CASE, INCLUDING

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
THE POSSIBILITY THAT 9/11 HAD

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
BEEN "SPONSORED, SUPPORTED AND

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
PERHAPS EVEN ORDERED BY SADDAM

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
HUSSEIN."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
THE PRESIDENT, THEY SAID, SHOULD

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
TAKE PREEMPTIVE ACTION.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE WE HAVE

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
MADE-- IT'S OUR MISTAKE, IT'S

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
NOT THE MISTAKE OF THE ARABS--

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
WAS NOT FINISHING OFF SADDAM

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
HUSSEIN IN 1991.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Moyers: NO ONE GOT MORE AIR

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
TIME FROM AN ARMCHAIR THAN BILL

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
KRISTOL, EDITOR OF THE "WEEKLY

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
STANDARD" AND A MEDIA-SAVVY

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
IN THE 1990s, KRISTOL ORGANIZED

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
A CAMPAIGN FOR INCREASED

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
MILITARY SPENDING AND A MUSCULAR

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
FOREIGN POLICY.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
IN 1998, HE AND HIS ALLIES WROTE

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON URGING

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
HIM TO REMOVE SADDAM HUSSEIN

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
FROM POWER.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
AND NOW, JUST DAYS AFTER 9/11,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
WITH MANY OF THEIR ALLIES

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
SERVING IN THE ADMINISTRATION,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
THEY WROTE AN OPEN LETTER TO

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
PRESIDENT BUSH, CALLING FOR

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
REGIME CHANGE IN BAGHDAD.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
OVER THE COMING MONTHS,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
KRISTOL'S "WEEKLY STANDARD" KEPT

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
UP THE DRUMBEAT.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES IF

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
THE U.S. DOES NOT FINISH OFF

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
THIS SADDAM HUSSEIN AS A SECOND

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
STEP IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM?

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
PRESIDENT, HAVING DECLARED A

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM, DIDN'T

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
FOLLOW THROUGH, DIDN'T TAKE OUT

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
THE MOST THREATENING TERRORIST

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
STATE IN THE WORLD.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Moyers: THE EDITORIAL PAGE OF

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL" SIGNED

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
ON, AND SO DID HIGH-PROFILE

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
PUNDITS LIKE THE "NEW YORK

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
TIMES'" WILLIAM SAFIRE.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
SAFIRE, WILL YOU WAGER MS.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
WRIGHT RIGHT NOW THAT SADDAM

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
WILL BE OUT OF POWER BY THE END

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
OF 2002?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I'LL SEE YOU HERE A YEAR FROM

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
NOW.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
IF YOU GO AFTER IRAQ YOU'RE

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
GOING TO LOSE A LOT OF ALLIES,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
BUT WHO CARES?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Moyers: CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
AND OTHER TOP COLUMNISTS AT THE

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
"WASHINGTON POST" ALSO SAW THE

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
HAND OF SADDAM HUSSEIN IN THE

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
TERRORIST ATTACKS.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
JIM HOAGLAND IMPLICATED HUSSEIN

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
WITHIN HOURS AFTER THE SUICIDE

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
BOMBERS STRUCK ON 9/11.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
AND THE "POST'S" GEORGE WILL

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
FIRED AWAY ON THE TALK SHOWS.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
THE ADMINISTRATION KNOWS HE'S

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
VOWED... HUSSEIN HAS VOWED

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
REVENGE, HE HAS ANTHRAX, HE

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
LOVES BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, HE HAS

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
TERRORIST TRAINING CAMPS,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
INCLUDING A 707 TO PRACTICE ON.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Moyers: IT WAS PROVING

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THE

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
OPINION OF THE PUNDITS FROM THE

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
POLICIES OF THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
BUT AS THE HULLABALOO OVER

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
SADDAM GREW IN WASHINGTON, BOB

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
SIMON OF CBS NEWS' "60 MINUTES"

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
WAS DUMBFOUNDED.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
HE'S BASED IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
FROM OVERSEAS WE HAD A

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
CLEARER VIEW.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I MEAN, WE KNEW THINGS OR

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
SUSPECTED THINGS THAT PERHAPS

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS COULD

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
NOT SUSPECT.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABSURDITY OF

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
PUTTING UP A CONNECTION BETWEEN

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN AND AL QAEDA.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Moyers: ABSURDITY.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
CANNOT QUESTION AN ABSURDITY?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
WELL, MAYBE THE WASHINGTON

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
PRESS CORPS, BASED INSIDE THE

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
BELT, WASN'T AS AWARE AS THOSE

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
OF US WHO ARE BASED IN THE

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
MIDDLE EAST AND WHO SPEND A LOT

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
OF TIME IN IRAQ.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I MEAN, WHEN THE WASHINGTON

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
PRESS CORPS TRAVELS, IT TRAVELS

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
WITH THE PRESIDENT OR WITH THE

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
SECRETARY OF STATE AND...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Moyers: IN A BUBBLE.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000
YEAH, IN A BUBBLE.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
WHEREAS WE WHO'VE SPENT WEEKS

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
JUST WALKING THE STREETS OF

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
BAGHDAD, AND IN OTHER SITUATIONS

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
IN BAGHDAD, JUST WERE SCRATCHING

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
OUR HEADS IN WAYS THAT PERHAPS

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
THAT THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
COULD NOT.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Moyers: SIMON WAS UNDER NO

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
ILLUSIONS ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
DURING THE FIRST GULF WAR, HE

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
AND HIS CAMERA CREW WERE

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
ARRESTED BY IRAQI FORCES AND

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
BRUTALIZED FOR 40 DAYS BEFORE

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
BEING RELEASED.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
WE'RE GOING HOME, WHICH IS

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
THE PLACE YOU GO TO AFTER A WAR

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
WHEN... IF YOU'VE BEEN AS LUCKY

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
AS WE'VE BEEN.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Moyers: IT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
TO SIMON THAT THE DICTATOR WOULD

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
TRUST ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
SADDAM, AS MOST TYRANTS, WAS

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
A TOTAL CONTROL FREAK.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
HE WANTED TOTAL CONTROL OF HIS

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
REGIME, TOTAL CONTROL OF THE

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
COUNTRY.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
AND TO INTRODUCE A WILD CARD

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
LIKE AL QAEDA IN ANY SENSE WAS

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
JUST SOMETHING HE WOULD NOT DO.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
SO I JUST DIDN'T BELIEVE IT FOR

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
AN INSTANT.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
WERE SAID, MANY OF THE THINGS

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
THAT WERE SAID ABOUT IRAQ,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
AND THAT REALLY PROMPTS YOU TO

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
ASK, "WAIT A MINUTE, IS THIS

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
TRUE?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
DOES EVERYONE AGREE THAT THIS IS

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
TRUE?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
DOES ANYONE THINK THIS IS NOT

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
TRUE?"

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
THIS IS PLAN-A NOW.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Moyers: JOHN WALCOTT WASN'T

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
BUYING THE OFFICIAL LINE,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
EITHER.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
THE BUREAU CHIEF OF KNIGHT

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
RIDDER NEWS SERVICE, HE AND HIS

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
REPORTERS COVERED WASHINGTON FOR

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
32 NEWSPAPERS SPREAD ACROSS THE

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
COUNTRY.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
OUR READERS AREN'T HERE IN

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
WASHINGTON.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
THEY AREN'T UP IN NEW YORK.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
THEY AREN'T THE PEOPLE WHO SEND

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS TO WAR.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
THEY'RE THE PEOPLE WHO GET SENT

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
TO WAR.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
AND WE FELT AN OBLIGATION TO

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
THEM TO EXPLAIN WHY THAT MIGHT

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
HAPPEN.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
WE WERE DETERMINED TO SCRUTINIZE

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASE FOR

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
WAR AS CLOSELY AS WE POSSIBLY

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
COULD, AND THAT'S WHAT WE SET

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
OUT TO DO.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Moyers: SO AS HE LISTENED TO

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
PUNDITS AND OFFICIALS TALKING

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN'S SUPPOSED

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
CONNECTIONS TO 9/11, WALCOTT WAS

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
SKEPTICAL.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO US WHY

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
ANYONE WAS ASKING QUESTIONS

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
ABOUT IRAQ IN THE WAKE OF AN

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
ATTACK THAT HAD AL QAEDA WRITTEN

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
ALL OVER IT.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Moyers: HE ASSIGNED HIS TWO

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
TOP REPORTERS TO INVESTIGATE THE

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
CLAIMS.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
BETWEEN THEM, WARREN STROBEL AND

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
JONATHAN LANDAY HAD MORE THAN 40

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
YEARS EXPERIENCE REPORTING ON

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND NATIONAL

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
SECURITY.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
THEY HAD LOTS OF SOURCES TO CALL

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
ON.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
WE WERE BASICALLY, I THINK,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
HEARING TWO DIFFERENT MESSAGES

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
FROM... THERE'S A MESSAGE, THE

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
PUBLIC MESSAGE THE

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
ADMINISTRATION WAS GIVING OUT

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
ABOUT IRAQ.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
IT'S W.M.D., THE FACT THERE WAS

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
AN IMMEDIATE THREAT, GRAVE

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
THREAT, GATHERING THREAT.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
BUT THAT WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM PEOPLE

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
ON THE INSIDE, PEOPLE WE HAD

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
KNOWN IN MANY CASES FOR YEARS

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
AND TRUSTED.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Moyers: THEY WENT ABOUT THEIR

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
REPORTING THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
WITH SHOE LEATHER, TRACKING DOWN

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
AND MEETING WITH SOURCES DEEP

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
INSIDE THE INTELLIGENCE

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
COMMUNITY.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO THE

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
WORKING GRUNTS, YOU KNOW,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
UNIFORM MILITARY OFFICERS,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATS, THOSE

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.000
PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY THAN

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
NOT-- NOT ALWAYS, OF COURSE, BUT

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
MORE LIKELY THAN NOT-- TO TELL

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
YOU SOME VERSION OF THE TRUTH,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
AND TO BE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
IT COMES TO TERRORISM OR THE

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
MIDDLE EAST, THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Moyers: STROBEL LEARNED THAT

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
WITHIN TWO WEEKS AFTER 9/11,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
SENIOR INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
WERE GROWING CONCERNED THAT THE

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
BUSH ADMINISTRATION WAS

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
STRETCHING LITTLE BITS AND

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
PIECES OF INFORMATION TO CONNECT

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN TO AL QAEDA WITH

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
NO HARD EVIDENCE.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
THERE WAS A LOT OF SKEPTICISM

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
AMONG OUR EDITORS BECAUSE WHAT

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
WE WERE WRITING WAS SO AT ODDS

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
WITH WHAT MOST OF THE REST OF

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS WAS

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
REPORTING AND SOME OF OUR PAPERS

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
FRANKLY, JUST DIDN'T RUN THE

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
STORIES.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THEY HAD ACCESS TO THE "NEW YORK

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
TIMES" WIRE AND THE "WASHINGTON

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
POST" WIRE, AND THEY CHOSE THOSE

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
STORIES INSTEAD.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Moyers: WITHIN THE MONTH,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
STROBEL FOUND OUT THE PENTAGON

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
HAD ALREADY DISPATCHED JAMES

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
WOOLSEY TO EUROPE LOOKING FOR

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
ANY SHRED OF EVIDENCE TO

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
INCRIMINATE HUSSEIN.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000
HE DID THIS EVEN KNOWING THAT

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
THE C.I.A. HAD ALREADY ANALYZED

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
THIS CAREFULLY AND FOUND NO SUCH

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
LINKS.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
SO THE MORE I THOUGHT ABOUT

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
THAT, THE MORE IT JUST DIDN'T

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
SEEM TO MAKE SENSE.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Moyers: KNIGHT RIDDER'S EARLY

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
SKEPTICISM WAS A RARITY INSIDE

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
THE BELTWAY BUBBLE.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
A DECISION TO GO TO WAR, EVEN

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
AGAINST AN EIGHTH-RATE POWER

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
SUCH AS IRAQ, IS THE MOST

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
SERIOUS DECISION THAT A

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
GOVERNMENT CAN EVER MAKE AND IT

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
DESERVES THE MOST SERIOUS KIND

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
OF SCRUTINY THAT WE IN THE MEDIA

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
CAN GIVE IT.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
IS IT NECESSARY TO SEND OUR

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO GO KILL

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
SOMEBODY ELSE'S YOUNG MEN AND

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
WOMEN?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Moyers: THAT MEANT ASKING

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SOURCES OF

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
INFORMATION THE PRESS AND

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
GOVERNMENT WERE RELYING ON,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
INCLUDING, NOTABLY, THIS MAN,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
AHMED CHALABI.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
AFTER THE FIRST GULF WAR,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
AMERICANS HAD INSTALLED CHALABI

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
AS THE LEADER OF IRAQI EXILES

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
SEEKING REGIME CHANGE IN

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
BAGHDAD.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
NOW HE WAS ALL OVER WASHINGTON

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S AND THE

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
NEO-CONSERVATIVES' STAR WITNESS

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
AGAINST SADDAM.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
HELLO.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
CHALABI'S MOTIVES WERE ALWAYS

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
PERFECTLY CLEAR IN THIS AND

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
UNDERSTANDABLE.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
HE WAS AN IRAQI.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
HE DIDN'T WANT HIS COUNTRY RUN

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000
BY A THUG AND A MURDERER, A MASS

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
MURDERER AND A CROOK, AND

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
EVERYTHING HE SAID HAD TO BE

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
LOOKED AT IN THAT LIGHT AND

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
SCRUTINIZED IN THAT LIGHT.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
AND WHY ANYONE WOULD GIVE HIM A

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
FREE PASS, OR ANYONE ELSE A FREE

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
PASS FOR THAT MATTER, ON A

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
MATTER AS IMPORTANT AS GOING TO

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
WAR, IS BEYOND ME.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
CHALABI WAS A CREATURE OF

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
AMERICAN PROPAGANDA TO A LARGE

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.000
DEGREE.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
IT WAS AN AMERICAN COMPANY, THE

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
RENDON GROUP, THAT, WORKING

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
SECRETLY WITH THE C.I.A.,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
BASICALLY CREATED HIS

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
ORGANIZATION, THE IRAQI NATIONAL

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
CONGRESS, AND PUT CHALABI IN

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
CHARGE, BASICALLY.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Moyers: JAMES BAMFORD IS AN

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
INDEPENDENT JOURNALIST WHOSE

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
SPECIALTY IS THE INTELLIGENCE

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
WORLD.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
CHALABI WAS PAID A LOT OF MONEY

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
FROM THE U.S. TAXPAYERS.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
THE C.I.A. PAID HIM ORIGINALLY

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
ABOUT $350,000 A MONTH TO

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
CHALABI AND HIS ORGANIZATION.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
THE C.I.A. FINALLY CAUGHT ON IN

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
THE MID-'90s THAT CHALABI WAS A

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
CON MAN, BASICALLY, AND THEY

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
DROPPED HIM.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Moyers: CHALABI'S HANDLERS IN

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
WASHINGTON WERE NOT DETERRED BY

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
THAT STAIN ON HIS CREDIBILITY.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
HE CHARMED CONGRESS OUT OF

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
MILLIONS MORE DOLLARS FOR HIS

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
CAUSE, AND HAD THE PRESS EATING

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
OUT OF HIS HAND.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
HE MADE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
THE MEDIA.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
AND HE CONVINCED A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
THAT HE WAS LEGITIMATE EVEN

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
THOUGH THE C.I.A. HAD DROPPED

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
HIM.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Moyers: WHEN CHALABI MADE

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
SELECTED IRAQI DEFECTORS

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
AVAILABLE TO THE PRESS IT WAS A

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
WIN/WIN GAME: THE DEFECTORS GOT

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
A PLATFORM; JOURNALISTS GOT BIG

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
SCOOPS.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
THERE WAS A BIG EFFORT, IN

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
FACT, TO FIND PEOPLE WHO SEEMED

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
TO HAVE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE ABOUT

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE IRAQ.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
BECAUSE, IN FACT, IF YOU COULD

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
FIND SOMEBODY WHO WAS CREDIBLE

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
TALKING ABOUT A NUCLEAR PROGRAM

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
IN IRAQ OR CHEMICAL WEAPONS,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
THAT WOULD BE A BIG STORY.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Moyers: AND IT WORKED.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
THE "NEW YORKER," "U.S. A.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
TODAY," THE "WASHINGTON POST,"

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
THE "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS," THE

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
"NEW YORK TIMES."

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
AND ON PBS, JUST TWO MONTHS

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
AFTER 9/11, "FRONTLINE" AND THE

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
"NEW YORK TIMES" TEAMED UP FOR A

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
DOCUMENTARY ON THE DEFECTORS.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
CAPTAIN SABAH KHODADA IS A

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
FORMER ARMY OFFICER WHO DEFECTED

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
FROM IRAQ.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
HE MADE A CRUDE DRAWING OF WHAT

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
HE SAYS IS A TERRORIST TRAINING

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
CAMP ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
BAGHDAD.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Moyers: THERE WERE CAVEATS.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
AND A FURTHER CAUTION: THESE

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
DEFECTORS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
"FRONTLINE'S" ATTENTION BY ONE

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
GROUP OF IRAQI DISSIDENTS, THE

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I.N.C., THE IRAQI NATIONAL

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
CONGRESS.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Moyers: BUT THE CAVEATS

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
COULDN'T COMPETE WITH THE

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
SPECTACULAR TALES TOLD BY

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000
DEFECTORS.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
BEFORE THE INVASION THE "NEW

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000
YORK TIME'S" JUDITH MILLER WOULD

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
WRITE SIX PROMINENT STORIES

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
BASED ON THEIR TESTIMONY.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
AHMED CHALABI IS A

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
CONTROVERSIAL LEADER OF THE

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
IRAQI OPPOSITION.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Moyers: AND STILL ON THE WEB,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
A REPORT ABOUT THE DEFECTORS,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
NARRATED BY JUDITH MILLER AND

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
PRODUCED BY "NEW YORK TIMES"

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
TELEVISION FOR THE "NEWSHOUR" ON

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
PBS.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
WELL, JUDY MILLER HAD BEEN AN

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
OLD FRIEND OF CHALABI, DID A LOT

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
OF THE STORIES ON CHALABI, WAS

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
VERY FAVORABLE TO CHALABI.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Moyers: JAMES BAMFORD FOUND

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
OUT THAT IN 2001, CHALABI HAD

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
ARRANGED FOR MILLER TO MEET IN

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
THAILAND WITH A DEFECTOR FROM

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
IRAQ NAMED AL-HAIDERI.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
SO, AL-HAIDERI WAS IN

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
BANGKOK.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
JUDY MILLER FLEW THERE TO

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
INTERVIEW HIM.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" RAN A

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
FRONT-PAGE STORY BASICALLY

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
CONFIRMING EVERYTHING THE

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN SAYING

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
ABOUT IRAQ.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Moyers: AL-HAIDERI SAID HE

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
WAS A KURD FROM NORTHERN IRAQ.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
HE TOLD MILLER THE IRAQIS HAD

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
HIDDEN CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
WEAPONS; SOME, MILLER REPORTED,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
RIGHT UNDER SADDAM'S

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
PRESIDENTIAL SITES.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
THE STORY SPREAD FAR AND WIDE.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
JUST... REMAINS IMMENSELY

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
INFLUENTIAL.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
PEOPLE IN THE TV WORLD READ IT

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
EVERY MORNING.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
AND IT'S AMAZING HOW OFTEN

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
YOU'LL SEE A STORY GO FROM THE

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
FRONT PAGE OF THE DAY'S PAPER IN

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
THE MORNING TO THE EVENING

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
NEWSCAST AT NIGHT.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT, OF COURSE,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
READ IT, THINK TANKS, AND SO ON.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
THERE WERE SOME RED FLAGS

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
THAT THE "NEW YORK TIMES" STORY

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
THREW OUT IMMEDIATELY, WHICH

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
CAUGHT OUR EYE IMMEDIATELY.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
THE FIRST WAS THE IDEA THAT A

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
KURD, THE ENEMY OF SADDAM, HAD

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
BEEN ALLOWED INTO HIS MOST TOP

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
SECRET MILITARY FACILITIES.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
THAT WAS, FOR ME, THE BIGGEST

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
RED FLAG.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
AND THERE WERE OTHERS, LIKE THE

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
IDEA THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WOULD

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
PUT A BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
FACILITY UNDER HIS RESIDENCE.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
I MEAN, WOULD YOU PUT A

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS LAB UNDER

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
YOUR LIVING ROOM?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
THE FIRST RULE OF BEING AN

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
INTELLIGENCE AGENT, OR A

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
JOURNALIST-- AND THEY'RE REALLY

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
NOT THAT DIFFERENT-- IS YOU'RE

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
SKEPTICAL OF DEFECTORS BECAUSE

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
THEY HAVE A REASON TO

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
EXAGGERATE.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
THEY WANT TO INCREASE THEIR

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
VALUE TO YOU.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
THEY PROBABLY WANT SOMETHING

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
FROM YOU.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE LYING, BUT

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
YOU SHOULD BE... JOURNALISTS ARE

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
SUPPOSED TO BE SKEPTICAL, RIGHT?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
AND I'M AFRAID THE "NEW YORK

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
TIMES" REPORTER IN THAT CASE,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
AND A LOT OF OTHER REPORTERS,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
WERE JUST NOT SKEPTICAL OF WHAT

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
THESE DEFECTORS WERE SAYING, NOR

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
WAS THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
A FORMER TOP IRAQI NUCLEAR

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
SCIENTIST TELLS CONGRESS IRAQ

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
COULD BUILD THREE NUCLEAR BOMBS

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
BY 2005.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
WELL, NOW ANOTHER DEFECTOR,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
A SENIOR IRAQI INTELLIGENCE

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
OFFICIAL, TELLS "VANITY FAIR" IN

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW THAT

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS TRAINED AN

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
ELITE FIGHTING FORCE IN

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
SABOTAGE, URBAN WARFARE,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
HIJACKING AND MURDER.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
DAVID ROSE WROTE THE STORY, HE

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
JOINS US NOW FROM LONDON.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Moyers: IN "VANITY FAIR'S"

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
DAVID ROSE, DEFECTORS FOUND

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
ANOTHER EAGER BEAVER FOR THEIR

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
CLAIMS.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
THE GLOSSY MAGAZINE, A FAVORITE

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
OF MEDIA ELITES, GAVE HIM FOUR

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
BIG SPREADS TO TELL DEFECTOR

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
STORIES.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
THE TALK SHOWS LAPPED IT UP.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
WHAT THE DEFECTOR, AL-

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
QURAIRY, A FORMER BRIGADIER

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
GENERAL IN THE IRAQI

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, TOLD ME IS

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
THAT THESE GUYS-- THERE ARE

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
1,200 IN ALL-- AND THEY'VE BEEN

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
TRAINED TO HIJACK TRAINS, BUSES,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
SHIPS, AND SO FORTH.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
AS YOU TRACK THEIR STORIES,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
THEY BECOME EVER MORE FANTASTIC,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
AND THEY'RE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
ARE TELLING THESE STORIES, UNTIL

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
YOU GET TO THE MOST FANTASTIC

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
TALES OF ALL, WHICH APPEARED IN

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
"VANITY FAIR" MAGAZINE.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
THE LAST TRAINING EXERCISE

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
WAS TO BLOW UP A FULL-SIZE

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
MOCKUP OF A U.S. DESTROYER IN A

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
LAKE IN CENTRAL IRAQ.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
OR JUMPING INTO PITS OF

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
FOULED WATER AND HAVING TO KILL

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
A DOG WITH YOUR BARE TEETH.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I MEAN, THE... AND THIS WAS

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
COMING FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
APPEARING IN ALL OF THESE

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
STORIES, AND AS I... AND

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
SOMETIMES THEIR RANK WOULD

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
CHANGE.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
MUSAWI TOLD US THAT HE HAS

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
VERIFIED THAT THIS MAN WAS AN

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000
OFFICER IN IRAQ'S RUTHLESS

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
INTELLIGENCE SERVICE, THE

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
MUKHABARAT.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
AND YOU'RE SAYING, "WAIT A

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
MINUTE, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
HERE, BECAUSE IN THIS STORY HE

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
WAS A MAJOR, BUT IN THIS STORY

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
THE GUY'S A COLONEL.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
AND IN THIS STORY THIS WAS HIS

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
FUNCTION, BUT NOW HE SAYS IN

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
THIS STORY HE WAS DOING

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
SOMETHING ELSE."

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
THE DEFECTOR IS TELLING

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
MUSAWI THAT IN ORDER TO EVADE

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
THE U.N. INSPECTORS, SADDAM

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
HUSSEIN PUT HIS BIOLOGICAL

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
WEAPONS LABORATORIES IN TRUCKS

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
THAT THE DEFECTOR TOLD US HE

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
PERSONALLY BOUGHT FROM RENAULT.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
REFRIGERATOR TRUCKS?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.000
YEAH, YEAH.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
AND HOW MANY?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
SEVEN.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Moyers: LESLIE STAHL AND CBS

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
RETRACTED THEIR STORY A YEAR

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
AFTER THE INVASION WHEN NEARLY

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
ALL THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED BY

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
DEFECTORS PROVED TO BE FALSE.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
"VANITY FAIR'S" DAVID ROSE LATER

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000
SAID HIGH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
HAD CONFIRMED HIS STORIES, BUT

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
THESE WERE THE VERY OFFICIALS

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
WHO HAD BET ON CHALABI AS THEIR

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
FAVORITE MAN O' WAR.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
TO THE KNIGHT RIDDER TEAM IT ALL

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
SMELLED OF A CON GAME.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
WHAT HE DID WAS REASONABLY

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
CLEVER, BUT FAIRLY OBVIOUS,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000
WHICH IS HE GAVE THE SAME STUFF

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
TO SOME REPORTERS THAT, FOR ONE

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
REASON OR ANOTHER, HE FELT WOULD

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
SIMPLY REPORT IT.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
AND THEN HE GAVE THE SAME STUFF

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
TO PEOPLE IN THE VICE

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND IN THE

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE'S OFFICE.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
AND SO, IF THE REPORTER CALLED

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OR THE

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
VICE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE TO

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
CHECK, THEY WOULD'VE SAID, "OH,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
I THINK THAT'S... YOU CAN GO

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
WITH THAT.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
WE HAVE THAT, TOO."

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
SO YOU CREATE THE APPEARANCE, OR

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
CHALABI CREATED THE APPEARANCE,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
THAT THERE WERE TWO SOURCES AND

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
THAT THE INFORMATION HAD BEEN

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED, WHEN,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
IN FACT, THERE WAS ONLY ONE

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
SOURCE AND IT HADN'T BEEN

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
CONFIRMED BY ANYBODY.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
AND LET'S NOT FORGET HOW

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
CLOSE THESE PEOPLE WERE TO THIS

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH RAISES THE

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
QUESTION: WAS THERE

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
COORDINATION?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
BUT IT SURE LOOKED LIKE IT.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Moyers: THE ADMINISTRATION

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
WAS NOW STEPPING UP EFFORTS TO

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
NAIL DOWN A TANGIBLE LINK

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
BETWEEN SADDAM AND 9/11.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
JOURNALISTS WERE TIPPED TO A

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
MEETING THAT SUPPOSEDLY TOOK

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
PLACE IN PRAGUE BETWEEN IRAQI

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
AGENTS AND THE 9/11 RINGLEADER,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
MOHAMMED ATTA.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
PUNDITS HAD A FIELD DAY.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
HE HAS CONTACTS OUTSIDE IN

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
SUDAN AND AFGHANISTAN WITH

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
TERRORISTS.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
HE MET... THEY DID INDEED HAVE A

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
CONTACT BETWEEN ATTA AND AN

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
IRAQI DIPLOMAT.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Moyers: IN THE "NEW YORK

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
TIMES," WILLIAM SAFIRE CALLED

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
THE PRAGUE MEETING AN

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000
"UNDISPUTED FACT."

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
HE WOULD WRITE ABOUT THE ATTA

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
CONNECTION TEN TIMES IN HIS OP-

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
ED COLUMN.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
JUST WEEKS AFTER 9/11, SAFIRE

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
HAD PREDICTED A QUICK WAR, WITH

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
IRAQIS CHEERING THEIR LIBERATORS

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
AND LEADING THE ARAB WORLD

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
TOWARD DEMOCRACY.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
BETWEEN MARCH 2002 AND THE

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
INVASION A YEAR LATER, SAFIRE

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
WOULD WRITE A TOTAL OF 27

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
OPINION PIECES FANNING THE

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
SPARKS OF WAR.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
AND ON TIM RUSSERT'S "MEET THE

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
PRESS," SAFIRE KEPT IT UP.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
BILL SAFIRE, THE DIFFERENCE

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
BETWEEN SUFFICIENT PROVOCATION

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
AND A PREEMPTIVE STRIKE?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
I DON'T THINK WE NEED ANY

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
MORE PROVOCATION THAN WE'VE HAD

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
BY TEN YEARS OF BREAKING HIS

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
AGREEMENT AT THE CEASE FIRE.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
HE HAS BEEN BUILDING WEAPONS OF

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
MASS DESTRUCTION.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Moyers: IN OCTOBER, HIS OWN

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
PAPER RAN A FRONT-PAGE STORY BY

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
JAMES RISEN QUESTIONING THE

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
EVIDENCE.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
THEN CAME THIS REPORT FROM BOB

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
SIMON.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
TRYING TO MAKE THE LINK TO

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
IMPLICATE SADDAM HUSSEIN IN THE

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, AND

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
THEY'VE BEEN POINTING TO AN

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
ALLEGED MEETING BETWEEN MOHAMMED

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
ATTA, THE LEAD HIJACKER, AND AN

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
IRAQI INTELLIGENCE OFFICER IN

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
THE CZECH CAPITAL OF PRAGUE.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
IF WE HAD COMBED PRAGUE AND

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE FOR A

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
MEETING BETWEEN MOHAMMAD ATTA

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
AND THE IRAQI INTELLIGENCE

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
FIGURE, IF WE KNEW THAT, YOU HAD

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
TO FIGURE THAT THE

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
ADMINISTRATION KNEW IT.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
AND YET THEY WERE SELLING THE

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
CONNECTION BETWEEN AL QAEDA AND

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
SADDAM.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
BOB BAER SPENT 16 YEARS AS AN

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
UNDERCOVER AGENT FOR THE C.I.A.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Moyers: HOW DID YOU GET TO

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
BOB BAER, THE FORMER C.I.A.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
OFFICIAL, WHO WAS SUCH AN

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
IMPORTANT SOURCE FOR YOU?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
WE CALLED HIM.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
( LAUGHS )

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Moyers: HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I KNEW SOME FRIENDS OF HIS.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
IT WAS... IT WASN'T A PROBLEM

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
GETTING HIS PHONE NUMBER.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
I MEAN, ANY REPORTER COULD GET

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000
HIS PHONE NUMBER.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Moyers: WHO WAS HE?

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.000
AND WHAT... WHY WAS HE

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
IMPORTANT?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
HE WAS ONE OF THE GUYS WHO

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
WAS SENT TO PRAGUE TO FIND THAT

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
LINK.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
HE WAS SENT TO FIND THE LINK

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
BETWEEN AL QAEDA AND SADDAM.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Moyers: HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
HERO IF HE'D FOUND THE LINK.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
OH, MY HEAVENS, YES.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
I MEAN, THIS WAS WHAT EVERYONE

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
WAS LOOKING FOR.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Moyers: BUT THERE WAS LITTLE

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
APPETITE INSIDE THE NETWORKS FOR

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
TAKING ON A POPULAR WARTIME

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
PRESIDENT, SO SIMON DECIDED TO

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
WRAP HIS STORY INSIDE A MORE

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
BENIGN ACCOUNT OF HOW THE WHITE

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
HOUSE WAS MARKETING THE WAR.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME A

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
PRESIDENT HAS MOUNTED A SALES

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
CAMPAIGN TO SELL A WAR.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
AND I THINK WE ALL FELT FROM THE

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
BEGINNING THAT TO DEAL WITH A

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
SUBJECT AS EXPLOSIVE AS THIS, WE

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
SHOULD KEEP IT IN A WAY ALMOST

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
LIGHT, IF THAT DOESN'T SEEM

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
RIDICULOUS.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Moyers: GOING TO WAR, ALMOST

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
LIGHT.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
NOT TO PRESENT IT AS A

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
FRONTAL ATTACK ON THE

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
ADMINISTRATION'S CLAIMS, WHICH

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT ONLY

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
PREMATURE, BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
THE AMMUNITION TO DO IT AT THE

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
TIME.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
WE DID NOT KNOW THEN THAT THERE

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
WERE NO MASS... WEAPONS OF MASS

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
WE ONLY KNEW THAT THE CONNECTION

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
THE ADMINISTRATION WAS MAKING

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
BETWEEN SADDAM AND AL QAEDA WAS

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
VERY TENUOUS AT BEST AND THAT

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
THE ARGUMENT IT WAS MAKING OVER

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
THE ALUMINUM TUBES SEEMED HIGHLY

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
DUBIOUS.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
WE KNEW THESE THINGS.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
AND THEREFORE WE COULD PRESENT

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
THE MADISON AVENUE CAMPAIGN ON

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
THESE THINGS, WHICH WAS A SORT

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
OF SOFTER, LESS CONFRONTATIONAL

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
WAY OF DOING IT.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Moyers: DID YOU GO TO ANY OF

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
THE BRASS AT CBS, EVEN AT "60

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
MINUTES," AND SAY, "LOOK, WE GOT

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
TO DIG DEEPER.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
WE GOT TO CONNECT THE DOTS.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
THIS ISN'T RIGHT."

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
NO.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
IN ALL HONESTY, WITH A THOUSAND

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
MEA CULPAS, I'VE DONE A FEW

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
STORIES IN IRAQ.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
BUT NOPE, I DON'T THINK WE

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
FOLLOWED UP ON THIS.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
IRAQ IS IN POSSESSION OF

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
CONTRARY TO THEIR PROMISES...

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Moyers: WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
WAS NOW MARKETING AS FACT WOULD

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
GO VIRTUALLY UNCHALLENGED.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
WE KNOW THEY HAVE WEAPONS OF

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
MASS DESTRUCTION, WE KNOW THEY

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
HAVE ACTIVE PROGRAMS.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Moyers: AS THE "WASHINGTON

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
POST'S" VETERAN REPORTER, WALTER

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
PINCUS, WOULD LATER REPORT, THE

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
PROPAGANDA MACHINE WAS RUN BY

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
THE PRESIDENT'S INNER CIRCLE,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
OFFICIALS WHO CALLED THEMSELVES

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
THE WHITE HOUSE IRAQ GROUP, OR

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
"WHIG."

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
YOU WROTE THAT WHIG INCLUDED

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
KARL ROVE, THE CHIEF OF STAFF,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
ANDREW CARD, MARY MATALIN, CONDI

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
RICE, STEVEN HADLEY, LEWIS

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
LIBBY, AND THEY WERE IN CHARGE

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
OF SELLING THE WAR.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
SELLING THE WAR, YEAH.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
GOOD EVENING.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
A LONG YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
ENEMIES ATTACKED OUR COUNTRY.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Moyers: THEIR CHIEF SALESMAN

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
HAD THE BEST PROPS AT HIS

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
DISPOSAL.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000
TERRORIST OR TYRANT TO THREATEN

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
CIVILIZATION WITH WEAPONS OF

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
MASS MURDER.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
THEY CREATED THAT LINK.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Moyers: THE MARKETING GROUP?

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
THE MARKETING GROUP.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
AND THE LINK WAS A TWO-FOLD

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
LINK: ONE, HE HAD WEAPONS OF

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
MASS DESTRUCTION; AND TWO, HE

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
SUPPORTED TERRORISTS.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
AND THEY REPEATED IT EVERY DAY.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
ANYBODY WHO WATCHES TELEVISION

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
THESE DAYS KNOWS YOU SELL A

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
PRODUCT NOT JUST BY SAYING IT

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
ONCE, BY SAYING IT OVER AND OVER

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
AGAIN WITH NEW SPOKESMEN TWO,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
THREE TIMES A DAY, AND IT SINKS

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
INTO THE PUBLIC.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Moyers: IS THERE ANYTHING

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
UNUSUAL ABOUT AN ADMINISTRATION

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
MARKETING ITS POLICY?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
IT'S... I THINK EACH

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
ADMINISTRATION HAS LEARNED FROM

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
THE OTHER, AND WITH THIS GROUP

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
IS JUST THE CLEVEREST I'VE EVER

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
SEEN AND TOOK IT TO NEW HEIGHTS.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
THE TV, RADIO, PRINT, OTHER

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
MEDIA OUTLETS ARE AS CRUCIAL TO

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
GOING TO WAR AS THE BOMBS AND

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
THE BULLETS AND THE PLANES.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
THEY'RE PART OF THE ARSENAL, THE

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
PROPAGANDA WEAPONRY, IF YOU

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
WILL.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
AND THAT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTOOD

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
ACROSS THE BOARD AT THE

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
PENTAGON, THE WHITE HOUSE, THE

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
STATE DEPARTMENT.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
A PROVEN MENACE LIKE SADDAM

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
HUSSEIN IN POSSESSION OF WEAPONS

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
OF MASS DESTRUCTION...

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
THE IRAQI REGIME POSSESSES

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
WE DO HAVE SOLID EVIDENCE OF

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
THE PRESENCE IN IRAQ OF AL QAEDA

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
MEMBERS.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
THE REGIME HAS LONG-STANDING

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
AND CONTINUING TIES TO TERRORIST

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
JUST REPEAT IT AND REPEAT IT

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
AND REPEAT IT.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
REPEAT "AL QAEDA, IRAQ.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
AL QAEDA, IRAQ.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
AL QAEDA, IRAQ."

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
JUST KEEP IT GOING.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
KEEP THAT DRUMBEAT GOING.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
LONG AFTER IT WAS WELL

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
ESTABLISHED THAT THERE WAS NO

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
LINK BETWEEN AL QAEDA AND THE

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ AND THE

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
SADDAM REGIME, THE POLLS SHOWED

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
THAT AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
AMERICANS BELIEVED THAT AL

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
QAEDA... THAT IRAQ WAS

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
RESPONSIBLE FOR SEPTEMBER 11.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVED

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
AND ACCEPTED THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT UNTIL WE

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
REALLY STARTED BURROWING INTO

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
THE STORY THAT I BELIEVED IT,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
TOO.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
COULD GO ALONG WITH...

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Moyers: LANDAY FOUND PLENTY

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
OF EVIDENCE TO CONTRADICT THE

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA, AND THE

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
FACTS QUICKLY CHANGED HIS MIND.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
I SIMPLY SPENT BASICALLY A

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
MONTH FAMILIARIZING MYSELF WITH

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
WHAT SADDAM'S WEAPONS OF MASS

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
DESTRUCTION PROGRAMS HAD BEEN

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
AND THERE WAS TONS OF MATERIAL

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
AVAILABLE ON THAT FROM THE U.N.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
WEAPONS INSPECTORS.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I MEAN, THEY GOT INTO VIRTUALLY

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
EVERYTHING, AND THEIR REPORTS

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
WERE ONLINE.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
IF YOU GO DOWN HERE, THE IRAQ

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
NUCLEAR VERIFICATION OFFICE,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
THEY PUT UP REGULAR... "HERE YOU

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
GO" KEY FINDINGS, WHAT THEY

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
FOUND OUT ABOUT IRAQ'S NUCLEAR

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
WEAPONS PROGRAMS.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
IT'S ALL HERE IN THE OPEN FOR

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO READ IT.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Moyers: INTERNATIONAL

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
INSPECTORS HAD GONE INTO IRAQ

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
AFTER THE FIRST GULF WAR TO

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
SEARCH FOR AND TO DESTROY SADDAM

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
HUSSIN'S WEAPONS SYSTEMS.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
LATE IN 1998, THE INSPECTIONS

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
CAME TO AN ABRUPT HALT AFTER THE

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
IRAQI GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
COOPERATE, BUT THAT HARDLY MEANT

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
NO ONE WAS WATCHING.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
DURING THE PERIOD OF TIME

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
BETWEEN WHEN THE INSPECTORS LEFT

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
IRAQ, WHICH WAS IN 1998, THE END

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
OF 1998, AND THEN, THE UNITED

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
STATES HAD COVERED THE PLACE

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
WITH SPY SATELLITES AND U2

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
OVERFLIGHTS, AND, YOU KNOW, THE

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
OTHER INTELLIGENCE SERVICES HAD

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
THEIR EYEBALLS ON THIS PLACE.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
THERE IS A GREAT DANGER

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
THAT...

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Moyers: THAT'S WHY LANDAY WAS

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
SURPRISED BY WHAT VICE PRESIDENT

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
CHENEY TOLD A GROUP OF VETERANS

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
IN LATE AUGUST 2002.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
MANY OF US ARE CONVINCED THAT

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN WILL ACQUIRE

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS FAIRLY SOON.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
AND I LOOKED AT THAT AND I

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
SAID, "WHAT IS HE TALKING

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
ABOUT?"

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
BECAUSE TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
WEAPON, YOU NEED SPECIFIC

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND, IN

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
PARTICULAR, THE WAY THE IRAQIS

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
WERE TRYING TO PRODUCE A NUCLEAR

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
WEAPON WAS THROUGH ENRICHMENT OF

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
URANIUM.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
NOW, YOU NEED TENS OF THOUSANDS

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
OF MACHINES CALLED CENTRIFUGES

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
TO PRODUCE HIGHLY ENRICHED

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
URANIUM FOR A NUCLEAR WEAPON.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
YOU'VE GOT TO HOUSE THOSE IN A

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
FAIRLY BIG PLACE, AND YOU'VE GOT

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
TO PROVIDE A HUGE AMOUNT OF

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
POWER TO THIS FACILITY.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
COULD HE REALLY HAVE DONE IT

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
WITH ALL OF THESE EYES ON HIS

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
COUNTRY?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT SADDAM

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
HAS RESUMED HIS EFFORTS TO

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
ACQUIRE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
SO, WHEN CHENEY SAID THAT, I

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
GOT ON THE PHONE TO PEOPLE, AND

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
ONE PERSON SAID TO ME-- SOMEBODY

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
WHO WATCHED PROLIFERATION AS

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
THEIR JOB-- SAID, "THE VICE

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
PRESIDENT IS LYING."

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Moyers: ON THE BASIS OF HIS

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, LANDAY

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
WROTE THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
TO BACK UP THE VICE PRESIDENT'S

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
CLAIMS.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
BUT THE STORY LANDAY WROTE

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
DIDN'T RUN IN NEW YORK OR

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
WASHINGTON; KNIGHT RIDDER,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
REMEMBER, HAS NO OUTLET IN

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
EITHER CITY.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
SO IT COULDN'T COMPETE WITH A

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
BLOCKBUSTER THAT APPEARED TWO

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
DAYS LATER ON THE FRONT PAGE OF

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000
THE NATION'S PAPER OF RECORD

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
WITH A FAMILIAR BYLINE.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
QUOTING ANONYMOUS ADMINISTRATION

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
OFFICIALS, THE "TIMES" REPORTED

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD LAUNCHED

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
"A WORLDWIDE HUNT FOR MATERIALS

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
TO MAKE AN ATOMIC BOMB USING

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
SPECIALLY DESIGNED ALUMINUM

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
TUBES."

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
AND THERE, ON "MEET THE PRESS"

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
THAT SAME MORNING, WAS VICE

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
PRESIDENT CHENEY.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
THERE'S A STORY IN THE "NEW

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
YORK TIMES" THIS MORNING, THIS

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
IS-- AND I WANT TO ATTRIBUTE

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
IT TO THE "TIMES"-- I DON'T WANT

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
TO TALK ABOUT OBVIOUSLY SPECIFIC

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES, BUT...

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
NOW, ORDINARILY, INFORMATION

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
LIKE THE ALUMINUM TUBES,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
WOULD... WOULDN'T APPEAR... IT

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
WAS TOP SECRET INTELLIGENCE, AND

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
THE VICE PRESIDENT AND THE

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR WOULD

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
NOT BE ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
THIS ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
BUT IT APPEARED THAT MORNING IN

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" AND,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
THEREFORE, THEY WERE ABLE TO

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
TALK ABOUT IT.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
IT'S NOW PUBLIC THAT, IN

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
FACT, HE HAS BEEN SEEKING TO

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
ACQUIRE AND WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
INTERCEPT TO PREVENT HIM FROM

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
ACQUIRING THROUGH THIS

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
PARTICULAR CHANNEL THE KINDS OF

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
TUBES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
BUILD A CENTRIFUGE, AND THE

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
CENTRIFUGE IS REQUIRED TO TAKE

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
LOW-GRADE URANIUM AND ENHANCE IT

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
INTO HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
WHICH IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
IN ORDER TO BUILD A BOMB.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Moyers: DID YOU SEE THAT

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.000
PERFORMANCE?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I DID.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Moyers: WHAT DID YOU THINK?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
I THOUGHT IT WAS REMARKABLE.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Moyers: WHY?

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.000
REMARKABLE.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
YOU LEAK A STORY, AND THEN YOU

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.000
QUOTE THE STORY.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
I MEAN, THAT'S A REMARKABLE

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
THING TO DO.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Moyers: AND THAT'S ONLY PART

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
OF IT.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
USING THE IDENTICAL LANGUAGE OF

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
THE ANONYMOUS SOURCES QUOTED IN

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
THE "TIMES," TOP OFFICIALS WERE

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
NOW INVOKING THE ULTIMATE

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
SPECTER OF NUCLEAR WAR: THE

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
SMOKING GUN AS MUSHROOM CLOUD.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW QUICKLY HE

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
CAN ACQUIRE A NUCLEAR WEAPON,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
BUT WE DON'T WANT THE SMOKING

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
GUN TO BE A MUSHROOM CLOUD.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
THOSE SORTS OF STORIES, WHEN

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
THEY APPEAR ON THE FRONT PAGE OF

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
THE SO-CALLED LIBERAL "NEW YORK

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
TIMES," IT ABSOLUTELY COMES WITH

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
A STAMP OF APPROVAL.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I MEAN, IF THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
THINKS SADDAM IS ON THE

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
PRECIPICE OF SOME MUSHROOM

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
CLOUDS, THEN THERE'S REALLY NO

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
DEBATE.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000
WE READ IN THE "NEW YORK

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
TIMES" TODAY A STORY THAT SAYS

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN IS CLOSER TO

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
ACQUIRING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
DOES HE HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
IS THERE A SMOKING GUN HERE?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
"THE SMOKING GUN" IS AN

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
INTERESTING PHRASE.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
THEN AS WE SAW IN REPORTING

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
JUST THIS MORNING...

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
WHAT SPECIFICALLY HAS HE

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
OBTAINED THAT YOU BELIEVE WILL

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
ENHANCE HIS NUCLEAR DEVELOPMENT

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
PROGRAM?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Moyers: WAS IT JUST A

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
COINCIDENCE IN YOUR MIND THAT

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
CHENEY CAME ON YOUR SHOW AND

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
OTHERS WENT ON THE OTHER SUNDAY

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
SHOWS THE VERY MORNING THAT THAT

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
STORY APPEARED?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" IS A BETTER

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000
JUDGE OF THAT THAN I AM.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Moyers: NO ONE TIPPED YOU

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
NO, NO.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I MEAN...

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Moyers: THE CHENEY OFFICE

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
DIDN'T MAKE ANY... DIDN'T LEAK

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:06.000
TO YOU THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
A BIG STORY?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:08.000
NO.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
( LAUGHS )

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
NO.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I MEAN, I DON'T... I DON'T HAVE

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
THE... THIS IS... YOU KNOW, ON

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
"MEET THE PRESS," PEOPLE COME ON

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
AND THERE ARE NO GROUND RULES.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
WE CAN ASK ANY QUESTION WE WANT.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
ALUMINUM TUBE STORY UNTIL I READ

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
IT IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Moyers: CRITICS POINT TO

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
SEPTEMBER 8, 2002, AND TO YOUR

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
SHOW IN PARTICULAR, AS THE

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
CLASSIC CASE OF HOW THE PRESS

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
AND THE GOVERNMENT BECAME

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
INSEPARABLE.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
SOMEONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
PLANTS A DRAMATIC STORY IN THE

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
"NEW YORK TIMES" AND THEN THE

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
VICE PRESIDENT COMES ON YOUR

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
SHOW AND POINTS TO THE "NEW YORK

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000
TIMES."

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
IT'S A CIRCULAR, SELF-CONFIRMING

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000
LEAK.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
I DON'T KNOW HOW JUDITH

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
MILLER AND MICHAEL GORDON

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
REPORTED THAT STORY, WHO THEIR

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
SOURCES WERE.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
IT WAS A FRONT-PAGE STORY OF THE

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
"NEW YORK TIMES."

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
WHEN SECRETARY RICE AND VICE

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
PRESIDENT CHENEY AND OTHERS CAME

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
UP THAT SUNDAY MORNING ON ALL

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
THE SUNDAY SHOWS, THEY DID

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
EXACTLY THAT.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
WHAT MY CONCERN WAS, IS THAT

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
THERE WERE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
OTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
AND TO THIS DAY, I WISH MY PHONE

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
HAD RUNG OR I HAD ACCESS TO

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
THEM.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Moyers: BOB SIMON DIDN'T WAIT

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
FOR THE PHONE TO RING.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
WHEN YOU SAID A MOMENT AGO WHEN

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
WE STARTED TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
KNEW ABOUT ALUMINUM TUBES, WHAT

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
PEOPLE... WHO WERE YOU TALKING

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
TO?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
WE WERE TALKING TO PEOPLE, TO

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
SCIENTISTS... TO SCIENTISTS AND

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
TO RESEARCHERS AND TO PEOPLE WHO

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
HAD BEEN INVESTIGATING IRAQ FROM

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
THE START.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Moyers: WOULD THESE PEOPLE

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO ANY

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000
REPORTER WHO CALLED OR WERE THEY

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
EXCLUSIVE SOURCES FOR "60

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
MINUTES"?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
NO, I THINK THAT MANY OF THEM

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO ANY

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
REPORTER WHO CALLED.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Moyers: AND YOU JUST PICKED

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:38.000
UP THE PHONE?

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
JUST PICKED UP THE PHONE.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Moyers: TALKED TO THEM?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
TALKED TO THEM AND THEN WENT

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
DOWN WITH THE CAMERAS.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Moyers: FEW JOURNALISTS

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
FOLLOWED SUIT.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
AND THROUGHOUT THE FALL OF 2002,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
HIGH OFFICIALS WERE REPEATING

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
APOCALYPTIC WARNINGS WITH

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
VIRTUALLY NO DEMAND FROM THE

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
ESTABLISHMENT PRESS FOR

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
EVIDENCE.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
FACING CLEAR EVIDENCE OF

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
PERIL, WE CANNOT WAIT FOR THE

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
FINAL PROOF-- THE SMOKING GUN--

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
THAT COULD COME IN THE FORM OF A

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
MUSHROOM CLOUD.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Moyers: COULD MEMBERS OF THE

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
PRESS HAVE KNOWN AT THAT POINT

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
EXAGGERATING?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
INDIVIDUALS DID IT.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
THERE WERE SPECIALISTS WHO WERE

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
RAISING QUESTIONS.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
AND ONE OF OUR REPORTERS, JOBY

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
WARRICK, WROTE A VERY TOUGH

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
PIECE ABOUT NOT JUST THE

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
DISAGREEMENT, BUT... BUT HOW

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
DOUBTFUL IT WAS THAT THESE TUBES

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000
WERE FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
IT WAS A ONE-DAY PIECE IN OUR

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000
PAPER, AND IT WASN'T PICKED UP.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Moyers: BUT WARRICK'S STORY

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
APPEARED ON PAGE 18, NOT PAGE

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
ONE.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
THE FRONT PAGE OF THE

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
"WASHINGTON POST" OR ANY

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
NEWSPAPER IS A BILLBOARD OF WHAT

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:44.000
THE EDITORS ARE TELLING YOU,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
"THESE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
STORIES OF THE DAY. "

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
AND STORIES THAT DON'T RUN ON

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
THE FRONT PAGE, THE READER SORT

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
OF GETS THAT, WELL, THESE ARE OF

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
SECONDARY IMPORTANCE.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Moyers: HOWARD KURTZ IS THE

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
"WASHINGTON POST" MEDIA CRITIC.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
I WENT BACK AND DID THE MATH.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
FROM AUGUST 2002 UNTIL THE WAR

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
WAS LAUNCHED IN MARCH OF 2003

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
THERE WERE ABOUT 140 FRONT-PAGE

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
PIECES IN THE "WASHINGTON POST"

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000
MAKING THE ADMINISTRATION'S CASE

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
FOR WAR.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
IT WAS, "THE PRESIDENT SAID

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
YESTERDAY," "THE VICE PRESIDENT

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
SAID YESTERDAY," "THE PENTAGON

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
SAID YESTERDAY."

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
WELL, THAT'S PART OF OUR JOB.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
THOSE PEOPLE WANT TO SPEAK, WE

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM A PLATFORM.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING WRONG WITH

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
THAT.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
BUT THERE WAS ONLY A HANDFUL...

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
A HANDFUL OF STORIES THAT RAN ON

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
THE FRONT PAGE, SOME MORE THAT

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000
RAN INSIDE THE PAGES OF THE

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
PAPER THAT MADE THE OPPOSITE

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
CASE.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
OR, IF NOT MAKING THE OPPOSITE

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
CASE, RAISED QUESTIONS.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
"WAS THIS REALLY TRUE?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
WHAT WAS THE LEVEL OF PROOF?

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
DID THE C.I.A. REALLY KNOW?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
WHAT WERE THOSE ALUMINUM TUBES?"

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
THOSE STORIES, AND SOME

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
REPORTERS WORKED HARD ON THEM,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
HAD A HARDER TIME GETTING ON THE

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.000
FRONT PAGE.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
WHY?

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T DEFINITIVE.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Moyers: BUT WHO DEFINES

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
DEFINITIVE?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000
REPORTER WALTER PINCUS' SOURCES

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
DEEP INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
QUESTIONED HOW THE INTELLIGENCE

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
WAS BEING USED, BUT HIS STORIES

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
WERE MOSTLY RELEGATED TO THE

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
BACK PAGES.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
ACROSS THE MEDIA WORLD, THE

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
BELLICOSE BUT UNCONFIRMED CLAIMS

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
MADE THE BIG HEADLINES.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
THE CAUTIONARY STORIES DID NOT.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
AND I BELIEVE, HONESTLY,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE A FEAR OF

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
IRRITATING THE WHITE HOUSE--

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
CERTAINLY NOT AT THE "WASHINGTON

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000
POST."

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
BUT THEY DO WORRY ABOUT SORT OF

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.000
GETTING OUT AHEAD OF SOMETHING.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Moyers: ISN'T THAT SUPPOSED

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
TO BE SCOOP JOURNALISM?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
WELL, BUT YOU COULD BE WRONG.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
IT'S A TRUISM THAT INDIVIDUAL

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
JOURNALISTS, AND, IN FACT, THE

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
TOP RANK MEDIA OUTLETS THEY WORK

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
FOR, REALLY WANT TO BE AHEAD OF

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
THE CURVE, BUT NOT OUT ON A

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
LIMB.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
AND IF YOU TOOK SERIOUSLY THE

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
WARNING FLAGS THAT WERE PROFUSE

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
BEFORE THE INVASION OF IRAQ,

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S STORY

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
WAS A BUNCH OF NONSENSE ABOUT

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
W.M.D.s, YOU WOULD NOT JUST BE

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
AHEAD OF THE CURVE A LITTLE, YOU

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY OUT ON A

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
LIMB.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
I DON'T THINK THERE WAS

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
ENOUGH SKEPTICISM BECAUSE I

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
THINK MOST OF US KIND OF

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
BELIEVED THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN WAS

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
BUILDING BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
AND PERHAPS EVEN NUCLEAR

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
WEAPONS.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Moyers: ISN'T IT THE ROLE OF

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
THE FOURTH ESTATE, THOUGH, TO BE

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
CRITICAL OF GROUP THINK?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
IT DEFINITELY IS AND I THINK

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
WE IN THE PRESS, WE'RE NOT

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
CRITICAL ENOUGH.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
WE DIDN'T QUESTION OUR SOURCES

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000
ENOUGH.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
WE WEREN'T SMART ENOUGH, WE

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
WEREN'T ALERT ENOUGH, WE DIDN'T

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.000
DIG ENOUGH, AND WE SHOULDN'T

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
HAVE BEEN FOOLED IN THIS WAY.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Moyers: EVEN OPRAH GOT IN ON

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
THE ACT, FEATURING IN OCTOBER

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
2002 "NEW YORK" TIMES REPORTER

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
JUDITH MILLER.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT SADDAM

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
HUSSEIN HAS DEADLY STOCKS OF

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
ANTHRAX, OF BOTULINIUM TOXIN,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000
VIRULENT POISONS KNOWN TO MAN.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Moyers: LIBERAL HAWK KENNETH

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
POLLAK.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
AND WHAT WE KNOW FOR A FACT

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
FROM A NUMBER OF DEFECTORS

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
WHO'VE COME OUT OF IRAQ OVER THE

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
YEARS IS THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN IS

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO ACQUIRE

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND IS BUILDING

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
THEM AS FAST AS HE CAN.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Moyers: AND THE RIGHT HAND

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
MAN TO AHMED CHALABI.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
AND SO DO THE IRAQI PEOPLE

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
WANT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
LIBERATE THEM?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
IN 1991 THE IRAQI PEOPLE WERE...

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I HOPE IT DOESN'T OFFEND

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
YOU...

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Moyers: WHEN ONE GUEST DARED

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
TO EXPRESS DOUBT, OPRAH WOULD

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
HAVE NONE OF IT.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000
BELIEVE WITH THE MEDIA AND...

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
OH, WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
PROPAGANDA... SHOW YOU

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
PROPAGANDA.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
WE'RE JUST SHOWING YOU WHAT IS.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I UNDERSTAND THAT, I

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
OKAY.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
BUT OKAY, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
YOUR OPINION.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Moyers: CONTRARY OPINIONS

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
WEREN'T VERY POPULAR IN

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
WASHINGTON EITHER, AS AMBITIOUS

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
DEMOCRATS EMBRACED THE NOW

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
CONVENTIONAL BUT UNCONFIRMED

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
WISDOM.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
WHO AMONG US CAN SAY WITH ANY

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
CERTAINTY TO ANYBODY THAT THE

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
WEAPONS MIGHT NOT BE USED

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
AGAINST OUR TROOPS OR AGAINST

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
ALLIES IN THE REGION?

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT IF

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
LEFT UNCHECKED, SADDAM HUSSEIN

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE HIS

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
CAPACITY TO WAGE BIOLOGICAL AND

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
CHEMICAL WARFARE, AND WILL KEEP

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
TRYING TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
WEAPONS.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Moyers: WHEN DEMOCRATS DID GO

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
AGAINST THE GRAIN, THEY WERE

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
DENOUNCED BY THE PARTISAN PRESS

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
AND LARGELY IGNORED BY THE

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
MAINSTREAM PRESS.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
AND BEFORE WE PUT THIS GREAT

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
NATION ON THE TRACK TO WAR, I

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
WANT TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE-- HARD

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
EVIDENCE-- NOT MORE PRESIDENTIAL

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
RHETORIC.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
I HAVE HEARD NO PERSUASIVE

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
EVIDENCE THAT SADDAM IS ON THE

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000
THRESHOLD OF ACQUIRING THE

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000
NUCLEAR WEAPONS HE HAS SOUGHT

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
OFFERED NO PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000
THAT SADDAM WOULD TRANSFER

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO AL QAEDA.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000
TED KENNEDY GAVE A PASSIONATE

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
SPEECH IN 2002 RAISING ALL SORTS

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAR AND

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
WHAT THE AFTERMATH WOULD BE.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
WAR WITH IRAQ BEFORE A

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
GENUINE ATTEMPT AT INSPECTION

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
AND DISARMAMENT, WITHOUT GENUINE

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, COULD

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
SWELL THE RANKS OF AL QAEDA WITH

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000
SYMPATHIZERS AND TRIGGER AN

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
ESCALATION IN TERRORIST ACTS.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000
"WASHINGTON POST" GAVE THAT

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
SPEECH ONE SENTENCE, 36 WORDS.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
I CALCULATED IN 2002 THE

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000
"WASHINGTON POST" PROBABLY

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
PUBLISHED 1,000 ARTICLES AND

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.000
COLUMNS ABOUT... ABOUT IRAQ.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
PROBABLY ONE MILLION WORDS, IN

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
EXCESS OF ONE MILLION WORDS.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
AND ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
DEMOCRATS IN THE COUNTRY RAISED

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAR, THE

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000
"WASHINGTON POST" SET ASIDE 36

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.000
WORDS.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Moyers: IT HAD NOW BECOME

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
UNFASHIONABLE TO DISSENT FROM

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
THE OFFICIAL LINE, UNFASHIONABLE

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000
AND RISKY.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
ANYONE WHO HURTS THIS COUNTRY

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
IN A TIME LIKE THIS, WELL, LET'S

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000
JUST SAY YOU WILL BE

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
SPOTLIGHTED.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
IF YOU'RE A JOURNALIST OR A

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
POLITICIAN AND YOU'RE SWIMMING

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
UPSTREAM, SO TO SPEAK, YOU'RE

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
GOING TO ENCOUNTER A LOT OF

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
PIRANHA, AND THEY ARE VORACIOUS.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
THERE'S A NOTION THAT THIS IS

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
THE PERSON THAT WE GO AFTER THIS

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:40.000
WEEK.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
FOX NEWS AND... AND TALK

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
RADIO AND THE CONSERVATIVE

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
BLOGGERS.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
I MEAN, THEY WERE BANGING THOSE

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000
DRUMS VERY LOUD, AND EVERYONE IN

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
THE PRESS COULD HEAR IT.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
NOT ONLY WAS IT JUST LIBERAL

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
BIAS, IT WAS AN ANTI-AMERICAN

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
BIAS, AN UNPATRIOTIC BIAS AND

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
THAT THESE JOURNALISTS WERE

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
REALLY NOT PART OF AMERICA.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
AND EVERY JOURNALIST KNEW IT.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
THEY HAD AND THEY HAVE A VERY

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
EFFECTIVE SLAM MACHINE.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS, "YOU

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
EITHER REPORT THE NEWS THE WAY

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
WE WANT IT REPORTED OR WE'RE

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
GOING TO HANG A SIGN AROUND YOUR

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
NECK."

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
I WILL CALL THOSE WHO

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000
PUBLICLY CRITICIZE THEIR COUNTRY

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
IN A TIME OF MILITARY CRISIS--

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
WHICH THIS IS-- BAD AMERICANS.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
THERE'S A LEVEL OF VITRIOL

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
AND VINDICTIVENESS THAT IS VERY

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
SCARY TO LISTEN TO, AND YOU

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
THINK THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
LISTENING TO THEM.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
THE MEDIA HAVE BECOME SORT OF

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
LIKE THE WHIPPING BOY BECAUSE

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
THEY KNOW THAT THE PRESS CAN

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT RUNS

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
COUNTER TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
IS CLAIMING, TO WHAT THE BUSH

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
ADMINISTRATION IS CLAIMING.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
NOW, "DONAHUE."

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Moyers: ON HIS NEW MSNBC TALK

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
SHOW, PHIL DONAHUE DISCOVERED

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
JUST WHAT COULD HAPPEN WHEN YOU

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
STEPPED OUT OF LINE.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
TONIGHT: ANTI-WAR PROTESTORS

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
TAKING ON THE GOVERNMENT.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.000
IS THERE A PLACE FOR THEM IN

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
THIS POST-9/11 WORLD OR ARE THEY

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
JUST DOWNRIGHT UNPATRIOTIC?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
AND I JUST FELT, YOU KNOW, WHAT

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
WOULD BE WRONG WITH HAVING ONE

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
SHOW A NIGHT, YOU KNOW, SAY,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
"HOLD IT, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
CAN WE AFFORD THIS?

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
DO WE HAVE ENOUGH TROOPS?

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
AND WHAT ABOUT GENERAL SHINSEKI?

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
AND WHERE ARE ALL... YOU KNOW,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
WHAT IS GUANTANAMO?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS?"

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I THOUGHT PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
MY MESSAGE WOULD WATCH ME

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
BECAUSE THE... NO ONE ELSE WAS

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000
DOING IT.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T GET OVER

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
THE UNANIMITY OF OPINION ON

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
CABLE.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
THE DRUM WAS BEATING.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
EVERYBODY WANTED TO BOMB

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
SOMEBODY.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000
AND I'M THINKING, "WAIT A

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
MINUTE."

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
SO, HERE I GO... I MEAN, FOOL

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
THAT I AM.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.000
I RUSHED IN.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000
SCOTT RITTER IS HERE AND SO IS

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
AMBASSADOR...

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Moyers: YOU HAD SCOTT RITTER,

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000
FORMER WEAPONS INSPECTOR, WHO

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000
WAS SAYING THAT IF WE INVADE, IT

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
WILL BE A HISTORIC BLUNDER.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
YOU DIDN'T HAVE HIM ALONE.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
HE HAD TO BE THERE WITH SOMEONE

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
ELSE WHO SUPPORTED THE WAR.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU COULDN'T

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
HAVE SCOTT RITTER ALONE.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
YOU COULD HAVE RICHARD PERLE

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
ALONE.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Moyers: YOU COULD HAVE THE

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
CONSERVATIVES...

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
YOU COULD HAVE THE SUPPORTERS

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
OF THE PRESIDENT ALONE, AND THEY

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000
WOULD SAY WHY THIS WAR IS

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000
IMPORTANT.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
YOU COULDN'T HAVE A DISSENTER

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
ALONE.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
OUR PRODUCERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.000
FEATURE TWO CONSERVATIVES FOR

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.000
EVERY LIBERAL.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Moyers: YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
NO, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Moyers: INSTRUCTED FROM

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
ABOVE?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.000
YES.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
I WAS COUNTED AS TWO LIBERALS,

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
AND SO...

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Moyers: THEY'RE UNDER SELLING

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000
YOU.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I HAD TO... I HAD TO HAVE

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
TWO... THERE'S JUST A TERRIBLE

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
FEAR.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:36.000
AND I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
WORD.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Moyers: ERIC SORENSON, WHO

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
WAS THE PRESIDENT OF MSNBC, TOLD

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
THE "NEW YORK TIMES," "ANY

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
MISSTEP AND YOU CAN GET INTO

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
TROUBLE WITH THESE GUYS AND HAVE

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
THE PATRIOTISM POLICE HUNT YOU

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
DOWN."

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
YES.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.000
WELL, HE'S THE MANAGEMENT GUY.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
SO HIS PHONE WOULD RING.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000
NOBODY'S GOING TO CALL DONAHUE

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
AND TELL HIM TO SHUT UP AND

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
SUPPORT THE WAR.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
NOBODY'S THAT FOOLISH.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000
IT'S A LOT MORE SUBTLE THAN

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
THAT.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
THE MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE WAR

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
IS THAT THERE WAS A SORT OF

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
ACCEPTABLE MAINSTREAM OPINION

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000
THAT GOT SET.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
SEEN AS OUTSIDE THAT MAINSTREAM

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000
WERE VIEWED AS SORT OF FRINGE,

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000
AND THEY WERE MARGINALIZED.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
YOU SAW THAT IN THE

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
DEMONSTRATORS...

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, WE

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.000
DON'T WANT NO IRAQ WAR!

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:36.000
...HOW PEOPLE DEMONSTRATING

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
DID NOT GET MUCH PLAY.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, STOP

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
THE BOMBING, STOP THE HATE.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
WE DON'T WANT NO IRAQ WAR;

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
THROW DICK CHENEY THROUGH THE

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
DOOR.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
SO IN OCTOBER OF 2002,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
100,000 PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON,

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
THE... ONE OF THE LARGEST, YOU

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
KNOW, PEACE DEMONSTRATIONS IN...

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
IN YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000
AND THE PRESS JUST... YOU KNOW,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
THE "WASHINGTON POST" PUT A

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
PHOTO ON ITS METRO PAGE.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Moyers: THE PHOTOGRAPHS RAN

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
WITH AN ARTICLE, BUT THE PAPER'S

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
OMBUDSMAN LATER CRITICIZED THE

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
"POST" FOR NOT GIVING THE STORY

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
MORE PROMINENCE.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
MEANWHILE, IN THE SIX MONTHS

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
LEADING UP TO THE INVASION, THE

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
"WASHINGTON POST" WOULD

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
EDITORIALIZE IN FAVOR OF THE WAR

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
AT LEAST 27 TIMES.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
WHAT GOT EVEN LESS INK THAN THE

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
PROTESTORS WAS THE RELEASE OF

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
SOMETHING CALLED THE NATIONAL

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000
INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000
BEFORE VOTING TO GIVE THE

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.000
PRESIDENT WAR POWERS, CONGRESS

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
DETAIL ALL THE TOP SECRET

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
EVIDENCE IT WAS USING TO JUSTIFY

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
AN INVASION.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.000
THE PRESS GOT A DECLASSIFIED

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
VERSION.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
MOST OF THE MEDIA GAVE IT A

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
CURSORY READING, BUT JONATHAN

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
LANDAY EXAMINED THE TEXT

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
CLOSELY.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000
I GOT MY COPY, AND I OPENED

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
IT UP.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.000
THIS IS THE WHITE PAPER THAT...

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000
AND I CAME TO THE PART THAT

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
TALKED ABOUT THE ALUMINUM TUBES.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
NOW, IT SAID THAT THE MAJORITY

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
OF ANALYSTS BELIEVED THAT THOSE

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
TUBES WERE FOR THE NUCLEAR

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
WEAPONS PROGRAM.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
IT TURNS OUT, THOUGH, THAT THAT

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
MAJORITY OF INTELLIGENCE

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
ANALYSTS WERE... HAD NO

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000
BACKGROUND IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Moyers: KNIGHT RIDDER WAS ON

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
TOP OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.000
OF THE RUN-UP TO THE INVASION,

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
THE MANIPULATION OF INTELLIGENCE

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000
TO MAKE THE CASE FOR WAR.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:28.000
SO, HERE WAS YET ANOTHER

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
BUILDING BLOCK IN THIS CHAIN OF

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
BUILDING BLOCKS THAT WE HAD

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
COLLECTED OVER THESE MONTHS

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING TO

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
THE PUBLIC, AND WHAT THE

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
INTELLIGENCE WAS ACTUALLY

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
TELLING THEM.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
AND THERE WERE DIFFERENCES.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
SOME OF THEM WERE... WERE

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
NUANCED, SOME OF THEM WERE QUITE

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
LARGE.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
BUT IT BECAME QUITE APPARENT

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
THAT THEY WERE GRABBING JUST

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000
ABOUT ANYTHING THEY COULD TO

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
MAKE THE CASE FOR GOING TO WAR

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
IN IRAQ.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Moyers: OVER A DOZEN SOURCES

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
TOLD KNIGHT RIDDER THAT THE

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
PENTAGON WAS PRESSURING ANALYSTS

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000
TO "COOK THE INTELLIGENCE

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
BOOKS."

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
DEEP THROATS WERE TALKING, BUT

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000
FEW IN THE PRESS WERE LISTENING.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITHIN THE

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.000
U.S. GOVERNMENT WHO OBJECT WHEN

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.000
THEY PERCEIVE THAT THEIR

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
GOVERNMENT ISN'T BEING STRAIGHT

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000
WITH THE PEOPLE.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
AND WHEN THEY PERCEIVE THAT AN

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
ADMINISTRATION IS VEERING AWAY

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
FROM THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000
THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT, THEY

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
BECOME MORE READY TO TALK ABOUT

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000
THINGS THAT PERHAPS THEY

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
ORDINARILY SHOULDN'T.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
AYES ARE 296.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
THE NAYS ARE 133.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
THE JOINT RESOLUTION IS PASSED.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Moyers: IGNORING THE REPORTS

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
OF FLAWED INTELLIGENCE, CONGRESS

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
GAVE THE PRESIDENT THE GO-AHEAD

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
FOR USE OF FORCE.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
KNIGHT RIDDER'S TEAM JUST KEPT

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
ON DIGGING.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
BY THE END OF THE MONTH, THEIR

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
REPORTING HAD COME FULL CIRCLE.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
SOURCES CONFIRMED THAT THE

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
PENTAGON WAS PREPARING FOR WAR

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
BASED ON INFORMATION FROM AHMED

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000
CHALABI AND THE IRAQI NATIONAL

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
CONGRESS DESPITE OBJECTIONS FROM

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
EXPERTS INSIDE THE C.I.A.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
THE ADMINISTRATION CAN

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
WITHSTAND THE KNIGHT RIDDER

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
CRITIQUE BECAUSE IT... IT WASN'T

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
REVERBERATING INSIDE WASHINGTON

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
AND THEREFORE PEOPLE WEREN'T

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000
PICKING IT UP.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
WE WERE UNDER THE RADAR MOST

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
OF THE TIME AT KNIGHT RIDDER.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
WE WERE NOT A COMPANY THAT, I

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
THINK, KARL ROVE AND OTHERS

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
CARED DEEPLY ABOUT, EVEN THOUGH

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
IN TERMS OF READERS, WE'RE MUCH

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
BIGGER THAN THE "NEW YORK TIMES"

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000
AND THE "WASHINGTON POST."

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
WE'RE LESS INFLUENTIAL; THERE'S

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
NO WAY AROUND THAT.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
BUT THERE WAS A PERIOD WHEN

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
WE WERE SITTING OUT THERE AND I

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.000
HAD A LOT OF LATE NIGHT GUT

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:44.000
CHECKS WHERE I WAS JUST LIKE,

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
"ARE WE TOTALLY OFF ON SOME LOOP

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
HERE?

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
THAT WE...

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000
YEAH.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.000
WE... WE WOULD...

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.000
ARE WE... WE WRONG?

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000
ARE WE GOING TO BE EMBARRASSED?

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000
EVERYDAY WE WOULD LO... EVERY

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
DAY WE'D LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
SAY, LITERALLY... ONE OF US

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
WOULD FIND SOMETHING OUT AND I'D

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
LOOK AT HIM AND SAY, "WHAT'S

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
GOING ON HERE?"

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
BUT I THINK IT'S TELLING THAT

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
THEY DIDN'T REALLY OPERATE BY

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
THAT BELTWAY GAME THE WAY THE

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
NETWORKS, THE CABLE CHANNELS,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
"NEWSWEEK," "TIME," "NEW YORK

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
TIMES," "WASHINGTON POST."

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
THEY SEEM TO SORT OF OPERATE

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
OUTSIDE THAT BUBBLE.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
AND LOOK AT WHAT THE BENEFITS

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
WERE WHEN THEY OPERATED OUTSIDE

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
THAT BUBBLE.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
THEY ACTUALLY GOT THE STORY

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
RIGHT.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS IT'S... IT'S

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
PROOF POSITIVE THAT THAT STORY

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000
WAS THERE.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000
AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN GOTTEN

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
AND SOME PEOPLE DID GET IT.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000
BUT THE VAST MAJORITY CHOSE TO

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
IGNORE IT OR... OR NOT EVEN TRY.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
HOW MANY TIMES DID I GET

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
INVITED ON THE TALK... HOW MANY

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
TIMES DID YOU GET INVITED ON A

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
TALK SHOW?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I THINK MAYBE ONE...

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
YEAH, NOT THE BIG TALK SHOWS.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
ACTUALLY...

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000
NOT THE BIG SUNDAY SHOWS...

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:37.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I'LL TELL YOU WHO INVITED ME ON

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.000
A TALK... ON A TALK SHOWS:

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.000
C-SPAN.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
TELEVISION, ESPECIALLY CABLE

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
TELEVISION HAS A SORT OF CROSS-

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
FIRE MENTALITY.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
YOU PUT ON THE PRO-BUSH GUEST

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
AND THE ANTI-BUSH GUEST AND THEY

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
GO AT IT.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
YOU PUT ON THE "LET'S GO INTO

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
IRAQ" AND "LET'S NOT GO INTO

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
IRAQ" AND THEY GO AT IT.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
WELL, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
THEY'RE PUNDITS.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
BUT THAT'S NOT A DEBATE THAT'S

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
PARTICULARLY WELL-SUITED TO

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
SHEDDING LIGHT ON WHETHER OR NOT

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S CASE

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
FOR WAR RESTED ON SOME KIND OF

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
FACTUAL BASIS.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
THAT'S NOT WHAT PUNDITS DO.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I MEAN, I REALLY THINK THE

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
REASON THE UNITED STATES HAS A

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
BAD REPUTATION IN THE ARAB WORLD

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
IS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
OF DICTATORSHIPS.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000
WE'VE BEEN ON THE SIDE OF VERY

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
CORRUPT, VERY BACKWARD

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
GOVERNMENTS.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Moyers: PETER BEINART BECAME

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
EDITOR OF THE "NEW REPUBLIC" AT

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
AGE 28.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
DURING THE RUN-UP TO THE

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
INVASION HE WAS ONE OF THE

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
HOTTEST YOUNG PUNDITS IN TOWN, A

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
LIBERAL HAWK, ACCUSING OPPONENTS

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
OF THE WAR OF BEING

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
"INTELLECTUALLY INCOHERENT" AND

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
ECHOING THE OFFICIAL LINE THAT

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
HUSSEIN WOULD SOON POSSESS A

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
NUCLEAR WEAPON.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
WE NEED A LITTLE BIT OF

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, BUT WE DON'T

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
NEED THE MORAL SUPPORT OF

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
ANYONE, BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
SIDE OF THE ANGELS IN THIS.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Moyers: HAD YOU BEEN TO IRAQ?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
NO.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Moyers: SO WHAT MADE YOU

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
PRESENT YOURSELF, IF YOU DID,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
AS... AS A MIDDLE EAST EXPERT?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I DON'T THINK THAT I

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
PRESENTED MYSELF AS A MIDDLE

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.000
EAST EXPERT, PER SE.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I WAS A POLITICAL JOURNALIST.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I WAS A... A COLUMNIST WRITING

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
SOMEONE IN MY... IN MY POSITION

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
IS NOT A MIDDLE EAST EXPERT IN

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
THE WAY THAT SOMEBODY WHO

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
STUDIES THIS AT A UNIVERSITY IS,

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
OR EVEN AT A THINK TANK.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
BUT I CONSUMED THAT STUFF.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I WAS RELYING ON PEOPLE WHO DID

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
THAT KIND OF REPORTING AND

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
GOVERNMENT WHO HAD... WHO HAD

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED MATERIAL

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
FOR THEIR ASSESSMENT.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Moyers: AND YOU WOULD TALK TO

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
THEM AND THEY WOULD, IN EFFECT,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
BRIEF YOU, THE BACKGROUND ON

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
WHAT THEY KNEW?

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000
SOMETIMES, BUT...

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Moyers: I'M TRYING TO HELP

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
THE AUDIENCE UNDERSTAND.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
HOW DOES... YOU DESCRIBED

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
YOURSELF AS A POLITICAL... A

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
REPORTER OF POLITICAL OPINION,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:21.000
OR A JOURNALIST OF POLITICAL

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
OPINION.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
YEAH.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Moyers: HOW DO YOU GET THE

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
INFORMATION THAT ENABLES YOU TO

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
REACH THE CONCLUSION THAT YOU

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
DRAW AS A POLITICAL JOURNALIST?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
WELL, I WAS DOING MOSTLY, FOR

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
A LARGE PART IT, WAS READING...

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
READING THE STATEMENTS AND THE

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
THINGS THAT PEOPLE SAID.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I WAS NOT A BEAT REPORTER.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I WAS EDITING A MAGAZINE AND

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
WRITING A COLUMN.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
SO, I WAS NOT DOING A LOT OF

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:38.000
PRIMARY REPORTING.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
BUT WHAT I WAS DOING WAS A LOT

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
OF READING OF OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
REPORTING AND READING OF WHAT

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
OFFICIALS WERE SAYING.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Moyers: IF WE JOURNALISTS GET

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
IT WRONG ON THE FACTS, WHAT IS

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
THERE TO BE RIGHT ABOUT?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
WELL, I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
POINT, BUT THE ARGUMENT IN THE

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
FALL OF 2002 WAS NOT MOSTLY

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
ABOUT THE FACTS; IT WAS ABOUT A

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
WHOLE SERIES OF IDEAS ABOUT WHAT

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
WOULD HAPPEN IF WE INVADED.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Moyers: WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
GET AT IS HOW DOES THE PUBLIC

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
SORT ALL OF THIS OUT FROM OUT

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
THERE BEYOND THE BELTWAY?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
FAR MORE PEOPLE SAW YOU, SEE

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
BILL KRISTOL ON TELEVISION, THAN

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.000
WILL EVER READ THE ASSOCIATED

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.000
PRESS REPORTS OR THE KNIGHT

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
RIDDER REPORTERS.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
ISN'T THERE AN IMBALANCE THEN,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
ON WHAT THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
PERCEIVE ABOUT A CRITICAL ISSUE

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
OF LIFE AND DEATH LIKE... LIKE

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
WAR?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
PEOPLE... LOOK, WOULD IT BE

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
BETTER IF TELEVISION WERE NOT

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
THE PRIMARY MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
PEOPLE GOT THEIR NEWS?

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
YES.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT... I DO

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000
TELEVISION, BUT I'M PRIMARILY IN

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
THE BUSINESS OF WRITING AND

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
EDITING BECAUSE I BELIEVE

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
ULTIMATELY THAT WORDS CAN CONVEY

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
MORE, RICHER INFORMATION THAN

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
TELEVISION.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
WOULDN'T WE BE A BETTER SOCIETY

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
IF PEOPLE GOT MOST OF THEIR NEWS

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
FROM PRINT RATHER THAN

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
TELEVISION?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
YES, I THINK WE WOULD.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000
ONE OF THE GREAT PRESSURES

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
WE'RE FACING IN JOURNALISM NOW

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
IS IT'S A LOT CHEAPER TO HIRE

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
THUMB-SUCKERS AND PUNDITS AND

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
HAVE TALK SHOWS ON THE AIR THAN

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000
ACTUALLY HAVE BUREAUS AND

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
REPORTERS.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
AND IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
WHEN EVERYBODY'S A PUNDIT, WE'RE

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
STILL GOING TO NEED SOMEBODY

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
THERE TO GO TALK TO THE

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
COLONELS, TO BE ON THE GROUND IN

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
BAGHDAD AND STUFF, AND THAT'S

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
VERY EXPENSIVE.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
REPORTING IS HARD.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
THE SUBSTITUTE FOR REPORTING FAR

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
TOO OFTEN HAS BECOME, "LET'S

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
JUST RING UP AN EXPERT.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
LET'S SEE.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
THESE ARE EXPERTS ON

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
INTERNATIONAL ARMAMENTS.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
AND I'LL JUST GO DOWN THE LIST

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
HERE AND CHECK RICHARD PERLE."

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
ONCE IT BEGINS TO LOOK AS

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
THOUGH HE IS RELINQUISHING HIS

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
GRIP ON POWER, I THINK HE'S

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
TOAST.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:24.000
THE CHOICE IS DISARMING HIM

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
BY WAR OR LETTING HIM HAVE HIS

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
THIS IS JOURNALISM ON THE

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
CHEAP IF IT'S JOURNALISM AT ALL.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
JUST PICK UP THE PHONE, CALL AN

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
EXPERT, BRING AN EXPERT INTO THE

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
STUDIO.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
EASY, NOT TIME CONSUMING,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
DOESN'T TAKE RESOURCES.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
AND IF YOU... IF YOU'RE LUCKY

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
AND GOOD WITH YOUR LIST OF

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
PEOPLE, YOU GET AN ARTICULATE

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
PERSON WHO WILL KIND OF SPARK UP

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
THE BROADCAST.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.000
THE PEOPLE AT KNIGHT RIDDER

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
WERE CALLING THE COLONELS AND

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
THE LIEUTENANTS AND THE PEOPLE

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
IN THE C.I.A. AND FINDING OUT,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
YOU KNOW, THAT INTELLIGENCE IS

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
NOT VERY GOOD.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000
WE SHOULD'VE ALL BEEN DOING

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
THAT.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Moyers: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
THAT THE FURTHER YOU GET AWAY

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
FROM OFFICIAL WASHINGTON, THE

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
CLOSER YOU GET TO REALITY?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
THAT'S ONE OF THE HAZARDS IN

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
THIS BUSINESS IS WHEN YOU RELY

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
ON TOP LEVEL SOURCES TOO MUCH,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
YOU CAN LOSE OUT ON GETTING THE

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
REAL INFORMATION.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
THE PRESIDENT'S TOP NATIONAL

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
SECURITY ADVISORS FANNED OUT ON

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
THE TALK SHOWS WITH A

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
COORDINATED MESSAGE.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
THE TEST HERE IS NOT WHETHER

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
THEY CAN FIND SOMETHING.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
THE TEST IS WHETHER OR NOT IRAQ

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
IS GOING TO COOPERATE.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
THIS IS ABOUT THE DISARMAMENT

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
OF IRAQ, NOT ABOUT WEAPONS

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
INSPECTORS HUNTING AND PECKING

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND WE

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
JUST CAN'T KEEP HUNTING AND

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
PECKING AND LOOKING AND...

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
GENERALLY ARE POLITICAL RATHER

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
THAN PROFESSIONAL.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
AND THEIR FIRST LOYALTY IS TO A

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
POLITICAL PARTY OR TO A PERSON,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
NOT TO A BUREAUCRACY, NOT TO A

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
JOB.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
AND SO, WHAT YOU GET FROM THEM

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
IS SPIN.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I... LOOK, I'M A BLUE-COLLAR

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
GUY FROM BUFFALO.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I KNOW WHO MY SOURCES ARE.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
I WORK THEM VERY HARD.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
IT'S THE MID-LEVEL PEOPLE THAT

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
NOW...

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Moyers: THEY'RE THE ONES WHO

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
KNOW THE STORY?

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
WELL, THEY'RE WORKING ON THE

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:03.000
PROBLEM.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
AND THEY UNDERSTAND THE DETAIL

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
MUCH BETTER THAN A LOT OF THE

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
SO-CALLED POLICY MAKERS AND...

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
AND POLITICAL OFFICIALS.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Moyers: BUT THEY DON'T GET ON

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000
THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
NO.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
YOU... I MEAN, THEY DON'T WANT

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
TO BE, TRUST ME.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I MEAN, THEY CAN LOSE THEIR

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
JOBS, AND THEY KNOW IT.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
BUT THEY'RE... THEY CAN PROVIDE

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
INFORMATION, WHICH CAN HELP IN

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
ME CHALLENGING OR TRYING TO DRAW

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
OUT, SOMETIMES, THEIR BOSSES AND

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
OTHER PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Moyers: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
THE FACT THAT OF THE 414 IRAQ

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
STORIES BROADCAST ON NBC, ABC

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
AND CBS NIGHTLY NEWS FROM

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
SEPTEMBER 2002 UNTIL FEBRUARY

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
2003, ALMOST ALL THE STORIES

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
COULD BE TRACED BACK TO SOURCES

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, THE

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
PENTAGON, AND THE STATE

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
DEPARTMENT?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
A... AN OPPOSITION PARTY.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
THAT'S OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Moyers: SO, IT'S NOT NEWS

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
UNLESS THERE'S SOMEBODY...

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
NO, NO, NO.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
OPPOSITION PARTY, YOUR

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
OPPOSIT... OPPOSING VIEWS.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
MORE AND MORE IN... THE MEDIA

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
BECOME, I THINK, COMMON CARRIERS

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
OF ADMINISTRATION STATEMENTS,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
AND CRITICS OF THE

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
ADMINISTRATION.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.000
AND WE'VE SORT OF GIVEN UP BEING

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
INDEPENDENT ON OUR OWN.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
WE USED TO DO AT THE "POST"

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
SOMETHING CALLED TRUTH SQUADING.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
PRESIDENT WOULD MAKE A SPEECH...

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
WE USED TO DO IT WITH RONALD

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
REAGAN THE FIRST FIVE OR SIX

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
MONTHS BECAUSE HE WOULD MAKE SO

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
MANY FACTUAL ERRORS,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
PARTICULARLY IN HIS PRESS

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
CONFERENCE.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
FROM $10,000 TO $60,000 A

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
YEAR...

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
AND AFTER TWO OR THREE WEEKS

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
OF IT, THE PUBLIC AT LARGE,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
WOULD SAY, "WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
THE MAN ALONE?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.000
HE'S TRYING TO BE HONEST.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
HE MAKES MISTAKES.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
SO WHAT?"

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
AND WE STOPPED DOING IT.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Moyers: YOU STOPPED BEING THE

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
TRUTH SQUAD?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
WE STOPPED TRUTH SQUADING

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
EVERY SORT OF PRESS CONFERENCE,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
OR TRUTH SQUADING.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
AND WE LEFT IT THEN TO THE

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
DEMOCRATS.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S UP TO THE

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
DEMOCRATS TO CATCH PEOPLE, NOT

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
US.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Moyers: SO, IF THE DEMOCRATS

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
CHALLENGED A STATEMENT FROM THE

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
PRESIDENT, YOU COULD QUOTE BOTH

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
SIDES.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
WE THEN QUOTE BOTH SIDES,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
YEAH.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Moyers: NOW, THAT'S CALLED

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
OBJECTIVITY BY MANY STANDARDS,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
ISN'T IT?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
WELL, THAT'S OBJECTIVITY IF

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
YOU THINK THERE ARE ONLY TWO

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
SIDES AND IF YOU'RE NOT

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
INTERESTED IN THE FACTS.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
AND THE FACTS ARE SEPARATE FROM,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
YOU KNOW, WHAT ONE SIDE SAYS

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
ABOUT THE OTHER.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Moyers: BY LATE NOVEMBER

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
2002, THE PRESS HAD YET ANOTHER

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
CHANCE TO GET THE FACTS RIGHT.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
FACING INTENSE INTERNATIONAL

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
PRESSURE, THE WHITE HOUSE AGREED

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
TO HOLD OFF MILITARY ACTION

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
UNTIL SADDAM HUSSEIN PERMITTED A

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
TEAM OF U.N. INSPECTORS TO

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
RETURN TO IRAQ AND TAKE A CLOSER

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
LOOK.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
THE FIRST INSPECTIONS BEGAN ON

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
NOVEMBER 27.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
CHARLES HANLEY, A PRIZE WINNING

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
REPORTER FOR THE ASSOCIATED

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
PRESS WITH MORE THAN 30 YEARS

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
EXPERIENCE REPORTING ON WEAPONS

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
ISSUES, WENT ALONG TO COVER

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
THEIR WORK.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
WHAT WE DID WAS GO OUT EVERY

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
DAY WITH THE INSPECTORS.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
THESE GUYS WOULD ROAR OUT ON

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
THESE MOTORCADES AT VERY HIGH

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
SPEED AND ROAR THROUGH TOWNS AND

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
DO SUDDEN U-TURNS AND... AND

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
DRIVE OVER LAND AND DO ALL OF

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
THESE THINGS TO CONFUSE THE

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
IRAQIS ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
GOING SO THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
A CALL AHEAD TELLING...TELLING

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
THEM TO PUT AWAY ALL THE BAD

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
STUFF.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
THE INSPECTORS THEN WOULD ISSUE

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
A DAILY REPORT.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
AND AS IT TURNED OUT, OF COURSE,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
INSPECTION AFTER INSPECTION, IT

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.000
TURNED OUT TO BE CLEAN.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
THEY HAD NOTHING TO REPORT, NO

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
VIOLATIONS TO REPORT.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Moyers: IN JANUARY OF ¡03

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
HANLEY WROTE ABOUT THE

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
SUSPICIOUS SITES THAT THE U.S.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
AND BRITISH GOVERNMENTS HAD

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
EARLIER IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
CONCERNS.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
"NO SMOKING GUNS IN... ALMOST

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
400 INSPECTIONS," HE REPORTED.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
IT OUGHT TO HAVE CAST SERIOUS

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
DOUBT ON THE WHITE HOUSE'S

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.000
ENTIRE EVALUATION OF THE IRAQI

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
THREAT.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
BUT REPORTING LIKE THIS WAS

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
OVERSHADOWED BY THE DRUMBEAT

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
FROM WASHINGTON, WHICH IS WHY,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
HANLEY SAYS, SOMETIMES HIS

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
EDITORS BALKED WHEN HE WROTE

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE LACKED FIRM

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
EVIDENCE ON W.M.D.s.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
AND THAT WOULD BE STRICKEN

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
FROM MY COPY BECAUSE IT WOULD

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
STRIKE SOME EDITORS AS A... AS

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
CONTENTIOUS, AS SORT OF AN

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
ATTACK OR SOME SORT OF

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
ALLEGATION RATHER THAN A FACT,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
YOU KNOW, AND "WE DON'T WANT OUR

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
REPORTERS ALLEGING THINGS.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
WE, YOU KNOW, WE JUST REPORT THE

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
FACTS."

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
WELL, IT WAS A FACT.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT FACT

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
THAT SEEMED TO BE LOST ON AN

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
AWFUL LOT OF JOURNALISTS,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Moyers: SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
INVASION, WITH THE FACTS STILL

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
IN SHORT SUPPLY, THE AMERICAN

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
SECRETARY OF STATE WENT BEFORE

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
THE UNITED NATIONS.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I CANNOT TELL YOU EVERYTHING

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
THAT WE KNOW.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
BUT WHAT I CAN SHARE WITH YOU,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
WHEN COMBINED WITH WHAT ALL OF

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
US HAVE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS,

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
IS DEEPLY TROUBLING.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
ONE MAJOR PROBLEM WAS THAT

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
SECRETARY POWELL BARELY

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WERE

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
INSPECTIONS GOING ON.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
IT GOT TO RIDICULOUS POINTS,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
SUCH AS HIS COMPLAINING ABOUT

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
THE FACT THAT THEY'D PUT A ROOF

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
OVER THIS OPEN AIR SHED WHERE

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
THEY WERE TESTING MISSILES.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
THIS PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN IN

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
APRIL OF 2002.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
SINCE THEN, THE TEST STAND HAS

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
BEEN FINISHED AND A ROOF HAS

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
BEEN PUT OVER IT SO IT WILL BE

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000
HARDER FOR SATELLITES TO SEE

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH THE

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
TEST STAND.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
WHAT HE NEGLECTED TO MENTION

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
WAS THAT THE INSPECTORS WERE

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
UNDERNEATH, WATCHING WHAT WAS

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
GOING ON.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
A SINGLE DROP OF V. X. ON THE

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
SKIN WILL KILL IN MINUTES.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
FOUR TONS.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
HE DIDN'T POINT OUT THAT MOST

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
OF THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
DESTROYED.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
AND ON POINT AFTER POINT, HE

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
FAILED TO POINT OUT THAT THESE

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
FACILITIES ABOUT WHICH HE WAS

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
RAISING SUCH ALARM WERE UNDER

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
REPEATED INSPECTIONS BY... BY

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
GOOD... EXPERT PEOPLE WITH VERY

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
GOOD EQUIPMENT, AND WHO WERE

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
LEAVING BEHIND CAMERAS AND OTHER

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
MONITORING EQUIPMENT TO KEEP

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
US... A CONTINUING EYE ON IT.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
LEAVING SADDAM HUSSEIN IN

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
POSSESSION OF WEAPONS OF MASS

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
DESTRUCTION FOR A FEW MORE

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
MONTHS OR YEARS IS NOT AN

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
OPTION, NOT IN A POST-SEPTEMBER

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
11 WORLD.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
THE HOLES IN THE...HIS

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
PRESENTATION BECAME IMMEDIATE

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
WITHIN DAYS IF NOT HOURS.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.000
BUT WHAT I WANT TO BRING TO

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
YOUR ATTENTION TODAY IS THE

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
POTENTIALLY MUCH MORE SINISTER

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
NEXUS BETWEEN IRAQ AND THE AL

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
QAEDA TERRORIST NETWORK, A NEXUS

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
THAT COMBINES CLASSIC TERRORIST

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
ORGANIZATIONS AND MODERN METHODS

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
OF MURDER.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
ONE OF THE FIRST BIG

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
EMBARRASSMENTS WAS POWELL HAD

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
TALKED ABOUT THIS BRITISH

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.000
INTELLIGENCE REPORT.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
I WOULD CALL MY COLLEAGUES'

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000
ATTENTION TO THE FINE PAPER THAT

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
UNITED KINGDOM DISTRIBUTED

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
YESTERDAY, WHICH DESCRIBES IN

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
EXQUISITE DETAIL IRAQI DECEPTION

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
ACTIVITIES.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Moyers: SUPPOSEDLY THAT

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
"EXQUISITE DETAIL" FROM BRITISH

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
INTELLIGENCE CAME FROM A TOP-

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
SECRET DOSSIER.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.000
LITERALLY WITHIN A DAY OR TWO

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
IT WAS... IT WAS PROVEN IN

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
THE... IN THE BRITISH PRESS THAT

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000
THAT HAD SIMPLY BEEN DOWNLOADED

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
OFF THE INTERNET AND WAS

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
PLAGIARIZED.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
AND IT ACTUALLY CONTAINS THE

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
TYPOS THAT WERE IN THE ORIGINAL.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.000
THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000
DOSSIER IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
IRAQI DECEPTION AND CONCEALMENT.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
IT SAYS IT DRAWS UPON A NUMBER

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
OF SOURCES, INCLUDING

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
INTELLIGENCE MATERIAL.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
WELL, ACTUALLY, WHAT IT LARGELY

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
DRAWS ON IS A THESIS WRITTEN BY

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
A CALIFORNIAN POST-GRADUATE

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
STUDENT.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
THAT WAS JUST THE FIRST OF

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
MANY EMBARRASSMENTS THAT WERE TO

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
COME.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000
BUT WITHIN DAYS, THE BRITISH

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
PRESS WAS GOING CRAZY OVER

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
THIS... OVER THIS REVELATION.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
AS FOR THE STUDENT HIMSELF,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
HE'S ACCUSED THE GOVERNMENT OF

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000
PLAGIARISM.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
IF THE GOVERNMENT IS REDUCED

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
TO TRAWLING ACADEMIC JOURNALS,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
THEN HOW GOOD IS THE REST OF ITS

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
CASE FOR WAR AGAINST IRAQ?

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Moyers: FEW PROMINENT

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
AMERICAN BROADCASTERS WOULD ASK

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
SUCH POINTED QUESTIONS:

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
THE SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
POWELL HAS MADE THE CASE AGAINST

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
IRAQ.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
POWELL HAS GIVEN A LOT OF

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
IMPORTANT SPEECHES IN HIS

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
LIFETIME TO A LOT OF LARGE

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
AUDIENCES, BUT NO SPEECH WAS

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE ONE HE

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
GAVE TODAY.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
IN THE UNITED NATION SECURITY

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
COUNCIL THIS MORNING, THE

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
SECRETARY OF STATE COLIN POWELL

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
TOOK ALMOST AN HOUR AND A HALF

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
TO MAKE THE BUSH

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
ADMINISTRATION'S CASE AGAINST

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
SADDAM HUSSEIN.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
MAKING THE CASE FOR WAR:

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
SECRETARY POWELL SHOWS THE WORLD

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
WHAT HE CALLS "UNDENIABLE

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
PROOF."

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
COLIN POWELL WAS TRUSTED--

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
IS TRUSTED, I'D PUT IT, IN A

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
SENSE.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
HE, UNLIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
WHO MADE THE DECISIONS TO GO TO

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
WAR, COLIN POWELL HAS SEEN WAR.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
HE KNOWS WHAT A GREEN JUNGLE

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
HELL VIETNAM WAS.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
HE KNOWS WHAT THE BATTLEFIELD

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
LOOKS LIKE.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
AND WHEN COLIN POWELL SAYS TO

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000
YOU, "I, COLIN POWELL, AM

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
PUTTING MY PERSONAL STAMP ON

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
THIS INFORMATION.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
IT'S MY NAME, MY FACE, AND I'M

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
PUTTING IT OUT THERE," THAT DID

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Moyers: AND YOU WERE

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
IMPRESSED.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000
I WAS IMPRESSED.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:53.000
AND WHO WOULDN'T BE?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
AND YOU LOOK AT THE RESPONSE

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
FROM-- FORGET ABOUT THE RIGHT-

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
WING MEDIA-- FROM THE SO-CALLED

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
LIBERAL PRESS THE NEXT MORNING.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
YOU PICK UP THE "WASHINGTON

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
POST," ON THE OP-ED PAGE,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
THERE'S JIM HOAGLAND SAYING,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
"OBVIOUSLY, FROM WHAT POWELL

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
SAID, THERE ARE WEAPONS OF MASS

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ."

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
YOU GO A FEW INCHES AWAY TO

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
RICHARD COHEN, AN AVOWED

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
LIBERAL, HE SAYS, "OBVIOUSLY

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
THERE ARE WEAPONS OF MASS

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
DESTRUCTION."

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
I MEAN, IT'S A FAIR PARAPHRASE

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
TO SAY THESE PUNDITS AND MANY

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
OTHERS WERE ASSERTING "IF YOU

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
DON'T THINK THERE ARE W.M.D.s IN

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
IRAQ, YOU ARE AN IDIOT."

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Moyers: ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
EDITORIAL WRITERS BOUGHT WHAT

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000
POWELL WAS SELLING.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
THESE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
MOST DISCERNING, SOPHISTICATED

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
JOURNALISTS IN THE COUNTRY

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
WRITING THIS STUFF, AND THEY

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:05.000
WERE TOTALLY BAMBOOZLED.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
AND SURE ENOUGH, IN THE

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
NEWSPAPERS, IF YOU LOOKED VERY

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
HARD INSIDE IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
IN THE COVERAGE, YOU COULD FIND

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
REALLY SERIOUS QUESTIONS THAT

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
WERE RAISED ABOUT THIS.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
BUT THEY WERE VERY MUCH PUSHED

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
ASIDE.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Moyers: THIS GETS US RIGHT TO

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
THE HEART OF THE DEBATE THAT'S

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
GOING ON NOW IN OUR CRAFT.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
WE LEAN HEAVILY IN REPORTING ON

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.000
WHAT THEY SAY.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Moyers: "WE WANT NO WIDER

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
WAR."

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
"I'M NOT A CROOK."

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.000
"MUSHROOM CLOUD."

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
"WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION."

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
WE REALLY GIVE HEAVY WEIGHT TO

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
WHAT PUBLIC OFFICIALS SAY.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
WELL, THAT'S TRUE, AND WE

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
NEED TO ADDRESS THAT.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
IN THE END IT WAS, "LOOK, THE

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
PRESIDENT HIMSELF SAYS THESE

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
THINGS ARE SO.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
HE STANDS BEFORE THE CONGRESS

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
WITH THE QUESTION OF WAR AND

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
PEACE HANGING IN THE BALANCE AND

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
SAYS THESE THINGS."

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000
AND THERE WAS A FEELING, NOT

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
JUST WITH MYSELF; GIVEN ALL

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000
THAT, WHO AM I TO SAY, "YOU KNOW

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
WHAT, I THINK IT'S ALL A

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000
MACHIAVELLIAN SCHEME TO TAKE US

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000
INTO IRAQ."

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
BIG NEWS TODAY IN THE CABLE

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
WORLD, ELLEN: PHIL DONAHUE

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
CANCELLED BY THAT OTHER NETWORK.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Moyers: 22 DAYS BEFORE THE

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
INVASION, YOUR SHOW WAS

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
CANCELED.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
IT SHOULD BE SAID THAT WE DID

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
FAIRLY WELL IN THE RATINGS.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
WE DID NOT BURN THE TOWN DOWN.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
NOBODY ON MSNBC DID.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
BUT WE WERE CERTAINLY AS GOOD AS

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
ANYBODY ELSE ON THE NETWORK.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
AND OFTEN, OFTEN WE LED THE

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
NETWORK.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Moyers: IN DUMPING DONAHUE,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
NBC CITED RATINGS.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
BUT A BLOGGER GOT HIS HANDS ON

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
AN INTERNAL MEMO AND THE PRESS

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
PICKED IT UP.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
NOW THAT MEMO SAID, "DONOHUE

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
PRESENTS A DIFFICULT PUBLIC FACE

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
FOR NBC IN A TIME OF WAR.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
AT THE SAME TIME, OUR

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
COMPETITORS ARE WAVING THE FLAG

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY."

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT MEMO AT

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000
THE TIME?

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
NO, NO.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT TILL I

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000
READ ABOUT IT IN THE "NEW YORK

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000
TIMES."

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Moyers: WHAT DID YOU THINK...

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
WHAT... WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
YOU?

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
THAT DISSENT IS UNPATRIOTIC?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
WELL, NOT ONLY UNPATRIOTIC,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
TONIGHT, THE CASE FOR WAR.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
SHOWDOWN IRAQ, WITH WOLF

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
BLITZER.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I THINK THESE EXECUTIVES WERE

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
TERRIFIED OF BEING CALLED SOFT

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
ON TERRORISM.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
THEY ABSOLUTELY KNEW THAT THE

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
WINDS WERE BLOWING AT HURRICANE

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
FORCE POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000
AND RATHER THAN STAND UP FOR

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
JOURNALISM, THEY JUST BLEW WITH

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
THE WIND.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
AND DAN RATHER AND OTHERS WHO

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
SAY, "YEAH, YOU KNOW, I WAS

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
CARRIED AWAY BACK THEN."

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.000
WELL, SURE.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
THAT'S WHEN IT MATTERS.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
WHEN IT MATTERS MOST IS WHEN YOU

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AS A

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
JOURNALIST.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
FEAR IS IN EVERY NEWSROOM IN

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
THE COUNTRY.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
AND FEAR OF WHAT?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
WELL, IT'S THE FEAR IF... IT'S A

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
COMBINATION OF IF YOU DON'T GO

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
ALONG TO GET ALONG, YOU'RE GOING

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
TO GET THE REPUTATION OF BEING A

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
TROUBLEMAKER.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
THERE'S ALSO THE FEAR THAT, YOU

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.000
KNOW, PARTICULARLY IN...IN

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
NETWORKS, THEY'VE BECOME HUGE,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
INTERNATIONAL CONGLOMERATES.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
THEY HAVE BIG NEEDS, LEGISLATIVE

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
NEEDS, REGULATORY NEEDS IN

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
WASHINGTON.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
NOBODY HAS TO SEND YOU A MEMO TO

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
TELL YOU THAT THAT'S THE CASE.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
YOU KNOW, AND THAT PUTS A SEED

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
IN YOUR MIND OF, WELL, IF YOU

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
STICK YOUR NECK OUT, IF YOU TAKE

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
THE RISK OF GOING AGAINST THE

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
GRAIN WITH YOUR REPORTING, IS

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
ANYBODY GOING TO BACK YOU UP?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
THE MEDIA JUST CONTINUED ON

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
THIS PATH OF REPORTING, "WELL,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ALLEGES

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
THAT THERE ARE W.M.D," AND NEVER

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
REALLY STOPPED AND SAID, "IT

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE ARE.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE."

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE SECOND

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.000
SENTENCE IN ANY STORY ABOUT THE

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
ALLEGATIONS OF W.M.D.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000
THE SECOND SENTENCE SHOULD HAVE

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
BEEN, "BUT THEY DID NOT PRESENT

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
ANY EVIDENCE TO BACK THIS UP."

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SENDING YOUNG

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
MEN AND WOMEN, AND NOWADAYS NOT

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
SO YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN, TO RISK

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
THEIR LIVES.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
AND EVERYONE WANTS TO BE BEHIND

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
THEM AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
BEHIND THEM.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
THE QUESTION FOR US IN

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
JOURNALISM IS, ARE WE REALLY

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
BEHIND THEM WHEN WE FAIL TO DO

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
OUR JOBS?

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
IS THAT REALLY THE KIND OF

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
SUPPORT THAT THEY DESERVE?

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000
OR ARE WE REALLY, IN THE LONG

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
RUN, SERVING THEM BETTER BY

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
ASKING THESE HARD QUESTIONS

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
ABOUT WHAT WE'VE ASKED THEM TO

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
DO?

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
GOOD MORNING.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
SHOCK AND AWE.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
REPORTS OF SECRET SURRENDER

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000
TALKS AS U.S. BOMBS HIT

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.000
BAGHDAD.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000
THIS CBS NEWS SPECIAL REPORT

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
IS PART OF OUR CONTINUING

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
COVERAGE OF AMERICA AT WAR.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Moyers: FOUR YEARS AFTER

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
SHOCK AND AWE, THE PRESS HAS YET

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
TO COME TO TERMS WITH ITS ROLE

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000
IN ENABLING THE BUSH

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
ADMINISTRATION TO GO TO WAR ON

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
FALSE PRETENSES.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
PETER BEINERT IS ALMOST ALONE IN

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.000
ADMITTING HE WAS MISTAKEN.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
WHERE I THINK I WAS

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
TRAGICALLY WRONG WAS NOT TO SEE

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
IN FEBRUARY, MARCH 2003, AFTER

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
WE GOT THE INSPECTORS BACK IN ON

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000
THE GROUND AND WE BEGAN TO LEARN

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
MUCH MORE ABOUT WHAT HAD BEEN

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
GOING ON IN IRAQ THAN WE HAD

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
KNOWN IN 2002, WHEN WE HAD NO

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
ONE ON THE GROUND, THAT THAT

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
ASSUMPTION WAS BEING PROVEN

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
WRONG.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Moyers: YOU SAY TRAGICALLY

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
WRONG.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
BECAUSE I THINK THE WAR HAS

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
BEEN A TRAGIC DISASTER.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I MEAN, THE AMERICANS KILLED,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
THE IRAQIS KILLED.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
IT'S TRUE, LIFE UNDER SADDAM WAS

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000
HELL, BUT CAN ONE REALLY SAY

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
THAT LIFE FOR IRAQIS IS BETTER

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
TODAY?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Moyers: WE WANTED TO TALK TO

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
SOME OTHERS IN THE MEDIA ABOUT

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
THEIR ROLE IN THE RUN UP TO THE

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
WAR.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
JUDITH MILLER, WHO LEFT THE

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
"TIMES" AFTER BECOMING EMBROILED

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
IN A WHITE HOUSE LEAK SCANDAL

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
DECLINED OUR REQUEST ON LEGAL

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
GROUNDS.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000
THE "TIMES'" LIBERAL HAWK THOMAS

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
FRIEDMAN ALSO SAID NO.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
SO DID BILL SAFIRE, WHO HAD

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
PREDICTED IRAQ WOULD NOW BE

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
LEADING THE ARAB WORLD TO

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
DEMOCRACY.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
PRESIDENT BUSH RECENTLY AWARDED

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
HIM THE MEDAL OF FREEDOM.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
THE "WASHINGTON POST'S" CHARLES

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
KRAUTHAMMER ALSO TURNED US DOWN.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
SO DID ROGER AILES, THE MAN IN

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
CHARGE OF FOX NEWS.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
HE DECLINED BECAUSE, AN

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
ASSISTANT TOLD US, HE'S WRITING

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
A BOOK ON HOW FOX HAS CHANGED

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000
THE FACE OF AMERICAN

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000
BROADCASTING AND DOESN'T WANT TO

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
SCOOP HIMSELF.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
WILLIAM KRISTOL LED THE MARCH TO

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
BAGHDAD BEHIND A BATTERY OF

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
WASHINGTON MICROPHONES.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
HE HAS NOT RESPONDED TO ANY OF

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000
OUR REQUESTS FOR AN INTERVIEW

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
BUT HE STILL SHOWS UP ON TV AS

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
AN EXPERT, MOST OFTEN ON FOX

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
NEWS.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000
AND HE'S GOT TO BEGIN TO SHOW

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
PROGRESS IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
MONTHS ONCE THE U.S. TROOPS GET

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000
IN.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
BEING A PRO-WAR PUNDIT MEANS

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
SORRY.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000
I MEAN, THESE WERE PEOPLE WHO

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
WERE LAYING OUT THE BLUEPRINT

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
FOR THE WAR ABOUT HOW IT WAS

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
GOING TO UNFOLD.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
AND, IT TURNS OUT, COULDN'T HAVE

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
BEEN MORE WRONG EVERY WHICH WAY.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT...

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
AND IT'S ASTONISHING TO SEE

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
THEM STILL ON TV INVITED ON AS

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
EXPERTS IN THE REGION.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Moyers: IT'S TRUE, SO MANY OF
