PROGRAMMING A MODERN COMPUTER.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.100
THE ENIAC WAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.330
"MACHINES, AND IN SOME WAYS"

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.330

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.600
MACHINE INTO ANOTHER IN A PATH

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.160
THAT WOULD SOLVE YOUR PARTICULAR

"PROBLEM, AND
PROGRAMMING<P>BECOMES"

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.830
MUCH MORE THAN THAT AS COMPUTERS

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.860
BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:14.460
"ON THE OTHER HAND,
I DO THINK IT"

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.530

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.100
TIME AND TODAY.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.560

"JEAN BARTIK, SHE WILL TELL YOU"

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.400
THE IMPORTANT ROLE SHE HAD IN

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.700

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.030
FIGURING OUT WHAT WAS WRONG--

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.460
AND VERY QUICKLY I THINK PEOPLE

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:33.360
REALIZED THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.360
MACHINE; IT'S THE MACHINE PLUS

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.300

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.260

00:41:43.260 --> 00:42:08.230
