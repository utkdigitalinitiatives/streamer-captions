00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800


2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.000


3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.330
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,

4
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.570
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870
He does confess he feels himself distracted;

7
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.170
But from what cause will by no means speak.

8
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.300
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.430
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.530
When we would bring him on to some confession

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.930
Of his true state.

12
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.500
Did he receive you well?

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.670
Most like a gentleman.

14
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.530
But with much forcing of his disposition.

15
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.400
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,

16
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.870
Most free in his reply.

17
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.400
Did you assay him to any pastime?

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.630
Madam, it so fell out

19
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.770
that certain players We o'er-raught on the way:

20
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.730
of these we told him; And there did seem in him

21
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.170
a kind of joy To hear of it.

22
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200
They are here about the court, And, as I think,

23
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.630
they have already order This night to play before him.

24
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.930
This is most true.

25
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.970
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties

26
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.470
To hear and see the matter.

27
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.670
With all my heart;

28
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.630
and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined.

29
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.770
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,

30
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.030
And drive his purpose into these delights.

31
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.400
We shall, my lord.

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.200
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;

33
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.100
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither

34
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.170
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here affront Ophelia.

35
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.330
Her father and myself, lawful espials,

36
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,

37
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.070
We may of their encounter frankly judge,

38
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
And gather by him, as he is behaved,

39
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.230
If be the affliction of his love or no

40
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.830
That thus he suffers for.

41
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.030
I shall obey you.

42
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.000
And for your part, Ophelia,

43
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.600
I do wish That your good beauties

44
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.970
be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness.

45
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.100
So shall I hope your virtues

46
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.530
Will bring him to his wonted ways again,

47
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.500
To both your honours.

48
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.270
Madam, I wish it may.

49
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.300
Ophelia, walk you here.

50
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.200
Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.

51
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.670
Read on this book

52
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.100
That show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness.

53
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.470
We are oft to blame in this-- 'Tis too much proved--

54
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.530
that with devotion's visage And pious action

55
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.630
we do sugar o'er The devil himself.

56
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.370
O, 'tis too true!

57
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.370
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!

58
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.770
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,

59
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.830
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

60
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.130
Than is my deed to my most painted word.

61
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.370
O heavy burden!

62
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.900
I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.

63
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.070
To be, or not to be...

64
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.200
That is the question:

65
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.900
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

66
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.570
to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

67
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.530
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

68
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.800
And by opposing end them?

69
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.830
To die...

70
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.130
To sleep.

71
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.800
No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache

72
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.770
and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to,

73
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.470
'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd.

74
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.630
To die, to sleep...

75
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.000
To sleep: perchance to dream.

76
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.330
Ay, there's the rub;

77
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.970
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

78
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.400
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,

79
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.570
Must give us pause.

80
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.170
There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life;

81
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.100
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

82
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.800
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,

83
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.930
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,

84
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.330
The insolence of office

85
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.370
and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes,

86
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.270
When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?

87
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.200
Who would these fardels bear,

88
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.870
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

89
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.500
But that the dread of something after death,

90
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.470
The undiscover'd country

91
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.530
from whose bourn No traveler returns,

92
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.670
puzzles the will

93
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.870
And makes us rather bear those ills we have

94
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.100
Than fly to others that we know not of?

95
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.670
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all;

96
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.500
And thus the native hue of resolution

97
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.630
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,

98
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.630
And enterprises of great pitch and moment

99
00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.570
With this regard their currents turn awry,

100
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.100
And lose the name of action.

101
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.970
Soft you now!

102
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.930
The fair Ophelia!

103
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:27.470
Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd.

104
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.830
Good my lord,

105
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.970
How does your honour for this many a day?

106
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.730
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

107
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.100
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,

108
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.170
That I have longed long to re-deliver;

109
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.530
I pray you, now receive them.

110
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.470
No, not I; I never gave you aught.

111
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.270
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;

112
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.930
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed

113
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.330
As made the things more rich.

114
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.670
Their perfume lost, Take these again;

115
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.430
for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor

116
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.030
when givers prove unkind.

117
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.130
There, my lord.

118
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.030
Oh.

119
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.330
Oh.

120
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.570
Are you honest?

121
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.670
My lord?

122
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.770
Are you fair?

123
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.970
What means your lordship?

124
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.370
That if you be honest and fair,

125
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.100
your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

126
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.200
Could beauty, my lord,

127
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.070
have better commerce than with honesty?

128
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.430
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty

129
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.430
will sooner transform honesty from what it is into a bawd

130
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.770
than the force of honesty can translate beauty

131
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.400
into his likeness.

132
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.830
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.

133
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.170
I did love you once.

134
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.070
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

135
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.830
You should not have believed me;

136
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.300
for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock

137
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.900
but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.

138
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.930
I was the more deceived.

139
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.100
Get thee to a nunnery.

140
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.270
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

141
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.270
I am myself indifferent honest;

142
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.000
but yet I could accuse me of such things

143
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.870
that it were better my mother had not borne me:

144
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.900
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,

145
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.170
with more offences at my beck

146
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:42.730
than I have thoughts to put them in,

147
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.100
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.

148
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.470
What should such fellows as I do

149
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.570
crawling between earth and heaven?

150
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.570
We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us.

151
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.970
Go thy ways to a nunnery.

152
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.230
Where's your father?

153
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.670
At home, my lord.

154
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.000
Let the doors be shut upon him

155
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.530
that he may play the fool no where but in his own house.

156
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.030
Farewell.

157
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.600
Help him, you sweet heavens!

158
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.530
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:

159
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.630
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,

160
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.030
thou shalt not escape calumny.

161
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.070
Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell.

162
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.270
Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool;

163
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:48.230
for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.

164
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.170
To a nunnery, go, and quickly too.

165
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.270
Farewell.

166
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.400
Heavenly powers, restore him!

167
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.630
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;

168
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.930
God has given you one face; you make yourselves another.

169
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.070
You jig, you amble, you lisp,

170
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.530
you nick-name God's creatures,

171
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.400
you make your wantonness your ignorance.

172
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.330
Go to, I'll no more on't.

173
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.170
It hath made me mad.

174
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:28.870
I say, we will have no more marriages:

175
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:33.830
those that are married already, all but one, shall live;

176
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.330
the rest shall keep as they are.

177
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.100
To a nunnery, go.

178
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.400
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!

179
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.770
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;

180
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.600
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,

181
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.000
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,

182
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.800
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!

183
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:20.730
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched

184
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.330
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,

185
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:28.970
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,

186
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:35.570
Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;

187
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.030
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth

188
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.800
Blasted with ecstasy:

189
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.670
O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen.

190
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.030
See what I see!

191
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.870
Love!

192
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.970
His affections do not that way tend;

193
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.300
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,

194
00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.500
Was not like madness.

195
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.070
There's something in his soul

196
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.800
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;

197
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.570
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose

198
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.070
Will be some danger: which to prevent,

199
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.930
I have in quick determination set it down.

200
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.370
He shall with speed to England

201
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.200
For the demand of our neglected tribute.

202
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.570
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects

203
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.100
shall expel This something-settled matter

204
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.730
in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating

205
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.270
puts him From fashion of himself.

206
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.370
What think you on't?

207
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.470
It shall do well:

208
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.400
but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief

209
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.370
Sprung from neglected love.

210
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.100
How now, Ophelia!

211
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.970
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;

212
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.730
We heard it all.

213
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.970
My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit,

214
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.000
after the play Let his queen mother

215
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.470
all alone entreat him To show his grief.

216
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.970
Let her be round with him;

217
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.370
I'll be placed, so please you,

218
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.600
in the ear Of all their conference.

219
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.400
If she find him not, To England send him,

220
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.070
or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.

221
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.300
It shall be so.

222
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.100
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

223
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.770
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,

224
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:57.100
trippingly on the tongue.

225
00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.530
but if you mouth it, as many of your players do,

226
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.200
I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.

227
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.870
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hands, thus,

228
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.130
but use all gently;

229
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.900
for in the very torrent, tempest, and,

230
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.470
as I may say, whirlwind of your passion,

231
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.270
you must acquire and beget a temperance

232
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.900
that may give it smoothness.

233
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.700
I warrant your honour.

234
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.000
Be not too tame neither,

235
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.770
but let your own discretion be your tutor.

236
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.330
Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;

237
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.770
with this special observance do o'erstep not

238
00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.070
the modesty of nature:

239
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.230
for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing,

240
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:40.130
whose end, both at the first and now

241
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.170
was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature;

242
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.630
to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image,

243
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:54.200
and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.

244
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.570
Now this overdone, or come tardy off,

245
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:00.430
though it make the unskillful laugh,

246
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.330
cannot but make the judicious grieve;

247
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.570
the censure of the which one must in your allowance

248
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.770
outweigh a whole theatre of others.

249
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:12.970
Go, make you ready.

250
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.100
How now, my lord!

251
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.470
Will the king hear this piece of work?

252
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.500
And the queen too, and that presently.

253
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.730
Bid the players make haste.

254
00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.870
Will you two help to hasten them?

255
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:27.930
We will, my lord.

256
00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.230
What ho, Horatio!

257
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.630
Here, sweet lord, at your service.

258
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.270
Horatio...

259
00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.600
Thou art e'en as just a man

260
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.030
As e'er my conversation coped withal.

261
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.170
O, my dear lord.

262
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.170
Nay, do not think I flatter;

263
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.030
For what advancement may I hope from thee

264
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.170
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits

265
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.130
To feed and clothe thee?

266
00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.700
Why should the poor be flatter'd?

267
00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.800
Dost thou hear?

268
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.130
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice

269
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.300
And could of men distinguish,

270
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.630
her election Hath seal'd thee for herself;

271
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.400
for thou hast been As one, in suffering all,

272
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.230
that suffers nothing,

273
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.800
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards

274
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.200
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those

275
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.670
Whose blood and judgment are so well comeddled

276
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.870
That they are not a pipe for fortune's fingers

277
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.870
To sound what stop she please.

278
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.330
Give me that man That is not passion's slave,

279
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.600
and I will wear him In my heart's core,

280
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.000
ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.

281
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.400
Something too much of this.

282
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.070
There is a play to-night before the king;

283
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.330
One scene of it comes near the circumstance

284
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.700
Which I have told thee of my father's death:

285
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.670
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,

286
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.330
Even with the very comment of thy soul

287
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.530
Observe my uncle: if his occulted guilt

288
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.200
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,

289
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.500
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,

290
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.770
And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy.

291
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:10.530
Well, my lord:

292
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.700
If he steal aught whilst this play is playing

293
00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.670
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

294
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.100
They are coming to the play;

295
00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.200
I must be idle. Get you a place.

296
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.900
Ah.

297
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.270
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

298
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:43.930
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish:

299
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:49.030
I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

300
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.800
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet;

301
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.100
these words are not mine.

302
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.300
No, nor mine now.

303
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.430
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

304
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.500
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

305
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.270
What did you enact?

306
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:16.200
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed in the Capitol.

307
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.100
Brutus killed me.

308
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.730
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.

309
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.230
Be the players ready?

310
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.100
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

311
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.600
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

312
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.900
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

313
00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.470
O, ho! Do you mark that?

314
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.230
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

315
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.870
No, my lord.

316
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.200
I mean, my head upon your lap?

317
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.800
Ay, my lord.

318
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.470
Do you think I meant country matters?

319
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.370
I think nothing, my lord.

320
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.930
That's a fair thought to lie between maid's legs.

321
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.030
What is't, my lord?

322
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.130
Nothing.

323
00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.230
You are merry, my lord.

324
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.330
Who, I?

325
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:00.500
Ay, my lord.

326
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.200
O God, your only jig-maker.

327
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.030
What should a man do but be merry?

328
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.770
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks,

329
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:11.170
and my father died within these two hours.

330
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.130
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

331
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.830
So long?

332
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.900
Nay then, let the devil wear black,

333
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.630
for I'll have a suit of sables.

334
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.930
O heavens!

335
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.170
Died two months and not forgotten yet?

336
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.470
Then there's hope a great man's memory

337
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.770
may outlive his life half a year.

338
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.870
What means this, my lord?

339
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:28.030
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

340
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.970
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

341
00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.830
We shall know by this fellow:

342
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.330
the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.

343
00:22:36.330 --> 00:22:41.870
For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency,

344
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.370
We beg your hearing patiently.

345
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.470
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

346
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.570
'Tis brief, my lord.

347
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.030
As woman's love.

348
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.370
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart

349
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.700
gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,

350
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.570
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen

351
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.030
About the world have times twelve thirties been,

352
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.070
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual

353
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:11.400
in most sacred bands.

354
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.970
So many journeys may the sun and moon

355
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.100
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!

356
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.070
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,

357
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.930
So far from cheer and from your former state,

358
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.000
That I distrust you.

359
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.730
Yet, though I distrust,

360
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.130
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:

361
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.330
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;

362
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:37.800
My operant powers their functions leave to do:

363
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.370
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,

364
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.830
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind

365
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.330
For husband shalt thou--

366
00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:48.570
O, confound the rest!

367
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.330
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:

368
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.830
In second husband let me be accurst!

369
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.270
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

370
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.170
Wormwood, wormwood.

371
00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:01.430
The instances that second marriage move

372
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:05.800
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.

373
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.170
A second time I kill my husband dead,

374
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.630
When second husband kisses me in bed.

375
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.630
I do believe you think what now you speak;

376
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.900
But what we do determine oft we break.

377
00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.970
Purpose is but the slave to memory,

378
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:22.070
Of violent birth but poor validity;

379
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:25.530
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;

380
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.130
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

381
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.700
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!

382
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.470
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!

383
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.330
To desperation turn my trust and hope!

384
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.130
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!

385
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.570
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy

386
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.300
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!

387
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.530
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,

388
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.970
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

389
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.070
If she should break it now!

390
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.400
'Tis deeply sworn.

391
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.930
Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull,

392
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.500
and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep.

393
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.430
Sleep rock thy brain,

394
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.270
And never come mischance between us twain!

395
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.870
Madam, how like you this play?

396
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.000
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

397
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.270
O, but she'll keep her word.

398
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.400
Have you heard the argument?

399
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.730
Is there no offence in 't?

400
00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.370
No, no, they do but jest,

401
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.670
poison in jest; no offence i' the world.

402
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.770
What do you call the play?

403
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.130
"The Mouse-trap."

404
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.230
Marry, how?

405
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:53.570
Tropically.

406
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.170
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna:

407
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.800
Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista:

408
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.830
you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work.

409
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.130
But what o' that?

410
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.970
Your majesty and we that have free souls,

411
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.230
it touches us not.

412
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:12.230
Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.

413
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:16.270
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

414
00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.830
Begin, murderer.

415
00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.830
Pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin.

416
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:28.870
Come: "the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge."

417
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:34.470
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;

418
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.830
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;

419
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.370
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,

420
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:45.770
With Hecat's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,

421
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.430
Thy natural magic and dire property

422
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.630
On wholesome life usurps immediately.

423
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.230
Ah!

424
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.670
He poisons him i' the garden for his estate.

425
00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:58.970
His name's Gonzago.

426
00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.300
The story is extant and writ in choice Italian.

427
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.470
You shall see anon

428
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:06.430
how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

429
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.630
The king rises.

430
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.800
What, frighted with false fire!

431
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.100
How fares my lord?

432
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.270
Give o'er the play.

433
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.270
Give me some light.

434
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.170
Away!

435
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.670
Lights, lights, lights!

436
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.870
Why,

437
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.730
Let the stricken deer go weep,

438
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.670
The hart ungalled play;

439
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.300
For some must watch while some must sleep:

440
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.070
Thus runs the world away.

441
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.330
O good Horatio,

442
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:05.370
I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound.

443
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.500
Didst perceive?

444
00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:07.600
Very well, my lord.

445
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.830
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

446
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.000
I did very well note him.

447
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.500
Ah, ha!

448
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.600
Come, some music!

449
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.070
Come, the recorders!

450
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.070
For if the king like not the comedy,

451
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.370
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.

452
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.600
Come, some music!

453
00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.600
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

454
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.700
Sir, the whole history.

455
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.800
The king, sir.

456
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.570
Ay, sir, what of him?

457
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.530
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered.

458
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.630
With drink, sir?

459
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.100
No, my lord, rather with choler.

460
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.500
Your wisdom should show itself

461
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.370
more richer to signify this to his doctor;

462
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.030
for, for me to put him to his purgation

463
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.500
would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.

464
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.400
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame

465
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.970
and start not so wildly from my affair.

466
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.530
I am tame, sir. Pronounce.

467
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.330
The queen, your mother,

468
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.770
in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

469
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.970
You are welcome.

470
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:03.100
Nay, good my lord,

471
00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.230
this courtesy is not of the right breed.

472
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.230
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer,

473
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.070
I will do your mother's commandment:

474
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.430
if not, your pardon and my return

475
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.630
shall be the end of my business.

476
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:13.270
Sir, I cannot.

477
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.200
What, my lord?

478
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.570
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased:

479
00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:23.630
but, sir, such answer as I can make,

480
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.800
you shall command;

481
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.370
or, rather, as you say, my mother.

482
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.470
Therefore no more, but to the matter:

483
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.670
my mother, you say--

484
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:31.170
Then thus she says;

485
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.770
your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration.

486
00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:38.370
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother!

487
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.700
Is there no sequel

488
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.900
at the heels of this mother's admiration?

489
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.230
Impart.

490
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.170
She desires to speak with you in her closet,

491
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.600
ere you go to bed.

492
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.400
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.

493
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.900
Have you any further trade with us?

494
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.830
My lord, you once did love me.

495
00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.900
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.

496
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:06.270
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?

497
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.500
You do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty

498
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.630
if you deny your griefs to your friend.

499
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:15.100
Sir, I lack advancement.

500
00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.670
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself

501
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.630
for your succession in Denmark?

502
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:24.430
Ay, truly but "While the grass grows"--

503
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.300
The proverb is something musty.

504
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.230
Ah, the recorders!

505
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.500
Let me see one.

506
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.900
To withdraw with you.

507
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.430
Why do you go about to recover the wind of me

508
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.470
as if you would drive me into a toil?

509
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.900
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold,

510
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.870
my love is too unmannerly.

511
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.500
I do not well understand that.

512
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.200
Will you play upon this pipe?

513
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.800
My lord, I cannot.

514
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.900
I pray you.

515
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.000
Believe me, I cannot.

516
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.100
I do beseech you.

517
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.370
I know no touch of it, my lord.

518
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.730
It is as easy as lying.

519
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.030
Govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb,

520
00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:59.430
give it breath with your mouth,

521
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.600
and it will discourse most eloquent music.

522
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.700
Look you, these are the stops.

523
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.170
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony;

524
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.570
I have not the skill.

525
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.600
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!

526
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.600
You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops.

527
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.670
You would pluck out the heart of my mystery.

528
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.870
You would sound me from my lowest note

529
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.000
to the top of my compass.

530
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.830
And there is much music, excellent voice,

531
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:26.070
in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak.

532
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.430
'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on

533
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.400
than a pipe?

534
00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.100
Call me what instrument you will,

535
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.770
though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.

536
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.470
God bless you, sir!

537
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.900
My lord, the queen would speak with you and presently.

538
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.630
Do you see yonder cloud

539
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.400
that's almost in shape of a camel?

540
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.300
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.

541
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.300
Methinks it's like a weasel.

542
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.600
It is backed like a weasel.

543
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.300
Or a whale?

544
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.430
Very like a whale.

545
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.100
Then I will come to my mother by and by.

546
00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.770
They fool me to the top of my bent.

547
00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.170
I will come by and by.

548
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.300
I will say so.

549
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.430
By and by is easily said.

550
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.970
Leave me, friends.

551
00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:39.270
'Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn

552
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:45.900
and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.

553
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:59.300
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business

554
00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:04.970
as the day Would quake to look upon.

555
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.130
Soft!

556
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.830
Now to my mother.

557
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:13.370
O heart, lose not thy nature;

558
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:16.500
let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.

559
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.700
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.

560
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:23.370
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;

561
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.700
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;

562
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.400
How in my words soever she be shent,

563
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:37.630
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

564
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.600
I like him not.

565
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.100
Nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.

566
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.500
Therefore prepare you;

567
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.070
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,

568
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.770
And he to England shall along with you:

569
00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.270
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near

570
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:12.570
as doth hourly grow Out of his brows.

571
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:15.500
We will ourselves provide.

572
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:19.230
Most holy and religious fear it is

573
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.230
To keep those many, many bodies safe

574
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.530
That live and feed upon your majesty.

575
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.870
The cease of majesty Dies not alone;

576
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.770
but, like a gulf, doth draw What's near it with it.

577
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:31.370
It is a massy wheel,

578
00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.200
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,

579
00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.200
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things

580
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.300
Are mortised and adjoin'd;

581
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.200
which, when it falls, Each small annexment,

582
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.800
petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.

583
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.230
Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

584
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:55.630
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;

585
00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.370
For we will fetters put about this fear,

586
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.030
Which now goes too free-footed.

587
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.130
We will haste us.

588
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:13.230
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.

589
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.970
Behind the arras I'll convey myself

590
00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.370
To hear the process.

591
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.030
Fare you well, my liege:

592
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.570
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed

593
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.830
And tell you what I know.

594
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.600
Thanks, good my lord.

595
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:41.800
My offence is rank; it smells to heaven;

596
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:49.200
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, A brother's murder.

597
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.530
Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will:

598
00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.570
My strongest guilt defeats my strong intent;

599
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.030
And, like a man to double business bound,

600
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.630
I stand in pause where I shall first begin

601
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.800
And both neglect.

602
00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.970
What if this cursed hand

603
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.870
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,

604
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.430
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens

605
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.070
To wash it white as snow?

606
00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.200
Whereto serves mercy

607
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:12.500
But to confront the visage of offence?

608
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.900
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,

609
00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.400
To be forestalled ere we come to fall

610
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.330
Or pardon'd being down?

611
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.230
Then I'll look up; My fault is past.

612
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:27.400
But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn?

613
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.830
"Forgive me my foul murder"?

614
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.370
That cannot be;

615
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:32.670
since I am still possess'd Of those effects

616
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:33.870
for which I did the murder,

617
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:40.530
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.

618
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:44.230
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?

619
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.030
In the corrupted currents of this world

620
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.870
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice

621
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.930
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself

622
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:56.470
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;

623
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:58.700
There is no shuffling,

624
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.730
there the action lies In his true nature;

625
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.000
and we ourselves compell'd,

626
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.970
Even in the teeth and forehead of our faults,

627
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.270
To give in evidence.

628
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.970
What then?

629
00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:11.500
What rests?

630
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.900
Try what repentance can: what can it not?

631
00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.270
What can it when one cannot repent?

632
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.630
O wretched state!

633
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.670
O bosom black as death!

634
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:32.730
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,

635
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.570
Art more engaged!

636
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:43.700
Help, angels!

637
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.200
Make assay!

638
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.130
Bow, stubborn knees.

639
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:59.800
And heart with strings of steel,

640
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.400
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!

641
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:13.700
All may be well.

642
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:29.700
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;

643
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.200
And now I'll do't.

644
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:44.470
And so he goes to heaven; And so am I revenged.

645
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.700
That would be scann'd: A villain kills my father;

646
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.800
and for that, I, his sole son,

647
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.930
do this same villain send To heaven.

648
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:58.970
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

649
00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:03.270
He took my father grossly, full of bread;

650
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:07.970
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;

651
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.770
And am I then avenged

652
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:11.970
To take him in the purging of his soul,

653
00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:15.900
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?

654
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.670
No!

655
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.670
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:

656
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.630
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,

657
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.700
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;

658
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.100
At game, at swearing, or about some act

659
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.200
That has no relish of salvation in't;

660
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.230
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven

661
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.370
And his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell,

662
00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.270
whereto it goes.

663
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.000
My mother stays:

664
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:53.000
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

665
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.730
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.

666
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.530
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

667
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:31.470
He comes straight.

668
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.670
Look you lay home to him.

669
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.470
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with

670
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:36.670
And that your grace hath screen'd

671
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.070
and stood between Much heat and him.

672
00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.130
I'll silence me even here.

673
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.370
Pray you, be round with him.

674
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:43.500
I'll warrant you.

675
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.630
Mother!

676
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.500
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

677
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.970
Mother?

678
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:58.230
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

679
00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:00.900
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

680
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:04.730
Mother, you have my father much offended.

681
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.670
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

682
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.200
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

683
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.330
Why, how now, Hamlet!

684
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.570
What's the matter now?

685
00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.900
Have thou forgot me?

686
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.200
No, by the rood, not so:

687
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.630
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;

688
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:25.970
And--would it were not so!-- you are my mother.

689
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.470
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

690
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:29.800
Come, come, and sit you down;

691
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.230
you shall not budge;

692
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.730
You go not till I set you up a glass

693
00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.230
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

694
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:36.500
What wilt thou do?

695
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.730
Thou wilt not murder me?

696
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.330
Help, help, ho!

697
00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:40.700
Help, help, help!

698
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.230
Now? A rat?

699
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.730
Dead, for a ducat, dead!

700
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:47.370
O, I am slain!

701
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:49.400
O me, what hast thou done?

702
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.400
Nay, I know not: Is it the king?

703
00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.730
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

704
00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:54.830
A bloody deed!

705
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.130
Almost as bad, good mother,

706
00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:58.330
As kill a king and marry with his brother.

707
00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.870
As kill a king!

708
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:02.370
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

709
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:10.070
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool!

710
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:15.470
Farewell.

711
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:23.600
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;

712
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:28.000
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.

713
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:34.400
Leave wringing of your hands: peace!

714
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.500
Sit you down, And let me wring your heart;

715
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.470
for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff,

716
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.700
If damned custom have not brass'd it

717
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.700
so That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

718
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.130
What have I done

719
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.370
that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?

720
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.270
Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,

721
00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.270
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose

722
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.170
From the fair forehead of an innocent love

723
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:58.470
And sets a blister there,

724
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:02.130
makes marriage-vows As false as dicers' oaths.

725
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.470
Ay me, what act That roars so loud

726
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.670
and thunders in the index?

727
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:10.870
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,

728
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:14.730
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.

729
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:19.030
See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyperion's curls;

730
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.970
the front of Jove himself; An eye like Mars,

731
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:25.030
to threaten and command;

732
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.030
A station like the herald Mercury

733
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.700
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;

734
00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.030
A combination and a form indeed,

735
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.670
Where every god did seem to set his seal,

736
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.530
To give the world assurance of a man:

737
00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:45.730
This was your husband.

738
00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:48.300
Look you now, what follows:

739
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.130
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,

740
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.600
Blasting his wholesome brother.

741
00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.830
Have you eyes?

742
00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:55.870
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,

743
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:57.330
And batten on this moor?

744
00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.600
Ha!

745
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.770
Have you eyes?

746
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:02.600
You cannot call it love;

747
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.830
for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame.

748
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:07.230
It's humble And waits upon the judgment:

749
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.900
and what judgment Would step from this to this?

750
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.270
Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion;

751
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.430
but sure, that sense Is apoplex'd;

752
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.270
for madness would not err,

753
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:19.400
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd

754
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:22.000
But it reserved some quantity of choice

755
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.200
To serve in such a difference.

756
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.370
What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?

757
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:28.470
O shame!

758
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.070
Where is thy blush?

759
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:33.730
Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,

760
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:36.130
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax

761
00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.230
And melt in its own fire.

762
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:39.830
Proclaim no shame

763
00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.270
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

764
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.000
Since frost itself as actively doth burn

765
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.670
And reason panders will.

766
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.430
O Hamlet, speak no more:

767
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.970
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;

768
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.930
And there I see such black and grained spots

769
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.470
As will not leave their tinct.

770
00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:01.530
Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,

771
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.430
Stew'd in corruption, honeying, making love

772
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:07.970
Over the nasty sty--

773
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.270
O, Hamlet speak no more;

774
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:12.630
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ear;

775
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:14.870
No more, sweet Hamlet!

776
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.670
A murderer and a villain;

777
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.600
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe

778
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.270
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;

779
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.200
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,

780
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.970
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,

781
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:28.530
And put it in his pocket!

782
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.630
No more!

783
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:32.230
A king of shreds and patches--

784
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:42.330
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,

785
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.430
You heavenly guards!

786
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.730
What would your gracious figure?

787
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.770
Alas, he's mad!

788
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.630
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,

789
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.330
That, lapsed in time and passion,

790
00:45:55.330 --> 00:46:00.930
lets go by The important acting of your dread command?

791
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:02.870
O, say!

792
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:04.670
Do not forget:

793
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:08.800
this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.

794
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:13.230
But look.

795
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:16.670
Amazement on thy mother sits.

796
00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:23.370
O, step between her and her fighting soul:

797
00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.670
Speak to her, Hamlet.

798
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.030
How is it with you, lady?

799
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:34.130
Alas, how is't with you,

800
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:36.970
That you do bend your eye on vacancy

801
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:41.400
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?

802
00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.630
Whereon do you look?

803
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.030
On him, on him!

804
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.870
Look you, how pale he glares!

805
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:52.030
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,

806
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:53.900
Would make them capable.

807
00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.200
Do not look upon me;

808
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.200
Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects:

809
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.000
then what I have to do Will want true colour;

810
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.870
tears perchance for blood.

811
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.870
To whom do you speak this?

812
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.300
Do you see nothing there?

813
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:17.370
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

814
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:20.130
Nor did you nothing hear?

815
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.900
No, nothing but ourselves.

816
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.270
Why, look you there!

817
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:29.370
Look, how it steals away!

818
00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:34.130
My father, in his habit as he lived!

819
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.470
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

820
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:40.370
This is the very coinage of your brain:

821
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:44.870
This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.

822
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.100
Ecstasy!

823
00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:57.500
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,

824
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.930
And makes as healthful music:

825
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:04.970
it is not madness That I have utter'd:

826
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:06.670
bring me to the test,

827
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:11.370
And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from.

828
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:14.370
Mother, for love of grace,

829
00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:18.600
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,

830
00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.530
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:

831
00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.430
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,

832
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.970
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,

833
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.830
Infects unseen.

834
00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:35.070
Confess yourself to heaven;

835
00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:39.500
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;

836
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.370
And do not spread the compost on the weeds

837
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.800
To make them ranker.

838
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.670
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

839
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:55.900
O, throw away the worser part of it

840
00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.070
And live the purer with the other half.

841
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:05.200
Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed;

842
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.600
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

843
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.670
Refrain to-night.

844
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:20.370
That shall lend a kind of easiness

845
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.370
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;

846
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:30.270
Once more, good night:

847
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.230
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,

848
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.500
I'll blessing beg of you.

849
00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:45.870
For this same lord, I do repent:

850
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.030
but heaven hath pleased it so

851
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:48.630
To punish me with this and this with me,

852
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:54.170
That I must be their scourge and minister.

853
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.600
I will bestow him,

854
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.370
and will answer well The death I gave him.

855
00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:00.870
So, again, good night.

856
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:06.330
I must be cruel, only to be kind.

857
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.970
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

858
00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:22.870
One word more, good lady.

859
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.730
What shall I do?

860
00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.670
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:

861
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.300
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;

862
00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:35.300
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;

863
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:38.830
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,

864
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.230
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,

865
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.830
Make you to ravel all this matter out,

866
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:58.400
That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft.

867
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.630
'Twere good you let him know.

868
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:04.900
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath

869
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.170
And breath of life,

870
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:12.530
I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.

871
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:16.300
I must to England; you know that?

872
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.470
Alack, I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

873
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:23.470
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,

874
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:27.070
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,

875
00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:29.230
They bear the mandate;

876
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.670
They must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery.

877
00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.230
Let it work; For 'tis the sport

878
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.300
to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard:

879
00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.030
and it shall go hard,

880
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:48.730
But I will delve one yard below their mines,

881
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:53.970
And blow them at the moon.

882
00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:57.530
O, 'tis most sweet,

883
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:03.700
When in one line two crafts directly meet.

884
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.000
This man shall set me packing:

885
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.870
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.

886
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:15.070
Mother, good night.

887
00:52:15.070 --> 00:52:18.830
Indeed this counselor Is now most still,

888
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:22.500
most secret and most grave,

889
00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:33.830
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.

890
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:40.100
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.

891
00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.830
Good night, mother.

892
00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:48.830
