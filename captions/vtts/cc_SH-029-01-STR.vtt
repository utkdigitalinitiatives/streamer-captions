00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:54.130


2
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.870
You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods

3
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.900
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers

4
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.830
Still seem as does the king's.

5
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.630
But what's the matter?

6
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.730
His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom,

7
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.630
whom he purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow

8
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.870
That late he married--hath referr'd herself

9
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.900
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;

10
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.970
Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd:

11
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.630
all Is outward sorrow; though I think the king

12
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.230
Be touch'd at very heart.

13
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.700
None but the king?

14
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.170
He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,

15
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.070
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,

16
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.870
Although they wear their faces to the bent

17
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.670
Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not

18
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700
Glad at the thing they scowl at.

19
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.930
And why so?

20
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.030
He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing

21
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.270
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.700
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!

23
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.200
And therefore banish'd--is a creature such

24
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.230
As, to seek through the regions of the earth

25
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.230
For one his like, there would be something failing

26
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.630
In him that should compare. I do not think

27
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.100
So fair an outward and such stuff within

28
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.670
Endows a man but he.

29
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.200
You speak him far.

30
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.600
I do extend him, sir, within himself,

31
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.370
Crush him together rather than unfold

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.670
His measure duly.

33
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.870
What's his name and birth?

34
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.430
I cannot delve him to the root: his father

35
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.300
Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.530
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,

37
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.970
But had his titles by Tenantius whom

38
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.270
He served with glory and admired success,

39
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.030
So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;

40
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.300
And had, besides this gentleman in question,

41
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.170
Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time

42
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.030
Died with their swords in hand;

43
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.300
for which their father,

44
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.100
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow

45
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.900
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,

46
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.370
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased

47
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.630
As he was born. The king he takes the babe

48
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.530
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,

49
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.330
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,

50
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.500
Puts to him all the learnings that his time

51
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.030
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,

52
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.370
As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,

53
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.900
And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--

54
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.530
Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,

55
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.100
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature

56
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.670
A glass that feated them, and to the graver

57
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.100
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,

58
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.000
For whom he now is banish'd, her own price

59
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.630
Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;

60
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.400
By her election may be truly read

61
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.570
What kind of man he is.

62
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.570
I honour him

63
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.700
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,

64
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.570
Is she sole child to the king?

65
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.730
His only child.

66
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.170
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,

67
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.100
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,

68
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.170
I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery

69
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.930
Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge

70
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.400
Which way they went.

71
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.070
How long is this ago?

72
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.170
Some twenty years.

73
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.070
That a king's children should be so convey'd,

74
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.670
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,

75
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.830
That could not trace them!

76
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.330
Howsoe'er 'tis strange,

77
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.630
Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,

78
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.830
Yet is it true.

79
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.970
I do well believe you.

80
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.030
No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,

81
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.700
After the slander of most stepmothers,

82
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.670
Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner,

83
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.270
but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys

84
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.000
That lock up your restraint.

85
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.800
For you, Posthumus,

86
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.630
So soon as I can win the offended king,

87
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.930
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet

88
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.670
The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good

89
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.130
You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience

90
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.330
Your wisdom may inform you.

91
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.700
Please your highness,

92
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700
I will from hence to-day.

93
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.230
You know the peril.

94
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.770
I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying

95
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.330
The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king

96
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.300
Hath charged you should not speak together.

97
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.830
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant

98
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.430
Can tickle where she wounds!

99
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.000
My dearest husband,

100
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.230
I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--

101
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.230
Always reserved my holy duty--what

102
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.100
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;

103
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.230
And I shall here abide the hourly shot

104
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.230
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,

105
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.100
But that there is this jewel in the world

106
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.630
That I may see again.

107
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.230
My queen! my mistress!

108
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.200
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause

109
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.770
To be suspected of more tenderness

110
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.470
Than doth become a man. I will remain

111
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.730
The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:

112
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.300
My residence in Rome at one Philario's,

113
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.700
Who to my father was a friend, to me

114
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.900
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,

115
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.670
And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,

116
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.670
Though ink be made of gall.

117
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.870
Be brief, I pray you:

118
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.100
If the king come, I shall incur I know not

119
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.230
How much of his displeasure.

120
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.230
Should we be taking leave

121
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.070
As long a term as yet we have to live,

122
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.370
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

123
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.700
Nay, stay a little:

124
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.470
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,

125
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.770
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;

126
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.970
This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;

127
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.730
But keep it till you woo another wife,

128
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.000
When Imogen is dead.

129
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.770
How, how! another?

130
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.230
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,

131
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.230
And sear up my embracements from a next

132
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.100
With bonds of death!

133
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.070
Remain, remain thou here

134
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.870
While sense can keep it on.

135
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.230
And, sweetest, fairest,

136
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.530
As I my poor self did exchange for you,

137
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.900
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles

138
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:26.670
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;

139
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.200
It is a manacle of love; I'll place it

140
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.130
Upon this fairest prisoner.

141
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.730
O the gods!

142
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.300
When shall we see again?

143
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.100
Alack, the king!

144
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:47.770
Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!

145
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.330
If after this command thou fraught the court

146
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.670
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!

147
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.770
Thou'rt poison to my blood.

148
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.570
The gods protect you!

149
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.200
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.

150
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.070
There cannot be a pinch in death

151
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.570
More sharp than this is.

152
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.330
O disloyal thing,

153
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.430
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st

154
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.270
A year's age on me.

155
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.130
I beseech you, sir,

156
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.570
Harm not yourself with your vexation

157
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.300
I am senseless of your wrath;

158
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.070
Past grace? obedience?

159
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.630
Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

160
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.800
That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

161
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.470
O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,

162
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.930
And did avoid a puttock.

163
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.430
Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne

164
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.170
A seat for baseness.

165
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.030
No; I rather added

166
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.500
A lustre to it.

167
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.930
O thou vile one!

168
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.400
Sir, It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:

169
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.130
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is

170
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.630
A man worth any woman, overbuys me

171
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.030
Almost the sum he pays.

172
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.170
What, art thou mad?

173
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.100
Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were

174
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.300
A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus

175
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.130
Our neighbour shepherd's son!

176
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.430
Thou foolish thing!

177
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.270
They were again together: you have done

178
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.130
Not after our command. Away with her,

179
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.200
And pen her up.

180
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.770
Beseech your patience. Peace,

181
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:13.630
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,

182
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.930
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort

183
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.370
Out of your best advice.

184
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.270
Nay, let her languish

185
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.430
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,

186
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.930
Die of this folly!

187
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.730
Fie! you must give way.

188
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.230
Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

189
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.800
My lord your son drew on my master.

190
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.530
Ha! No harm, I trust, is done?

191
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.530
There might have been,

192
00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.700
But that my master rather play'd than fought

193
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.300
And had no help of anger: they were parted

194
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.730
By gentlemen at hand.

195
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.400
I am very glad on't.

196
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.470
Why came you from your master?

197
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.000
On his command: he would not suffer me

198
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.870
To bring him to the haven; left these notes

199
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.370
Of what commands I should be subject to,

200
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.630
When 't pleased you to employ me.

201
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.070
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least

202
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.130
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

203
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.970
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it.

204
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.930
Have I hurt him?

205
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.330
No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.

206
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.570
Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass,

207
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.500
if he be not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel,

208
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.400
if it be not hurt.

209
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.870
The villain would not stand me.

210
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.370
No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

211
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.570
Stand you! You have land enough of your own:

212
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.670
but he added to your having; gave you some ground.

213
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.970
I would they had not come between us.

214
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:35.130
And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

215
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.370
Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain

216
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:42.130
go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen

217
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:43.670
small reflection of her wit.

218
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.830
She shines not upon fools,

219
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.800
lest the reflection should hurt her.

220
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.300
Come, I'll to my chamber.

221
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.430
Would there had been some hurt done!

222
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.000
I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,

223
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.770
And question'dst every sail: if he should write

224
00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.330
And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,

225
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.830
As offer'd mercy is.

226
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.100
What was the last That he spake to thee?

227
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.070
It was his queen, his queen!

228
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.130
Then waved his handkerchief?

229
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.670
And kiss'd it, madam.

230
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.600
Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!

231
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:21.770
And that was all?

232
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.730
No, madam; for so long

233
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.400
As he could make me with this eye or ear

234
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.800
Distinguish him from others, he did keep

235
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.570
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,

236
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.270
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind

237
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:40.370
Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,

238
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.870
How swift his ship.

239
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.070
Thou shouldst have made him

240
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.100
As little as a crow, or less, ere left to after-eye him.

241
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.170
Madam, so I did.

242
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.070
I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them,

243
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.070
but to look upon him, till the diminution

244
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.030
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,

245
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.770
Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from

246
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.700
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then

247
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.000
Have turn'd mine eye and wept.

248
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.570
But, good Pisanio, When shall we hear from him?

249
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:11.230
Be assured, madam,

250
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.330
With his next vantage.

251
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.730
I did not take my leave of him, but had

252
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.770
Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him

253
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.970
How I would think on him at certain hours

254
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.330
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear

255
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:29.730
The shes of Italy should not betray

256
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.470
Mine interest and his honour,

257
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.200
or have charged him,

258
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.430
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,

259
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.770
To encounter me with orisons, for then

260
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:44.800
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could

261
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.500
Give him that parting kiss which I had set

262
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.970
Betwixt two charming words,

263
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.430
comes in my father

264
00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.170
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north

265
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.370
Shakes all our buds from growing.

266
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.200
The queen, madam,

267
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.770
Desires your highness' company.

268
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.500
Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.

269
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.400
I will attend the queen.

270
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.870
Madam, I shall.

271
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.430
Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain:

272
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.100
he was then of a crescent note,

273
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.500
expected to prove so worthy

274
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.700
as since he hath been allowed the name of;

275
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.300
but I could then have looked on him without the help

276
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.100
of admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments

277
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.300
had been tabled by his side

278
00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.070
and I to peruse him by items.

279
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.230
You speak of him when he was less furnished than now

280
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.030
he is with that which makes him

281
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.700
both without and within.

282
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.470
I have seen him in France: we had very many there

283
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.730
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

284
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.630
This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein

285
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.900
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,

286
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.770
words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

287
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:05.970
And then his banishment.

288
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.930
Ay, and the approbation of those that weep

289
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.500
this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully

290
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.270
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,

291
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.370
which else an easy battery might lay flat,

292
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.200
for taking a beggar without less quality.

293
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.700
But how comes it he is to sojourn with you?

294
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.730
How creeps acquaintance?

295
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.730
His father and I were soldiers together;

296
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:31.900
to whom I have been often bound

297
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.870
for no less than my life.

298
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.630
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained

299
00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.970
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen

300
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.870
of your knowing, to a stranger of his quality.

301
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.730
I beseech you all, be better known

302
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.470
to this gentleman; whom I commend

303
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.330
to you as a noble friend of mine:

304
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:48.870
how worthy he is I will leave to appear hereafter,

305
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.430
rather than story him in his own hearing.

306
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.600
Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

307
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.830
Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,

308
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:00.370
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

309
00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.570
Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness:

310
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.270
I was glad I did atone my countryman and you;

311
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.130
it had been pity

312
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.330
you should have been put together

313
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:15.330
with so mortal a purpose as then each bore,

314
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.570
upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature.

315
00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.770
By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;

316
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.830
rather shunned to go even with what I heard

317
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.100
than in my every action to be guided by others' experiences:

318
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.130
but upon my mended judgment--

319
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.700
if I offend not to say it is mended--

320
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.470
my quarrel was not altogether slight.

321
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.000
Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

322
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.730
Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,

323
00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.030
which may, without contradiction,

324
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.470
suffer the report.

325
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.030
It was much like an argument that fell out last night,

326
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:48.270
where each of us fell in praise

327
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:50.730
of our country mistresses;

328
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.570
this gentleman at that time vouching--

329
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.470
and upon warrant of bloody affirmation--

330
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.470
his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,

331
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:03.330
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable

332
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.

333
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.530
That lady is not now living,

334
00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.330
or this gentleman's opinion by this worn out.

335
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.500
She holds her virtue still and I my mind.

336
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.030
You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.

337
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.930
Being so far provoked as I was in France,

338
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.530
I would abate her nothing,

339
00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.130
though I profess myself her adorer, not her friend.

340
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:34.370
As fair and as good--

341
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.670
a kind of hand-in-hand comparison--

342
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.700
had been something too fair and too good

343
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.500
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others

344
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.270
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres

345
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.500
many I have beheld. I could not but believe

346
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.930
she excelled many: but I have not seen

347
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.000
the most precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

348
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.230
I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.

349
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.470
What do you esteem it at?

350
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.730
More than the world enjoys.

351
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.670
Either your unparagoned mistress is dead,

352
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.270
or she's outprized by a trifle.

353
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.600
You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given,

354
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.470
if there were wealth enough for the purchase,

355
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.930
or merit for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,

356
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.470
and only the gift of the gods.

357
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.370
Which the gods have given you?

358
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.370
Which, by their graces, I will keep.

359
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.730
You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,

360
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.530
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds.

361
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.170
Your ring may be stolen too: so your brace

362
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.500
of unprizable estimations; the one is but frail

363
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.230
and the other casual; a cunning thief,

364
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.130
or a that way accomplished courtier,

365
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.300
would hazard the winning both of first and last.

366
00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.770
Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier

367
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.130
to convince the honour of my mistress,

368
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.170
if, in the holding or loss of that, you term her frail.

369
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.430
I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves;

370
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.470
notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

371
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.970
Let us leave here, gentlemen.

372
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.500
Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior,

373
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.400
I thank him, makes no stranger of me;

374
00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.700
we are familiar at first.

375
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.630
With five times so much conversation, I should get

376
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.400
ground of your fair mistress,

377
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.270
make her go back, even to the yielding,

378
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.300
had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

379
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.370
No, no.

380
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.600
I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate

381
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.930
to your ring; which, in my opinion,

382
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.070
o'ervalues it something:

383
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.100
but I make my wager rather against your confidence

384
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.370
than her reputation:

385
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.530
and to bar your offence herein too,

386
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.770
I durst attempt it against any lady in the world.

387
00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.030
You are a great deal abused

388
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.530
in too bold a persuasion;

389
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:38.470
Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;

390
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.800
let it die as it was born,

391
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.170
and, I pray you, be better acquainted.

392
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.570
Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's

393
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.570
on the approbation of what I have spoke!

394
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.770
What lady would you choose to assail?

395
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.830
Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.

396
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:59.100
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,

397
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.270
commend me to the court where your lady is,

398
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.300
with no more advantage than the opportunity

399
00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.630
of a second conference,

400
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.700
and I will bring from thence

401
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.330
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

402
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.630
I will wage against your gold, gold to it:

403
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.700
my ring I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

404
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700
You are afraid,

405
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:22.830
and therein the wiser.

406
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.070
If you buy ladies' flesh at a million a dram,

407
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.600
you cannot preserve it from tainting:

408
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.770
but I see you have some religion in you,

409
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:34.770
that you fear.

410
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.230
This is but a custom in your tongue;

411
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.670
you bear a graver purpose, I hope.

412
00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.370
I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo

413
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.730
what's spoken, I swear.

414
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:50.070
Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your return:

415
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.100
let there be covenants drawn between's:

416
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.800
my mistress exceeds in goodness

417
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.000
the hugeness of your unworthy thinking:

418
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.100
I dare you to this match: here's my ring.

419
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.000
I will have it no lay.

420
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.330
By the gods, it is one. If I bring you

421
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.330
no sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest

422
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.970
bodily part of your mistress,

423
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.900
my ten thousand ducats

424
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.300
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,

425
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.230
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,

426
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.230
she your jewel, this your jewel,

427
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.400
and my gold are yours:

428
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.570
provided I have your commendation

429
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.870
for my more free entertainment.

430
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.870
I embrace these conditions;

431
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.400
let us have articles betwixt us.

432
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.470
Only, thus far you shall answer:

433
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.870
if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly

434
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.930
to understand you have prevailed,

435
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:39.170
I am no further your enemy;

436
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.430
she is not worth our debate:

437
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.130
if she remain unseduced,

438
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.400
you not making it appear otherwise,

439
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.030
for your ill opinion and the assault you have made

440
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.330
to her chastity you shall answer me

441
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.200
with your sword.

442
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.730
Your hand; a covenant:

443
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.330
we will have these things

444
00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.200
set down by lawful counsel, and straight away

445
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.070
for Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold

446
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.070
and starve.

447
00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.130
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

448
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:09.070
Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:

449
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.970
But I beseech your grace, without offence,--

450
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.970
My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have

451
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.330
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,

452
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.700
Which are the movers of a languishing death;

453
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.000
But though slow, deadly?

454
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.900
I wonder, doctor,

455
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.900
Thou ask'st me such a question.

456
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.170
Have I not been Thy pupil long?

457
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.100
Hast thou not learn'd me how to make perfumes?

458
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.930
distil? preserve? yea, so

459
00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.930
That our great king himself doth woo me oft

460
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.930
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--

461
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:50.000
Unless thou think'st me devilish--

462
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.270
is't not meet that I did amplify my judgment

463
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.700
in other conclusions?

464
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.970
I will try the forces

465
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.070
Of these thy compounds on such creatures

466
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.970
as we count not worth the hanging, but none human,

467
00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.170
To try the vigour of them and apply

468
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.600
Allayments to their act, and by them gather

469
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.670
Their several virtues and effects.

470
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.730
Your highness

471
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.170
Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:

472
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.070
Besides, the seeing these effects will be

473
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.570
Both noisome and infectious.

474
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.870
O, content thee.

475
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.730
Here comes a flattering rascal;

476
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.330
upon him will I first work:

477
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.900
I do not like her. She doth think she has

478
00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.530
Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,

479
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:35.270
And will not trust one of her malice

480
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.730
with a drug of such damn'd nature.

481
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.470
Those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;

482
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.930
Which first, perchance, she'll prove on cats and dogs,

483
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.130
Then afterward up higher: but there is no danger

484
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.530
in what show of death it makes,

485
00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.970
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,

486
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.600
To be more fresh, reviving.

487
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.230
Weeps she still, say'st thou?

488
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.370
Dost thou think in time

489
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.230
She will not quench and let instructions enter

490
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.230
Where folly now possesses?

491
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.500
Do thou work:

492
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.000
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,

493
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.100
I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then

494
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.230
As great as is thy master,

495
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.100
greater,

496
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.870
for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name

497
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:25.000
Is at last gasp: return he cannot,

498
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.600
nor continue where he is: to shift his being

499
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.330
Is to exchange one misery with another,

500
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:33.470
And every day that comes comes to decay

501
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.400
A day's work in him.

502
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:39.100
What shalt thou expect,

503
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.130
To be depender on a thing that leans,

504
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.800
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,

505
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.200
So much as but to prop him?

506
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.000
Thou takest up

507
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.500
Thou know'st not what;

508
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.230
but take it for thy labour:

509
00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:07.270
It is a thing I made, which hath the king

510
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.670
Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know

511
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.670
What is more cordial.

512
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.270
Nay, I prethee, take it;

513
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:21.430
It is an earnest of a further good

514
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:22.930
That I mean to thee.

515
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:26.500
Tell thy mistress how

516
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:28.000
The case stands with her;

517
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.600
do't as from thyself.

518
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.900
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think

519
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.700
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,

520
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.300
Who shall take notice of thee:

521
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.200
I'll move the king

522
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.670
To any shape of thy preferment such

523
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.700
As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,

524
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:52.830
That set thee on to this desert, am bound

525
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.830
To load thy merit richly.

526
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.900
Call my women:

527
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.700
Think on my words.

528
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:20.370
A sly and constant knave,

529
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:25.500
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master

530
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.170
And the remembrancer of her to hold

531
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:34.100
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that

532
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.000
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her

533
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.130
Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,

534
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.430
Except she bend her humour, shall be assured

535
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.600
To taste of too.

536
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:15.930
A father cruel, and a step-dame false;

537
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.330
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,

538
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.230
That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!

539
00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:31.000
My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated

540
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Vexations of it!

541
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.370
Had I been thief-stol'n,

542
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.070
As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable

543
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.970
Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,

544
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.270
How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,

545
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:54.630
Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

546
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.930
Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,

547
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.870
Comes from my lord with letters.

548
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.070
Change you, madam?

549
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.000
The worthy Leonatus is in safety

550
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.870
And greets your highness dearly.

551
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:10.430
Thanks, good sir:

552
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.070
You're kindly welcome.

553
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.700
He is one of the noblest note,

554
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.370
to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied.

555
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.500
Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your trust--

556
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.970
LEONATUS.'

557
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.370
So far I read aloud:

558
00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.530
But even the very middle of my heart

559
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.870
Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.

560
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.570
You are as welcome, worthy sir,

561
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:36.370
as I Have words to bid you, and shall find it so

562
00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.700
In all that I can do.

563
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.700
Thanks, fairest lady.

564
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.200
What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes

565
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.200
To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop

566
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.930
Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt

567
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.800
The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones

568
00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.000
Upon the number'd beach? and can we not

569
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.470
Partition make with spectacles so precious

570
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.830
'Twixt fair and foul?

571
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.570
What makes your admiration?

572
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:03.170
It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys

573
00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.970
'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way

574
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.730
and contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,

575
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.100
For idiots in this case of favour would

576
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.570
Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;

577
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.400
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed

578
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.100
Should make desire vomit emptiness,

579
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.400
Not so allured to feed.

580
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.230
What is the matter, trow?

581
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.970
The cloyed will,

582
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.500
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub

583
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.700
Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb

584
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.130
Longs after for the garbage.

585
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:30.870
What, dear sir,

586
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.800
Thus raps you? Are you well?

587
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.930
Thanks, madam; well.

588
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.100
Beseech you, sir, desire

589
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.430
My man's abode where I did leave him:

590
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.700
he Is strange and peevish.

591
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.800
I was going, sir,

592
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.870
To give him welcome.

593
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.070
Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

594
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.300
Well, madam.

595
00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:08.730
Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

596
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.470
Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there

597
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:16.200
So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd

598
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:17.700
The Briton reveller.

599
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.630
When he was here,

600
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.600
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times

601
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:22.600
Not knowing why.

602
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.030
I never saw him sad.

603
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.400
There is a Frenchman his companion, one

604
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.930
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves

605
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.330
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces

606
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:41.930
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--

607
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:45.100
Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,

608
00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.970
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows

609
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.670
By history, report, or his own proof,

610
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:54.130
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose

611
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.470
But must be, will his free hours languish

612
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.700
for assured bondage?

613
00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.700
Will my lord say so?

614
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.970
Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:

615
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.100
It is a recreation to be by and hear him

616
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.100
mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,

617
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.130
Some men are much to blame.

618
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.130
Not he, I hope.

619
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:17.630
Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might

620
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:23.300
Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;

621
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.530
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,

622
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:34.130
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound

623
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:35.030
To pity too.

624
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:35.770
What do you pity, sir?

625
00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.730
Two creatures heartily.

626
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.200
Am I one, sir?

627
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.700
You look on me:

628
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.100
what wreck discern you in me

629
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.430
Deserves your pity?

630
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.670
Lamentable! What,

631
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.730
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace

632
00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.670
I' the dungeon by a snuff?

633
00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.570
I pray you, sir,

634
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.800
Deliver with more openness your answers

635
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.370
To my demands. Why do you pity me?

636
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.830
That others do--

637
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.030
I was about to say--enjoy your--

638
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.030
But It is an office of the gods to venge it,

639
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:11.400
Not mine to speak on 't.

640
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400
You do seem to know

641
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.070
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--

642
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.330
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more

643
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.030
Than to be sure they do; for certainties

644
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.400
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,

645
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.970
The remedy then born--discover to me

646
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.900
What both you spur and stop.

647
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.230
Had I this cheek

648
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:38.030
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,

649
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:40.230
Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul

650
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.500
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which

651
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.070
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,

652
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.970
Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,

653
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.200
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs

654
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.270
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands

655
00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.070
Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as

656
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:02.270
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye

657
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.300
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light

658
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.500
That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit

659
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.570
That all the plagues of hell should at one time

660
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.870
Encounter such revolt.

661
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.670
My lord, I fear,

662
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.000
Has forgot Britain.

663
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.500
And himself. Not I,

664
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.270
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce

665
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:23.270
The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces

666
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.900
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue

667
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.370
Charms this report out.

668
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.400
Let me hear no more.

669
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.030
O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart

670
00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.100
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady

671
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.730
So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,

672
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:37.430
Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd

673
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:39.500
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition

674
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.330
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures

675
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.970
That play with all infirmities for gold

676
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.900
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff

677
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.800
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;

678
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.870
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you

679
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.100
Recoil from your great stock.

680
00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.330
Revenged!

681
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:01.930
How should I be revenged? If this be true,--

682
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.000
As I have such a heart that both mine ears

683
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.730
Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,

684
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.830
How should I be revenged?

685
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:10.870
Should he make me

686
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.070
Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,

687
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:17.570
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,

688
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:25.870
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.

689
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.930
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,

690
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:35.930
More noble than that runagate to your bed,

691
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.330
And will continue fast to your affection,

692
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.830
Still close as sure.

693
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:46.400
What, ho, Pisanio!

694
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.670
Let me my service tender on your lips.

695
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.470
Away! I do condemn mine ears that have

696
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:03.270
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,

697
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.230
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not

698
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:11.330
For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.

699
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.170
Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far

700
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.270
From thy report as thou from honour, and

701
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.100
Solicit'st here a lady that disdains

702
00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:25.900
both thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!

703
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.370
The king my father shall be made acquainted

704
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:32.270
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,

705
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.800
A saucy stranger in his court to mart

706
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.070
As in a Romish stew and to expound

707
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.930
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court

708
00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:41.370
He little cares for and a daughter who

709
00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.400
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!

710
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.870
O happy Leonatus! I may say

711
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.500
The credit that thy lady hath of thee

712
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.800
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness

713
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.800
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!

714
00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:58.500
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever

715
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.030
Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only

716
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.030
For the most worthiest fit!

717
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.300
Give me your pardon.

718
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.930
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance

719
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:20.330
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,

720
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.800
That which he is, new o'er: and he is one

721
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.670
The truest manner'd; such a holy witch

722
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.200
That he enchants societies into him;

723
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.030
Half all men's hearts are his.

724
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.000
You make amends.

725
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:

726
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.630
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,

727
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.100
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,

728
00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.700
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured

729
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.700
To try your taking a false report; which hath

730
00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.900
Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment

731
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.670
In the election of a sir so rare,

732
00:35:52.670 --> 00:36:00.130
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him

733
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.400
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,

734
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:10.870
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

735
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:12.830
All's well, sir:

736
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:17.400
take my power i' the court for yours.

737
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.070
My humble thanks.

738
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.230
I had almost forgot

739
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.030
To entreat your grace but in a small request,

740
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.130
And yet of moment to, for it concerns

741
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.930
Your lord; myself and other noble friends,

742
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:37.900
Are partners in the business.

743
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:38.930
Pray, what is't?

744
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.900
Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--

745
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.170
The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums

746
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.730
To buy a present for the emperor

747
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.130
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done

748
00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:55.230
In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels

749
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:57.470
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;

750
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.970
And I am something curious, being strange,

751
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.370
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you

752
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:03.530
To take them in protection?

753
00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.500
Willingly;

754
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.470
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since

755
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.270
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them

756
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:12.370
In my bedchamber.

757
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.230
They are in a trunk,

758
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.430
Attended by my men: I will make bold

759
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.000
To send them to you, only for this night;

760
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
I must aboard to-morrow.

761
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.030
O, no, no.

762
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.900
Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word

763
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.270
By lengthening my return. From Gallia

764
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.000
I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise

765
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.830
To see your grace.

766
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.200
I thank you for your pains:

767
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.730
