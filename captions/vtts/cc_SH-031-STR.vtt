00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.130
(♪song)

3
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.000
Cease to persuade, myloving Proteus:

4
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
Home-keeping youth haveever homely wits.

5
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.730
Were't not affectionchains thy tender days

6
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.630
To the sweet glances ofthy honour'd love,

7
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.670
I rather would entreat thycompany

8
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.870
To see the wonders of theworld abroad,

9
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.100
Than, living dullysluggardized at home,

10
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.330
Wear out thy youth withshapeless idleness.

11
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.430
But since thou lovest, lovestill and thrive therein,

12
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.770
Even as I would whenI to love begin.

13
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.900
Wilt thou be gone? SweetValentine, adieu!

14
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.270
Think on thy Proteus, whenthou haply seest

15
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.000
Some rare note-worthyobject in thy travel:

16
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.070
Wish me partaker in thyhappiness

17
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.270
When thou dost meet goodhap; and in thy danger,

18
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.270
If ever danger do environthee,

19
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.730
Commend thy grievance tomy holy prayers,

20
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.100
For I will be thybeadsman, Valentine.

21
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.870
And on a love-book prayfor my success?

22
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.470
Upon some book I loveI'll pray for thee.

23
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.030
That's on some shallowstory of deep love:

24
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.730
How young Leander cross'dthe Hellespont.

25
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.900
That's a deep story of adeeper love:

26
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.400
For he was more than overshoes in love.

27
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.330
'Tis true; for you areover boots in love,

28
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.930
And yet you never swum theHellespont.

29
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.570
Over the boots? nay, giveme not the boots.

30
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.930
No, I will not, for itboots thee not.

31
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.000
What?

32
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
To be in love, where scornis bought with groans;

33
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.200
Coy looks withheart-sore sighs;

34
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530
one fading moment's mirth

35
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.670
With twenty watchful,weary, tedious nights:

36
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.670
If haply won, perhaps ahapless gain;

37
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.230
If lost, why then agrievous labour won;

38
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.700
However, but a follybought with wit,

39
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.330
Or else a wit by follyvanquished.

40
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.230
So, by your circumstance,you call me fool.

41
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.230
So, by your circumstance,I fear you'll prove.

42
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.300
'Tis love you cavil at: Iam not Love.

43
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300
Love is your master, forhe masters you:

44
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.170
And he that is so yoked bya fool,

45
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.200
Methinks, should not bechronicled for wise.

46
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.670
Yet writers say, as inthe sweetest bud

47
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.030
The eating canker dwells,so eating love

48
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000
Inhabits in the finestwits of all.

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And writers say, as themost forward bud

50
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.930
Is eaten by the canker ereit blow,

51
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.330
Even so by love the youngand tender wit

52
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.730
Is turn'd to folly,blasting in the bud,

53
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.800
Losing his verdure even inthe prime

54
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.900
And all the fair effectsof future hopes.

55
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.400
But wherefore waste I timeto counsel thee,

56
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.570
That art a votary to fonddesire?

57
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.870
Once more adieu! my fatherat the road

58
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.030
Expects my coming, thereto see me shipp'd.

59
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.100
And thither will I bringthee, Valentine.

60
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.100
Sweet Proteus, no; nowlet us take our leave.

61
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.670
To Milan let me hear fromthee by letters

62
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.330
Of thy success in love,and what news else

63
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.730
Betideth here in absenceof thy friend;

64
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.400
And likewise will visitthee with mine.

65
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.570
All happiness bechance tothee in Milan!

66
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.400
As much to you at home!and so, farewell.

67
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.130
He after honour hunts, Iafter love:

68
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.670
He leaves his friends todignify them more,

69
00:04:50.670 --> 00:05:01.070
I leave myself, my friendsand all, for love.

70
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.530
Thou, Julia, thou hastmetamorphosed me,

71
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.600
Made me neglect mystudies, lose my time,

72
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.700
War with good counsel, setthe world at nought;

73
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.130
Made wit with musing weak,heart sick with thought.

74
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.030
Sir Proteus, save you! Sawyou my master?

75
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.100
But now he parted hence,to embark for Milan.

76
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.570
Twenty to one then he isshipp'd already,

77
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.830
And I have play'd thesheep in losing him.

78
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.470
Indeed, a sheep doth veryoften stray,

79
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.530
An if the shepherd be awhile away.

80
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.330
You conclude that my master is ashepherd, then, and I a sheep?

81
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.530
I do.

82
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.430
Why then, my horns are hishorns, whether I wake or sleep.

83
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.470
A silly answer andfitting well a sheep.

84
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.600
This proves me still asheep.

85
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
True; and thy master ashepherd.

86
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200
Nay, that I can deny by acircumstance.

87
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.970
It shall go hard but I'llprove it by another.

88
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.170
The shepherd seeks the sheep,

89
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.300
and not the sheep the Shepherd;

90
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.370
but I seek my master, andmy master seeks not me:

91
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.970
therefore I am no sheep.

92
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.370
The sheep for fodderfollow the shepherd;

93
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.830
the shepherd for foodfollows not the sheep:

94
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.100
thou for wagesfollowest thy master;

95
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.230
thy master for wagesfollows not thee:

96
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.400
therefore thou art a sheep.

97
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.330
Such another proof willmake me cry 'baa.'

98
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.900
But, dost thou hear? gavestthou my letter to Julia?

99
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.530
Ay sir: I, a lost mutton,gave your letter to her,

100
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.100
a laced mutton, and she,a laced mutton, gave me,

101
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.470
a lost mutton, nothingfor my labour.

102
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.970
Here's too small a pasturefor such store of muttons.

103
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.800
If the ground be overcharged,you were best stick her.

104
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
Nay: in that you are astray,'twere best pound you.

105
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.030
Nay, sir,

106
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.570
less than a pound shall serveme for carrying your letter.

107
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.770
You mistake; I mean thepound,--a pinfold.

108
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.500
From a pound to a pin?fold it over and over,

109
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.800
'Tis threefold too little

110
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.100
for carrying a letterto your lover.

111
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.900
But what said she?

112
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.400
Mmm.

113
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400
Mmm?

114
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.830
Ay.

115
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.870
Nod--Ay--why, that'snoddy.

116
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.230
You mistook, sir; Isay, she did nod:

117
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.700
and you ask me if she didnod; and I say, 'Ay.'

118
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.070
And that set together isnoddy.

119
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.170
Now you have taken thepains to set it together,

120
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.400
take it for your pains.

121
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.070
No, no; you shall have itfor bearing the letter.

122
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.630
Well, I perceive I must befain to bear with you.

123
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.700
Why sir, how do you bearwith me?

124
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.930
Marry, sir, theletter, very orderly;

125
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.700
having nothing but the word'noddy' for my pains.

126
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.070
Beshrew me, but you have aquick wit.

127
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.300
And yet it cannot overtakeyour slow purse.

128
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.570
Come come, open the matterin brief: what said she?

129
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.730
Open your purse,that the money

130
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.430
and the matter may beboth at once delivered.

131
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.630
Well, sir, here is foryour pains. What said she?

132
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.070
Truly, sir, I think you'llhardly win her.

133
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.570
Why, couldst thou perceiveso much from her?

134
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.470
Sir, I could perceivenothing at all from her;

135
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.630
no, not so much as a ducatfor delivering your letter:

136
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.800
and being so hard to methat brought your mind,

137
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.430
I fear she'll prove as hardto you in telling your mind.

138
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.000
Give her no token but stones;for she's as hard as steel.

139
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.170
What said she? nothing?

140
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.130
No, not so much as 'Takethis for thy pains.'

141
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.930
To testify your bounty, I thankyou, you have testerned me;

142
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.330
in requital whereof, henceforthcarry your letters yourself:

143
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.130
and so, sir, I'll commendyou to my master.

144
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.500
Go, go, be gone, to saveyour ship from wreck,

145
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.800
Which cannot perish havingthee aboard,

146
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.600
Being destined to a drierdeath on shore.

147
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.970
I must go send some bettermessenger:

148
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.730
I fear my Julia would notdeign my lines,

149
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.200
Receiving them from such aworthless post.

150
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
But say, Lucetta, now weare alone,

151
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.230
Wouldst thou then counselme to fall in love?

152
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.630
Ay, madam, so you stumblenot unheedfully.

153
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.300
Of all the fair resort ofgentlemen

154
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.930
That every day with parleencounter me,

155
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.470
In thy opinion which isworthiest love?

156
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.270
Please you repeat theirnames, I'll show my mind

157
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.600
According to my shallowsimple skill.

158
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.900
What think'st thou of thefair Sir Eglamour?

159
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.800
As of a knight well-spoken,neat and fine;

160
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.230
But, were I you, he nevershould be mine.

161
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.930
What think'st thou of therich Mercatio?

162
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.230
Well of his wealth; but ofhimself, so so.

163
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:59.530
What think'st thou of thegentle Proteus?

164
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.870
Lord, Lord! to see whatfolly reigns in us!

165
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.170
How now! what means thispassion at his name?

166
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.700
Pardon, dear madam: 'tis apassing shame

167
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700
That I, unworthy body as Iam,

168
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.200
Should censure thus onlovely gentlemen.

169
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.530
Why not on Proteus, as ofall the rest?

170
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.770
Then thus: of many good Ithink him best.

171
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.700
Your reason?

172
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.600
I have no other, but awoman's reason;

173
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.270
I think him so because Ithink him so.

174
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.830
And wouldst thou have mecast my love on him?

175
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.170
Ay, if you thought yourlove not cast away.

176
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.800
Why he, of all the rest,hath never moved me.

177
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.570
Yet he, of all the rest, Ithink, best loves ye.

178
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.600
His little speaking showshis love but small.

179
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.870
Fire that's closest keptburns most of all.

180
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.730
They do not love that donot show their love.

181
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.430
O, they love least thatlet men know their love.

182
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.000
I would I knew his mind.

183
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.270
Peruse this paper, madam.

184
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.400
'To Julia.' Say, fromwhom?

185
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.730
That the contents willshow.

186
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.870
Say, say, who gave itthee?

187
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.530
Valentine's page; and sent,I think, from Proteus.

188
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.870
He would have given it you;but I, being in the way,

189
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.330
Did in your name receive it:pardon the fault I pray.

190
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:15.100
Now, by my modesty, agoodly broker!

191
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.830
Dare you presume toharbour wanton lines?

192
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.870
To whisper and conspireagainst my youth?

193
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.330
Now, trust me, 'tis anoffice of great worth

194
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.930
And you an officer fit forthe place.

195
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.300
There, take the paper. See it bereturned.

196
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.970
Or else return no moreinto my sight.

197
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.730
To plead for love deservesmore fee than hate.

198
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.130
Will ye be gone?

199
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:48.630
That you may ruminate.

200
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.870
And yet I would I hado'erlooked the letter:

201
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.370
It were a shame to callher back again

202
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:08.170
And pray her to a faultfor which I chid her.

203
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.300
What a fool is she, thatknows I am a maid,

204
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.200
And would not force theletter to my view!

205
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.770
Since maids, in modesty,say 'no' to that

206
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:22.370
Which they would have theprofferer construe 'ay.'

207
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:44.300
Fie, fie, how wayward isthis foolish love

208
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.300
That, like a testy babe,will scratch the nurse

209
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.100
And presently all humbledkiss the rod!

210
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.130
How churlishly I chidLucetta hence,

211
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.170
When willingly I wouldhave had her here!

212
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.670
How angerly I taught mybrow to frown,

213
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.530
When inward joy enforcedmy heart to smile!

214
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.900
My penance is to callLucetta back

215
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.130
And ask remission for myfolly past.

216
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.830
What ho! Lucetta!

217
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.070
What would your ladyship?

218
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.030
Is't near dinner-time?

219
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.000
I would it were,

220
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.830
That you might kill yourstomach on your meat

221
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.300
And not upon your maid.

222
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.930
What is't that you took upso gingerly?

223
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.970
Nothing.

224
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.430
Why didst thou stoop,then?

225
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.330
To take a paper up that Ilet fall.

226
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.700
And is that paper nothing?

227
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.130
Nothing concerning me.

228
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.230
Then let it lie for thosethat it concerns.

229
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.800
Madam, it will not liewhere it concerns

230
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.530
Unless it have a falseinterpeter.

231
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.200
Some love of yours hathwrit to you in rhyme.

232
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.770
That I might sing it,madam, to a tune.

233
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.470
Give me a note: yourladyship can set.

234
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.370
As little by such toys asmay be possible.

235
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.430
Best sing it to the tuneof 'Light o' love.'

236
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.630
It is too heavy for solight a tune.

237
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.630
Heavy! belike it hath someburden then?

238
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.700
Ay, and melodious were it,would you sing it.

239
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.000
And why not you?

240
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.200
I cannot reach so high.

241
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:23.100
Let's see your song. Hownow, minion!

242
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.370
Keep tune there still, soyou will sing it out:

243
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.900
And yet methinks I do notlike this tune.

244
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.600
You do not?

245
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.800
No, madam; it is toosharp.

246
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.230
You, minion, are toosaucy.

247
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.530
Nay, now you are too flat

248
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.500
And mar the concord withtoo harsh a descant:

249
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.270
There wanteth but a meanto fill your song.

250
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.700
The mean is drown'd withyour unruly bass.

251
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.230
Indeed, I bid the base forProteus.

252
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.830
This babble shall nothenceforth trouble me.

253
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.100
Here is a coil withprotestation!

254
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.330
Go get you gone, and letthe papers lie:

255
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
You would be fingeringthem, to anger me.

256
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.700
She makes it strange; butshe would be best pleased

257
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.370
To be so anger'd withanother letter.

258
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:14.700
Nay, would I were soanger'd with the same!

259
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:23.570
O hateful hands, to tearsuch loving words!

260
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.070
Injurious wasps, to feedon such sweet honey

261
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:34.970
And kill the bees thatyield it with your stings!

262
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.130
I'll kiss each severalpaper for amends.

263
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:46.870
Look, here is writ 'kindJulia.' Unkind Julia!

264
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.400
As in revenge of thyingratitude,

265
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.930
I throw thy name againstthe bruising stones,

266
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.830
Trampling contemptuouslyon thy disdain.

267
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:02.400
And here is writ'love-wounded Proteus.'

268
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.400
Poor wounded name! mybosom as a bed

269
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.870
Shall lodge thee till thywound be thoroughly heal'd;

270
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:17.230
And thus I search it witha sovereign kiss.

271
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.500
But twice or thrice was'Proteus' written down.

272
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.830
Be calm, good wind, blownot a word away

273
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.100
Till I have found eachletter in the letter,

274
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.430
Except mine own name: thatsome whirlwind bear

275
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.800
Unto a raggedfearful-hanging rock

276
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.070
And throw it thence intothe raging sea!

277
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:39.500
Lo, here in one line ishis name twice writ,

278
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:45.600
'Poor forlorn Proteus,passionate Proteus,

279
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.400
To the sweet Julia:' thatI'll tear away.

280
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.770
And yet I will not, sithso prettily

281
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:01.700
He couples it to hiscomplaining names.

282
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:08.470
Thus will I fold them oneon another:

283
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:17.800
Now kiss, embrace,contend, do what you will.

284
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.570
Madam,

285
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.300
Dinner is ready, and yourfather stays.

286
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.930
Well, let us go.

287
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.770
What, shall these paperslie like tell-tales here?

288
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.900
If you respect them, bestto take them up.

289
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.100
Nay, I was taken up forlaying them down:

290
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.200
Yet here they shall notlie, for catching cold.

291
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.730
I see you have a month'smind to them.

292
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.830
Ay, madam, you may saywhat sights you see;

293
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.430
I see things too, althoughyou judge I wink.

294
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.970
Come, come; will't pleaseyou go?

295
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:48.330
Tell me, Panthino, whatsad talk was that

296
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.100
Wherewith my brother heldyou in the cloister?

297
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.400
'Twas of his nephewProteus, your son.

298
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.170
Why, what of him?

299
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.230
He wonder'd that yourlordship

300
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.830
Would suffer him to spendhis youth at home,

301
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.730
While other men, ofslender reputation,

302
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.800
Put forth their sons toseek preferment out:

303
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.600
Some to the wars, to trytheir fortune there;

304
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.230
Some to discover islandsfar away;

305
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.330
Some to the studiousuniversities.

306
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.430
For any or for all theseexercises,

307
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.100
He said that Proteus yourson was meet,

308
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.630
And did request me toimportune you

309
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.400
To let him spend his timeno more at home,

310
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.730
Which would be greatimpeachment to his age,

311
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.330
In having known no travelin his youth.

312
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.970
Nor need'st thou muchimportune me to that

313
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.300
Whereon this month I havebeen hammering.

314
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.530
I have consider'd well hisloss of time

315
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.030
And how he cannot be aperfect man,

316
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.400
Not being tried andtutor'd in the world:

317
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.400
Experience is by industryachieved

318
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.300
And perfected by the swiftcourse of time.

319
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.200
Then tell me, whither wereI best to send him?

320
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.870
I think your lordship isnot ignorant

321
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.170
How his companion,youthful Valentine,

322
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.600
Attends the emperor in hisroyal court.

323
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.800
I know it well.

324
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.930
'Twere good, I think, yourlordship sent him thither:

325
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.970
There shall he practisetilts and tournaments,

326
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.070
Hear sweet discourse,converse with noblemen.

327
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.730
And be in eye of everyexercise

328
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.330
Worthy his youth andnobleness of birth.

329
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.700
I like thy counsel; wellhast thou advised:

330
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.800
And that thou mayst perceivehow well I like it,

331
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.870
The execution of it shallmake known.

332
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.130
Even with the speediestexpedition

333
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.330
I will dispatch him to theemperor's court.

334
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.300
To-morrow, may it pleaseyou, Don Alphonso,

335
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.700
With other gentlemen ofgood esteem,

336
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.600
Are journeying to salutethe emperor

337
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.530
And to commend theirservice to his will.

338
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.630
Good company; with themshall Proteus go:

339
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.270
And, in good time! nowwill we break with him.

340
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:37.870
Sweet love! sweet lines!sweet life!

341
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.370
Here is her hand, theagent of her heart;

342
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.270
Here is her oath for love,her honour's pawn.

343
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.230
O, that our fathers wouldapplaud our loves,

344
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.900
To seal our happiness withtheir consents!

345
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.170
O heavenly Julia!

346
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.770
How now! what letter areyou reading there?

347
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:05.630
May't please your lordship,'tis a word or two

348
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.970
Of commendations sent fromValentine,

349
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.400
Deliver'd by a friend thatcame from him.

350
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.400
Lend me the letter; let mesee what news.

351
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.870
There is no news, my lord,but that he writes

352
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.970
How happily he lives, howwell beloved

353
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.170
And daily graced by theemperor;

354
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.170
Wishing me with him,partner of his fortune.

355
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.000
And how stand you affectedto his wish?

356
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.800
As one relying on yourlordship's will

357
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.000
And not depending on hisfriendly wish.

358
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
My will is somethingsorted with his wish.

359
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.500
Muse not that I thussuddenly proceed;

360
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.870
For what I will, I will,and there an end.

361
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.330
I am resolved that thoushalt spend some time

362
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.930
With Valentinus in theemperor's court:

363
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.400
What maintenance he fromhis friends receives,

364
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.130
Like exhibition thou shalthave from me.

365
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.370
To-morrow be in readinessto go:

366
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.130
Excuse it not, for I amperemptory.

367
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.600
My lord, I cannot be sosoon provided:

368
00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.030
Please you, deliberate aday or two.

369
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.200
Look, what thou want'stshall be sent after thee:

370
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.100
No more of stay! to-morrowthou must go.

371
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.270
Come on, Panthino: youshall be employ'd

372
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:12.700
To hasten on hisexpedition.

373
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.830
Thus have I shunn'd thefire for fear of burning,

374
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:32.800
And drench'd me in thesea, where I am drown'd.

375
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.670
I fear'd to show my fatherJulia's letter,

376
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.570
Lest he should takeexceptions to my love;

377
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.730
And with the vantage ofmine own excuse

378
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:49.070
Hath he excepted mostagainst my love.

379
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.600
O, how this spring of loveresembleth

380
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.470
The uncertain glory of anApril day,

381
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.230
Which now shows all thebeauty of the sun,

382
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:03.800
And by and by a cloudtakes all away!

383
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.300
Sir Proteus, your fathercalls for you:

384
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.100
He is in haste; therefore,I pray you to go.

385
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.600
Why, this it is: my heartaccords thereto,

386
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:23.500
And yet a thousand timesit answers 'no.'

387
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:36.730
(♪song)

388
00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.400
Sir, your glove.

389
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.970
Not mine; my gloves areon.

390
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:06.700
Why, then, this may beyours, for this is but one.

391
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:12.570
Ha! let me see: ay, giveit me, it's mine:

392
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.130
Sweet ornament that decksa thing divine!

393
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.770
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!

394
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.230
Madam Silvia! MadamSilvia!

395
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.170
How now, sirrah?

396
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:23.800
She is not within hearing,sir.

397
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:24.800
Why, sir, who bade youcall her?

398
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.130
Your worship, sir; or elseI mistook.

399
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.470
Well, you'll still be tooforward.

400
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.270
And yet I was last chiddenfor being too slow.

401
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.130
Go to, sir: tell me, doyou know Madam Silvia?

402
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.400
She that your worshiploves?

403
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.130
Why, how know you that Iam in love?

404
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.900
Marry, by thesespecial marks: first,

405
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.370
you have learned, like SirProteus, to wreathe your arms,

406
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.030
like a malecontent; torelish a love-song,

407
00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:49.400
like a robin-redbreast;

408
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.070
to walk alone, like onethat had the pestilence;

409
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.800
to sigh, like a school-boy

410
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.700
that had lost his A B C;

411
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.300
to weep, like a young wenchthat had buried her grandam;

412
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.670
to fast, like onethat takes diet;

413
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.170
to watch like onethat fears robbing;

414
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.970
to speak puling, like abeggar at Hallowmas.

415
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.600
You were wont, when youlaughed, to crow like a cock;

416
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.070
when you walked, to walklike one of the lions;

417
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:14.230
when you fasted, it waspresently after dinner;

418
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.300
when you looked sadly, itwas for want of money:

419
00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.730
and now you are metamorphosedwith a mistress, that,

420
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.270
when I look on you, I canhardly think you my master.

421
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:23.030
Are all these thingsperceived in me?

422
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.630
They are all perceivedwithout ye.

423
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.200
Without me? they cannot.

424
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.270
Without you? nay,that's certain, for,

425
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.830
without you were sosimple, none else would:

426
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.330
but you are so withoutthese follies,

427
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.570
that these folliesare within you

428
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.600
and shine through you likethe water in an urinal,

429
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.400
that not an eye that seesyou but is a physician

430
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.770
to comment on your malady.

431
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.830
But tell me, dost thouknow my lady Silvia?

432
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.130
She that you gaze on so asshe sits at supper?

433
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.000
Hast thou observed that?even she, I mean.

434
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.600
Why, sir, I know her not.

435
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.070
Dost thou know her bymy gazing on her,

436
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.200
and yet knowest her not?

437
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.970
Is she not hard-favoured,sir?

438
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.300
Not so fair, boy, aswell-favoured.

439
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.630
Sir, I know that wellenough.

440
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.100
What dost thou know?

441
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.800
That she is not so fairas, of you, well-favoured.

442
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.100
I mean that herbeauty is exquisite,

443
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.000
but her favour infinite.

444
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.400
That's because theone is painted

445
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.830
and the other outof all count.

446
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.670
How painted? and how outof count?

447
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:11.330
Marry, sir, so painted,to make her fair,

448
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.000
that no man countsof her beauty.

449
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.430
How esteemest thou me? Iaccount of her beauty.

450
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.570
You never saw her sinceshe was deformed.

451
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.200
How long hath she beendeformed?

452
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.800
Ever since you loved her.

453
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.370
I have loved her eversince I saw her;

454
00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.100
and still I see her beautiful.

455
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.800
If you love her, youcannot see her.

456
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.870
Why?

457
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:32.430
Because Love is blind. O,that you had mine eyes;

458
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.300
or your own eyes had thelights they were wont to have

459
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.130
when you chid at Sir Proteusfor going ungartered!

460
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.300
What should I see then?

461
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.430
Your own present folly andher passing deformity:

462
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.800
for he, being in love, couldnot see to garter his hose,

463
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.700
and you, being in love, cannotsee to put on your hose.

464
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.300
Belike, boy, then,you are in love;

465
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.130
for last morning you couldnot see to wipe my shoes.

466
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.830
True, sir; I was in lovewith my bed: I thank you,

467
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.030
you swinged me for my love,

468
00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.970
which makes me the bolderto chide you for yours.

469
00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:01.300
In conclusion, I standaffected to her.

470
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.730
I would you were set, soyour affection would cease.

471
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.970
Last night she enjoined me

472
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.730
to write some linesto one she loves.

473
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:08.530
And have you?

474
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.200
I have.

475
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.400
Are they not lamely writ?

476
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.670
No, boy, but as well as Ican do them. Peace!

477
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.200
here she comes.

478
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.370
O excellent motion! Oexceeding puppet!

479
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.970
Now will he interpret toher.

480
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:51.000
Madam and mistress, athousand good-morrows.

481
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.470
O, give ye good even! here'sa million of manners.

482
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:58.130
Sir Valentine and servant,to you two thousand.

483
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:03.900
He should give her interestand she gives it him.

484
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.870
As you enjoin'd me, I havewrit your letter

485
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.170
Unto the secret namelessfriend of yours;

486
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.270
Which I was much unwillingto proceed in

487
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:26.730
But for my duty to yourladyship.

488
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.370
I thank you gentle servant:'tis very clerkly done.

489
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.670
Now trust me, madam, itcame hardly off;

490
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.570
For being ignorant to whomit goes

491
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.230
I writ at random, verydoubtfully.

492
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.300
Perchance you think toomuch of so much pains?

493
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.570
No, madam; so it steadyou, I will write

494
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.800
Please you command, a thousandtimes as much; And yet--

495
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:52.670
A pretty period! Well, Iguess the sequel;

496
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.830
And yet I will not nameit; and yet I care not;

497
00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:01.100
And yet take this again;and yet I thank you,

498
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.970
Meaning henceforth totrouble you no more.

499
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.200
And yet you will; and yetanother 'yet.'

500
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.400
What means your ladyship?do you not like it?

501
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:18.070
Yes, yes; the lines arevery quaintly writ;

502
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.070
But since unwillingly,take them again.

503
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:27.130
Nay, take them.

504
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.830
Madam, they are for you.

505
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:38.270
Ay, ay: you writ them,sir, at my request;

506
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:42.070
But I will none of them;they are for you;

507
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.070
I would have had them writmore movingly.

508
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:46.170
Please you, I'll writeyour ladyship another.

509
00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:49.070
And when it's writ, for mysake read it over,

510
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:54.930
And if it please you, so;if not, why, so.

511
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.170
If it please me, madam,what then?

512
00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:02.530
Why, if it please you,take it for your labour:

513
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:11.900
And so, good morrow,servant.

514
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.400
O jest unseen,inscrutable, invisible,

515
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.400
As a nose on a man's face, ora weathercock on a steeple!

516
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.930
My master sues to her, andshe hath taught her suitor,

517
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:23.370
He being her pupil, tobecome her tutor.

518
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.870
O excellent device! wasthere ever heard a better,

519
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.570
That my master, being scribe,

520
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.830
to himself shouldwrite the letter?

521
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.570
How now, sir? what are youreasoning with yourself?

522
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:34.670
Nay, I was rhyming: 'tisyou that have the reason.

523
00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:35.530
To do what?

524
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.070
To be a spokesman forMadam Silvia.

525
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.200
To whom?

526
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.000
To yourself: why, shewooes you by a figure.

527
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.830
What figure?

528
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.030
By a letter, I should say.

529
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.330
Why, she hath not writ tome?

530
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.470
What need she, when she hathmade you write to yourself?

531
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.000
Why, do you notperceive the jest?

532
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:49.770
No, believe me.

533
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.430
No believing you, indeed, sir.

534
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.770
But did you perceiveher earnest?

535
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.570
She gave me none, exceptan angry word.

536
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.670
Why, she hath given you aletter.

537
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.330
That's the letter I writto her friend.

538
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:03.500
And that letter hath shedelivered, and there an end.

539
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.070
I would it were no worse.

540
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.170
I'll warrant you, 'tis aswell:

541
00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.000
For often have you writ toher, and she, in modesty,

542
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.930
Or else for want of idletime, could not again reply;

543
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.800
Or fearing else some messengerthat might her mind discover,

544
00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.070
Herself hath taughther love himself

545
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.370
to write untoher lover.

546
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.570
All this I speak in print,for in print I found it.

547
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.900
Why muse you, sir? 'tisdinner-time.

548
00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.270
I have dined.

549
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.100
Ay, but hearken, sir;

550
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.700
though the chameleon Lovecan feed on the air,

551
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.170
I am one that amnourished by my

552
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.470
victuals, and wouldfain have meat.

553
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.970
O, be not like your mistress;be moved, be moved.

554
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.030
Have patience, gentleJulia.

555
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.430
I must, where is noremedy.

556
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.000
When possibly I can, Iwill return.

557
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.200
If you turn not, you willreturn the sooner.

558
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:06.270
Keep this remembrance forthy Julia's sake.

559
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.370
Why then, we'll make exchange;here, take you this.

560
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.230
And seal the bargain witha holy kiss.

561
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.370
Here is my hand for mytrue constancy;

562
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:21.830
And when that houro'erslips me in the day

563
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.170
Wherein I sigh not, Julia,for thy sake,

564
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.130
The next ensuing hour somefoul mischance

565
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.130
Torment me for my love'sforgetfulness!

566
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.500
My father stays my coming;answer not;

567
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.370
The tide is now: nay, notthy tide of tears;

568
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.900
That tide will stay melonger than I should.

569
00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.830
Julia, farewell!

570
00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:44.900
What, gone without a word?

571
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.400
Ay, so true love shoulddo: it cannot speak;

572
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.700
For truth hath better deedsthan words to grace it.

573
00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.770
Sir Proteus, you arestay'd for.

574
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.470
Go; I come, I come.

575
00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:04.800
Alas! this parting strikespoor lovers dumb.

576
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.900
Nay, 'twill be this hourere I have done weeping;

577
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:16.430
all the kind of the Launceshave this very fault.

578
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.700
I have received my proportion,like the prodigious son,

579
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:22.800
and am going with Sir Proteusto the Imperial's court.

580
00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.370
I think Crab, my dog, be thesourest-natured dog that lives:

581
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:30.770
my mother weeping,my father wailing,

582
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.600
my sister crying,our maid howling,

583
00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.170
our cat wringing her hands,

584
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.570
yet did not this cruel-heartedcur shed one tear:

585
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.470
he is a stone, avery pebble stone,

586
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.130
and has no more pityin him than a dog:

587
00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.000
a Jew would have wept tohave seen our parting;

588
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.400
why, my grandam,

589
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.270
having no eyes, look you, weptherself blind at my parting.

590
00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.030
Nay, I'll show youthe manner of it.

591
00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:01.930
This shoe is my father: no,this left shoe is my father:

592
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.700
no, no, this leftshoe is my mother:

593
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.930
nay, that cannot be so neither:yes, it is so, it is so,

594
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:11.700
it hath the worser sole. Thisshoe, with the hole in it,

595
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.200
is my mother, and this myfather; a vengeance on't!

596
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.770
there 'tis: now, sit,this staff is my sister,

597
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.070
for, look you, she isas white as a lily

598
00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:27.030
and as small as a wand:this hat is Nan, our maid:

599
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.730
I am the dog: no,the dog is himself,

600
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.830
and I am the dog--Oh! thedog is me, and I am myself;

601
00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:40.570
ay, so, so. Now come I to myfather; Father, your blessing:

602
00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:44.600
now should not the shoespeak a word for weeping:

603
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:50.430
now should I kiss myfather; well, he weeps on.

604
00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:53.300
Now come I to my mother: O,that she could speak now

605
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:59.570
weaping like a wild woman!Now should I kiss my mother;

606
00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:06.300
why, there 'tis; here's mymother's breath up and down.

607
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:12.600
Now come I to my sister;mark the moan she makes.

608
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:18.430
Now the dog all this while shedsnot a tear nor speaks a word;

609
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.870
but see how I lay thedust with my tears.

610
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:25.970
Launce, away, away, aboard!thy master is shipped

611
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.670
and thou art to postafter with oars.

612
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.800
What's the matter? why weepestthou, man? Away, ass!

613
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.730
You'll lose the tide, ifyou tarry any longer.

614
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:35.370
It is no matter ifthe tied were lost;

615
00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.100
for it is the unkindest tiedthat ever any man tied.

616
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.300
What's the unkindest tide?

617
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.100
Why, he that's tied here,Crab, my dog.

618
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.170
Tut, man, I mean thou'ltlose the flood,

619
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.130
and, in losing the flood,lose thy voyage, and,

620
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.700
in losing thy voyage,lose thy master,

621
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:48.430
and, in losing thy master,lose thy service,

622
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.830
and, in losing thy service,--Whydost thou stop my mouth?

623
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:53.430
For fear thou shouldstlose thy tongue.

624
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.570
Where should I lose mytongue?

625
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.600
In thy tale.

626
00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.630
In thy tail!

627
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:59.570
Lose the tide, and thevoyage, and the master,

628
00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:01.600
and the service, andthe tied! Why, man,

629
00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:04.330
if the river were dry, I amable to fill it with my tears;

630
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.970
if the wind were down, I coulddrive the boat with my sighs.

631
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:11.600
Come, come away, man; Iwas sent to call thee.

632
00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.170
Sir, call me what thoudarest.

633
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.570
Wilt thou go?

634
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:21.730
Well, I will go.

635
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.570
Servant!

636
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:06.370
Mistress?

637
00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.530
Master, Sir Thurio frownson you.

638
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.730
Ay, boy, it's for love.

639
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:10.930
Not of you.

640
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.270
Of my mistress, then.

641
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.730
'Twere good you knockedhim.

642
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.130
Servant, you are sad.

643
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.970
Indeed, madam, I seem so.

644
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.600
Seem you that you are not?

645
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.530
Haply I do.

646
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:20.470
So do counterfeits.

647
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:21.170
So do you.

648
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:22.470
What seem I that I am not?

649
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:23.370
Wise.

650
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:24.900
What instance of thecontrary?

651
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.930
Your folly.

652
00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:27.200
And how quote you myfolly?

653
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.570
I quote it in your jerkin.

654
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.200
My jerkin is a doublet.

655
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.100
Well, then, I'll doubleyour folly.

656
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.230
How?

657
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.730
What, angry, Sir Thurio!do you change colour?

658
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.570
Give him leave, madam; heis a kind of chameleon.

659
00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.570
That hath more mind

660
00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:44.200
to feed on your bloodthan live in your air.

661
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.700
You have said, sir.

662
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.400
Ay, sir, and done too, forthis time.

663
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.030
I know it well, sir; youalways end ere you begin.

664
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.700
A fine volley ofwords, gentlemen,

665
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.300
and quickly shot off.

666
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:00.630
'Tis indeed, madam; wethank the giver.

667
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:01.830
Who is that, servant?

668
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.170
Yourself, sweet lady;for you gave the fire.

669
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.270
Sir Thurio borrows his witfrom your ladyship's looks,

670
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.570
and spends what he borrowskindly in your company.

671
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:14.600
Sir, if you spend wordfor word with me,

672
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.400
I shall make yourwit bankrupt.

673
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.130
I know it well, sir; youhave an exchequer of words,

674
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.830
and, I think, no othertreasure to give your

675
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.500
followers, for it appearsby their bare liveries,

676
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.530
that they live by yourbare words.

677
00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:30.930
No more, gentlemen, nomore:--here comes my father.

678
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.830
Now, daughter Silvia, youare hard beset.

679
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.770
Sir Valentine, yourfather's in good health:

680
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.700
What say you to a letterfrom your friends

681
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.000
Of much good news?

682
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.200
My lord, I will bethankful.

683
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.530
To any happy messengerfrom thence.

684
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.870
Know ye Don Antonio, yourcountryman?

685
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:55.370
Ay, my good lord, I knowthe gentleman

686
00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.470
To be of worth and worthyestimation

687
00:38:57.470 --> 00:39:00.270
And not without desert sowell reputed.

688
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.400
Hath he not a son?

689
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.670
Ay, my good lord; a sonthat well deserves

690
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:06.730
The honour and regard ofsuch a father.

691
00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:08.000
You know him well?

692
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
I know him as myself; forfrom our infancy

693
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.470
We have conversed andspent our hours together:

694
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.500
And though myself havebeen an idle truant,

695
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:18.800
Omitting the sweet benefitof time

696
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.100
To clothe mine age withangel-like perfection,

697
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.500
Yet hath Sir Proteus, forthat's his name,

698
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.100
Made use and fairadvantage of his days;

699
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.870
His years but young, buthis experience old;

700
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.770
His head unmellow'd, buthis judgment ripe;

701
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.770
And, in a word, for farbehind his worth

702
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:38.070
Comes all the praises thatI now bestow,

703
00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.130
He is complete in featureand in mind

704
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:44.500
With all good grace tograce a gentleman.

705
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.330
Beshrew me, sir, but if hemake this good,

706
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.170
He is as worthy for anempress' love

707
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.430
As meet to be an emperor'scounsellor.

708
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:55.600
Well, sir, this gentlemanis come to me,

709
00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.370
With commendation fromgreat potentates;

710
00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.470
And here he means to spendhis time awhile:

711
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.730
I think 'tis no unwelcomenews to you.

712
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.230
Should I have wish'd athing, it had been he.

713
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.130
Welcome him then accordingto his worth.

714
00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.770
Silvia, I speak to you,and you, Sir Thurio;

715
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.900
For Valentine, I need notcite him to it:

716
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.800
I will send him hither toyou presently.

717
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.900
This is the gentleman Itold your ladyship

718
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.770
Had come along with me,but that his mistress

719
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:30.470
Did hold his eyes lock'din her crystal looks.

720
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.100
Belike that now she hathenfranchised them

721
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.630
Upon some other pawn forfealty.

722
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.570
Nay, sure, I think sheholds them prisoners still.

723
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.270
Nay, then he should be blind;

724
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.970
and, being blind How could hesee his way to seek out you?

725
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:50.430
Why, lady, Love hathtwenty pair of eyes.

726
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:52.930
They say that Love hathnot an eye at all.

727
00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.200
To see such lovers,Thurio, as yourself:

728
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.230
Upon a homely object Lovecan wink.

729
00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:02.070
Have done, have done; herecomes the gentleman.

730
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:09.070
Welcome, dear Proteus!Mistress, I beseech you,

731
00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:11.770
Confirm his welcome withsome special favour.

732
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.000
His worth is warrant forhis welcome hither,

733
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.100
If this be he you oft havewish'd to hear from.

734
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.170
Mistress, it is: sweetlady, entertain him

735
00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.370
To be my fellow-servant toyour ladyship.

736
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:25.530
Too low a mistress for sohigh a servant.

737
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.770
Not so, sweet lady: buttoo mean a servant

738
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.270
To have a look of such aworthy mistress.

739
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.270
Leave off discourse ofdisability:

740
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.030
Sweet lady, entertain himfor your servant.

741
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.570
My duty will I boast of;nothing else.

742
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.500
And duty never yet didwant his meed:

743
00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:44.230
Servant, you are welcometo a worthless mistress.

744
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.730
I'll die on him that saysso but yourself.

745
00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.370
That you are welcome?

746
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:51.000
That you are worthless.

747
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.800
Madam, my lord your fatherwould speak with you.

748
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.100
I wait upon his pleasure.Come, Sir Thurio,

749
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.100
Go with me. Once more, newservant, welcome:

750
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.300
I'll leave you to conferof home affairs;

751
00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.000
When you have done, welook to hear from you.

752
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.730
We'll both attend uponyour ladyship.

753
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:21.030
Now, tell me, how do allfrom whence you came?

754
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:22.900
Your friends are well andhave them much commended.

755
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.830
And how do yours?

756
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:24.870
I left them all in health.

757
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:26.770
How does your lady? andhow thrives your love?

758
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.530
My tales of love were wontto weary you;

759
00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.070
I know you joy not in alove discourse.

760
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:35.430
Ay, Proteus, but that lifeis alter'd now:

761
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.770
I have done penance forcontemning Love,

762
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:41.030
Whose high imperiousthoughts have punish'd me

763
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:43.930
With bitter fasts, withpenitential groans,

764
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.500
With nightly tears anddaily heart-sore sighs;

765
00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.370
For in revenge of mycontempt of love,

766
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.230
Love hath chased sleepfrom my enthralled eyes

767
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.500
And made them watchers ofmine own heart's sorrow.

768
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.030
O gentle Proteus, Love's amighty lord,

769
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.700
And hath so humbled me,as, I confess,

770
00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.430
There is no woe to hiscorrection,

771
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:02.930
Nor to his service no suchjoy on earth.

772
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.470
Now no discourse, exceptit be of love;

773
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.900
Now can I break my fast,dine, sup and sleep,

774
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.900
Upon the very naked nameof love.

775
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.000
Enough; I read yourfortune in your eye.

776
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.930
Was this the idol that youworship so?

777
00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.630
Even she; and is she not aheavenly saint?

778
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.300
No; but she is an earthlyparagon.

779
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.500
Call her divine.

780
00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:23.570
I will not flatter her.

781
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:26.830
O, flatter me; for lovedelights in praises.

782
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.870
When I was sick, you gaveme bitter pills,

783
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.230
And I must minister thelike to you.

784
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:33.230
Then speak the truth byher; if not divine,

785
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.770
Yet let her be aprincipality,

786
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.030
Sovereign to all thecreatures on the earth.

787
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.600
Except my mistress.

788
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600
Sweet, except not any;

789
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.730
Except thou wilt exceptagainst my love.

790
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.770
Have I not reason toprefer mine own?

791
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.370
And I will help thee toprefer her too:

792
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.430
She shall be dignifiedwith this high honour--

793
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.570
To bear my lady's train,lest the base earth

794
00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.930
Should from her vesturechance to steal a kiss

795
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:54.300
And, of so great a favourgrowing proud,

796
00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.470
Disdain to root thesummer-swelling flower

797
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.530
And make rough wintereverlastingly.

798
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.600
Why, Valentine, whatbraggardism is this?

799
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.630
Pardon me, Proteus: all Ican is nothing

800
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:07.300
To her whose worth makesother worthies nothing;

801
00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:08.000
She is alone.

802
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.170
Then let her alone.

803
00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.030
Not for the world: why,man, she is mine own,

804
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.770
And I as rich in havingsuch a jewel

805
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.630
As twenty seas, if alltheir sand were pearl,

806
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.730
The water nectar and therocks pure gold.

807
00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:23.100
Forgive me that I do notdream on thee,

808
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.600
Because thou see'st medote upon my love.

809
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.430
My foolish rival, that herfather likes

810
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.530
Only for his possessionsare so huge,

811
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.500
Is gone with her along,and I must after,

812
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.500
For love, thou know'st, isfull of jealousy.

813
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.770
But she loves you?

814
00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:41.930
Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay,more, our, marriage-hour,

815
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.070
With all the cunningmanner of our flight,

816
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.530
Determined of; how I mustclimb her window,

817
00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.000
The ladder made of cords,and all the means

818
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.330
Plotted and 'greed on formy happiness.

819
00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.970
Good Proteus, go with meto my chamber,

820
00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.400
In these affairs to aid mewith thy counsel.

821
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.170
Go on before; I shallinquire you forth:

822
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:58.570
I must unto the road, todisembark

823
00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:00.470
Some necessaries that Ineeds must use,

824
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.570
And then I'll presentlyattend you.

825
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:02.270
Will you make haste?

826
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.670
I will.

827
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:32.970
(wind blows furiously)

828
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:57.300
Even as one heat anotherheat expels,

829
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:01.530
Or as one nail by strengthdrives out another,

830
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.570
So the remembrance of myformer love

831
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:09.330
Is by a newer object quiteforgotten.

832
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:15.030
Is it mine, or Valentine'spraise,

833
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:20.030
Her true perfection, or myfalse transgression,

834
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.470
That makes me reasonlessto reason thus?

835
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:28.130
She is fair; and so isJulia that I love--

836
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:35.670
That I did love, for nowmy love is thaw'd;

837
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.070
Which, like a waxen image,'gainst a fire,

838
00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:41.500
Bears no impression of thething it was.

839
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:43.400
Methinks my zeal toValentine is cold,

840
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.700
And that I love him not asI was wont.

841
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.400
O, but I love his lady tootoo much,

842
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.500
And that's the reason Ilove him so little.

843
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.600
How shall I dote on herwith more advice,

844
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.370
That thus without advicebegin to love her!

845
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.130
'Tis but her picture Ihave yet beheld,

846
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:05.100
And that hath dazzled myreason's light;

847
00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.970
But when I look on herperfections,

848
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:13.300
There is no reason but Ishall be blind.

849
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:19.200
If I can cheque my erringlove, I will;

850
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:26.230
If not, to compass herI'll use my skill.

851
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.230
Launce! by mine honesty,welcome to the courts!

852
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.370
Forswear not thyself, sweetyouth, for I am not welcome.

853
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.930
I reckon this always, thata man is never undone

854
00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.130
till he be hanged, nornever welcome to a place

855
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.430
till some certain shot be paidand the hostess say 'Welcome!'

856
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:44.100
Come on, you madcap, I'll to thealehouse with you presently;

857
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.130
where, for one shotof five pence,

858
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.530
thou shalt have fivethousand welcomes.

859
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:51.300
But, sirrah, how did thymaster part with Madam Julia?

860
00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.930
Marry, after theyclosed in earnest,

861
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:54.830
they parted veryfairly in jest.

862
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:55.670
But shall she marry him?

863
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:56.370
No.

864
00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:57.300
How then? shall he marryher?

865
00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.970
No, neither.

866
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:59.930
What, are they broken?

867
00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.270
No, they are both as wholeas a fish.

868
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.670
Why, then, how stands thematter with them?

869
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.230
Marry, thus: when itstands well with him,

870
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.670
it stands well with her.

871
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:07.600
What an ass art thou! Iunderstand thee not.

872
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.530
What a block art thou,that thou canst not!

873
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:10.500
My staff understands me.

874
00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.400
What thou sayest?

875
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.770
Ay, and what I do too:

876
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.630
look thee, I'll but lean, andmy staff understands me.

877
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.070
It stands under thee,indeed.

878
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.630
Why, stand-under andunder-stand is all one.

879
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:22.800
But tell me true, will'tbe a match?

880
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:29.270
Ask my dog: if he say yes, itwill! if he say no, it will;

881
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.400
if he shake his tail andsay nothing, it will.

882
00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.700
The conclusion isthen that it will.

883
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.300
Thou shalt never getsuch a secret from me

884
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.570
but by a parable.

885
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.070
'Tis well that I get it so.But, Launce, how sayest thou,

886
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:42.370
that my master is becomea notable lover?

887
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.600
I never knew himotherwise.

888
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.630
Than how?

889
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.170
A notable lubber, as thoureportest him to be.

890
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.330
Why, thou whoreson ass,thou mistakest me.

891
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.630
Why, fool, I meant notthee; I meant thy master.

892
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.030
I tell thee, my master isbecome a hot lover.

893
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.670
Why, I tell thee, I care notthough he burn himself in love.

894
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:58.870
If thou wilt, go withme to the alehouse;

895
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.870
if not, thou artan Hebrew, a Jew,

896
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.270
and not worth thename of a Christian.

897
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:04.230
Why?

898
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.970
Because thou hast not somuch charity in thee

899
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:08.470
as to go to the ale with aChristian. Wilt thou go?

900
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:11.130
At thy service.

901
00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:25.900
To leave my Julia, shall Ibe forsworn;

902
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.930
To love fair Silvia, shallI be forsworn;

903
00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:33.400
To wrong my friend, Ishall be much forsworn;

904
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.270
And even that power whichgave me first my oath

905
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:39.430
Provokes me to thisthreefold perjury;

906
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:46.500
Love bade me swear andLove bids me forswear.

907
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:50.870
O sweet-suggesting Love,if thou hast sinned,

908
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:55.770
Teach me, thy temptedsubject, to excuse it!

909
00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:00.070
At first I did adore atwinkling star,

910
00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:06.870
But now I worship acelestial sun.

911
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.430
Unheedful vows mayheedfully be broken,

912
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:11.930
And he wants wit thatwants resolved will

913
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:17.270
To learn his wit to exchangethe bad for better.

914
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:24.470
Fie, fie, unreverendtongue! to call her bad,

915
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.070
Whose sovereignty so oftthou hast preferr'd

916
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.770
With twenty thousandsoul-confirming oaths.

917
00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:37.070
I cannot leave to love,and yet I do;

918
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:40.570
But there I leave to lovewhere I should love.

919
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:45.800
Julia I lose and ValentineI lose:

920
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:52.030
If I keep them, I needsmust lose myself;

921
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:56.770
If I lose them, thus findI by their loss

922
00:50:56.770 --> 00:51:01.170
For Valentine myself, forJulia Silvia.

923
00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:03.870
I to myself am dearer thana friend,

924
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.630
For love is still mostprecious in itself;

925
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:11.970
And Silvia--witness Heaven,that made her fair!--

926
00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:20.600
Shows Julia but a swarthyEthiope.

927
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.230
I will forget that Juliais alive,

928
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.000
Remembering that my loveto her is dead;

929
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.300
And Valentine I'll hold anenemy,

930
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:34.070
Aiming at Silvia as asweeter friend.

931
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.470
I cannot now proveconstant to myself,

932
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:42.670
Without some treacheryused to Valentine.

933
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:48.230
This night he meaneth witha corded ladder

934
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.070
To climb celestialSilvia's chamber-window,

935
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:54.630
Myself in counsel, hiscompetitor.

936
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.500
Now presently I'll giveher father notice

937
00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:59.100
Of their disguising andpretended flight;

938
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.730
Who, all enraged, willbanish Valentine;

939
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:06.030
For Thurio, he intends,shall wed his daughter;

940
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.870
But, Valentine being gone,I'll quickly cross

941
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:17.700
By some sly trick bluntThurio's dull proceeding.

942
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:26.870
Love, lend me wings tomake my purpose swift,

943
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:31.730
As thou hast lent me witto plot this drift!

944
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:39.500
Counsel, Lucetta; gentlegirl, assist me;

945
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.270
And even in kind love I doconjure thee,

946
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:44.930
Who art the table whereinall my thoughts

947
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:47.030
Are visibly character'dand engraved,

948
00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:49.230
To lesson me and tell mesome good mean

949
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.970
How, with my honour, I mayundertake

950
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:54.970
A journey to my lovingProteus.

951
00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:57.700
Alas, the way is wearisomeand long!

952
00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.600
A true-devoted pilgrim isnot weary

953
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.530
To measure kingdoms withhis feeble steps;

954
00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:06.500
Much less shall she thathath Love's wings to fly,

955
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.270
And when the flight ismade to one so dear,

956
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:11.030
Of such divine perfection,as Sir Proteus.

957
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:13.130
Better forbear tillProteus make return.

958
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:16.970
O, know'st thou not hislooks are my soul's food?

959
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:18.400
Pity the dearth that Ihave pined in,

960
00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.100
By longing for that foodso long a time.

961
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:25.230
Didst thou but know theinly touch of love,

962
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:27.970
Thou wouldst as soon gokindle fire with snow

963
00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:29.700
As seek to quench the fireof love with words.

964
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.930
I do not seek to quenchyour love's hot fire,

965
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:35.630
But qualify the fire'sextreme rage,

966
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.070
Lest it should burn abovethe bounds of reason.

967
00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:40.970
The more thou damm'st itup, the more it burns.

968
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:43.200
The current that withgentle murmur glides,

969
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.970
Thou know'st, being stopp'd,impatiently doth rage;

970
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.770
But when his fair courseis not hindered,

971
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:53.530
He makes sweet music withthe enamell'ed stones,

972
00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.470
Giving a gentle kiss toevery sedge

973
00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:57.870
He overtaketh in hispilgrimage,

974
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:00.100
And so by many windingnooks he strays

975
00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.830
With willing sport to thewild ocean.

976
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:07.300
Then let me go and hindernot my course

977
00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.600
I'll be as patient as agentle stream

978
00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:14.370
And make a pastime of eachweary step,

979
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:18.000
Till the last step havebrought me to my love;

980
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.930
And there I'll rest, asafter much turmoil

981
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:24.200
A blessed soul doth inElysium.

982
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.400
But in what habit will yougo along?

983
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.600
Not like a woman; for Iwould prevent

984
00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.470
The loose encounters oflascivious men:

985
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:39.070
Gentle Lucetta, fit mewith such weeds

986
00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:42.630
As may beseem somewell-reputed page.

987
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:45.830
Why, then, your ladyshipmust cut your hair.

988
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:48.570
No, girl, I'll knit it upin silken strings

989
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:51.370
With twenty odd-conceitedtrue-love knots.

990
00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:52.630
To be fantastic may becomea youth

991
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:54.570
Of greater time than Ishall show to be.

992
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.770
What fashion, madam shallI make your breeches?

993
00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:58.470
That fits as well as 'Tellme, good my lord,

994
00:55:58.470 --> 00:56:00.330
What compass will you wearyour farthingale?'

995
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:02.430
Why even what fashion thoubest likest, Lucetta.

996
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:04.230
You must needs have themwith a codpiece, madam.

997
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.400
Out, out, Lucetta! thatwould be ill-favour'd.

998
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.100
A round hose, madam, now'snot worth a pin,

999
00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.100
Unless you have a codpieceto stick pins on.

1000
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.730
Lucetta, as thou lovestme, let me have

1001
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:16.900
What thou thinkest meetand is most mannerly.

1002
00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.130
But tell me, wench, howwill the world repute me

1003
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:22.770
For undertaking so unstaida journey?

1004
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.570
I fear me, it will make mescandalized.

1005
00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.000
If you think so, then stayat home and go not.

1006
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.400
Nay, that I will not.

1007
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.900
Then never dream oninfamy, but go.

1008
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.530
If Proteus like yourjourney when you come,

1009
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.470
No matter who's displeasedwhen you are gone:

1010
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.070
I fear me, he will scarcebe pleased withal.

1011
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:42.600
That is the least,Lucetta, of my fear:

1012
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:46.200
A thousand oaths, an oceanof his tears

1013
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.030
And instances of infiniteof love

1014
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:50.070
Warrant me welcome to myProteus.

1015
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.070
All these are servants todeceitful men.

1016
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:55.900
Base men, that use them toso base effect!

1017
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.470
But truer stars did governProteus' birth

1018
00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:04.400
His words are bonds, hisoaths are oracles,

1019
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.600
His love sincere, histhoughts immaculate,

1020
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.330
His tears pure messengerssent from his heart,

1021
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.630
His heart as far from fraudas heaven from earth.

1022
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:15.530
Pray heaven he prove so,when you come to him!

1023
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.900
Now, as thou lovest me, dohim not that wrong

1024
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.270
To bear a hard opinion ofhis truth:

1025
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:24.700
Only deserve my love byloving him;

1026
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:28.430
And presently go with meto my chamber,

1027
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:29.700
To take a note of what Istand in need of,

1028
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.500
To furnish me upon mylonging journey.

1029
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.370
All that is mine I leaveat thy dispose,

1030
00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:43.670
My goods, my lands, myreputation;

1031
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:45.300
Only, in lieu thereof,dispatch me hence.

1032
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.200
Come, answer not, but toit presently!

1033
00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.300
I am impatient of mytarriance.

1034
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:08.370


1035
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:30.330
Sir Thurio, give us leave,I pray, awhile;

1036
00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:37.130
We have some secrets toconfer about.

1037
00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:44.970
Now, tell me, Proteus,what's your will with me?

1038
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:47.500
My gracious lord, thatwhich I would discover

1039
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:52.300
The law of friendship bidsme to conceal;

1040
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.900
But when I call to mindyour gracious favours

1041
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.730
Done to me, undeserving asI am,

1042
00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:00.530
My duty pricks me on toutter that

1043
00:59:00.530 --> 00:59:03.500
Which else no worldly goodshould draw from me.

1044
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:09.000
Know, worthy prince, SirValentine, my friend,

1045
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.800
This night intends tosteal away your daughter:

1046
00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.330
Myself am one made privyto the plot.

1047
00:59:16.330 --> 00:59:18.000
I know you have determinedto bestow her

1048
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.700
On Thurio, whom yourgentle daughter hates;

1049
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:23.900
And should she thus bestol'n away from you,

1050
00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:26.130
It would be much vexationto your age.

1051
00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:27.630
Thus, for my duty's sake,I rather chose

1052
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.570
To cross my friend in hisintended drift

1053
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:32.430
Than, by concealing it,heap on your head

1054
00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.400
A pack of sorrows whichwould press you down,

1055
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:39.400
Being unprevented, to yourtimeless grave.

1056
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:51.570
Proteus, I thank thee forthine honest care;

1057
00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:58.600
Which to requite, commandme while I live.

1058
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.200
This love of theirs myselfhave often seen,

1059
01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:05.570
Haply when they havejudged me fast asleep,

1060
01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:07.470
And oftentimes havepurposed to forbid

1061
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:11.700
Sir Valentine her companyand my court:

1062
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.600
But fearing lest myjealous aim might err

1063
01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.030
And so unworthily disgracethe man,

1064
01:00:18.030 --> 01:00:21.270
A rashness that I ever yethave shunn'd,

1065
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:24.970
I gave him gentle looks,thereby to find

1066
01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:28.770
That which thyself hastnow disclosed to me.

1067
01:00:28.770 --> 01:00:30.800
And, that thou maystperceive my fear of this,

1068
01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.830
I nightly lodge her in anupper tower,

1069
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.970
The key whereof myselfhave ever kept;

1070
01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:39.000
And thence she cannot beconvey'd away.

1071
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.600
Know, noble lord, theyhave devised a mean

1072
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.400
How he her chamber-windowwill ascend

1073
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.570
And with a corded ladderfetch her down;

1074
01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:47.400
For which the youthfullover now is gone

1075
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.000
And this way comes he withit presently;

1076
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.870
Where, if it please you,you may intercept him.

1077
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:55.830
But, good my Lord, do itso cunningly

1078
01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:59.100
That my discovery be notaimed at;

1079
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.770
For love of you, not hateunto my friend,

1080
01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:05.430
Hath made me publisher ofthis pretence.

1081
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:07.070
Upon mine honour, he shallnever know

1082
01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:10.670
That I had any light fromthee of this.

1083
01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:18.530
Adieu, my Lord; SirValentine is coming.

1084
01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.470
Sir Valentine, whitheraway so fast?

1085
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:47.000
Please it your grace,there is a messenger

1086
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.200
That stays to bear myletters to my friends,

1087
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.070
And I am going to deliverthem.

1088
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:51.430
Be they of much import?

1089
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:52.800
The tenor of them doth butsignify

1090
01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.900
My health and happy beingat your court.

1091
01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:02.300
Nay then, no matter; staywith me awhile;

1092
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:09.230
I am to break with thee ofsome affairs

1093
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:14.500
That touch me near, whereinthou must be secret.

1094
01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.630
'Tis not unknown to theethat I have sought

1095
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:18.900
To match my friend SirThurio to my daughter.

1096
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.330
I know it well, my Lord;and, sure, the match

1097
01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:23.070
Were rich and honourable;besides, the gentleman

1098
01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:27.800
Is full of virtue, bounty,worth and qualities

1099
01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:32.400
Beseeming such a wife asyour fair daughter:

1100
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.030
Cannot your Grace win herto fancy him?

1101
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:39.830
No, trust me; she ispeevish, sullen, froward,

1102
01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:45.470
Proud, disobedient,stubborn, lacking duty,

1103
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:47.100
Neither regarding that sheis my child

1104
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.700
Nor fearing me as if Iwere her father;

1105
01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:52.070
And, may I say to thee,this pride of hers,

1106
01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:56.130
Upon advice, hath drawn mylove from her;

1107
01:02:56.130 --> 01:02:58.300
And, where I thought theremnant of mine age

1108
01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:01.670
Should have been cherish'dby her child-like duty,

1109
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:05.570
I now am full resolved totake a wife

1110
01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:07.930
And turn her out to whowill take her in:

1111
01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.370
Then let her beauty be herwedding-dower;

1112
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.830
For me and my possessionsshe esteems not.

1113
01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:16.530
What would your Grace haveme to do in this?

1114
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:20.070
There is a lady in cityhere

1115
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:25.300
Whom I affect; but she isnice and coy

1116
01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.570
And nought esteems my agedeloquence:

1117
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:30.670
For long agone I haveforgot to court;

1118
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:34.030
Besides, the fashion ofthe time is changed--

1119
01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:38.170
Now therefore, when I have theeto my tutor

1120
01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:39.700
How and which way I maybestow myself

1121
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:43.330
To be regarded in hersun-bright eye.

1122
01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:46.470
Win her with gifts, if sherespect not words:

1123
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.500
Dumb jewels often in theirsilent kind

1124
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.070
More than quick words domove a woman's mind.

1125
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.270
But she did scorn apresent that I sent her.

1126
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:56.930
A woman sometimes scornswhat best contents her.

1127
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:58.770
Send her another; nevergive her o'er;

1128
01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:02.330
For scorn at first makesafter-love the more.

1129
01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:04.870
If she do frown, 'tis notin hate of you,

1130
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:07.370
But rather to beget morelove in you:

1131
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:09.600
If she do chide, 'tis notto have you gone;

1132
01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:13.000
For why, the fools aremad, if left alone.

1133
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.330
Take no repulse, whatevershe doth say;

1134
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.870
For 'get you gone,' shedoth not mean 'away!'

1135
01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:23.900
Flatter and praise, commend,extol their graces;

1136
01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:28.300
Though ne'er so black, saythey have angels' faces.

1137
01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.800
That man that hath atongue, I say, is no man,

1138
01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.070
If with his tongue hecannot win a woman.

1139
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:35.770
But she I mean is promisedby her friends

1140
01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:37.600
Unto a youthful gentlemanof worth,

1141
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.470
And kept severely fromresort of men,

1142
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:41.600
That no man hath access byday to her.

1143
01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:42.970
Why, then, I would resortto her by night.

1144
01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.070
Ay, but the doors belock'd and keys kept safe,

1145
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:46.870
That no man hath recourseto her by night.

1146
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:49.530
What lets but one mayenter at her window?

1147
01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.700
Her chamber is aloft, farfrom the ground,

1148
01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.870
And built so shelving thatone cannot climb it

1149
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:54.330
Without apparent hazard ofhis life.

1150
01:04:54.330 --> 01:05:00.130
Why then, a ladderquaintly made of cords,

1151
01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:03.970
To cast up, with a pair ofanchoring hooks,

1152
01:05:03.970 --> 01:05:06.830
Would serve to scaleanother Hero's tower,

1153
01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:10.470
So bold Leander wouldadventure it.

1154
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:12.970
Now, as thou art agentleman of blood,

1155
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:16.030
Advise me where I may havesuch a ladder.

1156
01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:18.230
When would you use it?pray, sir, tell me that.

1157
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.000
This very night; for Loveis like a child,

1158
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.700
That longs for every thingthat he can come by.

1159
01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.930
By seven o'clock I'll getyou such a ladder.

1160
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:29.370
But, hark thee; I will goto her alone:

1161
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:32.000
How shall I best conveythe ladder thither?

1162
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.700
It will be light, my lord,that you may bear it

1163
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.000
Under a cloak that is ofany length.

1164
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.470
A cloak as long as thinewill serve the turn?

1165
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.600
Ay, my good lord.

1166
01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.830
Then let me see thy cloak:

1167
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:49.330
I'll get me one of suchanother length.

1168
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:51.770
Why, any cloak will servethe turn, my lord.

1169
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:56.170
How shall I fashion me towear a cloak?

1170
01:05:56.170 --> 01:06:00.500
Let me feelthy cloak upon me.

1171
01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:17.030
What letter is this same?What's here? 'To Silvia'!

1172
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:38.600
And here an engine fit formy proceeding.

1173
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:44.200
I'll be so bold to breakthe seal for once.

1174
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.830
'My thoughts do harbourwith my Silvia nightly,

1175
01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:49.900
And slaves they are to methat send them flying:

1176
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.900
O, could their master comeand go as lightly,

1177
01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:55.630
Himself would lodge wheresenseless they are lying!

1178
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:59.170
My herald thoughts in thypure bosom rest them:

1179
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:02.530
While I, their king, thathither them importune,

1180
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:06.700
Do curse the grace that withsuch grace hath bless'd them,

1181
01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:11.170
Because myself do want myservants' fortune:

1182
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:15.430
I curse myself, for theyare sent by me,

1183
01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:20.370
That they should harbourwhere their lord would be.'

1184
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.270
What's here?

1185
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:31.130
'Silvia, this night I willenfranchise thee.'

1186
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:37.600
'Tis so; and here's theladder for the purpose.

1187
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:42.200
Why, Phaeton,--for thouart Merops' son,--

1188
01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.770
Wilt thou aspire to guidethe heavenly car

1189
01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:47.330
And with thy daring follyburn the world?

1190
01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:50.770
Wilt thou reach stars,because they shine on thee?

1191
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:55.100
Go, base intruder!overweening slave!

1192
01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.400
Bestow thy fawning smileson equal mates,

1193
01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.500
And think my patience,more than thy desert,

1194
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.930
Is privilege for thydeparture hence:

1195
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:05.800
Thank me for this morethan for all the favours

1196
01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.170
Which all too much I havebestow'd on thee.

1197
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:11.870
But if thou linger in myterritories

1198
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:13.300
Longer than swiftestexpedition

1199
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.100
Will give thee time toleave our royal court,

1200
01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.670
By heaven! my wrath shallfar exceed the love

1201
01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:22.800
I ever bore my daughter orthyself.

1202
01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.130
Be gone! I will not hearthy vain excuse;

1203
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:35.430
But, as thou lovest thylife, make speed from hence.

1204
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:53.770
And why not death ratherthan living torment?

1205
01:08:53.770 --> 01:08:58.300
To die is to be banish'dfrom myself;

1206
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.900
And Silvia is myself:banish'd from her

1207
01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:09.170
Is self from self: adeadly banishment!

1208
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:21.800
What light is light, ifSilvia be not seen?

1209
01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:27.830
What joy is joy, if Silviabe not by?

1210
01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.500
Unless it be to think thatshe is by

1211
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.700
And feed upon the shadowof perfection

1212
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.100
Except I be by Silvia inthe night,

1213
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.330
There is no music in thenightingale;

1214
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.770
Unless I look on Silvia inthe day,

1215
01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:48.800
There is no day for me tolook upon;

1216
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:53.870
She is my essence, and Ileave to be,

1217
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:57.100
If I be not by her fairinfluence

1218
01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:07.930
Foster'd, illumined,cherish'd, kept alive.

1219
01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:12.300
I fly not death, to flyhis deadly doom:

1220
01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.800
Tarry I here, I but attendon death:

1221
01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:18.700
But, fly I hence, I flyaway from life.

1222
01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.870
Run, boy, run, run, andseek him out.

1223
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:22.100
Soho, soho!

1224
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.200
What does't thou see?

1225
01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.270
Him that we seek: there'snot a hair on's head

1226
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.900
but 'tis a Valentine.

1227
01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:29.100
Valentine?

1228
01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.030
No.

1229
01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:30.830
Who then? his spirit?

1230
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.470
Neither.

1231
01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:32.130
What then?

1232
01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:33.070
Nothing.

1233
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.930
Can nothing speak? Master,shall I strike?

1234
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:34.770
Who wouldst thou strike?

1235
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:35.500
Nothing.

1236
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.530
Villain, forbear.

1237
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:37.600
Why, sir, I'll strikenothing: I pray you,--

1238
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.930
Sirrah, I say, forbear.Friend Valentine, a word.

1239
01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:41.770
My ears are stopt andcannot hear good news,

1240
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.930
So much of bad alreadyhath possess'd them.

1241
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:45.570
Then in dumb silence willI bury mine,

1242
01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.930
For they are harsh,untuneable and bad.

1243
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:48.600
Is Silvia dead?

1244
01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.530
No, Valentine.

1245
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:51.530
No Valentine, indeed, forsacred Silvia.

1246
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:52.300
Hath she forsworn me?

1247
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.370
No, Valentine.

1248
01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:55.600
No Valentine, if Silviahave forsworn me.

1249
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.700
What is your news?

1250
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.800
Sir, there is a proclamationthat you are vanished.

1251
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.370
That thou art banished--O,that's the news!--

1252
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:06.900
From hence, from Silviaand from me thy friend.

1253
01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.130
O, I have fed upon thiswoe already,

1254
01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:11.700
And now excess of it willmake me surfeit.

1255
01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.700
Doth Silvia know that I ambanished?

1256
01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:15.430
Ay, ay; and she hathoffer'd to the doom--

1257
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:17.570
Which, unreversed, standsin effectual force--

1258
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:21.930
A sea of melting pearl,which some call tears:

1259
01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:24.100
Those at her father'schurlish feet she tender'd;

1260
01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.630
With them, upon her knees,her humble self;

1261
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.330
Wringing her hands, whosewhiteness so became them

1262
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:33.000
As if but now they waxedpale for woe:

1263
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.000
But neither bended knees,pure hands held up,

1264
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.570
Sad sighs, deep groans,nor silver-shedding tears,

1265
01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:43.270
Could penetrate heruncompassionate sire;

1266
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:45.800
But Valentine, if he beta'en, must die.

1267
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.300
Besides, her intercessionchafed him so,

1268
01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:49.300
When she for thy repealwas suppliant,

1269
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.930
That to close prison hecommanded her,

1270
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:52.370
With many bitter threatsof biding there.

1271
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:54.770
No more; unless the nextword that thou speak'st

1272
01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:56.400
Have some malignant powerupon my life:

1273
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.100
If so, I pray thee,breathe it in mine ear,

1274
01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:00.730
As ending anthem of myendless dolour.

1275
01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:02.900
Cease to lament for thatthou canst not help,

1276
01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.700
And study help for thatwhich thou lament'st.

1277
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.030
Time is the nurse andbreeder of all good.

1278
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:10.400
Here if thou stay, thoucanst not see thy love;

1279
01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.270
Besides, thy staying willabridge thy life.

1280
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:15.900
Hope is a lover's staff;walk hence with that

1281
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.530
And manage it againstdespairing thoughts.

1282
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:21.670
Thy letters may be here,though thou art hence;

1283
01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:23.570
Which, being writ to me,shall be deliver'd

1284
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:26.930
Even in the milk-whitebosom of thy love.

1285
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.030
The time now serves not toexpostulate:

1286
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:32.070
Come, I'll convey theethrough the city-gate;

1287
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:33.070
And, ere I part with thee,confer at large

1288
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:37.100
Of all that may concernthy love-affairs.

1289
01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.770
As thou lovest Silvia,though not for thyself,

1290
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:40.700
Regard thy danger, andalong with me!

1291
01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:43.600
I pray thee, Launce, an ifthou seest my boy,

1292
01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.170
Bid him make haste andmeet me at the North-gate.

1293
01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.500
Go, sirrah, find him out.Come, Valentine.

1294
01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:55.870
O my dear Silvia! HaplessValentine!

1295
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:02.330
I am but a fool;

1296
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:09.200
and yet I have the wit to thinkmy master is a kind of a knave:

1297
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:15.600
but that's all one, ifhe be but one knave.

1298
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.270
He lives not now thatknows me to be in love;

1299
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.530
yet I am in love;

1300
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:25.230
but a team of horse shallnot pluck that from me;

1301
01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:33.930
nor who 'tis I love; and yet'tis a woman; but what woman,

1302
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:41.830
I will not tell myself;and yet 'tis a milkmaid;

1303
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:44.930
yet 'tis not a maid, forshe hath had gossips;

1304
01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:47.100
yet 'tis a maid, for sheis her master's maid,

1305
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.200
and serves for wages.

1306
01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.630
She hath more qualitiesthan a water-spaniel;

1307
01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:58.100
which is much in abare Christian.

1308
01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.600
Here is the cate-log ofher condition.

1309
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.430
'Imprimis: She canfetch and carry.'

1310
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.370
Why, a horse can do no more:nay, a horse cannot fetch,

1311
01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.400
but only carry; thereforeis she better than a jade.

1312
01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:16.130
'Item: She can milk;' lookyou, a sweet virtue in a maid

1313
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.770
with clean hands.

1314
01:14:20.970 --> 01:14:23.600
How now, Signior Launce! whatnews with your mastership?

1315
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.300
With my master's ship?why, it is at sea.

1316
01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.230
Well, your old vicestill; mistake the word.

1317
01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:29.200
What news, then,in your paper?

1318
01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.230
The blackest news thatever thou heardest.

1319
01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.370
Why, man, how black?

1320
01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:33.700
Why, as black as ink.

1321
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.700
Let me read them.

1322
01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.500
Fie on thee, jolt-head!thou canst not read.

1323
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.230
Thou liest; I can.

1324
01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:40.930
I will try thee. Tell methis: who begot thee?

1325
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:42.230
Marry, the son of mygrandfather.

1326
01:14:42.230 --> 01:14:46.400
O illiterate loiterer! it wasthe son of thy grandmother:

1327
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.170
this proves that thoucanst not read.

1328
01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:51.030
Come, fool, come; try mein thy paper.

1329
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:53.900
There; and St. Nicholas bethy speed!

1330
01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.170
'Imprimis: She can milk.'

1331
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:57.130
Ay, that she can.

1332
01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:58.900
'Item: She brews goodale.'

1333
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.430
And thereof comes the proverb:

1334
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:02.700
'Blessing of your heart,you brew good ale.'

1335
01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.070
Item: She can sew.'

1336
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:06.070
That's as much as to say,Can she so?

1337
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:07.770
'Item: She can knit.'

1338
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.630
What need a man care fora stock with a wench,

1339
01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.270
when she can knithim a stock?

1340
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:13.070
'Item: She can wash andscour.'

1341
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.070
A special virtue:

1342
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:16.470
for then she need notbe washed and scoured.

1343
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:17.930
'Item: She can spin.'

1344
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.970
Then may I set theworld on wheels,

1345
01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:22.430
when she can spinfor her living.

1346
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:24.970
'Item: She hath manynameless virtues.'

1347
01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:26.200
That's as much as tosay, bastard virtues;

1348
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.430
that, indeed, knownot their fathers

1349
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:29.170
and therefore haveno names.

1350
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:31.130
'Here follow her vices.'

1351
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:32.970
Close at the heels of hervirtues.

1352
01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:35.500
'Item: She is not tobe kissed fasting

1353
01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.700
in respect ofher breath.'

1354
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.370
Well, that fault may be mendedwith a breakfast. Read on.

1355
01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:41.330
'Item: She hath a sweetmouth.'

1356
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.270
That makes amends for hersour breath.

1357
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:45.970
'Item: She doth talk inher sleep.'

1358
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:49.730
It's no matter for that, soshe sleep not in her talk.

1359
01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:51.670
'Item: She is slow in words.'

1360
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:55.470
O villain, that set thisdown among her vices!

1361
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:58.170
To be slow in words isa woman's only virtue:

1362
01:15:58.170 --> 01:16:00.630
I pray thee, out with't, andplace it for her chief virtue.

1363
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:02.470
'Item: She is proud.'

1364
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:05.130
Out with that too; itwas Eve's legacy,

1365
01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:06.300
and cannot beta'en from her.

1366
01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:09.070
'Item: She hath no teeth.'

1367
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:13.270
I care not for that neither,because I love crusts.

1368
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:15.470
'Item: She is curst.'

1369
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.330
Well, the best is, shehath no teeth to bite.

1370
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:20.870
'Item: She will oftenpraise her liquor.'

1371
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:23.600
If her liquor be good, sheshall: if she will not, I will;

1372
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.170
for good thingsshould be praised.

1373
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:27.200
'Item: She is tooliberal.'

1374
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.430
Of her tongue she cannot be,

1375
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:32.730
for that's writ downshe is slow of;

1376
01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:36.530
of her purse she shall not,for that I'll keep shut:

1377
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:41.370
now, of another thing shemay, and that cannot I help.

1378
01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:42.500
Well, proceed.

1379
01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.870
'Item: She hath morehair than wit,

1380
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:47.970
and more faults than hairs,and more wealth than faults.'

1381
01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.830
Stop there; I'll have her:she was mine, and not mine,

1382
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:51.400
twice or thrice inthat last article.

1383
01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:53.430
Rehearse that once more.

1384
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:55.200
'Item: She hath more hairthan wit,'--

1385
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.000
More hair than wit? Itmay be; I'll prove it.

1386
01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.200
The cover of the salt hidesthe salt, and therefore

1387
01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.700
it is more than the salt; thehair that covers the wit

1388
01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.730
is more than the wit, forthe greater hides the less.

1389
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:06.600
What's next?

1390
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.530
'And more faults thanhairs,'--

1391
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:10.530
That's monstrous: O, thatthat were out!

1392
01:17:10.530 --> 01:17:12.570
'And more wealth thanfaults.'

1393
01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:15.870
Why, that word makesthe faults gracious.

1394
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:17.530
Well, I'll have her;and if it be a match,

1395
01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:20.700
as nothing is impossible,--

1396
01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.800
What then?

1397
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:27.370
Why, then will I tellthee--that thy master stays

1398
01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:33.430
for thee at theNorth-gate.

1399
01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:34.600
For me?

1400
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.670
For thee! ay, who art thou?

1401
01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:36.700
he hath stayed for abetter man than thee.

1402
01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.770
And must I go to him?

1403
01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:38.970
Thou must run to him, forthou hast stayed so long

1404
01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.330
that going will scarceserve the turn.

1405
01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:43.600
Why didst not tell me sooner?pox of your love letters!

1406
01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.030
Now will he be swingedfor reading my letter;

1407
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:49.600
an unmannerly slave, that willthrust himself into secrets!

1408
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.870
I'll after, to rejoice inthe boy's correction.

1409
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:07.030
Sir Thurio, fear not butthat she will love you,

1410
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:09.500
Now Valentine is banish'dfrom her sight.

1411
01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.130
Since his exile she hathdespised me most,

1412
01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:14.500
Forsworn my company andrail'd at me,

1413
01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.000
That I am desperate ofobtaining her.

1414
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.330
This weak impress of loveis as a figure

1415
01:18:19.330 --> 01:18:21.730
Trenched in ice, whichwith an hour's heat

1416
01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:25.470
Dissolves to water anddoth lose his form.

1417
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:27.400
A little time will melther frozen thoughts

1418
01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:29.830
And worthless Valentineshall be forgot.

1419
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.570
How now, Sir Proteus! Isyour countryman

1420
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.330
According to ourproclamation gone?

1421
01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:36.600
Gone, my good lord.

1422
01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.770
My daughter takes hisgoing grievously.

1423
01:18:38.770 --> 01:18:40.630
A little time, my lord,will kill that grief.

1424
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:43.930
So I believe; but Thuriothinks not so.

1425
01:18:43.930 --> 01:18:49.130
Proteus, the good conceitI hold of thee--

1426
01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:50.700
For thou hast shown somesign of good desert--

1427
01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:53.000
Makes me the better toconfer with thee.

1428
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.430
Longer than I prove loyalto your grace

1429
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:57.470
Let me not live to lookupon your grace.

1430
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:59.500
Thou know'st how willinglyI would effect

1431
01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.470
The match between SirThurio and my daughter.

1432
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:02.500
I do, my lord.

1433
01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.730
And also, I think, thouart not ignorant

1434
01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:06.770
How she opposes heragainst my will

1435
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:08.870
She did, my lord, whenValentine was here.

1436
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:13.300
Ay, and perversely shepersevers so.

1437
01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:16.530
What might we do to makethe girl forget

1438
01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:20.170
The love of Valentine andlove Sir Thurio?

1439
01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:23.430
The best way is to slanderValentine

1440
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:26.130
With falsehood, cowardiceand poor descent,

1441
01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:28.600
Three things that womenhighly hold in hate.

1442
01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:30.570
Ay, but she'll think thatit is spoke in hate.

1443
01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:31.870
Ay, if his enemy deliverit:

1444
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:34.170
Therefore it must withcircumstance be spoken

1445
01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:38.300
By one whom she esteemethas his friend.

1446
01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:46.200
Then you must undertake toslander him.

1447
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.670
And that, my lord, I shallbe loath to do:

1448
01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:52.770
'Tis an ill office for agentleman,

1449
01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:54.970
Especially against hisvery friend.

1450
01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:57.300
Where your good wordcannot advantage him,

1451
01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.070
Your slander never canendamage him;

1452
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:00.470
Therefore the office isindifferent,

1453
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:07.500
Being entreated to it byyour friend.

1454
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.830
You have prevail'd, mylord; if I can do it

1455
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:13.300
By ought that I can speakin his dispraise,

1456
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:18.630
She shall not longcontinue love to him.

1457
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:20.830
But say this weed her lovefrom Valentine,

1458
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:24.830
It follows not that shewill love Sir Thurio.

1459
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:28.030
Therefore, as you unwindher love from him,

1460
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:30.400
Lest it should ravel andbe good to none,

1461
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.270
You must provide to bottomit on me;

1462
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:35.030
Which must be done bypraising me as much

1463
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.330
As you in worth dispraiseSir Valentine.

1464
01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:39.330
And, Proteus, we daretrust you in this kind,

1465
01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:42.330
Because we know, onValentine's report,

1466
01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:44.330
You are already Love'sfirm votary

1467
01:20:44.330 --> 01:20:46.600
And cannot soon revolt andchange your mind.

1468
01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:48.930
Upon this warrant shallyou have access

1469
01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:52.100
Where you with Silvia mayconfer at large;

1470
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:55.030
For she is lumpish, heavy,melancholy,

1471
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:58.630
And, for your friend'ssake, will be glad of you;

1472
01:20:58.630 --> 01:21:00.270
Where you may temper herby your persuasion

1473
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:05.530
To hate young Valentineand love my friend.

1474
01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:08.670
As much as I can do, Iwill effect:

1475
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:13.730
But you, Sir Thurio, arenot sharp enough;

1476
01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:15.930
You must lay lime totangle her desires

1477
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:18.400
By wailful sonnets, whosecomposed rhymes

1478
01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:20.930
Should be full-fraughtwith serviceable vows.

1479
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:21.830
Ay,

1480
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:24.030
Much is the force ofheaven-bred poesy.

1481
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:27.370
Say that upon the altar ofher beauty

1482
01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:31.100
You sacrifice your tears,your sighs, your heart:

1483
01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.370
Write till your ink bedry, and with your tears

1484
01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:36.230
Moist it again, and framesome feeling line

1485
01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:38.170
That may discover suchintegrity:

1486
01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:41.870
For Orpheus' lute wasstrung with poets' sinews,

1487
01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:44.300
Whose golden touch couldsoften steel and stones,

1488
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.100
Make tigers tame and hugeleviathans

1489
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.370
Forsake unsounded deeps todance on sands.

1490
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:55.200
After your dire-lamentingelegies,

1491
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.700
Visit by night your lady'schamber-window

1492
01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.370
With some sweet concert;to their instruments

1493
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:02.200
Tune a deploring dump: thenight's dead silence

1494
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:06.370
Will well become suchsweet-complaining grievance.

1495
01:22:06.370 --> 01:22:09.730
This, or else nothing,will inherit her.

1496
01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:13.630
This discipline shows thouhast been in love.

1497
01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:15.930
And thy advice this nightI'll put in practise.

1498
01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:19.930
Therefore, sweet Proteus,my direction-giver,

1499
01:22:19.930 --> 01:22:21.200
Let us into the citypresently

1500
01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.000
To sort some gentlemenwell skill'd in music.

1501
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.430
I have a sonnet that willserve the turn

1502
01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:29.530
To give the onset to thygood advice.

1503
01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:30.600
About it, gentlemen!

1504
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:32.330
We'll wait upon your gracetill after supper,

1505
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:33.900
And afterward determineour proceedings.

1506
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:42.570
Even now about it! I willpardon you.

1507
01:23:39.730 --> 01:23:44.300
Fellows, stand fast; I seea passenger.

1508
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:50.900
If there be ten, shrinknot, but down with 'em.

1509
01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:18.870
Stand, sir, and throw usthat you have about ye:

1510
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:24.370
If not: we'll make you sitand rifle you.

1511
01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:30.700
Sir, we are undone; theseare the villains

1512
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:32.570
That all the travellers dofear so much.

1513
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:33.570
My friends,--

1514
01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:35.800
That's not so, sir: we areyour enemies.

1515
01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:39.000
Peace! we'll hear him.

1516
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.700
Ay, by my beard, will we,for he's a proper man.

1517
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:44.430
Then know that I havelittle wealth to lose:

1518
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:47.070
A man I am cross'd withadversity;

1519
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:49.230
My riches are these poorhabiliments,

1520
01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:50.670
Of which if you shouldhere disfurnish me,

1521
01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:52.730
You take the sum andsubstance that I have.

1522
01:24:52.730 --> 01:24:53.730
Whither travel you?

1523
01:24:53.730 --> 01:24:54.500
To Verona.

1524
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.530
Whence came you?

1525
01:24:55.530 --> 01:24:56.270
From Milan.

1526
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:57.400
Have you long sojournedthere?

1527
01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:58.770
Some sixteen months, andlonger might have stay'd,

1528
01:24:58.770 --> 01:25:01.230
If crooked fortune had notthwarted me.

1529
01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:02.870
What, were you banish'dthence?

1530
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:03.400
I was.

1531
01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.330
For what offence?

1532
01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:06.900
For that which nowtorments me to rehearse:

1533
01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:09.830
I kill'd a man, whosedeath I much repent;

1534
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:12.330
Bu t yet I slew himmanfully in fight,

1535
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:15.300
Without false vantage orbase treachery.

1536
01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.270
Why, ne'er repent it, ifit were done so.

1537
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:21.270
But were you banish'd forso small a fault?

1538
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:24.070
I was, and held me glad ofsuch a doom.

1539
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:25.830
Have you the tongues?

1540
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:27.230
My youthful travel thereinmade me happy,

1541
01:25:27.230 --> 01:25:28.970
Or else I often had beenmiserable.

1542
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:31.800
By the bare scalp of RobinHood's fat friar,

1543
01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:35.930
This fellow were a kingfor our wild faction!

1544
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:38.000
We'll have him. Sirs, aword.

1545
01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.500
Master, be one of them; it's anhonourable kind of thievery.

1546
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.770
Peace, villain!

1547
01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:46.330
Tell us this: have you anything to take to?

1548
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:47.270
Nothing but my fortune.

1549
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:50.030
Know, then, that some ofus are gentlemen,

1550
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:52.530
Such as the fury ofungovern'd youth

1551
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:54.430
Thrust from the company ofawful men:

1552
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:56.370
Myself was from Veronabanished

1553
01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:58.500
For practising to stealaway a lady,

1554
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.700
An heir, and near alliedunto the duke.

1555
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.470
And I from Mantua, for agentleman,

1556
01:26:02.470 --> 01:26:04.970
Who, in my mood, I stabb'dunto the heart.

1557
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:09.530
And I for such like pettycrimes as these,

1558
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:11.770
But to the purpose--for wecite our faults,

1559
01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:14.470
That they may hold excus'dour lawless lives;

1560
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:16.530
And partly, seeing you arebeautified

1561
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:18.600
With goodly shape and byyour own report

1562
01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.970
A linguist and a man ofsuch perfection

1563
01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:24.000
As we do in our qualitymuch want--

1564
01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.530
Indeed, because you are abanish'd man,

1565
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.630
Therefore, above the rest,we parley to you:

1566
01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:30.730
Are you content to be ourgeneral?

1567
01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:32.470
To make a virtue ofnecessity

1568
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:34.270
And live, as we do, inthis wilderness?

1569
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:36.100
What say'st thou? wiltthou be of our consort?

1570
01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:38.600
Say ay, and be the captainof us all:

1571
01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.870
We'll do thee homage andbe ruled by thee,

1572
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:43.770
Love thee as our commanderand our king.

1573
01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:46.530
But if thou scorn ourcourtesy, thou diest.

1574
01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:50.970
Thou shalt not live tobrag what we have offer'd.

1575
01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:55.970
I take your offer and willlive with you,

1576
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.270
Provided that you do nooutrages

1577
01:26:58.270 --> 01:27:01.030
On silly women or poorpassengers.

1578
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:05.170
No, we detest such vilebase practises.

1579
01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:07.630
Come, go with us, we'llbring thee to our crews,

1580
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:09.670
And show thee all thetreasure we have got,

1581
01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:14.270
Which, with ourselves, allrest at thy dispose.

1582
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:41.230
Already have I been falseto Valentine

1583
01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:44.930
And now I must be asunjust to Thurio.

1584
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:46.600
Under the colour ofcommending him,

1585
01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:50.600
I have access my own loveto prefer:

1586
01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:57.230
But Silvia is too fair,too true, too holy,

1587
01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:00.700
To be corrupted with myworthless gifts.

1588
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:08.130
When I protest trueloyalty to her,

1589
01:28:08.130 --> 01:28:13.130
She twits me with myfalsehood to my friend;

1590
01:28:13.130 --> 01:28:15.270
When to her beauty Icommend my vows,

1591
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:17.300
She bids me think how Ihave been forsworn

1592
01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:20.830
In breaking faith withJulia whom I loved:

1593
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:23.730
And notwithstanding allher sudden quips,

1594
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:26.830
The least whereof wouldquell a lover's hope,

1595
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:30.870
Yet, spaniel-like, themore she spurns my love,

1596
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:35.370
The more it grows andfawneth on her still.

1597
01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:37.470
But here comes Thurio: nowmust we to her window,

1598
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:40.930
And give some eveningmusic to her ear.

1599
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.070
How now, Sir Proteus, areyou crept before us?

1600
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:46.770
Ay, gentle Thurio: for youknow that love

1601
01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:49.070
Will creep in servicewhere it cannot go.

1602
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:50.800
Ay, but I hope, sir, thatyou love not here.

1603
01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.700
Sir, but I do; or else Iwould be hence.

To that I'll speak, tothat I'll sigh and weep:

1708
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:48.170
For since the substance ofyour perfect self

1709
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:50.470
Is else devoted, I am buta shadow;

1710
01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:54.430
And to your shadow will Imake true love.

1711
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.570

1712
01:35:57.570 --> 01:36:03.800

1713

1714

1715

01:37:03.230 --> 01:37:08.530
That e'er I watch'd andthe most heaviest.

1726
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:34.300
This is the hour thatMadam Silvia

1727
01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:38.100
Entreated me to call andknow her mind:

1728
01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:42.430
There's some great mattershe'ld employ me in.

1729
01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.300
Madam, madam!

1730
01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:14.730
Who calls?

1731
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:17.270
Your servant and yourfriend;

1732
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:19.870
One that attends yourladyship's command.

1733
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:22.930
Sir Eglamour, a thousandtimes good morrow.

1734
01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:26.470
As many, worthy lady, toyourself:

1735
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:29.530
According to yourladyship's impose,

1736
01:38:29.530 --> 01:38:32.670
I am thus early come toknow what service

1737
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:34.970
It is your pleasure tocommand me in.

1738
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:38.000
O Eglamour, thou art agentleman--

1739
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.770
Think not I flatter, for Iswear I do not--

1740
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:45.100
Valiant, wise, remorseful,well accomplish'd:

1741
01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:47.370
Thou art not ignorant whatdear good will

1742
01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:50.330
I bear unto the banish'dValentine,

1743
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:51.830
Nor how my father wouldenforce me marry

1744
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:55.670
Vain Thurio, whom my verysoul abhors.

1745
01:38:55.670 --> 01:38:58.130
Thyself hast loved; and Ihave heard thee say

1746
01:38:58.130 --> 01:39:00.700
No grief did ever come sonear thy heart

1747
01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.970
As when thy lady and thytrue love died,

1748
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:06.700
Upon whose grave thouvow'dst pure chastity.

1749
01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:09.530
Sir Eglamour, I would toValentine,

1750
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:12.400
To Mantua, where I hear hemakes abode;

1751
01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.930
And, for the ways aredangerous to pass,

1752
01:39:13.930 --> 01:39:16.430
I do desire thy worthycompany,

1753
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:18.500
Upon whose faith andhonour I repose.

1754
01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.430
Urge not my father'sanger, Eglamour,

1755
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:24.330
But think upon my grief, alady's grief,

1756
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.070
And on the justice of myflying hence,

1757
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:28.270
To keep me from a mostunholy match,

1758
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:31.830
Which heaven and fortunestill rewards with plagues.

1759
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:34.830
I do desire thee, evenfrom a heart

1760
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.270
As full of sorrows as thesea of sands,

1761
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:39.730
To bear me company and gowith me:

1762
01:39:39.730 --> 01:39:42.000
If not, to hide what Ihave said to thee,

1763
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.770
That I may venture todepart alone.

1764
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:49.800
Madam, I pity much yourgrievances;

1765
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:53.700
Which since I know theyvirtuously are placed,

1766
01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:56.400
I give consent to go alongwith you,

1767
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.370
Recking as little whatbetideth me

1768
01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:04.230
As much I wish all goodbefortune you.

1769
01:40:04.230 --> 01:40:05.430
When will you go?

1770
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:08.400
This evening coming.

1771
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.300
Where shall I meet you?

1772
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:10.870
At Friar Patrick's cell,

1773
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:12.900
Where I intend holyconfession.

1774
01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:21.070
I will not fail your ladyship.Good morrow, gentle lady.

1775
01:40:21.070 --> 01:40:28.430
Good morrow, kind SirEglamour.

1776
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:50.300
When a man's servant shallplay the cur with him,

1777
01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:53.430
look you, it goes hard: onethat I brought up of a puppy;

1778
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:54.630
one that I saved from drowning,

1779
01:40:54.630 --> 01:40:55.700
when three or four

1780
01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.800
of his blind brothersand sisters went to it.

1781
01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.470
I have taught him, even asone would say precisely,

1782
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:03.470
'thus I would teach a dog.'I was sent to deliver

1783
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:05.600
him as a present to MistressSilvia from my master;

1784
01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.930
and I came no soonerinto the dining-chamber

1785
01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:12.700
but he steps me to her trencherand steals her capon's leg:

1786
01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.600
O, 'tis a foul thing whena cur cannot keep himself

1787
01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:19.070
in all companies! I wouldhave, as one should say,

1788
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:22.130
one that takes upon him tobe a dog indeed, to be,

1789
01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:26.570
as it were, a dogat all things.

1790
01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:27.770
If I had not hadmore wit than he,

1791
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:29.230
to take a fault uponme that he did,

1792
01:41:29.230 --> 01:41:31.800
I think verily he hadbeen hanged for't;

1793
01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.100
sure as I live, he had sufferedfor't; you shall judge.

1794
01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:38.700
He thrusts me himself intothe company of three or four

1795
01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:43.570
gentlemanlike dogs underthe duke's table:

1796
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:45.370
he had not beenthere--bless the mark!--

1797
01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:50.370
a pissing while, but allthe chamber smelt him.

1798
01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.700
'Out with the dog!' says one:

1799
01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:53.130
'What cur is that?'says another:

1800
01:41:53.130 --> 01:41:56.530
'Whip him out' says the third:'Hang him up' says the duke.

1801
01:41:56.530 --> 01:41:58.970
I, having been acquaintedwith the smell before,

1802
01:41:58.970 --> 01:42:03.030
knew it was Crab, and goesme to the fellow that

1803
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:05.700
whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quothI, 'you mean to whip the dog?'

1804
01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.930
'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he.

1805
01:42:07.930 --> 01:42:10.270
'You do him the morewrong,' quoth I;

1806
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:13.200
''twas I did thething you wot of.'

1807
01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.200
He makes me no more ado, butwhips me out of the chamber.

1808
01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:18.400
How many masters would dothis for his servant?

1809
01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.870
Nay, I'll be sworn, I have satin the stocks for puddings

1810
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:25.600
he hath stolen, otherwisehe had been executed;

1811
01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.700
I have stood on the pilloryfor geese he hath killed,

1812
01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:29.570
otherwise he hadsuffered for't.

1813
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:30.970
Thou thinkest not of this now.

1814
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:33.430
Nay, I remember thetrick you served me

1815
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:35.930
when I took my leaveof Madam Silvia:

1816
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:43.870
did not I bid thee stillmark me and do as I do?

1817
01:42:43.870 --> 01:42:45.870
when didst thou seeme heave up my leg

1818
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:48.170
and make water against agentlewoman's farthingale?

1819
01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:52.630
didst thou ever seeme do such a trick?

1820
01:43:11.130 --> 01:43:23.570
Sebastian is thy name? Ilike thee well

1821
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:26.300
And will employ thee insome service presently.

1822
01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:28.200
In what you please: I'lldo what I can.

1823
01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.370
I hope thou wilt.

1824
01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:33.800
How now, you whoresonpeasant!

1825
01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:36.330
Where have you been thesetwo days loitering?

1826
01:43:36.330 --> 01:43:39.200
Marry, sir, I carried MistressSilvia the dog you bade me.

1827
01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.270
And what says she to mylittle jewel?

1828
01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:42.130
Marry, she says yourdog was a cur,

1829
01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:44.700
and tells you currish thanks isgood enough for such a present.

1830
01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:45.970
But she received my dog?

1831
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:49.230
No, indeed, did she not: herehave I brought him back again.

1832
01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:52.000
What, didst thou offer herthis from me?

1833
01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.830
Ay, sir: the other squirrelwas stolen from me

1834
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:56.030
by the hangman boysin the market-place:

1835
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:59.500
and then I offeredher mine own,

1836
01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.030
who is a dog as bigas ten of yours,

1837
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:03.070
and therefore thegift the greater.

1838
01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.430
Go get thee hence, andfind my dog again,

1839
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.900
Or ne'er return again intomy sight.

1840
01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:12.030
Away, I say! stay'st thouto vex me here?

1841
01:44:15.970 --> 01:44:23.670
A slave, that still an endturns me to shame!

1842
01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:28.600
Sebastian, I haveentertained thee,

1843
01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:30.130
Partly that I have need ofsuch a youth

1844
01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:32.670
That can with somediscretion do my business,

1845
01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:37.170
For 'tis no trusting toyond foolish lout,

1846
01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:51.800
But chiefly for thy faceand thy behavior,

1847
01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.230
Which, if my augurydeceive me not,

1848
01:44:54.230 --> 01:45:01.370
Witness good bringing up,fortune and truth:

1849
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:06.470
Therefore know thou, forthis I entertain thee.

1850
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:10.800
Go presently and take thisring with thee,

1851
01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:13.930
Deliver it to MadamSilvia:

1852
01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:18.170
She loved me welldeliver'd it to me.

1853
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:23.130
It seems you loved nother, to leave her token.

1854
01:45:23.130 --> 01:45:24.530
She is dead, belike?

1855
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:25.570
Not so; I think she lives.

1856
01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:26.830
Alas!

1857
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:29.630
Why dost thou cry 'alas'?

1858
01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:30.230
I cannot choose

1859
01:45:30.230 --> 01:45:31.430
But pity her.

1860
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:34.630
Wherefore shouldst thoupity her?

1861
01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:36.130
Because methinks that sheloved you as well

1862
01:45:36.130 --> 01:45:39.900
As you do love your ladySilvia:

1863
01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:43.200
She dreams of him that hasforgot her love;

1864
01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.330
You dote on her that caresnot for your love.

1865
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:52.130
'Tis pity love should beso contrary;

1866
01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:56.470
And thinking of it makesme cry 'alas!'

1867
01:45:56.470 --> 01:45:59.630
Well, give her that ringand therewithal

1868
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:11.370
This letter. That'sher chamber.

1869
01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:19.270
Tell my lady I claim the promisefor her heavenly picture.

1870
01:46:19.630 --> 01:46:25.130
Your message done, hiehome unto my chamber,

1871
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:31.070
Where thou shalt find me,sad and solitary.

1872
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:45.930
How many women would dosuch a message?

1873
01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:49.730
Alas, poor Proteus! thouhast entertain'd

1874
01:46:49.730 --> 01:46:53.870
A fox to be the shepherdof thy lambs.

1875
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:59.100
Alas, poor fool! why do Ipity him

1876
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:03.500
That with his very heartdespiseth me?

1877
01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:09.370
Because he loves her, hedespiseth me;

1878
01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:16.730
Because I love him I mustpity him.

1879
01:47:16.730 --> 01:47:20.070
This ring I gave him whenhe parted from me,

1880
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:24.330
To bind him to remember mygood will;

1881
01:47:24.330 --> 01:47:27.800
And now am I, unhappymessenger,

1882
01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:30.900
To plead for that which Iwould not obtain,

1883
01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:33.800
To carry that which Iwould have refused,

1884
01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:41.970
To praise his faith whichI would have dispraised.

1885
01:47:41.970 --> 01:47:45.770
I am my master'strue-confirmed love;

1886
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:49.630
But cannot be true servantto my master,

1887
01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:56.470
Unless I prove falsetraitor to myself.

1888
01:47:56.470 --> 01:48:01.730
Yet will I woo for him,but yet so coldly

1889
01:48:01.730 --> 01:48:06.170
As, heaven it knows, Iwould not have him speed.

1890
01:48:11.370 --> 01:48:14.870
Gentlewoman, good day! Ipray you, be my mean

1891
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:17.500
To bring me where to speakwith Madam Silvia.

1892
01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:21.030
What would you with her,if that I be she?

1893
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:25.000
If you be she, I doentreat your patience

1894
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:26.530
To hear me speak themessage I am sent on.

1895
01:48:26.530 --> 01:48:27.830
From whom?

1896
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:32.070
From my master, SirProteus, madam.

1897
01:48:32.530 --> 01:48:36.870
O, he sends you for apicture.

1898
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:38.770
Ay, madam.

1899
01:48:38.770 --> 01:48:43.430
Ursula, bring my picturehere.

1900
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:54.270
Go give your master this:tell him from me,

1901
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:56.700
One Julia, that hischanging thoughts forget,

1902
01:48:56.700 --> 01:49:00.700
Would better fit hischamber than this shadow.

1903
01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:05.400
Madam, please you perusethis letter.--

1904
01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:09.900
Pardon me, madam; I haveunadvised

1905
01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:12.300
Deliver'd you a paper thatI should not:

1906
01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:15.100
This is the letter to yourladyship.

1907
01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.070
I pray thee, let me lookon that again.

1908
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:18.800
It may not be; good madam,pardon me.

1909
01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:25.600
There, hold!

1910
01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.400
I will not look upon yourmaster's lines:

1911
01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.670
I know they are stuff'dwith protestations

1912
01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:35.700
And full of new-foundoaths; which he will break

1913
01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:40.130
As easily as I do tear hispaper.

1914
01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.930
Madam, he sends yourladyship this ring.

1915
01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:53.300
The more shame for himthat he sends it me;

1916
01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.070
For I have heard him say athousand times

1917
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:58.930
His Julia gave it him athis departure.

1918
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:01.200
Though his false fingerhave profaned the ring,

1919
01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:04.800
Mine shall not do hisJulia so much wrong.

1920
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.330
She thanks you.

1921
01:50:06.330 --> 01:50:09.330
What say'st thou?

1922
01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:12.430
I thank you, madam, thatyou tender her.

1923
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:15.230
Poor gentlewoman! mymaster wrongs her much.

1924
01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:16.600
Dost thou know her?

1925
01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:19.400
Almost as well as I doknow myself:

1926
01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:20.930
To think upon her woes Ido protest

1927
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:23.130
That I have wept a hundredseveral times.

1928
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:27.400
Belike she thinks thatProteus hath forsook her.

1929
01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.500
I think she doth; andthat's her cause of sorrow.

1930
01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:34.900
Is she not passing fair?

1931
01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.700
She hath been fairer,madam, than she is:

1932
01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:40.030
When she did think mymaster loved her well,

1933
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:45.570
She, in my judgment, wasas fair as you:

1934
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:47.130
But since she did neglecther looking-glass

1935
01:50:47.130 --> 01:50:49.970
And threw hersun-expelling mask away,

1936
01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:52.770
The air hath starved theroses in her cheeks

1937
01:50:52.770 --> 01:50:54.670
And pinch'd thelily-tincture of her face,

1938
01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:58.900
That now she is become asblack as I.

1939
01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:01.030
How tall was she?

1940
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:03.630
About my stature; for atPentecost,

1941
01:51:03.630 --> 01:51:06.330
When all our pageants ofdelight were play'd,

1942
01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:09.100
Our youth got me to playthe woman's part,

1943
01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:10.770
And I was trimm'd in MadamJulia's gown,

1944
01:51:10.770 --> 01:51:12.630
Which served me as fit, byall men's judgments,

1945
01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:15.400
As if the garment had beenmade for me:

1946
01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:19.570
Therefore I know she isabout my height.

1947
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:25.570
And at that time I madeher weep agood,

1948
01:51:25.570 --> 01:51:30.770
For I did play alamentable part:

1949
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:32.030
Madam, 'twas Ariadnepassioning

1950
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:37.500
For Theseus' perjury andunjust flight;

1951
01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:42.470
Which I so lively actedwith my tears

1952
01:51:42.470 --> 01:51:49.370
That my poor mistress,moved therewithal,

1953
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:56.200
Wept bitterly; and would Imight be dead

1954
01:51:56.200 --> 01:52:01.200
If I in thought felt nother very sorrow!

1955
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:08.030
She is beholding to thee,gentle youth.

1956
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:15.270
Alas, poor lady, desolateand left!

1957
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:19.430
I weep myself to thinkupon thy words.

1958
01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:27.170
Here, youth, there is mypurse; I give thee this

1959
01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:35.200
For thy sweet mistress' sake,because thou lovest her.

1960
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:38.330
Farewell.

1961
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:51.130
And she shall thank youfor't, if e'er you know her.

1962
01:52:51.130 --> 01:52:56.630
A virtuous gentlewoman,mild and beautiful

1963
01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:58.000
I hope my master's suitwill be but cold,

1964
01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.400
Since she respects mymistress' love so much.

1965
01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:12.870
Alas, how love can triflewith itself!

1966
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:17.770
Here is her picture:let me see;

1967
01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:32.870
I think, If I had such atire, this face of mine

1968
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:37.730
Were full as lovely as isthis of hers:

1969
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:41.570
And yet the painterflatter'd her a little,

1970
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:46.230
Unless I flatter withmyself too much.

1971
01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:51.230
Her hair is auburn, mineis perfect yellow:

1972
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:52.670
If that be all thedifference in his love,

1973
01:53:52.670 --> 01:53:55.400
I'll get me such acolour'd periwig.

1974
01:53:56.270 --> 01:54:01.630
Ay, but her forehead'slow, and mine's as high.

1975
01:54:01.630 --> 01:54:05.070
What should it be that herespects in her

1976
01:54:05.070 --> 01:54:07.770
But I can make respectivein myself,

1977
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:16.570
If this fond Love were nota blinded god?

1978
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:28.030
Come, shadow, come andtake this shadow up,

1979
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:34.770
For 'tis thy rival. O thousenseless form,

1980
01:54:34.770 --> 01:54:41.370
Thou shalt be worshipp'd,kiss'd, loved and adored!

1981
01:54:41.370 --> 01:54:42.430
And, were there sense inhis idolatry,

1982
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:48.270
My substance should bestatue in thy stead.

1983
01:54:48.270 --> 01:54:55.700
I'll use thee kindly forthy mistress' sake,

1984
01:54:55.970 --> 01:55:03.130
That used me so; or else,by Jove I vow,

1985
01:55:03.130 --> 01:55:05.730
I should have scratch'dout your unseeing eyes

1986
01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:11.500
To make my master out oflove with thee!

1987
01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:30.430


1988
01:55:33.570 --> 01:55:36.430
The sun begins to gild thewestern sky;

1989
01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:38.430
And now it is about thevery hour

1990
01:55:38.430 --> 01:55:45.800
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick'scell, should meet me.

1991
01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:49.100
She will not fail, forlovers break not hours,

1992
01:55:49.100 --> 01:55:51.600
Unless it be to comebefore their time;

1993
01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:56.500
So much they spur theirexpedition.

1994
01:56:06.970 --> 01:56:08.900
See where she comes.

1995
01:56:08.900 --> 01:56:11.030
Lady, a happy evening!

1996
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:15.270
Amen, amen! Go on, goodEglamour,

1997
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:17.270
Out at the postern by theabbey-wall:

1998
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:20.170
I fear I am attended bysome spies.

1999
01:56:20.170 --> 01:56:22.270
Fear not: the forest isnot three leagues off;

2000
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:26.300
If we recover that, we aresure enough.

2001
01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.930
Sir Proteus, what saysSilvia to my suit?

2002
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:55.630
O, sir, I find her milderthan she was;

2003
01:56:55.630 --> 01:56:58.600
And yet she takesexceptions at your person.

2004
01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:00.730
What, that my leg is toolong?

2005
01:57:00.730 --> 01:57:03.230
No; that it is too little.

2006
01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:05.070
I'll wear a boot, to makeit somewhat rounder.

2007
01:57:05.070 --> 01:57:08.100
But love will not be spurr'dto what it loathes.

2008
01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:09.330
What says she to my face?

2009
01:57:09.330 --> 01:57:10.770
She says it is a fair one.

2010
01:57:10.770 --> 01:57:14.630
Nay then, the wanton lies;my face is black.

2011
01:57:14.630 --> 01:57:16.730
But pearls are fair; andthe old saying is,

2012
01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:19.370
Black men are pearls inbeauteous ladies' eyes.

2013
01:57:19.370 --> 01:57:21.330
'Tis true; such pearls asput out ladies' eyes;

2014
01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:22.970
For I had rather wink thanlook on them.

2015
01:57:22.970 --> 01:57:25.430
How likes she mydiscourse?

2016
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:26.930
Ill, when you talk of war.

2017
01:57:26.930 --> 01:57:30.170
But well, when I discourseof love and peace?

2018
01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:32.270
But better, indeed, whenyou hold your peace.

2019
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:33.970
What says she to myvalour?

2020
01:57:33.970 --> 01:57:36.070
O, sir, she makes no doubtof that.

2021
01:57:36.070 --> 01:57:37.500
She needs not, when sheknows it cowardice.

2022
01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:39.030
What says she to my birth?

2023
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:40.170
That you are well derived.

2024
01:57:40.170 --> 01:57:42.170
True; from a gentleman toa fool.

2025
01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:44.430
Considers she mypossessions?

2026
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:47.200
O, ay; and pities them.

2027
01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.030
Wherefore?

2028
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:49.770
That such an ass shouldowe them.

2029
01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:51.100
That they are out bylease.

2030
01:57:51.100 --> 01:57:52.930
Here comes the duke.

2031
01:57:52.930 --> 01:57:55.230
How now, Sir Proteus! hownow, Thurio!

2032
01:57:55.230 --> 01:57:57.370
Which of you saw SirEglamour of late?

2033
01:57:57.370 --> 01:57:58.000
Not I.

2034
01:57:58.000 --> 01:57:58.630
Nor I.

2035
01:57:58.630 --> 01:57:59.500
Saw you my daughter?

2036
01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:00.630
Neither.

2037
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:01.570
Why then,

2038
01:58:01.570 --> 01:58:03.130
She's fled unto thatpeasant Valentine;

2039
01:58:03.130 --> 01:58:04.530
And Eglamour is in hercompany.

2040
01:58:04.530 --> 01:58:06.730
'Tis true; for FriarLaurence met them both,

2041
01:58:06.730 --> 01:58:09.470
As he in penance wander'dthrough the forest;

2042
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:12.130
Him he knew well, andguess'd that it was she,

2043
01:58:12.130 --> 01:58:14.070
But, being mask'd, he wasnot sure of it;

2044
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:15.730
Besides, she did intendconfession

2045
01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:18.930
At Patrick's cell this even;and there she was not;

2046
01:58:18.930 --> 01:58:21.730
These likelihoods confirmher flight from hence.

2047
01:58:21.730 --> 01:58:23.670
Therefore, I pray you,stand not to discourse,

2048
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:24.930
But mount you presentlyand meet with me

2049
01:58:24.930 --> 01:58:26.130
Upon the rising of themountain-foot

2050
01:58:26.130 --> 01:58:28.870
That leads towards Mantua,whither they are fled:

2051
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:33.170
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen,and follow me.

2052
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:37.670
Why, this it is to be apeevish girl,

2053
01:58:37.670 --> 01:58:40.000
That flies her fortunewhen it follows her.

2054
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.670
I'll after, more to berevenged on Eglamour

2055
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:47.130
Than for the love ofreckless Silvia.

2056
01:58:47.130 --> 01:58:49.970
And I will follow, morefor Silvia's love

2057
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:53.000
Than hate of Eglamour thatgoes with her.

2058
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.930
And I will follow, more tocross that love

2059
01:58:56.930 --> 01:59:00.900
Than hate for Silvia thatis gone for love.

2060
02:00:07.930 --> 02:00:11.770
(yells and laughing)

2061
02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:30.530
Come, come,

2062
02:00:30.530 --> 02:00:33.470
Be patient; we must bringyou to our captain.

2063
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:35.530
A thousand more mischancesthan this one

2064
02:00:35.530 --> 02:00:37.770
Have learn'd me how tobrook this patiently.

2065
02:00:37.770 --> 02:00:39.130
Come, bring her away.

2066
02:00:39.130 --> 02:00:41.370
Where is the gentlemanthat was with her?

2067
02:00:41.370 --> 02:00:46.430
Being nimble-footed, hehath outrun us,

2068
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:49.270
But Moyses and Valeriusfollow him.

2069
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:51.100
Go thou with her to thewest end of the wood;

2070
02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:54.030
There is our captain: we'llfollow him that's fled;

2071
02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:56.630
The thicket is beset; hecannot 'scape.

2072
02:00:56.630 --> 02:01:00.270
Come, I must bring you toour captain's cave:

2073
02:01:00.270 --> 02:01:02.800
Fear not; he bears anhonourable mind,

2074
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:04.830
And will not use a womanlawlessly.

2075
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:09.500
O Valentine, this I endurefor thee!

2076
02:01:23.730 --> 02:01:28.330
How use doth breed a habitin a man!

2077
02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:32.070
This shadowy desert,unfrequented woods,

2078
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:37.830
I better brook thanflourishing peopled towns:

2079
02:01:58.930 --> 02:02:02.870
Here can I sit alone,unseen of any,

2080
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:04.970
And to the nightingale'scomplaining notes

2081
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:10.100
Tune my distresses andrecord my woes.

2082
02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:12.230
O thou that dost inhabitin my breast,

2083
02:02:12.230 --> 02:02:15.900
Leave not the mansion solong tenantless,

2084
02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:18.600
Lest, growing ruinous, thebuilding fall

2085
02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.230
And leave no memory ofwhat it was!

2086
02:02:21.230 --> 02:02:24.830
Repair me with thypresence, Silvia;

2087
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:29.730
Thou gentle nymph, cherishthy forlorn swain!

2088
02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.730
What halloing and whatstir is this to-day?

2089
02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.300
These are my mates, thatmake their wills their law,

2090
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.570
Have some unhappypassenger in chase.

2091
02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:42.500
They love me well; yet Ihave much to do

2092
02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:45.130
To keep them from unciviloutrages.

2093
02:02:45.130 --> 02:02:49.130
Withdraw thee, Valentine:

2094
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:53.800
who's this comes here?

2095
02:02:57.370 --> 02:03:01.500
Madam, this service I havedone for you,

2096
02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.430
Though you respect notaught your servant doth,

2097
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:05.070
To hazard life and rescueyou from him

2098
02:03:05.070 --> 02:03:07.100
That would have forcedyour honour and your love;

2099
02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:11.100
Vouchsafe me, for my meed,but one fair look;

2100
02:03:11.100 --> 02:03:12.870
A smaller boon than this Icannot beg

2101
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:15.670
And less than this, I amsure, you cannot give.

2102
02:03:15.670 --> 02:03:17.930
How like a dream is this Isee and hear!

2103
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:19.800
Love, lend me patience toforbear awhile.

2104
02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:23.530
O miserable, unhappy thatI am!

2105
02:03:23.530 --> 02:03:25.770
Unhappy were you, madam,ere I came;

2106
02:03:25.770 --> 02:03:28.270
But by my coming I havemade you happy.

2107
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:30.100
By thy approach thoumakest me most unhappy.

2108
02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:32.530
And me, when he approachethto your presence.

2109
02:03:32.530 --> 02:03:35.000
Had I been seized by ahungry lion,

2110
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.630
I would have been abreakfast to the beast,

2111
02:03:37.630 --> 02:03:41.000
Rather than have falseProteus rescue me.

2112
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.700
O, Heaven be judge how Ilove Valentine,

2113
02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:49.300
Whose life's as tender tome as my soul!

2114
02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:52.670
And full as much, for morethere cannot be,

2115
02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:55.800
I do detest false perjuredProteus.

2116
02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:58.600
Therefore be gone; solicitme no more.

2117
02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.730
What dangerous action,stood it next to death,

2118
02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:04.730
Would I not undergo forone calm look!

2119
02:04:04.730 --> 02:04:06.570
O, 'tis the curse in love,and still approved,

2120
02:04:06.570 --> 02:04:08.570
When women cannot lovewhere they're beloved!

2121
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:11.970
When Proteus cannot lovewhere he's beloved.

2122
02:04:11.970 --> 02:04:15.670
Read over Julia's heart,thy first best love,

2123
02:04:15.670 --> 02:04:19.570
For whose dear sake thoudidst then rend thy faith

2124
02:04:19.570 --> 02:04:22.130
Into a thousand oaths; andall those oaths

2125
02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:25.500
Descended into perjury, tolove me.

2126
02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:30.100
Thou hast no faith leftnow, unless thou'dst two;

2127
02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:34.400
And that's far worse thannone; better have none

2128
02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:37.370
Than plural faith which istoo much by one:

2129
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:40.500
Thou counterfeit to thytrue friend!

2130
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:41.770
In love Who respects friend?

2131
02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:43.800
All men but Proteus.

2132
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.270
Nay, if the gentle spiritof moving words

2133
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:49.630
Can no way change you to amilder form,

2134
02:04:49.630 --> 02:04:51.200
I'll woo you like asoldier, at arms' end,

2135
02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:55.100
And love you 'gainst thenature of love,--force ye.

2136
02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:55.930
O heaven!

2137
02:04:55.930 --> 02:04:57.800
I'll force thee yield tomy desire.

2138
02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:01.570
Ruffian, let go that rudeuncivil touch,

2139
02:05:01.570 --> 02:05:06.100
Thou friend of an illfashion!

2140
02:05:09.630 --> 02:05:17.530
Valentine!

2141
02:05:17.530 --> 02:05:23.600
Thou common friend, that'swithout faith or love,

2142
02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:29.100
For such is a friend now;treacherous man!

2143
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:32.430
Thou hast beguiled myhopes; nought but mine eye

2144
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:35.930
Could have persuaded me:now I dare not say

2145
02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:42.300
I have one friend alive;thou wouldst disprove me.

2146
02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:45.070
Who should be trusted,when one's own right hand

2147
02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:50.900
Is perjured to the bosom?Proteus,

2148
02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:55.300
I am sorry I must nevertrust thee more,

2149
02:05:55.300 --> 02:06:00.830
But count the world astranger for thy sake.

2150
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:07.670
The private wound is deepest:O time most accurst,

2151
02:06:07.670 --> 02:06:13.230
'Mongst all foes that afriend should be the worst!

2152
02:06:13.230 --> 02:06:22.930
My shame and guiltconfounds me.

2153
02:06:22.930 --> 02:06:29.030
Forgive me, Valentine: ifhearty sorrow

2154
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:32.070
Be a sufficient ransom foroffence,

2155
02:06:32.070 --> 02:06:37.070
I tender 't here; I do astruly suffer

2156
02:06:37.070 --> 02:06:41.170
As e'er I did commit.

2157
02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:46.100
Then I am paid;

2158
02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:55.170
And once again I doreceive thee honest.

2159
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.730
Who by repentance is notsatisfied

2160
02:07:13.730 --> 02:07:19.370
Is nor of heaven nor earth,for these are pleased.

2161
02:07:19.370 --> 02:07:24.130
By penitence the Eternal'swrath's appeased:

2162
02:07:24.130 --> 02:07:30.770
And, that my love mayappear plain and free,

2163
02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:36.400
All that was mine inSilvia I give thee.

2164
02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:40.830
O me unhappy!

2165
02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:43.670
Look to the boy.

2166
02:07:43.670 --> 02:07:48.000
Why, boy! why, wag! hownow! what's the matter?

2167
02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.930
Look up; speak.

2168
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:53.530
O good sir,

2169
02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:56.200
my master charged me to delivera ring to Madam Silvia,

2170
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.970
which, out of my neglect,was never done.

2171
02:07:58.970 --> 02:08:01.230
Where is that ring, boy?

2172
02:08:01.230 --> 02:08:02.530
Here 'tis; this is it.

2173
02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:07.670
How! let me see:

2174
02:08:07.670 --> 02:08:11.070
Why, this is the ring Igave to Julia.

2175
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:13.230
O, cry you mercy, sir, Ihave mistook:

2176
02:08:13.230 --> 02:08:15.370
This is the ring you sentto Silvia.

2177
02:08:15.370 --> 02:08:18.530
But how camest thouby this ring?

2178
02:08:18.530 --> 02:08:22.630
At my depart I gavethis unto Julia.

2179
02:08:22.630 --> 02:08:27.970
And Julia herself did giveit me;

2180
02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:37.470
And Julia herself hathbrought it hither.

2181
02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:45.770
How! Julia!

2182
02:08:45.770 --> 02:08:50.030
Behold her that gave aimto all thy oaths,

2183
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:54.430
And entertain'd 'em deeplyin her heart.

2184
02:08:54.430 --> 02:09:05.470
How oft hast thou withperjury cleft the root!

2185
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:12.900
O Proteus, let this habitmake thee blush!

2186
02:09:12.900 --> 02:09:15.900
Be thou ashamed that Ihave took upon me

2187
02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:19.130
Such an immodest raiment,if shame live

2188
02:09:19.130 --> 02:09:22.130
In a disguise of love:

2189
02:09:22.130 --> 02:09:24.830
It is the lesser blot,modesty finds,

2190
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:32.400
Women to change their shapesthan men their minds.

2191
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:38.900
Than men their minds! O 'tistrue.

2192
02:09:39.470 --> 02:09:43.770
Were man constant,he were perfect.

2193
02:09:43.770 --> 02:09:47.500
That one error Fillshim with faults;

2194
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:50.830
makes him run throughall the sins:

2195
02:09:50.830 --> 02:09:55.430
Inconstancy falls off ereit begins.

2196
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:17.300
What is in Silvia's face,but I may spy

2197
02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:26.000
More fresh in Julia's witha constant eye?

2198
02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.770
Come, come, a hand fromeither:

2199
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.370
Let me be blest to makethis happy close;

2200
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:41.830
'Twere pity two such friendsshould be long foes.

2201
02:10:43.770 --> 02:10:48.400
Bear witness, Heaven, Ihave my wish for ever.

2202
02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.800
And I mine.

2203
02:10:50.800 --> 02:11:04.070
A prize, a prize, a prize!

2204
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:08.030
Forbear, forbear, I say!it is my lord the duke.

2205
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:11.100
Your grace is welcome to aman disgraced,

2206
02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:12.400
Banished Valentine.

2207
02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.130
Sir Valentine!

2208
02:11:14.130 --> 02:11:16.530
Yonder is Silvia; andSilvia's mine.

2209
02:11:16.530 --> 02:11:19.030
Thurio, give back, or elseembrace thy death;

2210
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:20.630
Come not within themeasure of my wrath;

2211
02:11:20.630 --> 02:11:23.470
Do not name Silvia thine;if once again,

2212
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:26.330
Verona shall not holdthee. Here she stands;

2213
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:28.000
Take but possession of herwith a touch:

2214
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.830
I dare thee but to breatheupon my love.

2215
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:31.770
Sir Valentine, I care notfor her, I;

2216
02:11:31.770 --> 02:11:34.170
I hold him but a fool thatwill endanger

2217
02:11:34.170 --> 02:11:36.270
His body for a girl thatloves him not:

2218
02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:40.230
I claim her not, andtherefore she is thine.

2219
02:11:44.970 --> 02:11:46.830
The more degenerate andbase art thou,

2220
02:11:46.830 --> 02:11:49.300
To make such means for heras thou hast done

2221
02:11:49.300 --> 02:11:52.230
And leave her on suchslight conditions.

2222
02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:55.630
Now, by the honour of myancestry,

2223
02:11:55.630 --> 02:11:57.770
I do applaud thy spirit,Valentine,

2224
02:11:57.770 --> 02:12:01.070
And think thee worthy ofan empress' love:

2225
02:12:01.070 --> 02:12:03.630
Know then, I here forgetall former griefs,

2226
02:12:03.630 --> 02:12:07.600
Cancel all grudge, repealthee home again,

2227
02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.370
Plead a new state in thyunrivall'd merit,

2228
02:12:10.370 --> 02:12:13.800
To which I thus subscribe:Sir Valentine,

2229
02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.430
Thou art a gentleman andwell derived;

2230
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:21.970
Take thou thy Silvia, forthou hast deserved her.

2231
02:12:22.570 --> 02:12:26.800
I thank your grace; thegift hath made me happy.

2232
02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:29.030
I now beseech you, foryour daughter's sake,

2233
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:30.930
To grant one boom that Ishall ask of you.

2234
02:12:30.930 --> 02:12:33.300
I grant it, for thine own,whate'er it be.

2235
02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:34.970
These banish'd men that Ihave kept withal

2236
02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:36.870
