00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.670


2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:54.000


3
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.730
In delivering my son from me,

4
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.870
I bury a second husband.

5
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.970
And I in going, madam,

6
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.100
weep o'er my father's death anew:

7
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
but I must attend his majesty's command,

8
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.770
to whom I am now in ward,

9
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.200
evermore in subjection.

10
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.500
You shall find of the king a husband, madam;

11
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.330
you,sir, a father

12
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.330
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

13
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.030
He hath abandoned his physicians, madam;

14
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.330
under whose practises

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.470
he hath persecuted time with hope,

16
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830
and finds no other advantage in the process

17
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.630
but only the losing of hope by time.

18
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.930
This young gentlewoman had a father,

19
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.100
O, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!

20
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.730
whose skill was almost as great as his honesty;

21
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.330
had it stretched so far,

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.300
would have made nature immortal,

23
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.770
and death should have play for lack of work.

24
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.970
Would, for the king's sake, he were living!

25
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.100
I think it would be the death

26
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.300
of the king's disease.

27
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.400
How called you the man you speak of, madam?

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.530
He was famous, sir, in his profession,

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.670
and it was his great right to be so:

30
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.570
Gerard de Narbon.

31
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.430
He was excellent indeed, madam:

32
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.000
the king very lately spoke of him

33
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.170
admiringly and mourningly

34
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.070
he was likely to have lived still,

35
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.330
if knowledge could be set up against mortality.

36
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.230
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.030
A fistula, my lord.

38
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.700
I heard not of it before.

39
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.200
I would it were not notorious.

40
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.500
Was this gentlewoman

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.270
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.330
His sole child, my lord,

43
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.530
and bequeathed to my overlooking.

44
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.200
I have those hopes of her good

45
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.870
that her education promises;

46
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.370
her dispositions she inherits,

47
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.530
in her they are the better

48
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.870
for their simpleness;

49
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.830
she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

50
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.900
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

51
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.500
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in.

52
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.800
The remembrance of her father

53
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830
never approaches her heart

54
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.030
but the tyranny of her sorrows

55
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.400
takes all livelihood from her cheek.

56
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.830
Go to, Helena, no more; go to

57
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.170
lest it be rather thought

58
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.870
you affect a sorrow than have it.

59
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.970
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

60
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.630
How understand we that?

61
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.570
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,

62
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.330
excessive grief the enemy to the living.

63
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.270
If the living be enemy to the grief,

64
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.630
the excess makes it soon mortal.

65
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.030
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

66
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.230
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father

67
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.870
In manners, as in shape!

68
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.870
thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee,

69
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.370
and thy goodness share with thy birthright!

70
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.270
Love all, trust a few,

71
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.900
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy

72
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.800
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend

73
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.130
Under thy life's key: be cheque'd for silence,

74
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.200
But never tax'd for speech.

75
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.800
What heaven more will,

76
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.900
that thee may furnish and my prayers fall down,

77
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.500
Fall on thy head! Farewell,

78
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.200
'Tis an unseason'd courtier;

79
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.930
good my lord, Advise him.

80
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.230
He cannot want the best

81
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.930
that shall attend his love.

82
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.270
Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

83
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.430
The best wishes that can be forged

84
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.470
in your thoughts be servants to you!

85
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.830
Be comfortable to my mother, your mistress,

86
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.500
and make much of her.

87
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.100
Farewell, pretty lady:

88
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.100
you must hold the credit of your father.

89
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.330
O, were that all! I think not on my father;

90
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.100
And these great tears grace his remembrance more

91
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.570
Than those I shed for him.

92
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.600
What was he like?

93
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.700
I have forgot him:

94
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.800
my imagination carries no favour in't but Bertram's.

95
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.670
I am undone: there is no living, none,

96
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.770
If Bertram be away.

97
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.430
'Twere all one that I should love

98
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.300
a bright particular star

99
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.070
And think to wed it, he is so above me:

100
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.770
In his bright radiance and collateral light

101
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.070
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.

102
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.270
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:

103
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.570
The hind that would be mated by the lion

104
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.370
Must die for love.

'Twas pretty, though plague,

109
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.600
to see him every hour;

110
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.700
to sit and draw his arched brows,

111
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.170
his hawking eye, his curls,

112
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.970
In our heart's table;

113
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.570
heart too capable of every line and trick

114
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.930
of his sweet favour:

115
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.330
But now he's gone,

116
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.270
and my idolatrous fancy

117
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.470
Must sanctify his reliques.

118
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.230
Who comes here?

119
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.730
One that goes with him:

120
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.000
I love him for his sake;

121
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.170
And yet I know him a notorious liar,

122
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.030
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;

123
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.870
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,

124
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.100
That they take place,

125
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.100
when virtue's steely bones look bleak i' the cold wind:

126
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.970
withal, full oft we see

127
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.030
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

128
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.170
Save you, fair queen!

129
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.200
Are you meditating on virginity?

130
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.330
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you:

131
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.670
let me ask you a question.

132
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.530
Man is enemy to virginity;

133
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.670
how may we barricado it against him?

134
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.030
Keep him out.

135
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.330
But he assails;

136
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.130
and our virginity, though valiant,

137
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.100
in the defence yet is weak:

138
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.570
unfold to us some warlike resistance.

139
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.000
There is none: man, sitting down before you,

140
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.530
will undermine you and blow you up.

141
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.700
Bless our poor virginity

142
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.830
from underminers and blowers up!

143
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.330
It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature

144
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.030
to preserve virginity.

145
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.000
Loss of virginity is rational increase

146
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.400
and there was never virgin got

147
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.130
till virginity was first lost.

148
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.800
I will stand for 't a little,

149
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.670
though therefore I die a virgin.

150
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.970
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle,

151
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.130
made of self-love,

152
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:30.900
which is the most inhibited sin in the canon.

153
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.670
Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't:

154
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.830
out with 't!

155
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.730
within the year it will make itself two,

156
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.000
which is a goodly increase;

157
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.730
and the principal itself not much the worse:

158
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.130
away with 't!

159
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.070
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

160
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.030
Let me see: marry, ill,

161
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.800
to like him that ne'er it likes.

162
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.130
'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying;

163
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.230
the longer kept, the less worth:

164
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.700
Virginity, like an old courtier,

165
00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.630
wears her cap out of fashion:

166
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.700
richly suited, but unsuitable:

167
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.030
just like the brooch and the tooth-pick,

168
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.200
which wear not now.

169
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.200
Your date is better in your pie

170
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.170
and your porridge than in your cheek;

171
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.570
and your virginity, your old virginity,

172
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.370
is like one of our French withered pears,

173
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.470
it looks ill, it eats drily;

174
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:25.000
marry, 'tis a withered pear;

175
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it was formerly better;

176
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.230
marry, yet 'tis a withered pear:

177
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.170
will you anything with it?

178
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.530
Not my virginity yet

179
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.200
There shall your master have a thousand loves,

180
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.370
A mother and a mistress and a friend,

181
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.630
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,

182
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.570
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,

183
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.030
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;

184
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.930
His humble ambition, proud humility,

185
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.130
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,

186
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.670
His faith, his sweet disaster;

187
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.270
with a world of pretty,

188
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.130
fond, adoptious christendoms,

189
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.870
that blinking Cupid gossips.

190
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.530
Now shall he--

191
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.400
I know not what he shall. God send him well!

192
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.530
The court's a learning place, and he is one--

193
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.700
What one, i' faith?

194
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:23.070
That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

195
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.400
What's pity?

196
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.230
That wishing well had not a body in't,

197
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.400
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,

198
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.170
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,

199
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.270
Might with effects of them follow our friends,

200
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.330
And show what we alone must think,

201
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.230
which never returns us thanks.

202
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.430
Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

203
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.970
Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee,

204
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.470
I will think of thee at court.

205
00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.130
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

206
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.430
Under Mars, I.

207
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.430
I especially think, under Mars.

208
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.200
Why under Mars?

209
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.630
The wars have so kept you under

210
00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.400
that you must needs be born under Mars.

211
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.230
When he was predominant.

212
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.030
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

213
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.630
Why think you so?

214
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.630
You go so much backward when you fight.

215
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.500
That's for advantage.

216
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.530
So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;

217
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:12.870
but the composition

218
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.170
that your valour and fear makes in you

219
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.430
is a virtue of a good wing,

220
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.770
and I like the wear well.

221
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.730
I am so full of businesses,

222
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.700
I cannot answer thee acutely.

223
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.830
When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;

224
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.700
when thou hast none, remember thy friends;

225
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.230
get thee a good husband,

226
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.870
and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

227
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.700
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,

228
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.630
Which we ascribe to heaven:

229
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.770
the fated sky gives us free scope,

230
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.600
only doth backward pull our slow designs

231
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.600
when we ourselves are dull.

232
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.870
What power is it which mounts my love so high,

233
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.600
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?

234
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.770
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings

235
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:04.000
To join like likes and kiss like native things.

236
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.700
Impossible be strange attempts to those

237
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.670
that weigh their pains in sense

238
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:13.200
and do suppose What hath been cannot be:

239
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.500
who ever strove to show her merit,

240
00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.300
that did miss her love?

241
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.470
The king's disease--

242
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.200
my project may deceive me,

243
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.400
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

244
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.570
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;

245
00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.270
Have fought with equal fortune and continue

246
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.330
A braving war.

247
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.230
So 'tis reported, sir.

248
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.270
Nay, 'tis most credible;

249
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.330
we here received it. A certainty,

250
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.670
vouch'd from our cousin Austria,

251
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.900
With caution that the Florentine will move us

252
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.370
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend

253
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.970
Prejudicates the business

254
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.870
and would seem to have us make denial.

255
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.100
His love and wisdom, approved so to your majesty,

256
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.070
may plead for amplest credence.

257
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.730
He hath arm'd our answer,

258
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:30.270
And Florence is denied before he comes:

259
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.730
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean

260
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.100
to see the Tuscan service,

261
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.030
freely have they leave to stand on either part.

262
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.630
It well may serve A nursery to our gentry,

263
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.330
who are sick for breathing and exploit.

264
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.070
What's he comes here?

265
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.400
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,

266
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.030
Young Bertram.

267
00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.530
Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;

268
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.300
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,

269
00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.400
Hath well composed thee.

270
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.930
Thy father's moral parts mayst thou inherit too!

271
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.300
Welcome to Paris.

272
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.530
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

273
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.530
It much repairs me to talk of your good father.

274
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.430
In his youth he had the wit

275
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.400
which I can well observe today

276
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.870
in our young lords;

277
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.030
but they may jest till their own scorn

278
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.130
return to them unnoted

279
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.570
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;

280
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.930
who were below him he used as creatures of another place

281
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.800
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,

282
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.230
Making them proud by his humility,

283
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:06.730
In their poor praise he humbled.

284
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:12.500
Such a man might be a copy to these younger times;

285
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.100
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now

286
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.830
But goers backward.

287
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.230
His good remembrance, sir,

288
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.970
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;

289
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.500
So in approof lives not his epitaph

290
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.970
as in your royal speech.

291
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.830
'Let me not live,' quoth he,

292
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.500
'After my flame lacks oil,

293
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.030
to be the snuff of younger spirits,

294
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:44.370
whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain;

295
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:47.870
whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments;

296
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:57.330
whose constancies expire before their fashions.'

297
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.270
This he wish'd;

298
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.770
I after him do after him wish too,

299
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.570
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,

300
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.630
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,

301
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.670
To give some labourers room.

302
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.730
You are loved, sir:

303
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.500
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

304
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:34.630
I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,

305
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.870
Since the physician at your father's died?

306
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.770
He was much famed.

307
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:44.100
Some six months since, my lord.

308
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.400
If he were living, I would try him yet.

309
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.000
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out

310
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.670
With several applications;

311
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.100
nature and sickness debate it at their leisure.

312
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.100
Welcome, count; my sons are no dearer.

313
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.300
Thank your majesty.

314
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.670
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah

315
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.130
the complaints I have heard of you

316
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.470
I do not all believe:

317
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.770
'tis my slowness that I do not;

318
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.630
for I know you lack not folly to commit them,

319
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.230
and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.

320
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.400
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

321
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400
Well, sir.

322
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.200
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor,

323
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.270
though many of the rich are damned:

324
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.900
but, if I may have your ladyship's good will

325
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.370
to go to the world,

326
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.630
Isbel the woman and I will do as we may.

327
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.170
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

328
00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:46.770
I do beg your good will in this case.

329
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.670
In what case?

330
00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.470
In Isbel's case and mine own.

331
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.270
Service is no heritage:

332
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.200
and I think I shall never have the blessing of God

333
00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.370
till I have issue o' my body;

334
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:58.500
for they say barnes are blessings.

335
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.000
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

336
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.400
My poor body, madam, requires it:

337
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.830
I am driven on by the flesh;

338
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.170
and he must needs go that the devil drives.

339
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.170
Is this all your worship's reason?

340
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.670
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons

341
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.770
such as they are.

342
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.530
May the world know them?

343
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.300
I have been, madam, a wicked creature,

344
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.500
as you and all flesh and blood are;

345
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.130
and, indeed, I do marry that I may repent.

346
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.300
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

347
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.370
I am out o' friends, madam;

348
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.430
and I hope to have friends for my wife's sake.

349
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.700
Such friends are thine enemies, sirrah.

350
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:38.230
Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

351
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.030
May it please you, madam,

352
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.870
that he bid Helen come to you: of her I am to speak.

353
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.030
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman

354
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.700
I would speak with her;

355
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.830
Well, now.

356
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.170
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

357
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.570
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me;

358
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.400
and she herself, without other advantage,

359
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.970
may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds:

360
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.600
there is more owing her than is paid;

361
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.530
and more shall be paid her than she'll demand.

362
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:09.300
Madam, I was very late more near her

363
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.970
than I think she wished me:

364
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.730
alone she was, and did communicate

365
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.500
to herself her own words

366
00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500
to her own ears;

367
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.730
she thought, I dare vow for her,

368
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.970
they touched not any stranger sense.

369
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.170
Her matter was, she loved your son:

370
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:29.000
Fortune, she said, was no goddess,

371
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
that had put such difference

372
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.970
betwixt their two estates;

373
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.930
Love no god, that would not extend his might,

374
00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.230
only where qualities were level;

375
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.870
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow

376
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:46.230
that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in:

377
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.500
which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;

378
00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.130
sithence, in the loss that may happen,

379
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.100
it concerns you something to know it.

380
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.330
You have discharged this honestly;

381
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.600
keep it to yourself:

382
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.100
many likelihoods informed me of this before,

383
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.170
which hung so tottering in the balance

384
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.630
that I could neither believe nor misdoubt.

385
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.130
stall this in your bosom;

386
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.430
and I thank you for your honest care:

387
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.100
I will speak with you more anon.

388
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.900
Even so it was with me when I was young:

389
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.470
If ever we are nature's, these are ours;

390
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:29.770
this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;

391
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.870
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;

392
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.000
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,

393
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.170
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:

394
00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.500
By our remembrances of days foregone,

395
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.230
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.

396
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.030
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.

397
00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.030
What is your pleasure, madam?

398
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.230
You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.

399
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.300
Mine honourable mistress.

400
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.830
Nay, a mother: Why not a mother?

401
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:11.600
When I said 'a mother,'

402
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.730
methought you saw a serpent:

403
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.870
what's in 'mother,' that you start at it? I say,

404
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.900
I am your mother;

405
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.600
And put you in the catalogue of those

406
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.800
That were enwombed mine:

407
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.570
'tis often seen adoption strives with nature

408
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.500
and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds:

409
00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.970
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,

410
00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:39.130
Yet I express to you a mother's care:

411
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.330
God's mercy, maiden!

412
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:45.200
Does it curd thy blood to say I am thy mother?

413
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.130
Why? that you are my daughter?

414
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.300
That I am not.

415
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.770
I say, I am your mother.

416
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:50.700
Pardon, madam;

417
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.170
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:

418
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.970
I am from humble, he from honour'd name;

419
00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.630
No note upon my parents, his all noble:

420
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.530
My master, my dear lord he is;

421
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.530
and I his servant live, and will his vassal die:

422
00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.730
He must not be my brother.

423
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.630
Nor I your mother?

424
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.370
You are my mother, madam; would you were,--

425
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.130
So that my lord your son were not my brother,--

426
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.270
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,

427
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.600
I care no more for than I do for heaven,

428
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.300
So I were not his sister.

429
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.570
Can't no other, but, I your daughter,

430
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.900
he must be my brother?

431
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:29.970
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:

432
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.630
God shield you mean it not!

433
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:37.170
Daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse.

434
00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.630
What, pale again?

435
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.970
My fear hath catch'd your fondness:

436
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.970
now I see the mystery of your loneliness,

437
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.500
and find your salt tears' head:

438
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.130
now to all sense 'tis gross

439
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.730
You love my son; invention is ashamed,

440
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.430
Against the proclamation of thy passion,

441
00:22:56.430 --> 00:23:01.970
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;

442
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.830
But tell me then, 'tis so;

443
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.870
for, look thy cheeks confess it, th' one to th' other;

444
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.870
and thine eyes see it so grossly shown

445
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.000
in thy behaviors

446
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.870
That in their kind they speak it:

447
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.300
only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,

448
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:20.300
That truth should be suspected.

449
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.770
Speak, is't so?

450
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.270
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;

451
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:31.570
If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,

452
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.230
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,

453
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.670
Tell me truly.

454
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.800
Good madam, pardon me!

455
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.170
Do you love my son?

456
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.530
Your pardon, noble mistress!

457
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.830
Love you my son?

458
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.570
Do not you love him, madam?

459
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.000
Go not about;

460
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.300
my love hath in't a bond,

461
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.730
whereof the world takes note:

462
00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.630
come, come, disclose the state of your affection;

463
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.130
for your passions have to the full appeach'd.

464
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.470
Then, I confess,

465
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.730
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,

466
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:08.270
That before you, and next unto high heaven,

467
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:10.930
I love your son.

468
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.470
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:

469
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:16.500
Be not offended;

470
00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.430
for it hurts not him that he is loved of me:

471
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.970
I follow him not by any token

472
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.230
of presumptuous suit;

473
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:25.970
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;

474
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.870
Yet never know how that desert should be.

475
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.300
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;

476
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.430
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve

477
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.430
I still pour in the waters of my love

478
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:47.500
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,

479
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.870
Religious in mine error,

480
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.170
I adore the sun,

481
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.570
that looks upon his worshipper,

482
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.500
but knows of him no more.

483
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.530
My dearest madam,

484
00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.130
Let not your hate encounter with my love

485
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.800
For loving where you do: but if yourself,

486
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.900
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,

487
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.630
Did ever in so true a flame of liking

488
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:18.070
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian

489
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.630
Was both herself and love:

490
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.200
O, then, give pity to her,

491
00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.730
whose state is such that cannot choose

492
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.900
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;

493
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.230
That seeks not to find that her search implies,

494
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.570
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

495
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.570
Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--

496
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.270
To go to Paris?

497
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.330
Madam, I had.

498
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.900
Wherefore? tell true.

499
00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.870
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.

500
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.330
You know my father left me some prescriptions

501
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.470
Of rare and proved effects,

502
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.770
such as his reading and manifest experience

503
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.730
had collected for general sovereignty;

504
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.300
amongst the rest, there is a remedy,

505
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.430
approved, set down,

506
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.200
To cure the desperate languishings

507
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.530
whereof the king is render'd lost.

508
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.570
This was your motive For Paris, was it? speak.

509
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.170
My lord your son made me to think of this;

510
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.470
Else Paris and the medicine and the king

511
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.530
Had from the conversation of my thoughts

512
00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.400
Haply been absent then.

513
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.000
But think you, Helen,

514
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.070
If you should tender your supposed aid,

515
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:39.630
he would receive it?

516
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.200
he and his physicians are of a mind;

517
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.230
he, that they cannot help him,

518
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.000
They, that they cannot help:

519
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.770
how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin,

520
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.300
when the schools, embowell'd

521
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.630
of their doctrine,

522
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.930
have left off the danger to itself?

523
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:54.930
There's something in't,

524
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.900
more than my father's skill,

525
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.400
which was the greatest of his profession,

526
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.470
that his good receipt

527
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.430
shall for my legacy be sanctified

528
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.700
By the luckiest stars in heaven:

529
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.200
and, would your honour but give me leave

530
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.570
to try success,

531
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.400
I'ld venture the well-lost life

532
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.700
of mine on his grace's cure

533
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.200
By such a day and hour.

534
00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.470
Dost thou believe't?

535
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:22.470
Ay, madam, knowingly.

536
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.930
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,

537
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.730
Means and attendants

538
00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.700
and my loving greetings to those of mine in court:

539
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.970
I'll stay at home and pray God's blessing

540
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.870
into thy attempt:

541
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:41.400
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,

542
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.970
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

543
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.970
