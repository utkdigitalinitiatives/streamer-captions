WEBVTT

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
IN THE EARLY
TWENTIETH CENTURY,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
LATIN AMERICA WAS AFLAME
WITH AESTHETIC FERVOR.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
PASSIONS RAN HIGH.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
MODERNISMO CORRALLED
THE ARTISTIC ENERGIES

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
OF EUROPE INTO A NEW
AND WHOLLY ORIGINAL

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
APPROACH TO
LITERATURE.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
THE AVANT GARDE PITCHED
ALL OUT WARFARE AGAINST

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
TRADITIONAL ARTISTIC FORMS
AND MODES OF EXPRESSION.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
AND THESE MOVEMENTS
ONLY GATHERED MOMENTUM

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
IN THE YEARS
THAT FOLLOWED,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
FANNED BY THE FLAMES
OF POLITICAL TURMOIL

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
THAT ERUPTED THROUGHOUT
THE CONTINENT.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
IN MEXICO, THE GOVERNMENT
OF PORFIRIO DIAZ

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
SUCCUMBED TO A MASSIVE
POPULAR INSURRECTION,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
GIVING RISE TO ONE OF THE
MOST INFLUENTIAL GENRES

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
ON THE CONTINENT: THE
REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
LATER, IN THE 1930'S, THE
ARGENTINEAN INTELLIGENTSIA

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
JOINED UP WITH FACTIONS
FROM THE MILITARY TO STAGE

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A COUP; YET THE IMPOSITION
OF A CONSERVATIVE REGIME

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
ONLY INTENSIFIED ARTISTIC
ACTIVITY IN THAT COUNTRY.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
SIMILARLY, AN ENTIRE
GENERATION OF CUBAN WRITERS

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
- INCLUDING THE GREAT
ALEJO CARPENTIER -

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
WERE OPPRESSED AND
OFTEN IMPRISONED

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
FOR THEIR OPPOSITION
TO THE DICTATORSHIP

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
OF GERALDO MACHADO.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
THIS PERIOD OF
TUMULT AND CHANGE

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
FOSTERED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF AUTHORS

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
WHO WERE TO BECOME ICONS
OF THE MAJOR INTERNATIONAL

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
EPISODES OF THIS ERA
- THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
THE STALINIST DICTATORSHIP,
AND THE SECOND WORLD WAR

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
THAT WAS LOOMING
ON THE HORIZON.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:16.000
*

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
*

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
AS A RESULT OF CHRONIC
SOCIAL INSTABILITY,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
WRITERS WERE OFTEN USED
AS POLITICAL FOOTBALLS

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
AND THEIR STATUS WAS IN
A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
MANY WENT INTO EXILE
- VOLUNTARY OR NOT -

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
FROM THEIR
MOTHER COUNTRIES.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
THIS MIGRATION LED TO A
CROSS-FERTILIZATION OF

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
STYLES AND SENSIBILITIES
THAT GREATLY DIVERSIFIED

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
THE LITERATURE
OF LATIN AMERICA.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
THE DISLOCATION
OF AUTHORS

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
SUCH AS ALFONSO
REYES IN MEXICO

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
AND JOSE ORTEGA Y
GASSET IN ARGENTINA

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
WAS A CRUCIAL
FACTOR IN THEIR

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
DEVELOPMENT AS WRITERS.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
REYES TAPPED INTO HIS
EXPERIENCE AS AN EXILE

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
TO CREATE A TEXT THAT
MASTERFULLY REVISIONED

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
THE WAY LATIN
AMERICAN HISTORY

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
WAS TO BE INTERPRETED:
 VISION OF ANAHUAC.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
OUR NATURE HAS TWO
 OPPOSITE ASPECTS.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
ONE, THE HIGHLY PRAISED
 VIRGIN FOREST OF AMERICA,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
IS HARDLY WORTHY
 OF DESCRIPTION.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
AN OBLIGATORY TOPIC
 OF ADMIRATION

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
IN THE OLD WORLD,
 IT INSPIRES

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
THE VERBAL ENTHUSIASMS
 OF CHATEAUBRIAND.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
A LIFE-GIVING OVEN WHERE
 ENERGIES SEEM TO BE

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
WASTED WITH PROFLIGATE
 GENEROSITY, WHERE OUR

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
SPIRIT IS MAROONED IN
 INTOXICATING EMANATIONS,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
IT IS AN
 EXALTATION OF LIFE

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
AND SIMULTANEOUSLY AN
 IMAGE OF VITAL ANARCHY.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
OURS, THAT OF ANAHUAC,
 IS SOMETHING BETTER

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AND MORE TONIC.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
AT LEAST, FOR THOSE
 WHO LIKE TO KEEP THEIR

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
WILL ALERT AT ALL TIMES
 AND THEIR THOUGHTS CLEAR.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
THE MOST FITTING VISION
 OF OUR NATURE IS IN THE

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
CENTRAL MESA REGIONS:
 THERE THE VEGETATION

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
IS TIMID AND HERALDIC,
 THE COUNTRYSIDE ORGANIZED,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
THE ATMOSPHERE ONE OF
 EXCESSIVE SPOTLESSNESS,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
IN WHICH THE COLORS
 THEMSELVES DROWN,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
COMPENSATING THE GENERAL
 HARMONY OF THE PICTURE;

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
THE LUMINOUS ETHER IN
 WHICH THINGS MOVE FORWARD

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
ON THEIR OWN TERMS.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
IN HIS INVESTIGATION OF
HIS CULTURE'S INDIGENOUS

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
HERITAGE, ALFONSO REYES
MINED CLASSIC TEXTS THAT

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
CHRONICLED THE HISTORY OF
LATIN AMERICA,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
INCLUDING HERNAN CORTES'S
 LETTERS FROM MEXICO,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
AND THE TRUE HISTORY OF
 THE CONQUEST OF NEW SPAIN

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
BY ANOTHER CONQUISTADOR,
BERNAL DIAZ DEL CASTILLO.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
REACHING BEYOND MEXICO
CITY TO ITS AZTEC

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
PREDECESSOR, THE ANCIENT
CITY OF TENOCHTITLAN,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
REYES DESCRIBED
A VIBRANT METROPOLIS

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
OF CONSTANT MOVEMENT.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
HE SKETCHED A PORTRAIT
WITH THE MINUTE DETAILS

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
OF DAILY LIFE,
THE SOUNDS OF THE CITY,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
THE CUSTOMS
OF THE PEOPLE.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
THE FIGURE OF ALFONSO
REYES IS INDISPENSABLE

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
NOT ONLY TO THE HISTORY
OF MEXICAN LITERATURE,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
BUT ALSO TO THE
CONTINENT'S LITERATURE.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
BECAUSE HE'S A MAN
WHO BELONGED TO

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
THE ATENEO GENERATION.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AND HE REALLY, THANKS IN
LARGE PART TO HIS FIRST

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
MENTOR PEDRO HENRIQUEZ
URENA, HAD A VERY

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
BROAD EDUCATION, A
VERY WIDE-RANGING ONE.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
REYES POSSESSED AN
EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
TO BRING THE WORLD OF
INDIGENOUS AMERICANS

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
TO LIFE, AND HIS WORK
SHED LIGHT ON AN ENTIRELY

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
NEW WAY OF READING
THE AMERICAN ARCHIVE.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
THIS FRESH
VISION OF HISTORY

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
WOULD FUEL THE POST
WORLD WAR II EXPLOSION

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
OF LITERARY OUTPUT
IN LATIN AMERICA.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THE PHENOMENON CAME TO
BE KNOWN AS "THE BOOM",

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
AND WAS REPRESENTED
BY AUTHORS SUCH AS

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
CARLOS FUENTES,
GABRIEL GARCIA MARQUEZ,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
AND MARIO VARGAS LLOSA,
AMONG MANY OTHERS.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
THIS NEW VISION OF LOCAL
CULTURE WAS PART OF A

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
LARGER REASSESSMENT OF
LATIN AMERICAN IDENTITY

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THAT WOULD
EVENTUALLY ENCOMPASS

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
THE ENTIRE CONTINENT.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
IN THIS PERIOD OF
REFLECTION THERE AROSE

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
"POESIA NEGRA",
OR "BLACK POETRY".

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THIS FORM
SYNTHESIZED ELEMENTS

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
OF BLACK AND
WHITE CULTURE

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
WHILE DESCRIBING BOTH
THE JOYS AND THE AGONY

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
OF THE AFRICAN
EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
THE CUBAN POET NICOLAS
GUILLEN EXPERIMENTED

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
WITH METER AND FORM TO
REPLICATE THE RHYTHMS

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
OF A FOLK MUSIC
KNOWN AS "SON"

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
FROM THE
ISLAND OF HISPANIOLA.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT NICOLAS GUILLEN'S

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
POETRY IS THAT IT
DOESN'T TREAT BLACKS

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
OR BEING BLACK AS AN ISSUE
IN HIS POETIC LITERATURE,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
BUT AS A VOICE...

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
AND THIS IS
A HUGE LEAP.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
WHEN NICOLAS GUILLEN
WRITES A POEM AND SAYS,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
"TAMBA, TAMBA, TAMBA,
TAMBA, TAMBA DEL NEGRO

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
QUE TUMBA; TUMBA DEL
NEGRO, CARAMBA, CARAMBA,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
QUE EL NEGRO TUMBA".

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
THE BLACK PERSON ISN'T
JUST A PRESENCE,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
AN OBJECT OF STUDY,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
AS IT HAD BEEN MANY
TIMES FOR FOLKLORISTS.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
BUT HERE IT'S A VOICE.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
AND THAT VOICE IS
REALLY VERY IMPORTANT.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
THE NON-FICTION ESSAY HAD
ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPORTANT

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000
COMPONENT OF LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
WRITERS SUCH AS OCTAVIO
PAZ AND SAMUEL RAMOS

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
IN MEXICO,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
AS WELL AS THE DOMINICAN
PEDRO HENRIQUEZ URENA

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
BREATHED FRESH
LIFE INTO THE GENRE.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
URENA WANTED TO USE
LITERATURE AS A PRISM

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
FOR BREAKING OUT THE
MEANING OF THE TERM

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
'LATIN AMERICAN',
AND OFFERED UP

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
A SERIES OF
THEORETICAL APPROACHES.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
HIS BOOK LITERARY CURRENTS
 IN HISPANIC AMERICA

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
DESCRIBED THE VARIOUS
IDENTITIES THAT

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE HAD PRODUCED,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
AND ATTEMPTED TO
RESCUE FROM OBLIVION

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
THE LANGUAGE OF THE
MESTIZO CULTURE.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
THE LITERARY
ORIENTATION OF THE TIME

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
IS ROMANTICISM.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
ROMANTICISM PROPOSED
TO EACH NATION,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
THE CREATION OF
THEIR OWN STYLE,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
SUSTAINED BY
THEIR TRADITIONS.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THIS WAS THE TENDENCY
OF THE YOUNG WRITERS

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
OF THE RIO
DE LA PLATA,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
AND THE REST OF THE
SPANISH AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
IF THEIR COMMITMENT
WAS SOMEHOW NOT ENOUGH,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
IT WAS BECAUSE A STYLE
IS NOT EASILY DEVELOPED

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
WHEN LED BY WILL.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
AS FAR AS THEMES GO,
WE COULD SAY THAT

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
THEY UNDERTOOK A
METHODIC EXPLORATION

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
OF THEIR OWN LANDS: THE
LANDSCAPES, FROM THE

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
INACCESSIBLE CORDILLERA
TO THE ENDLESS FLATLANDS;

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
THE INDIGENOUS TRADITION,
THE COLONIAL TRADITION,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
AND BETWEEN THEM, THE
COLLISION OF CONQUEST.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
THE CULTURAL ESSAY
QUICKLY BECAME CENTRAL

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
TO RETELLING LATIN
AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
THE GENRE GOT A
SUBSTANTIAL BOOST

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
FROM THE ARGENTINEAN
EZEQUIEL MARTINEZ ESTRADA,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
AN ESSAYIST KNOWN
FOR HIS EXUBERANT

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
AND EMPHATIC PROSE.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
THROUGH THE UNFOLDING
DIALECTIC OF HISTORY,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
HE SOUGHT OUT THE REASONS
FOR THE AMERICAN PRESENT

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
IN THE AMERICAN PAST.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
MARTINEZ ESTRADA WROTE
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
NIETZSCHE, MONTAIGNE, AND
KAFKA, AND EXAMINED THE

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
THEMES OF "CIVILIZATION"
VERSUS "BARBARISM" THAT

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
HAD BEEN FIRST PUT FORTH
BY THE INFLUENTIAL WRITER

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
DOMINGO FAUSTINO
SARMIENTO.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
THIS FRAMEWORK OF CHANGE
AND EXPERIMENTATION

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
GAVE RISE TO WRITERS
WHO PREFIGURED

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
THE LATIN
AMERICAN BOOM.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
THESE WERE
SOLITARY VOICES,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
WRITERS IN SEARCH
OF AN IDENTITY.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
PERHAPS THE MOST MARGINAL
OF THEM ALL, SET APART

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
FROM MODERNISM AND THE
VANGUARDS OF THE EARLY

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
TWENTIETH CENTURY, WAS
THE ARGENTINEAN NOVELIST,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
PLAYWRIGHT, AND SHORT
STORY WRITER ROBERTO ARLT.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
ARLT MAKES A BREAK WITH
ROMANTICISM AND HIS

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
WRITING COMES TO BE
POPULATED WITH METAPHORS

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
THAT COME FROM THE WORLD
OF TECHNOLOGY, FROM THE

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
20'S, FROM TECHNOLOGY AND
FROM SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
SO ARLT'S IMAGINATION
IS POPULATED BY

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
ALL THE TRAPPINGS
OF MODERNITY.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
THERE ARE VERY
FEW REFERENCES

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
BACK TO THE PAST.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
ARLT'S FIRST NOVEL, THE
 ANGRY TOY, FROM 1926,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
WAS DEDICATED TO
FELLOW ARGENTINE

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
AND GAUCHO AUTHOR
RICARDO GUIRALDES.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
ITS ADOLESCENT
PROTAGONIST,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
SILVIO ASTIER, HAILS FROM
HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
DESPITE HIS LOW BIRTH,
SILVIO CUTS A HEROIC FIGURE

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
- HE'S ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
FOR WHOM EVERYTHING
SEEMS TO COME EASILY.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
ARLT'S COMING-OF-AGE
STORY WAS BASED ON A

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
SERIALIZED NOVEL ENTITLED
 THEEXPLOITS OF ROCAMBOLE

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
BY THE FRENCH
GOTHIC WRITER

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
PIERRE ALEXIS
PONSON DU TERRAIL.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
ADOPTING PONSON DU
TERRAIL'S FANCIFUL

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
AND ADVENTUROUS
STYLE ENABLED ARLT

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
TO FASHION A TALE BOTH
CYNICAL AND FANTASTICAL.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
HIS NOVEL IS AN ESCAPE
FROM THE DAILY GRIND

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
THAT ALSO DOUBLES AS
POINTED COMMENTARY.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
THE ANGRY TOY ELICITED
IMPASSIONED PRAISE FROM

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
THE YOUNG INTELLECTUALS OF
THE ERA, WHO WERE QUICK TO

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
CONTRAST IT WITH THE WORK
OF OLD GUARD WRITERS

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
SUCH AS LEOPOLDO LUGONES,
MANUEL GALVEZ,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
AND EVEN
HORACIO QUIROGA,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
A PROGENITOR OF
MAGICAL REALISM.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
MEANWHILE, ARLT DEDICATED
HIMSELF TO JOURNALISM,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
PUBLISHING HIS DAILY COLUMN
"BUENOS AIRES ETCHINGS"

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
IN THE NEWSPAPER EL
 MUNDO, A PLATFORM THAT

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
PROVIDED HIM WITH A
WIDE PUBLIC READERSHIP.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THIS FORUM ALSO ENABLED
ARLT TO LEGITIMIZE

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
A MORE COLLOQUIAL APPROACH
TO LANGUAGE, WITHIN THE

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
CONTEXT OF THE INCREASED
PROFESSIONALIZATION OF

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
WRITING WHICH WAS TAKING
PLACE IN THE THIRTIES.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
MY EDITOR HAS ASKED ME NOT
TO USE THE WORD "BERRETIN"

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[PIGHEADEDNESS] BECAUSE
THE NEWSPAPER GOES TO

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
FAMILIES, AND THE WORD
BERRETIN MIGHT SOUND

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
BAD TO THEM, BUT I
RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
PERMISSION FROM THE LADIES
OF THE HOUSE TO USE THE

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
SWEET AND MELLIFLUOUS
WORD BERRETIN TODAY.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
THE CITY, RIFE WITH
CONTRADICTIONS AND THE

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
DISPLACED MODERNITY
OF THE CONTINENT,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
IS OMNIPRESENT IN
ALL OF ARLT'S FICTION.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
IT IS EVEN AN AGENT IN THE
ACT OF CREATION ITSELF.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
ARLT PENNED HIS NOVELS
 THE SEVEN MADMEN,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
THE FLAMETHROWERS, AND
 LOVE, THE MAGICIAN

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
IN THE DINGY BARS
AND POVERTY-STRICKEN

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
BOARDING HOUSES OF
CENTRAL BUENOS AIRES.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
THE PACE AND INTENSITY
OF ARLT'S WORK

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
DAMAGED HIS HEALTH,
AND HE DIED YOUNG,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
ON JULY 26TH, 1942.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
THE LAST ARTICLE HE
WROTE WAS ENTITLED

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
"THE LANDSCAPE
OF THE CLOUDS".

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
IN POSTERITY HE HAS BECOME
A GALVANIZING FIGURE,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
ONE WHO MITIGATES THE
CLASS-CONSCIOUS BIAS

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
OF EARLY TWENTIETH
CENTURY LITERATURE

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
AND RETURNS LITERATURE
TO THE PEOPLE.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000
ARLT IS AN IMMIGRANT,
THE CHILD OF POVERTY WHO

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
NONETHELESS HAS ACCESS TO
OPPORTUNITY IN ARGENTINA,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
WHICH IS CONSTANTLY
GROWING.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
HE'S A WRITER WHO CHOOSES
TO TURN HIS BACK ON

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
AESTHETIC INVESTIGATION,
IN ONE SENSE.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
AND IN ANOTHER SENSE, HE
TAKES IN AS MUCH AS HE CAN.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
BUT IT'S A WILD
PLACE, A NAIVE PLACE.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY
WAS AN ERA OF LARGE-SCALE

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
MIGRATORY CURRENTS
THAT FOREVER ALTERED

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
THE FACE OF LATIN
AMERICAN CITIES.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
THIS PROCESS OF CHANGE
ALSO FORCED A REASSESSMENT

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
OF PROBLEMATIC ISSUES
THAT HAD PERSISTED SINCE

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES
GAINED INDEPENDENCE

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
FROM THEIR COLONIAL
OVERLORDS; ISSUES LIKE

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
WHAT CONSTITUTES A
"NATIONAL LANGUAGE,"

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
WHAT A CULTURE CAN
CLAIM TO BE ITS OWN,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
AND HOW TO RESPOND

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
WHEN DISPARATE
CULTURES COME TOGETHER.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
THESE TENSIONS APPLIED
CONSTANT PRESSURE

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
ON CULTURAL AND SOCIAL
INSTITUTIONS - TENSIONS

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
WHICH WERE PLAYED OUT
PARTICULARLY IN THE SCHOOLS,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
WHERE PERSONAL IDENTITY
IS OFTEN LEARNED

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF
THE LARGER COMMUNITY.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
ARLT'S LITERATURE LAID
BARE THE CONTRADICTIONS,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
TRANSFORMATIONS,
AND INSTABILITY

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
THAT DEFINED HIS TIMES.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IN STARK CONTRAST
STANDS LEOPOLDO LUGONES,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
THE ARGENTINEAN
WRITER AND CRITIC

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
WHO CAME TO BE KNOWN AS
A CUSTODIAN OF LANGUAGE.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
IN THIS ROLE, HE LAID
CLAIM TO A NOTION OF

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
NATIONHOOD AND
NATIONAL LANGUAGE

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
THAT SPRANG FROM
THE MYTHIC IMAGE

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
OF THE RUGGED,
COW-HERDING GAUCHOS.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
LUGONES INSCRIBED NATIONAL
HISTORY AND LITERATURE

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
ONTO THE
RURAL LANDSCAPE,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
IMAGINATIVELY
LINKING THE ILIAD

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
WITH MARTIN FIERRO,
THE FAMOUS EPIC POEM

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
BY THE ARGENTINE
WRITER JOSE HERNANDEZ.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
LUGONES PUT FORTH HIS
IDEAS IN A SERIES OF

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
MASTERFUL LECTURES,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
COLLECTED IN HIS
CELEBRATED VOLUME

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
EL PAYADOR.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
AND THEN THERE CAME
JORGE LUIS BORGES.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
BORN IN 1899 IN BUENOS
AIRES, BORGES WOULD BECOME

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
ONE OF THE FOREMOST
LITERARY FIGURES

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
OF THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
A WIDE-RANGING
WRITER AND CRITIC,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
HE TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF
TO DISTINGUISH THE

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
NATIONAL VOICE FROM
ITS CREOLE REFERENT.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
IN HIS BOOK THE SIZE OF MY
 HOPE, PUBLISHED IN 1926,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
HE WROTE IN CRYPTIC TERMS
ABOUT HIS UNDERTAKING

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
AS A WRITER.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
BROTHER MOCHO AND HIS
 SUCCESSOR FELIX LIMA

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
ARE THE ORDINARINESS
 DISCUSSED IN THE SUBURB;

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
EVARISTO CARRIEGO,
 THE SADNESS OF HIS

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
DISINCLINATION
 AND BREAKDOWN.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
AFTERWARDS I CAME
 (AS LONG AS I LIVE,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
 SOMEONE TO PRAISE ME)

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
AND I SAID BEFORE
 ANYONE, NOT THE FATES,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
BUT THE LANDSCAPE OF
 THE OUTLYING AREAS:

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
THE GROCERY STORE PINK LIKE
 A CLOUD, THE ALLEYWAYS.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
ROBERTO ARLT AND
 JOSE TALLON ARE THE

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
SHAMELESSNESS OF THE
 SUBURB, ITS FEROCITY.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
EVERY ONE OF US HAS SAID
 HIS PIECE ON THE SUBURB;

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
NO ONE HAS SAID IT
 IN ITS ENTIRETY.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
BORGES QUICKLY BECAME
A CULTURAL TOUCHPOINT

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
AS WELL AS THE
GOLD STANDARD

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
FOR LEGIONS OF
WRITERS AND READERS.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
HIS EARLY WORK WAS
MARKED BY THE INFLUENCE

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
OF ULTRAISM, THE
SPANISH-BORN MOVEMENT

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
THAT PUT ITSELF OUT AS AN
ALTERNATIVE TO MODERNISMO,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
THE DISTINCTLY LATIN
AMERICAN COMMINGLING

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
OF ROMANTIC AND
SYMBOLIST SENSIBILITIES.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
SUCCESS DID NOT
COME IMMEDIATELY;

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
BORGES HAD TO SUBSIDIZE
THE PUBLICATION

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
OF HIS FIRST BOOKS
OF POEMS HIMSELF,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
AND HE WOULD
DISTRIBUTE HIS WORKS

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
BY SNEAKING THEM IN
HIS FRIEND'S BAGS.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
HIS MOST IMPORTANT
PROFESSIONAL AND

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
INTELLECTUAL ASSOCIATION
WAS WITH VICTORIA OCAMPO

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
- INTELLECTUAL,
PATRON, AND PUBLISHER

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
OF THE FABLED REVIEW
 SUR, OR SOUTH.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
IT WAS IN ISSUE NUMBER
FIVE OF SUR THAT BORGES

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
LAID OUT A LITERARY CREDO
THAT MANY HAVE INTERPRETED

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
AS THE PRECURSOR
OF MAGICAL REALISM.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
THAT WAS NOT HIS
INTENTION, HOWEVER.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
WHAT HE'D MEANT TO
DO WAS SIMPLY TO

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
COME OUT IN OPPOSITION
TO PURE REALISM,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
AN AESTHETIC
MOVEMENT THAT WAS

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
SWEEPING
THROUGH THE ARTS

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
IN THE EARLY PART OF
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
IN THE ESSAY, ENTITLED
"NARRATIVE ART AND MAGIC",

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
BORGES DREW A
DISTINCTION BETWEEN

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
TWO PROCESSES
OF FICTION.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
THE NATURAL, WHICH IS
 THE INCESSANT RESULT OF

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
UNCONTROLLABLE AND
 INFINITE OPERATIONS;

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
AND MAGIC
 LUCID AND LIMITED,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
WHERE THE PARTICULARS
 ARE PROPHESIED.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IN THE NOVEL, I THINK
 THE ONLY POSSIBLE HONOR

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
LIES WITH THE LATTER.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
LET THE FORMER BE FOR
 PSYCHOLOGICAL SIMULATION.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
IN THE 1940'S,
BORGES TURNED OUT

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
SOME OF HIS MOST
IMPORTANT WORKS:

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
THE GARDEN OF FORKING
 PATHS IN 1941;

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
FICTIONS IN 1944,
AND THE ALEPH IN 1949.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
HIS COMPLEX WORLD VIEW -
COSMOPOLITAN YET LOW-BROW,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
POETIC YET PEDESTRIAN
- IS EXPRESSED IN LANGUAGE

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
THAT IS BOTH PRECISE
AND ONEROUS.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
IN THESE FIRST VOLUMES,
BORGES WANTS TO RECLAIM

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
THE NATIONAL STORY AND
TO REWRITE IT CONCISELY,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
A VERY SYNTHETIC
FORM, FOR POETRY.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
AND BORGES IS ALSO THE
POET OF "LA RECOLETA".

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
HE WANTS TO THINK
ABOUT DEATH.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
HOW ARGENTINE
HISTORY EVOLVES

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
AND IS SYNTHESIZED
IN A HEADSTONE.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
AND BORGES' GREAT
QUESTION IS ALWAYS:

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
HOW CAN WE, UPON
WRITING OUR NAME,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
REACH IMMORTALITY?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
AND THIS IS A
THEME FOR BORGES

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
THAT IS ALWAYS
PRESENT.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I COME NOW TO THE
 INEFFABLE CENTER

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
OF MY TALE; IT
 IS HERE THAT

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
MY WRITER'S
 HOPELESSNESS BEGINS.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
ALL LANGUAGE IS AN
 ALPHABET OF SYMBOLS

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
WHOSE USE ASSUMES A PAST
 SHARED BY ITS INTERLOCUTORS;

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
HOW CAN ONE TRANSMIT TO
 OTHERS THE INFINITE ALEPH,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
WHICH MY TIMOROUS MEMORY
 CAN BARELY CONTAIN?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
BORGES BREATHED NEW LIFE
INTO THE FANTASY GENRE.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
HE IMBUED IT
WITH METAPHYSICS,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
AND GRANTED FANTASY
NEW COORDINATES

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
THAT ALTERED NOT ONLY THE
WAY THE GENRE WAS WRITTEN

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
BUT ALSO THE
WAY IT WAS READ.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
THE LABYRINTHINE GAMES
AND THE MYSTICAL SLANT

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
OF HIS BEST-KNOWN STORIES
WERE HIGHLY ORIGINAL

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
AND WIDELY INFLUENTIAL.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
SOME CRITICS HAVE GONE SO
FAR AS TO CLAIM THAT HIS

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
FICTION ALTERED THE REALITY
OF LITERATURE ITSELF.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
YET BORGES HIMSELF
INSISTED THAT

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
HIS TRUE AMBITIONS
WERE MODEST.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I DO NOT WRITE FOR
 A SELECT MINORITY,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
WHICH MEANS NOTHING
 TO ME, NOR FOR THAT

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
ADULATED PLATONIC ENTITY
 KNOWN AS 'THE MASSES'.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
BOTH ABSTRACTIONS, SO
 DEAR TO THE DEMAGOGUE,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I DISBELIEVE IN.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I WRITE FOR MYSELF
 AND FOR MY FRIENDS,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
AND I WRITE TO EASE
 THE PASSING OF TIME.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
BORGES WAS LINKED WITH A
GROUP OF WRITERS KNOWN AS

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
THE "MARTINFIERRISTAS",
SO NAMED BECAUSE

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
THEY WERE OFTEN
FEATURED IN THE PAGES

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
OF THE LITERARY
JOURNAL MARTIN FIERRO.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
HOWEVER, IN THE
POLITICAL REALM,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
HE FOUND HIMSELF
DEEPLY ISOLATED.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
LOOMING OVER HIS CAREER
WAS THE COMMANDING FIGURE

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
OF JUAN DOMINGO PERON, THE
POPULIST ARGENTINE LEADER

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
WHOM BORGES
STRONGLY DENOUNCED.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
ACCORDING TO THE
EMINENT CRITIC

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
EMIR RODRIGUEZ
MONEGAL,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
THE VERY CHARACTER
OF BORGES' WRITING

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
CHANGED DURING THE
PERON GOVERNMENT.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
THE MYTHICAL ELEMENT OF
BUENOS AIRES DRAINED OUT

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
OF HIS STORIES, AND THE
COLORFUL CHARACTERS AND

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
VIVID LOCATIONS WERE
NOWHERE TO BE FOUND.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
WHAT I FIND INTERESTING
IN BORGES' EVOLUTION,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
BEYOND HIS PROSE AND POETRY,
IS THAT HIS FIRST TEXTS

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
HAVE TO DO WITH THE
POOR NEIGHBORHOODS,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
WITH THE GAUCHOS, WITH
THE BUENOS AIRES SUBURBS.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
STORIES LIKE "THE MAN
FROM THE PINK CORNER".

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
THE "MILONGAS"
THAT BORGES WROTE,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
THE "MILONGA DE
JACINTO CHICLANA"

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
TO THE POINT WHERE HE
HIMSELF RECOGNIZES

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
THAT THOSE TEXTS
DIDN'T SATISFY HIM

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
COMPLETELY AND
THAT, IN A WAY,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
THAT "FAMOUS BORGES"
HAD APPROPRIATED THEM

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
AND HE HAD TO COME
UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
THE CLASSIC BORGES STORY
WAS A MIX OF MALICE

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
AND LITERARY MASTERY
THAT UNITED HIGH ART

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
WITH POPULAR CULTURE.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
HIS BEAUTIFULLY WROUGHT
TALES OF TROUBLEMAKERS

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
AND NE'ER-DO-WELLS
TRANSCEND THEIR PARTICULARS

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
AND JOIN THE PANTHEON
OF WORLD LITERATURE.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
YET HE TOOK PAINS TO
SQUARELY PLACE HIS WORK

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
IN THE CONTEXT OF A
SPECIFIC TIME AND PLACE

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
THROUGH ESSAYS SUCH AS

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
THE ARGENTINE WRITER
 AND TRADITION,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
OR THE LANGUAGE
 OF THE ARGENTINES.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
HIS ESSAYS DWELT IN
THE METAPHYSICAL,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
AS IN HIS BOOK
 ON ETERNITY.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE,
BORGES WAS A PHILOSOPHER

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
OF LANGUAGE.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
HE WAS A PHILOSOPHER
OF EXPRESSION,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
AND OF ITS
IMPOSSIBILITY.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
AND THAT BORGES
IS THE ONE THAT

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
GIVES RISE TO THE
OTHER THAT WE KNOW,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
THAT MIX OF HIGH AND LOW
CULTURE THAT IS SORT OF

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
A PREVIEW OF WHAT WE NOW
CALL CULTURAL STUDIES.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
BECAUSE HE DOES NOT
MAKE A MONSTROSITY

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
LIKE SOME OTHER HYBRIDS.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
WHAT HE DOES IS
DEMONSTRATE HOW ONE THING,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
IF YOU TWIST IT JUST A
BIT, CAN BECOME ANOTHER.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
AND YET, AND YET...

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
DENYING TEMPORAL
 SUCCESSION,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
DENYING THE SELF, DENYING
 THE ASTRONOMICAL UNIVERSE,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
ARE OBVIOUS ACTS
 OF DESPERATION

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
AND SECRET CONSOLATION.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
OUR FATE (UNLIKE THE
 HELL OF SWEDENBORG

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
OR THE HELL OF
 TIBETAN MYTHOLOGY)

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
IS NOT FRIGHTFUL
 BECAUSE IT IS UNREAL;

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
IT IS FRIGHTFUL BECAUSE IT
 IS IRREVERSIBLE AND IRONCLAD.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
TIME IS THE THING
 I AM MADE OF.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
TIME IS A RIVER THAT
 SWEEPS ME ALONG,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
BUT I AM THE RIVER;

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
IT IS A TIGER
 THAT TEARS ME APART,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
BUT I AM THE TIGER;

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
IT IS A FIRE
 THAT CONSUMES ME,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
BUT I AM THE FIRE.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
THE WORLD,
 UNFORTUNATELY, IS REAL;

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
I, UNFORTUNATELY,
 AM BORGES.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
JUST AS LONG-FORM FICTION
WAS REVITALIZED BY THE

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
ADVENT OF THE MEXICAN
REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
SO WAS LATIN AMERICAN
POETRY POINTED IN A

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
NEW DIRECTION DURING THE
MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
IN THIS CASE, IT WAS
AT THE HANDS OF THE

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
MAGNIFICENT MEXICAN POET,
ESSAYIST, AND INTELLECTUAL

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
OCTAVIO PAZ.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
THE SOURCES
OF INSPIRATION

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
FOR HIS EARLY
POEMS VARIED WIDELY,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
FROM MARXISM, SURREALISM,
AND EXISTENTIALISM,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
TO THE BUDDHIST AND HINDU
RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
HE WAS, HOWEVER, A
REVOLUTIONARY TO THE

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
CORE OF HIS BEING,
AS HE FAMOUSLY ATTESTED

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
IN HIS STUDY OF
MEXICAN IDENTITY,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
ENTITLED THE
 LABYRINTH OF SOLITUDE.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
IT IS THE REVOLUTION,
 THE MAGICAL WORD,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
THE WORD THAT WILL
 CHANGE IT ALL AND

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
THAT WILL GIVE US A GREAT
 JOY AND A QUICK DEATH.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
FOR THE REVOLUTION THE
 MEXICAN PEOPLE BECOME

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
LOST IN THOUGHT,
 IN THEIR PAST

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
AND IN THEIR ESSENCE, TO
 EXTRACT THEIR FILIATION

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
FROM THEIR PRIVATE
 LIFE, FROM THEIR CORE.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
PAZ WAS BORN INTO
TURBULENT TIMES,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
AND REVOLUTION CONTINUED
TO DEFINE MEXICO

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
THROUGHOUT HIS LIFETIME.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT
LAZARO CARDENAS,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
WHO SERVED FROM
1934 THROUGH 1940,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
GAVE NEW MOMENTUM TO
THE CYCLE OF CHANGE.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
HE IMPLEMENTED AGRARIAN
REFORM, CREATED LABOR AND

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
PEASANT ORGANIZATIONS, AND
PROMOTED PUBLIC EDUCATION.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
PAZ HIMSELF
EXPANDED HIS HORIZONS,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
TRAVELING TO SPAIN
TO PARTICIPATE

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
IN A CONGRESS OF
ANTI-FASCIST WRITERS.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
HE LATER WAS ONE OF THE
FOUNDERS OF THE JOURNAL,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
TALLER, OR WORKSHOP,
AND HE TRAVELED TO

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
THE UNITED STATES ON A
GUGGENHEIM FELLOWSHIP.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
HE BECAME DEEPLY
DISCOURAGED

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
BY A SERIES OF
DARK EVENTS:

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
HITLER TAKING
CONTROL IN GERMANY;

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
STALIN'S CONSOLIDATION
OF POWER IN THE USSR;

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
THE OUTBREAK OF THE
SPANISH CIVIL WAR,

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
AND THE ASSASSINATION OF
THE EXILED SOVIET COMMUNIST

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
LEON TROTSKY.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
PAZ DESCRIBED HIS
POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
IN THE LABYRINTH
 OF SOLITUDE.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
BETWEEN 1930 AND 1940,
 AS MUCH IN EUROPE AS IN

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
AMERICA, MOST OF US THEN
 YOUNG WRITERS FELT A GREAT

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
SYMPATHY FOR THE RUSSIAN
 REVOLUTION AND COMMUNISM.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
OUR ATTITUDE WAS A
 MIXTURE OF GOOD FEELINGS,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION
 AT THE INJUSTICES

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
THAT SURROUNDED US,
 AND IGNORANCE.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
MY DOUBTS
 BEGAN IN 1939,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
WITH THE SIGNING OF THE
 GERMAN-SOVIET PACT.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
THE DOUBTS WERE
 TRANSFORMED INTO CRITICISM.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
MANY LEFTIST
INTELLECTUALS OF THE TIME

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
REJECTED PAZ'S DENUNCIATION
OF FAR LEFT POLITICS.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
HOWEVER, IN BUENOS
AIRES HIS POSITION WAS

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
WELL RECEIVED BY JOSE
BIANCO AND VICTORIA OCAMPO.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
THEY PUBLISHED THE
 LABYRINTH OF SOLITUDE

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
IN THE JOURNAL
 SUR IN 1951,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
BOTH AS A PIECE OF
POLITICAL LITERATURE

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
AND FOR ITS INHERENT
AESTHETIC VALUE.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
AS HIS POEMS BEGAN TO
CIRCULATE THROUGHOUT

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
THE CONTINENT, PAZ
BECAME THE CHAMPION

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
OF A NEW, EROTICIZED
STRAIN OF VERSE.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
INFLUENCED BY WRITERS SUCH
AS THE MARQUIS DE SADE

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
AND THE FRENCH SURREALIST
GEORGES BATAILLE,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
HIS WORK EXUDED A RAW
SENSUALITY WHICH HE

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
CLOTHED IN THE IMAGERY
OF MEXICAN MYTHOLOGY.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
THIS SENSIBILITY OPENED
THE WAY FOR AN INFUSION

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
OF FAR EASTERN
THEMES INTO HIS WORK.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
PAZ HAD BEEN AN AVID
STUDENT OF BUDDHIST AND

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
TAOIST THOUGHT BEFORE
SETTING OFF ON EXTENDED

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
TOURS TO INDIA AND JAPAN
AS A MEXICAN DIPLOMAT.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
THESE INFLUENCES
BROUGHT ADDED TEXTURE

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
AND COLORATION
TO HIS VERSES.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
IT RAINED.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
THE HOUR IS AN
 ENORMOUS EYE.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
INSIDE IT, WE COME AND
 GO LIKE REFLECTIONS.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
THE RIVER OF MUSIC
 ENTERS MY BLOOD.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
IF I SAY "BODY",
 IT ANSWERS "WIND".

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
IF I SAY "EARTH",
 IT ANSWERS "WHERE?"

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
THE WORLD, A DOUBLE
 BLOSSOM, OPENS:

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
SADNESS OF HAVING COME,
 JOY OF BEING HERE.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
I WALK LOST IN
 MY OWN CENTER.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
ANOTHER LATIN AMERICAN
POET WHO DID NOT

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
SHY AWAY FROM
EROTIC THEMES

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
WAS THE CHILEAN
WRITER PABLO NERUDA.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
BORN IN 1904, BY THE AGE
OF TWENTY HE PUBLISHED

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
AN INTENSELY EROTIC
BOOK OF POEMS CALLED

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
TWENTY LOVE POEMS AND
 A SONG OF DESPAIR.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
THE BOOK WAS AN
INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
BY THE 1930'S

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
HE HAD CONQUERED
THE LITERARY WORLD.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
IN 1936 HIS MORE MATURE AND
AMBITIOUS BOOK OF POEMS,

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
RESIDENCE ON EARTH,
OFFERED DEFINITIVE PROOF

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
THAT NERUDA WAS ONE OF
THE WORLD'S GREATEST

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
CONTEMPORARY POETS.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
THIS WAS A TIME
OF GREAT UPHEAVAL

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
IN THE
SPANISH-SPEAKING WORLD.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
THE SPANISH CIVIL
WAR BROKE OUT AND,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE
SPANISH PLAYWRIGHT AND POET

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
FEDERICO GARCIA LORCA
WAS ASSASSINATED.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
NERUDA TRAVELED TO SPAIN
TO RAISE MONEY AND SUPPORT

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
FOR THE REPUBLICANS, AND
WROTE SPAIN IN MY HEART

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
AS AN EXPRESSION
OF SOLIDARITY.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
WITH THE ENGLISH WRITER
AND POLITICAL ACTIVIST

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
NANCY CUNARD, HE FOUNDED
A MAGAZINE CALLED

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
THE POETS OF THE WORLD
 DEFEND THE SPANISH PEOPLE.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
IN 1939, HE PUT OUT A
BOOK OF POEMS ENTITLED

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
FURIES AND SORROWS.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
BUT IN ANY CASE, THE
OBJECT OF HIS WORKS IS

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:50.000
CLEARLY PEOPLE, ATTITUDES
THAT ARE DIFFERENT.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
THERE'S A PROPHETIC NATURE
TO NERUDA'S POETRY.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
HE REALLY PUTS OUT THERE
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:09.000
HE REALLY PUTS OUT THERE
ALL THE POSSIBILITIES,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
THE RICHNESS
OF THE LANGUAGE.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000
KEEPING IN MIND
THE MUSICALITY,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000
HOW REPETITION
REVERBERATES.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
NERUDA IS A POET
WHO DISCOUNTS

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
THE PERUVIAN POET,
CESAR VALLEJO,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
WAS BORN IN A REMOTE VILLAGE
IN THE ANDES OF PERU,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
THE YOUNGEST OF
11 CHILDREN.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
IN 1922 HE PUBLISHED A BOOK
OF POEMS CALLED TRILCE,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
WHICH ESTABLISHED
HIM AS ONE OF THE

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
PREEMINENT POETIC VOICES
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
HE BECAME DEEPLY INVOLVED
IN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:08.000
AND IN 1930 PUBLISHED SPAIN,
 TAKE THIS CUP FROM ME.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
CHILDREN OF THE EARTH,
 IF SPAIN FALLS,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I SAY IT'S A MANNER
 OF SPEAKING -

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
IF THERE SHOULD FALL
 DOWN FROM THE SKY

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
HER FOREARM, WHICH IS
 SEIZED AND PULLED ALONG

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
BY TWO
 EARTH-FORGED PLATES;

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
CHILDREN, WHAT AN AGE
 OF SUNKEN TEMPLES!

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
HOW EARLY IN THE SUN
 WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU!

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
HOW SOON WITHIN YOUR
 BREAST THE ANCIENT CLAMOR!

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
HOW OLD YOUR TWO
 IN THE QUARTO.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
CHILDREN OF THE EARTH,
 HERE IS MOTHER SPAIN

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
WITH HER BELLY
 ON HER BACK!

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
HERE IS OUR TEACHER
 WITH HER YARDSTICK,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
SHE IS MOTHER AND TEACHER,
 CROSS AND TIMBER,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
BECAUSE SHE GAVE
 YOU THE HEIGHT,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
VERTIGO AND DIVISION
 AND SUM, CHILDREN,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
IT'S UP TO HER,
 FATHERS OF DUE PROCESS.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
IF SHE FALLS - I SAY, IT'S
 A MANNER OF SPEAKING -

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
IF SPAIN FALLS, FROM
 THE EARTH DOWNWARDS,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
CHILDREN! HOW YOU ARE
 GOING TO STOP GROWING!

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
IN THE PERIOD BEFORE THE
BOOM IN LATIN AMERICAN

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
LITERATURE, THE FIELD
OF CULTURAL PRODUCTION

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
WAS INTENSELY FOCUSED
ON DEFINING THE ROLE

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
AND MEANING OF
STORY TELLING.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
WHILE POETRY TYPICALLY SET
THE CULTURAL COURSE OF THE

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
CONTINENT, THIS PERIOD SAW
AN EXPLOSION OF INTEREST

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
IN THE ROLE OF NARRATIVE IN
DEFINING REGIONAL IDENTITY,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
CLASS IDENTITY,
AND LANGUAGE.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
THESE ISSUES WERE GIVEN
SHAPE BY THE URUGUAYAN

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
LITERARY CRITIC ANGEL
RAMA IN HIS BOOK

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
NARRATIVES OF
 TRANSCULTURATION,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
IN WHICH HE CALLS FOR THE
ALIGNMENT OF LITERATURE

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
WITH LARGER SOCIAL AND
HISTORICAL FACTORS.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
FOR RAMA, POLITICS, PROSE,
AND THE PROBLEMS THAT

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
DEFINED LATIN AMERICA WERE
ALL INEXTRICABLY LINKED.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
HE PLUMBED THE WORK OF
THE CUBAN ANTHROPOLOGIST

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
FERNANDO ORTIZ, WHO HAD
REINTERPRETED THE DYNAMICS

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
OF SOCIAL CONTACT AND
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
IN HIS FAMOUS ESSAY

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
CUBAN COUNTERPOINT
 OF TOBACCO AND SUGAR.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
RAMA USED THE TERM
"NARRATIVE TRANSCULTURATORS"

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:28.000
TO IDENTIFY WRITERS WHO
SYNTHESIZED ELEMENTS

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
FROM FAMILIAR AND
FOREIGN CULTURES.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
THESE ARE THE WRITERS
WHO MAKE A CAREER OUT OF

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
STEPPING OUTSIDE
THEMSELVES,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
AND LOOKING BACK AT THEIR
WORLD AS A BEMUSED OUTSIDER.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:51.000
THE PERUVIAN
ANTHROPOLOGIST AND WRITER

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
JOSE MARIA ARGUEDAS, HAD
ONE FOOT IN WHITE CULTURE

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
AND THE OTHER IN THE
TRADITIONAL WORLD

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
OF THE QUECHUA INDIANS.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
HE ATTEMPTED TO
CREATE WHAT HE CALLED

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
"THE OPERA OF THE POOR",
WHICH PORTRAYED SOCIETY

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
EXACTLY AS HE
EXPERIENCED IT.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
YET HE WAS CONFRONTED
WITH ENORMOUS CHALLENGES:

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
HOW DO YOU TRANSCRIBE THE
WORLDVIEW OF MARGINALIZED

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
CULTURES INTO THE IDIOM OF
THE MAINSTREAM CULTURE?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
HOW DO YOU LITERALLY
AND METAPHORICALLY

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
TRANSLATE THE LANGUAGE
OF SUBORDINATION

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
INTO THE LANGUAGE OF THE
DOMINANT SOCIAL FORCE?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
THESE CHALLENGES
ALSO CONFRONTED THE

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
CUBAN NOVELIST ALEJO
CARPENTIER, WHO NARRATED

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
THE EXPERIENCE OF
AFRO-AMERICAN CULTURE

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
IN A DISTINCTLY BAROQUE
LITERARY VOICE.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
AS SUCH, CARPENTIER
IS OFTEN CITED AS A

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
HERALD OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN BOOM.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
I WOULDN'T SAY CARPENTIER'S
WORK IS FANTASTICAL.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
AT LEAST IT DOESN'T
INTEND TO BE.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
WHAT HE INTENDS TO BE IS A
REALIST, BUT HE BELIEVES

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
THAT WHICH IS THE MAGICAL
IS A PART OF REALITY.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
CARPENTIER IS A VERY
IMPORTANT WRITER.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
IN A WAY HE GAVE
THEORETICAL FOUNDATION

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
TO WHAT WOULD LATER BE
CALLED MAGICAL REALISM,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
A PATH THAT HAS
LATER BEEN FOLLOWED

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
BY MORE AND
MORE WRITERS.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
HIS AESTHETIC THEORY OF
"LO REAL MARAVILLOSO" -

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
"THE MARVELOUS REAL" -
HAS BEEN INTERPRETED

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
BY MANY CRITICS AS
ONE OF THE ORIGINS OF

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
WHAT CAME TO BE KNOWN
AS "MAGICAL REALISM".

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000
THROUGH HIS MYTHIC AND
FANTASTICAL WRITING,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
HE BLAZED NEW TRAILS FOR
THE LATIN AMERICAN NOVEL.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
CARPENTIER DESCRIBED THE
POWER OF HIS APPROACH

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
IN THE PROLOGUE TO THE
 KINGDOM OF THIS WORLD.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
THE MARVELOUS BECOMES
 UNEQUIVOCALLY MARVELOUS

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
WHEN IT ARISES FROM
 AN UNEXPECTED CHANGE

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
IN REALITY -

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
A MIRACLE - A PRIVILEGED
 REVELATION OF REALITY,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
FROM AN UNUSUAL OR
 SINGULARLY FAVORABLE

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
ILLUMINATION OF THE
 UNNOTICED RICHES

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
OF REALITY, FROM
 AN AMPLIFICATION

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
OF THE SCALES AND
 CATEGORIES OF REALITY,

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
PERCEIVED WITH
 PECULIAR INTENSITY

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
DUE TO AN EXALTATION
 OF THE SPIRIT

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
WHICH TAKES IT TO A
 KIND OF "LIMIT STATE".

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
THIS PRESENCE AND VALIDITY
 OF THE TRULY MARVELOUS

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
WAS NOT A PRIVILEGE
 UNIQUE TO HAITI,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
BUT THE PATRIMONY
 OF ALL OF AMERICA,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
WHERE AN INVENTORY
 OF COSMOGONIES,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
FOR EXAMPLE, HAS
 YET TO BE CONDUCTED.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
THE TRULY MARVELOUS IS
 FOUND AT EVERY STEP

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
IN THE LIVES OF THE
 MEN WHO INSCRIBED DATES

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
IN THE HISTORY
 OF THE CONTINENT

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
AND WHO LEFT SURNAMES
 STILL USED TO THIS DAY.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
CARPENTIER'S STYLE
WAS HARVESTED

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
FROM THE
KALEIDOSCOPIC DIVERSITY

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN EXPERIENCE.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
HIS NOVELS AND SHORT
STORIES DEMONSTRATED

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
A PREOCCUPATION WITH
THE MUSICAL FORM,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
WITH ITS
REPETITION OF THEMES

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
AND SELF-REFERENTIAL
STRUCTURE.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
AS A JOURNALIST,
MUSICOLOGIST,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
AND ART CRITIC, HE OPENED
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
BETWEEN THE OLD
WORLD AND THE NEW.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000
CARPENTIER HAS A GOOD
MUSICAL EDUCATION.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
AND WHEN HE LIVES IN
PARIS, HE WRITES

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:23.000
A LOT OF ARTICLES ABOUT
CONTEMPORARY MUSIC,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000
INCLUDING SEVERAL
ABOUT STRAVINSKY,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
WHO WILL BE PART OF
"BAROQUE CONCERT".

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
IN THOSE UNIQUELY
AMERICAN EXPERIENCES,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
THE AFRO-AMERICAN WILL
HAVE SPECIAL IMPORTANCE,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
AS WELL AS BAROQUE
HERITAGE, WHICH CERTAINLY

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
HAD ITS IDEOLOGY AS FAR
AS AMERICA WAS CONCERNED.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
HIS FIRST NOVEL,
 PRAISED BE THE LORD!

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
WAS FIRST PUBLISHED
IN MADRID WHERE HE HAD

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
BEFRIENDED GARCIA LORCA
AND RAFAEL ALBERTI,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
THE SPANISH POET AND MEMBER
OF THE GENERATION OF 27.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
CARPENTIER RETURNED TO
CUBA IN 1933, AND IT WAS

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
UPON HIS REINTRODUCTION
TO THE NEW WORLD

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
THAT HE SAW SURREALISM
AND OLD WORLD CULTURE

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
AS CONVENTIONAL
AND UNIMAGINATIVE

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
IN COMPARISON TO HIS
NATIVE TRADITIONS.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
HE PUBLISHED THE
 KINGDOM OF THIS WORLD

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
IN MEXICO IN 1949, AND
SECURED HIS REPUTATION

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
WITH THE LOST
 STEPS IN 1953.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
IT'S VERY INTERESTING
BECAUSE FOR CARPENTIER,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
SURREALISM IS A
SIGN OF LIBERATION.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
HE HAD WRITTEN A NOVEL
THAT WAS PRACTICALLY

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
COSTUMBRISMO, OR
REALIST - ECUE-YAMBA-O!

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
HE LATER REGRETS
WRITING IT

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
WHEN HE ENCOUNTERS
SURREALISM.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
BUT THEN WHEN HE RETURNS
TO AMERICA, SURREALISM

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000
SEEMS OBSOLETE TO HIM,
ARTIFICIAL, DECADENT.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
AND SO HE BEGINS THIS
NEW ERA, AND WITH THIS

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:17.000
"MARVELOUS REALISM" YOU
GET HIS SUBSEQUENT NOVELS.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
THE GUATEMALAN WRITER AND
DIPLOMAT MIGUEL ANGEL

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
ASTURIAS ALSO PRACTICED
LITERARY TRANSCULTURATION.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
HE TURNED THE INSTABILITY
AND INJUSTICE

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
INTO A MYTHIC FICTION

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
IN WHICH THE MARVELS OF
NATURE COMMINGLE WITH THE

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
ABUSE OF POWER, WHERE THE
TELLING DETAIL BRINGS INTO

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
SHARP RELIEF THE HARSH
REALITY OF INDIGENOUS LIFE.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
HIS 1946 BOOK, THE
 PRESIDENT, IN WHICH HE

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
PORTRAYED A CARTOONISH
AND GROTESQUE DICTATOR,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
LAMPOONED THE
REPRESSIVE RULE OF

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
MANUEL ESTRADA CABRERA.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
IN IT HE COUNTERPOSED
THE FORCES OF LIGHT -

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
THE PEOPLE - WITH THE
FORCES OF DARKNESS -

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
THE DICTATOR - USING
A FAMILIAR PARADIGM

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000
FROM LATIN
AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
THE PRESIDENT IS A
BOOK OF MILITANT,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
OUTRAGED PROTEST THAT
DESCRIBES THE ATROCITIES

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
OF A DICTATORIAL REGIME
IN UNFLINCHING TERMS.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
CRUELTY, TERROR, AND
DEATH SUFFUSE THE WORK.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
HIS MYTHIC THEMES
REAPPEARED IN

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
MEN OF MAIZE
FROM 1949.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
HERE, LIGHT IS REPRESENTED
BY THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
AND DARKNESS BY
THE MEN OF MAIZE -

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
THE COLONIZERS WHO
COME TO EXPLOIT

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
THE PEASANTS' LANDS
FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
IN THIS WORK, ASTURIAS
SUCCESSFULLY JOINED

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
THE MYTHIC-MARVELOUS
APPROACH

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
WITH THE BRUTAL REALITY
OF LIFE AS AN INDIAN.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
THIS MOTIF IS
RESURRECTED IN HIS

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
BANANA PLANTATION
 TRILOGY, WHICH WAS,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
IN ESSENCE, A
LITERARY CRUSADE

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
AGAINST FOREIGN
EXPLOITATION OF GUATEMALA.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
ASTURIAS, WHO WAS AWARDED
THE 1967 NOBEL PRIZE

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
IN LITERATURE,
BELIEVED THAT,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
"THE NOVEL IS
THE ONLY MEANS OF

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
MAKING THE WORLD KNOW
THE NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
OF THE PEOPLE TO
WHICH IT BELONGS".

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
ON THE BORDER BETWEEN
ARGENTINA AND URUGUAY,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
FRAMED BY BUENOS
AIRES AND MONTEVIDEO,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
IS THE RIO DE LA PLATA
REGION OF SOUTH AMERICA.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
THE ESTUARY, FORMED
BY THE COMBINATION

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
OF THE URUGUAY
AND PARANA RIVERS,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
HAS A LONG INDIGENOUS
AND COLONIAL HISTORY.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
IT ALSO POSSESSES A
LITERATURE OF ITS OWN.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
AMONG ITS PURVEYORS
IS JULIO CORTAZAR.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
BORN IN BRUSSELS OF
ARGENTINEAN PARENTS,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.000
HE ARRIVED IN BUENOS
AIRES AT THE AGE OF FOUR.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
A SICKLY CHILD WHO
WAS A VORACIOUS READER,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
HE FELL IN LOVE
AT AN EARLY AGE

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
WITH THE SCIENCE
FICTION OF JULES VERNE.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
HE WORKED AS A
SCHOOLTEACHER

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
AND THEN AS A
PROFESSOR, AND IN 1938

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
PUBLISHED A SMALL BOOK OF
SONNETS ENTITLED PRESENCE,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
WRITTEN IN THE STYLE
OF STEPHANE MALLARME.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
IN 1949 HE PUBLISHED A
PLAY CALLED THE KINGS,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
WHICH WAS BASED ON
THE MYTH OF THESEUS

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
AND THE MINOTAUR.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
AN AVID ANTI-PERONIST,
HE LEFT HIS COUNTRY

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
IN 1951 TO WORK AS AN
INDEPENDENT TRANSLATOR

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
FOR UNESCO IN PARIS.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
IN THAT SAME YEAR HE
PUBLISHED BESTIARY,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
THE BOOK THAT
SET THE TONE FOR

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
WHAT WOULD BECOME HIS
CHARACTERISTIC STYLE.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
FANTASTICAL AND FUNNY,
CORTAZAR'S WORKS

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
DREW BACK THE CURTAIN ON
REALITY TO REVEAL ITS

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
RICKETY METAPHYSICAL
SUPERSTRUCTURE.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT
CORTAZAR AS A WHOLE.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
HIS STORIES ARE
ALONG THE LINES OF

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
FANTASTICAL LITERATURE.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
YOU SEE BORGES' INFLUENCE,
THAT WHOLE TRADITION.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
AND THE NARRATIVE IS WHAT
WAS CALLED EXPERIMENTAL.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
SO, ELIMINATING EVERYTHING
THE READER WAS USED TO

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
FROM THE REALIST NOVEL.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
WE HAVE TEXTS WHERE WE DON'T
KNOW WHO THE NARRATOR IS,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
MIXED UP TIME, MIXED
UP POINTS OF VIEW,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
PERSPECTIVES THAT
FORCE THE READER

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
TO WORK IN ORDER TO
UNDERSTAND THE STORY

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
BECAUSE NO ONE
IS EXPLAINING IT.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
AMBIGUITIES. SHIFTING VERB
TENSES. TWISTED FRAGMENTS.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
SO, EVERYTHING
EXPERIMENTAL

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
IS WITHIN THE
TRADITIONAL NARRATIVE.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
BETWEEN THE LAST
 SPOONFUL OF RICE PUDDING

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
(A PITY THERE WAS
 TOO LITTLE CINNAMON)

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
AND THE KISSES
 BEFORE GOING TO BED,

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
THE BELL IN THE
 PHONE-ROOM RANG,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
AND ISABEL
 LINGERED UNTIL

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
INES CAME FROM
 ANSWERING IT

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
AND WHISPERED SOMETHING
 IN HER MOTHER'S EAR.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
THEY LOOKED AT
 ONE ANOTHER

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000
AND THEN THE TWO OF
 THEM LOOKED AT ISABEL,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
WHO THOUGHT ABOUT
 THE BROKEN CAGE,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
THE MULTIPLICATION
 BEADS, AND A LITTLE BIT

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
ABOUT MISS LUCERA BEING
 ANGRY BECAUSE SHE HAD

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
RUNG HER DOORBELL ON HER
 WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
SHE WAS NOT
 VERY WORRIED;

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
HER MOTHER AND INES
 WERE LOOKING BEYOND HER,

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
ALMOST USING HER
 AS A PRETEXT.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
ALL THE SAME, THEY
 WERE LOOKING AT HER.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
ALSO ACTIVE DURING THIS
PERIOD WAS THE WRITER

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
SILVINA OCAMPO.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
SHE WAS MARRIED TO
THE NOTED AUTHOR,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
ADOLFO BIOY CASARES,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
FRIENDS WITH
JORGE LUIS BORGES,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
AND SISTER OF
VICTORIA OCAMPO,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
A NOTED INTELLECTUAL

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
AND PUBLISHER OF
THE JOURNAL SUR.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
LIVING IN THE
SHADOW OF THESE

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
LARGER-THAN-LIFE FIGURES,
SHE WROTE STORIES AND POEMS

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
AND PAINTED WATERCOLORS
- WORKS THAT DID NOT

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
MAKE AN IMPACT
DURING HER LIFETIME.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
HOWEVER, IN LATER YEARS,
PRAISE OF HER LIMPID PROSE

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
HAS STEADILY GROWN, AND
TODAY SHE IS CONSIDERED

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
ONE OF THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT FEMALE WRITERS

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:22.000
OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
HER STORIES, FORGOTTEN
 VOYAGE FROM 1937

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
AND AUTOBIOGRAPHY
 OF IRENE FROM 1948

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
ARE THE WORK OF AN
"ENFANT TERRIBLE"

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
WHO IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED
IN, AND TWEAKS THE NOSE OF,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
THE ARGENTINEAN
PATRICIAN CLASS.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
THE URUGUAYAN WRITER
JUAN CARLOS ONETTI WAS,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
BY CONTRAST, A
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
WHO DWELLED AT THE
FRINGES OF SOCIETY.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
HE CREATED A RIO DE LA
PLATA STYLE OF FICTION

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
THAT TRAFFICKED IN THE
MARGINALIZED FOLK OF THE

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
CITY, GIVING RISE TO A
LITERATURE WITHOUT EDGES,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
WHERE IDENTITIES
CONVULSE AND INTERMINGLE.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
FELLOW WRITER CARLOS
FUENTES WROTE THAT,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
"ONETTI'S NOVELS
AND STORIES

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000
ARE THE FOUNDATION
BLOCKS OF OUR MODERNITY.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
HE GAVE ALL OF US
- HIS DESCENDENTS -

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
A LESSON IN NARRATIVE
INTELLIGENCE,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
IN WISE STRUCTURE,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
AND IN IMMENSE LOVE FOR
THE LITERARY IMAGINATION".

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
HE'S A WRITER WHO
CREATES A PERSONAL WORLD,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
A FICTIONAL ONE, JUST
LIKE PROUST, OR FAULKNER.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
AND SO IN THAT SENSE HE
BUILDS HIS OWN TERRITORY.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
SO IN THAT CONSTRUCTION
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
SUBVERSION, BECAUSE
LATIN AMERICAN FICTION

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
IN THE 30'S USUALLY HAS
MORE TO DO WITH A MORE

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000
REGIONAL OR REALIST
REPRESENTATION OF TERRITORY.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.000
REGIONAL OR REALIST
REPRESENTATION OF TERRITORY.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
THE ARTIFICE OF HAVING
ONE'S OWN TERRITORY

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
TO HAVE YOUR FICTION
SET DOWN ROOTS,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
IS A STYLE ALL ITS OWN.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.000
AS WAS THE CASE WITH
NEARLY ALL THE MEMBERS

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
OF THE RIO DE LA
PLATA MOVEMENT,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
ONETTI WAS A JOURNALIST.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
HE SERVED AS A COPY
EDITOR FOR MARCHA -

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
THE MOST IMPORTANT
URUGUAYAN PUBLICATION

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
IT WAS THERE THAT
HE PUBLISHED A

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
LITERARY COLUMN CALLED
"THE PUDDLE STONE",

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
PENNING MYSTERIES AND
LITERARY GOSSIP ARTICLES.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000
IN 1939, HIS FIRST NOVEL,
 THE PIT, APPEARED;

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
AND IN 1941 HE PUBLISHED
 NO MAN'S LAND.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000
NINE YEARS LATER
HIS MAJOR WORK,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.000
A BRIEF LIFE,
WAS PUBLISHED.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
THIS NOVEL OPENED
NEW TERRITORY IN

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
RIO DE LA PLATA
LITERATURE.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
IN IT, HE CREATED SANTA
MARIA, A MYTHICAL CITY

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
THAT IS THE
SPIRITUAL CAPITAL

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
OF ONETTI'S
NARRATIVE WORLD.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000
IT IS AN UNCERTAIN
PLACE, HALFWAY

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
BETWEEN THE TWO SHORES
OF THE RIO DE LA PLATA.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
IN A BRIEF LIFE ALL HIS
NARRATIVE THEMES CONVERGE

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
- THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN
IDENTITY AND THE ABSENCE

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
OF IDENTITY, THE
RECURRENT ANXIETY OVER

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
THE ROLE OF DESTINY IN
THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
AND THE DREAM WORLD AS
A SCREEN FOR REALITY.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
ALL THIS PLAYED OUT
IN AN ATMOSPHERE

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
OF ECCENTRICITY AND
DISILLUSIONMENT.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
THIS NOVEL IS CONSIDERED
ONE OF THE SEMINAL WORKS

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
OF LATIN
AMERICAN WRITING.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
MEANWHILE, I AM THIS
 LITTLE BASHFUL MAN -

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
UNCHANGEABLE...

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
THIS LITTLE MAN THAT
 ANNOYS AS HE CAUSES PITY;

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
A MAN CONFUSED IN THE
 LEGION OF LITTLE MEN

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.000
THAT WERE PROMISED
 THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.000
THIS LITTLE MAN, ME AND
 MY TAXI METER, INEXISTENT;

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
A MERE INCARNATION OF THE
 IDEA OF JUAN MARIA BREUSEN.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
IN TRUTH, A NOBODY.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
LATIN AMERICAN WRITERS
OF THE MID 20TH CENTURY

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
IN A TIME OF
POLITICAL OPPRESSION

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
AND AESTHETIC
EXHAUSTION,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
WOVE A NARRATIVE
TAPESTRY

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
THAT WILL ULTIMATELY
BRING ABOUT

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:47.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN
BOOM OF THE 1960'S.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:00.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN
BOOM OF THE 1960'S.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:13.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN
BOOM OF THE 1960'S.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:23.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN
BOOM OF THE 1960'S.
