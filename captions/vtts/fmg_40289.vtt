00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.666
female narrator:
Ever since people have observed

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.766
and thought about the world
around us,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.500
they've realized
there's order in the universe.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.366
One of the big surprises
is that the physical world

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.660
can in fact be described
by mathematical relationships.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.660
Why would we want to do this?

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.733
Well, for one thing,

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:33.366
it allows us to go an extra step
and actually predict behavior

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.266
like the load
a plane can carry safely

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.700
or whether a building will
survive hurricane-force winds.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.200
Among physicists,

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:55.133
one of the most famous
mathematical relationships

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.566
is the one Edwin Hubble found
between the velocity

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.500
other galaxies are moving away
from our own galaxy

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:06.566
and their distance from us.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.366
Hubble's original data,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.900
plotting distance
on the horizontal axis

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.433
and velocity
on the vertical axis,

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.266
produces a straight line.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.533
Here is more recent data
on a bigger scale.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.133
You can see
that more distant galaxies

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:27.100
are not exactly on the line.

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.566
Astrophysicists believe
this is because

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.330
of the large uncertainty
in measurements

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.866
of these bigger distances,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.433
and they're still satisfied

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:39.433
that Hubble's linear
relationship is reliable.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.866
A big part
of a physicist's work

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.500
is the search for these
mathematical relationships,

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.133
or formulae.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:53.433
In this program, we'll look
at how you go about it.

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:08.533
We're going to look

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.833
at the behavior
of steel springs,

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.600
at what controls
the period of oscillation,

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:19.700
T, the time for one complete
stretch and contraction.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.700
To get answers,
we need to phrase questions

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.100
in terms of things
that can be measured.

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.766
For instance, we can ask,
what is the relationship

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.300
between T
and the mass on the spring?

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.400
Now, because T,
the oscillation time,

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:39.400
depends on something else,

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:44.266
we call it
the dependent variable.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.900
The mass on the spring
is different.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.866
We can make it whatever we want,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.900
so that's called
the independent variable.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.566
Before we start,
there's one other point.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.200
T could also be influenced by
a second independent variable,

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.833
like the stiffness
of the spring.

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:08.700
So how do we handle this?

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:12.800
The experimental approach
is to hold one of them constant,

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:14.966
say, the spring stiffness,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.800
while you measure the effect
of varying the other,

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.330
the mass.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.600
Then you hold the mass constant

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:26.566
while you vary
the spring stiffness.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.933
The students decide to begin

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.400
by holding the spring type
constant

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:41.633
while they vary the mass

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:46.660
to see what effect
that has on T.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.166
To do this, they'll use
a range of masses.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.566
They can measure these
to many significant figures,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.733
so the uncertainty in the mass
will be tiny.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:04.966
They decide that the most
significant source

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.466
of uncertainty

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.700
will be the human variation
in their stopwatch timings.

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:14.900
To minimize this, they decide
to time five oscillations,

00:04:14.933 --> 00:04:17.500
then divide the result by 5.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.766
- One, go.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.933
Two, three, four, five.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:27.966
Good. 5:36.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.533
- 5:40.

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:32.433
- That's pretty good.
- Yeah.

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:34.800
narrator: They also decide
that several students

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:38.000
should time the same event.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.366
- Two, three, four, five.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.133
narrator:
They believe these strategies

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.200
will give them
more accurate times

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:51.666
and a better feel
for the uncertainty,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.666
but they soon realize
there's another issue.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.833
As the spring oscillates,

00:04:57.866 --> 00:05:00.533
the amplitude,
the amount of stretch,

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:03.600
gets smaller and smaller.

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:08.300
Is this another variable
they have to worry about?

00:05:08.333 --> 00:05:11.400
By timing several sets
of oscillations on the run,

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:13.700
they find that there's
no significant difference

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:17.433
in the period
as the amplitude gets smaller,

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:21.866
so they conclude that T
is not a function of amplitude.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.466
In other words,
amplitude doesn't effect T.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.300
The girls are now ready
to start on a serious run

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:33.433
of data collection.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:38.166
As they collect the data,
they make a rough graph.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.100
This will help them
look for trends

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:43.100
and spot outliers,
any strange results

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:46.166
that need checking
with repeat measurements.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.900
A rough graph also shows

00:05:47.933 --> 00:05:51.660
whether the gap between masses
is too large

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.000
and if they've chosen
a large enough spread of masses.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.666
If it's too narrow,
it will be hard to tell

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.900
whether the graph line
is a straight line or a curve,

00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:05.333
and that's what happens
first time around.

00:06:05.366 --> 00:06:09.633
Their spread of masses
was too small,

00:06:09.666 --> 00:06:12.900
so they do more measurements
with smaller masses

00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:17.233
to increase the spread of data.

00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:19.666
Once they're satisfied
with their data,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.700
they plot it more carefully.

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:25.600
They also put in the range
of uncertainty,

00:06:25.633 --> 00:06:29.833
half a second, as error bars.

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:33.766
Then comes the moment of truth:

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.566
drawing the graph line
to see what shape it is.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.566
It's important not to just join
the dots with straight lines.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.733
That could obscure
the real shape.

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:47.233
A good technique
is to hold the paper up

00:06:47.266 --> 00:06:50.100
and look along the data points.

00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:54.233
This gives you a better feel
for the shape of the line.

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:57.933
If you can see the points
trending strongly into a curve,

00:06:57.966 --> 00:07:02.200
then take your pencil
and draw a smooth curve.

00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:05.600
The idea is to touch
as many data points as possible

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:12.300
but also to have about as many
points above as below the line.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:15.166
Notice that the error bars
work as guides.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.833
They'll help you to draw
your line of best fit

00:07:17.866 --> 00:07:19.966
with confidence.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.500
You may be wondering
why we're so interested

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:25.100
in the shape of the graph.

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:29.660
It's because it's the vital clue
to what we're after,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.100
the relationship
between T and mass.

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.866
This curve looks like a parabola
on its side.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.500
A parabola is described

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:43.100
by the relationship
Y equals X squared,

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:48.333
so maybe the formula here
is Y equals root X.

00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:55.766
Maybe our relationship
is T is proportional to root M.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.100
To test this, the students
prepare a table of root M values

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:03.933
and plot T against root M.

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:05.433
Here's the graph.

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:07.166
It's a straight line,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.766
which means that T is directly
proportional to root M.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:23.166
We now come
to our second question:

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.400
what is the relationship between
T, the period of oscillation,

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:30.000
and the stiffness
of the spring?

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.366
But there's a complication.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.866
How exactly do we measure
stiffness?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.100
It's done by subjecting a spring
to different forces,

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:43.200
then plotting force
against extension,

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:46.400
the amount of stretch.

00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:49.666
So here they go
with the first step,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.333
measuring the amount of stretch
for a collection of springs,

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:57.133
applying a range of forces
to each spring.

00:08:57.166 --> 00:09:03.233
[quirky bass guitar music]

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:31.000
Here are the results,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.600
plotting force against extension
for one spring.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.233
Now the graph lines
for all the springs measured.

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:47.533
What they find is that
the relationship is linear

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:49.866
and therefore
has the mathematical form

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.766
of Y equals MX plus C.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.660
The gradient of this line
is called the spring constant.

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.166
It's a measure
of the spring's stiffness.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.933
A loose spring
will have a small K value,

00:10:05.966 --> 00:10:09.660
a tight spring,
a large K value.

00:10:18.233 --> 00:10:19.866
Now that the girls
have worked out

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.300
the spring constant value
for their springs,

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:25.966
they're ready to investigate
how the oscillation period, T,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.366
depends on this second
independent variable.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.366
Remember, they need to exclude
any effect

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.466
from the other
independent variable, the mass.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.233
- 4:78.
- 4:92.

00:10:38.266 --> 00:10:41.133
narrator: So they put
the same mass on each spring

00:10:41.166 --> 00:10:44.330
and use the process
of timing five oscillations,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.900
as they did before.

00:10:47.933 --> 00:10:51.100
- Ready?
- Three, two, one.

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:53.533
narrator: The aim, of course,
is to produce a graph

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:58.700
of period versus spring constant
for a given mass.

00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:04.333
This is the graph
of their results.

00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:06.700
It looks like a hyperbola

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:09.166
but what sort of hyperbola?

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.700
We can't easily tell
if the form is Y equals 1 over X

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:18.366
or Y equals 1 over X squared

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.600
or Y equals 1 over root X,

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:24.400
which can also be written
like this.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.966
So what to do?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.200
Here is a very powerful way
of analyzing graphs

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:33.733
where the mathematical form
is not obvious.

00:11:33.766 --> 00:11:36.100
It looks like the relation
is of the form

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:40.133
T equals LK to the power of B,

00:11:40.166 --> 00:11:42.133
where B is probably negative

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:44.133
to make it look
like a hyperbola

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:47.833
and L is some constant.

00:11:47.866 --> 00:11:49.833
So now you need to use
what you know

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:52.933
about your logarithm rules.

00:11:52.966 --> 00:11:56.766
Since T equals LK
to the power of B,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.266
then you can be sure

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.566
that log T equals log LK
to the power B.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.733
We can write this
as log T equals log L

00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:12.660
plus B log K.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.600
Why this way?

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:15.966
Well, this equation
is of the form

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.700
Y equals C plus MX

00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:21.800
where M, the gradient,

00:12:21.833 --> 00:12:25.366
is B, the exponent
in our analysis.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.833
So what you do is prepare
a graph of log T

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:31.233
versus log K.

00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:35.833
The gradient turns out
to be minus 0.5,

00:12:35.866 --> 00:12:41.600
so we can say that T is
proportional to 1 over root K.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.100
- Go.
- One, two...

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:53.100
narrator: From experimental
measurements,

00:12:53.133 --> 00:12:56.100
the girls have now worked out
the relationship between T

00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:59.733
and two independent variables,
M and K.

00:12:59.766 --> 00:13:00.966
- Um, so...

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.330
narrator:
There's one more challenge.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.433
Can they combine
the two relationships into one?

00:13:06.466 --> 00:13:09.733
You're familiar
with such relationships.

00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:13.266
One of the most famous
is Newton's second law:

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.200
force is proportional
to two independent variables,

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:19.933
mass and acceleration.

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:25.966
[quirky bass guitar music]

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.100
If there is
a single relationship

00:13:46.133 --> 00:13:48.100
that connects
the spring variables,

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:50.660
it will look like this.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.433
This would relate T to both mass
and the spring constant

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:57.800
where theta is some
as yet unknown constant

00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:01.330
of proportionality.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.660
In this case, the girls
should have no difficulty

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.733
in finding a specific value
for theta.

00:14:06.766 --> 00:14:08.733
With their experimental results,

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:13.933
theta is the only unknown
in the equation.

00:14:13.966 --> 00:14:15.566
What they do is substitute

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.666
a few different values
of M and K

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.700
and the corresponding T
into the equation.

00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:24.866
So here is one set of values.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.200
Putting these into the equation,
they get a value for theta.

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:32.100
Taking other values
for M, K, and T,

00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:33.966
they use the same formula

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.330
and finish up with a set
of calculated values for theta.

00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:45.366
Averaging these, they find
that the value of theta

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.900
is about 6.3,
plus or minus 0.2.

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:52.633
This compares well
with the theoretical prediction

00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:56.333
of the relationship
T equals 2 pi

00:14:56.366 --> 00:14:58.766
times root M over K,

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.400
since 2 times pi is about 6.28.

00:15:17.466 --> 00:15:20.833
Real scientific data
must be verifiable,

00:15:20.866 --> 00:15:23.866
which means that someone else
can, if they choose,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.660
repeat your experiment to see
if they get the same results.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.933
No matter how amazing
your conclusion,

00:15:30.966 --> 00:15:33.233
it won't stand up
if you have no record

00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:38.666
of what you did
to produce your data.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.966
There's no precise agreed format
for a report.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.900
The structure,
names of sections, and so on

00:15:46.933 --> 00:15:48.100
can vary.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:50.766
Your teacher may prefer
something different,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.566
but here's a typical approach.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.200
First, the aim.

00:15:58.233 --> 00:15:59.966
It should explain
the relationship

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.266
that you're looking for

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.500
and refer specifically
to the variables

00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:06.400
you're going to measure.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:09.900
Something like, "How does
the period of oscillation

00:16:09.933 --> 00:16:13.166
"of a steel spring vary
with the mass of the spring

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.366
and the stiffness
of the spring?"

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.333
And you could state
the relationship like this.

00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:32.533
After the aim,
list the apparatus you used:

00:16:32.566 --> 00:16:36.700
eight springs,
selection of masses,

00:16:36.733 --> 00:16:42.200
ruler, stopwatch, scales,
door frame for support.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.400
Next, you need to describe
your method.

00:16:52.433 --> 00:16:56.566
For instance, to investigate
the effect of different masses,

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.733
describe how you timed T,

00:16:58.766 --> 00:17:00.566
what masses you used,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.200
how many oscillations you timed,

00:17:03.233 --> 00:17:05.660
and so on.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.466
- Three, two, one.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.966
narrator: It's good to include
diagrams or photos

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
that help to show what you did.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.633
The next section
will be your results.

00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:29.633
In this case, the easiest way
is to use tables.

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:33.200
This is where you decide
on your uncertainty.

00:17:33.233 --> 00:17:35.633
Include this
in your results tables

00:17:35.666 --> 00:17:39.233
along with a sentence
justifying your choice.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:41.233
There's no mysteries about this.

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:42.566
It will usually be based

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.833
on the range of results
you recorded.

00:17:52.433 --> 00:17:55.600
Next is the analysis.

00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:57.600
This is where you use
your results

00:17:57.633 --> 00:18:01.933
to draw your graphs,
calculate gradients, and so on.

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:04.100
You should also describe here

00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:07.400
the final relationship
you arrived at.

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:17.233
After your analysis
is the discussion.

00:18:17.266 --> 00:18:20.600
This outlines issues
arising from your experiment,

00:18:20.633 --> 00:18:23.633
such as any problems
you encountered,

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:26.666
how you could have reduced
your uncertainty,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.330
and suggestions
for a better approach.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.433
This section is sometimes
called evaluation.

00:18:40.533 --> 00:18:43.266
Finally, you need a conclusion.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.566
Don't feel like this has to say
something totally new.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:47.866
It doesn't.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.633
The important thing
is that it answers the question

00:18:50.666 --> 00:18:52.266
posed in the aim.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.566
In this case,
it states the relationship

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.100
that you have discovered.

00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:59.660
Most of the relationships
you encounter

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.633
in your study of physics

00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:03.700
were found by a process
like the one we've explored

00:19:03.733 --> 00:19:05.466
in this program.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.333
If you continue on
into scientific research,

00:19:08.366 --> 00:19:10.500
we hope your life
of experimentation

00:19:10.533 --> 00:19:13.200
is exciting and fruitful.

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.330
- Ready?

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.660
[laughter]

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.766
- Sorry.
- Yeah, that's not--

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.200
No, that's not
what I've been doing.

00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:32.933
Three, two, one. Go.
Is that right?

00:19:32.966 --> 00:19:34.700
- Yeah, that's what
I've been doing when it--

00:19:34.733 --> 00:19:35.866
just when starts coming down.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.660
- Oh, okay.
Then we'll do that.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.433
I've been doing the other one.

00:19:38.466 --> 00:19:39.666
- Which one have you been doing?

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.266
- The--it goes up.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.666
When it goes up.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.100
- Would you--I'm just doing it
when it reaches the top,

00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:47.100
when it's at the top.

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:49.566
- You're confusing me.
