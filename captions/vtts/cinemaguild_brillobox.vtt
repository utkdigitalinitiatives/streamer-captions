00:06:41.277 --> 00:06:41.611
Brillo.

142
00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:43.945
Armaly: I think the box
just depicts cleaning.

143
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:47.700
It's a sink full of water
with bubbles in it.

144
00:06:48.368 --> 00:06:49.992
The original Brillo
box was designed

145
00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:53.122
by an Abstract Expressionist
painter named James Harvey.

146
00:06:53.123 --> 00:06:55.749
&lt;i&gt;And James was in the
school of Pollock&lt;/i&gt;

147
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.584
&lt;i&gt;and many of the other
Ab Ex painters,&lt;/i&gt;

148
00:06:57.585 --> 00:06:58.877
&lt;i&gt;and yet he had a day
job to pay the bills&lt;/i&gt;

149
00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:02.089
&lt;i&gt;and then he happened to be
hired by the Brillo company&lt;/i&gt;

150
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.298
&lt;i&gt;to create what would become&lt;/i&gt;

151
00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:08.011
&lt;i&gt;one of their most iconic and
recognizable symbols of the company.&lt;/i&gt;

152
00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:09.763
Armaly: &lt;i&gt;Warhol depicted the case&lt;/i&gt;

153
00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:12.516
&lt;i&gt;that got shipped from
the plant to stores.&lt;/i&gt;

154
00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:14.893
&lt;i&gt;So you saw this colored box,&lt;/i&gt;

155
00:07:14.894 --> 00:07:16.061
&lt;i&gt;with the Brillo
logo in the middle.&lt;/i&gt;

156
00:07:16.062 --> 00:07:18.647
In today's world, that
would be a very expensive

157
00:07:18.648 --> 00:07:21.860
corrugated box to
ship your product in.

158
00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.446
Lisanne: The first big show
of the supermarket boxes

159
00:07:25.447 --> 00:07:28.450
&lt;i&gt;was at the Stable Gallery
in New York City.&lt;/i&gt;

160
00:07:28.616 --> 00:07:30.909
Shiner:&lt;i&gt;Critics said,"What
on Earth is this thing?&lt;/i&gt;

161
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.913
"How could this be art? What is
Warhol doing? Has he gone insane?"

162
00:07:34.914 --> 00:07:39.376
Smith: &lt;i&gt;It's&lt;/i&gt; The Emperor's New
Clothes. It's copying commercial product,

163
00:07:39.377 --> 00:07:42.337
and it's a big joke and
a big sort of fake.

164
00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:45.340
Shiner: Andy wanted to make it
seem as though you were walking

165
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:47.634
&lt;i&gt;into the back room
of a grocery store&lt;/i&gt;

166
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:50.095
&lt;i&gt;and had to climb through boxes.&lt;/i&gt;

167
00:07:50.096 --> 00:07:52.139
&lt;i&gt;It was his little
way of making fun&lt;/i&gt;

168
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.933
that we, as consumers,
want to buy art

169
00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:57.312
just like we wanna buy bananas.

170
00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:00.939
&lt;i&gt;Warhol had dreams of
people walking away,&lt;/i&gt;

171
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.484
carrying a wooden box
under their arm,

172
00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:05.778
um, for a very low price.

173
00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:10.491
That was a bargain for
a Warhol, even then.

174
00:08:10.492 --> 00:08:11.783
And yet, no one bought them.

175
00:08:11.784 --> 00:08:14.578
Lisanne: When it surfaced that
the original Brillo box

176
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:16.872
&lt;i&gt;was designed by the
artist James Harvey,&lt;/i&gt;

177
00:08:16.873 --> 00:08:19.374
&lt;i&gt;the artist's supporters
were incensed.&lt;/i&gt;

178
00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.711
Irving Sandler: Jim's
gallery, the Graham Gallery,

179
00:08:22.712 --> 00:08:25.130
put out a press
release about how

180
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:27.508
this very fine Abstract
Expressionist painter,

181
00:08:27.509 --> 00:08:30.427
&lt;i&gt;had, in order to
support his fine art,&lt;/i&gt;

182
00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:32.804
had to do this base
commercial art,

183
00:08:32.805 --> 00:08:37.142
and now he was being ripped
off by this Andy Warhol.

184
00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:38.852
&lt;i&gt;I said, "What you
should have done, Jim,&lt;/i&gt;

185
00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:41.688
&lt;i&gt;is while Andy was selling
his&lt;/i&gt; Brillo Boxes,

186
00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:45.317
&lt;i&gt;you should have been
selling signed originals&lt;/i&gt;

187
00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:47.570
for ten cents each."

188
00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.571
Lisanne: &lt;i&gt;When
Warhol's&lt;/i&gt; Brillo Boxes

189
00:08:49.572 --> 00:08:51.365
&lt;i&gt;were sent to an
exhibition in Toronto,&lt;/i&gt;

190
00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:53.325
&lt;i&gt;they were stopped at
the Canadian border,&lt;/i&gt;

191
00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:57.162
rejected as art and taxed
as commercial goods.

192
00:08:57.163 --> 00:08:58.497
(beep) Man:&lt;i&gt;Speak.&lt;/i&gt;

193
00:08:58.498 --> 00:09:01.792
Newswoman: Andy, a Canadian
government spokesman said that your art

194
00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:04.878
&lt;i&gt;could not be described
as original sculpture.&lt;/i&gt;

195
00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:07.464
Would you agree with that?
Uh, yes.

196
00:09:07.465 --> 00:09:10.759
Why do you agree? Well,
because it's not original.

197
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.386
The Canadian incident
is one of the best,

198
00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:14.680
because it really is about
the boxes themselves.

199
00:09:14.681 --> 00:09:16.390
And the fact that the
Canadian government

200
00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:17.975
didn't recognize the
boxes as sculpture

201
00:09:17.976 --> 00:09:21.395
and wanted to charge a duty tax
because they thought they were goods,

202
00:09:21.396 --> 00:09:23.981
&lt;i&gt;played perfect into the
hands of the media,&lt;/i&gt;

203
00:09:23.982 --> 00:09:25.524
&lt;i&gt;and it was perfect
for Ivan and Andy&lt;/i&gt;

204
00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:28.735
&lt;i&gt;in which to capitalize
on to some degree.&lt;/i&gt;

205
00:09:28.736 --> 00:09:31.030
&lt;i&gt;Ivan was a perfect
foil for Andy.&lt;/i&gt;

206
00:09:31.031 --> 00:09:32.781
&lt;i&gt;He was almost like Howard Cosell.&lt;/i&gt;

Newswoman: Well, isn't
this sort of a joke then,

209
00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:38.745
that you're playing
on the public?

Uh, no. It gives me
something to do.

Newswoman: Well, why have
you bothered to do that?

212
00:09:43.835 --> 00:09:45.419
Why not create something new?

213
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.631
Uh, because it's easier to do.

214

Rita: The reality
was, is this art?

215
00:09:52.218 --> 00:09:54.469
&lt;i&gt;Is this the art we're used to?&lt;/i&gt;

216
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.889
Is the European wing at the Met?
No.

217
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.602
There's no wing at the Met yet.

218

I loved it.

Martin: A Brillo box being presented as
a work of art was unusual,

220
00:10:06.774 --> 00:10:08.650
&lt;i&gt;but people that
appreciated Pop Art&lt;/i&gt;

221
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:10.527
&lt;i&gt;knew that Pop Artists
were seeing things&lt;/i&gt;

222
00:10:10.528 --> 00:10:15.034
&lt;i&gt;that the public
instinctively appreciated.&lt;/i&gt;

223
00:10:16.492 --> 00:10:19.828
He took things that originate din
the world of commercial art,

224
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:22.539
&lt;i&gt;for packaging and
marketing of products,&lt;/i&gt;

225
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:27.210
and made them stand alone as
visually pleasurable things

226
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:28.378
&lt;i&gt;to look at and own.&lt;/i&gt;

I decided to take a stab.

232

&lt;i&gt;In my naiveté, I
pressed Mr. Karp&lt;/i&gt;

235
00:10:50.318 --> 00:10:53.612
to see what he could do
about having Mr. Warhol

00:19:35.718 --> 00:19:38.429
&lt;i&gt;I found myself in a

00:25:45.755 --> 00:25:49.883
the phone was ringing and we

"This is an opportunity to add

"one of the most important
Warhol works to your collection,

not only a Warhol work but
also the rare sculpture."

&lt;i&gt;Those people came
in at our request,&lt;/i&gt;

532
00:25:58.476 --> 00:26:02.396
&lt;i&gt;and we even sent the box to
their house to see it in situ,&lt;/i&gt;

533
00:26:02.397 --> 00:26:04.147

with other things.&lt;/i&gt;

534

&lt;i&gt;on what an opportunity this was.&lt;/i&gt;

536

And while the estimate
was very conservative,

was going to go more.

This is going to be mine,"

582
00:28:24.997 --> 00:28:27.708
it becomes very strong, and
you have a fair amount

They wanted to be
very anonymous.

They were on a telephone
actually in the room.

596
00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:13.666
So they sort of hid themselves in
the group of other bidders.

Here at $900,000.

601
00:29:22.765 --> 00:29:26.349

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.851

One million, 150 thousand?

610
00:29:47.288 --> 00:29:48.538
One million, 200 thousand?

611
00:29:48.539 --> 00:29:50.249
One million, 250 thousand?

612
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.210
Paulson: One million, three.
Three hundred there.

613
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:55.420

and let the bidding unfold

614
00:29:55.421 --> 00:29:57.006
&lt;i&gt;to the point where
they can jump in&lt;/i&gt;

615
00:29:57.007 --> 00:29:58.840

00:30:00.343 --> 00:30:02.094
&lt;i&gt;everyone else was going
to fall by the wayside,&lt;/i&gt;

618
00:30:02.095 --> 00:30:05.639
&lt;i&gt;and just as we thought we were
safe, someone else would pop in.&lt;/i&gt;

619
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.975
Two million dollars.

620
00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:12.104
Two million, one. Two million,
one hundred thousand dollars.

621
00:30:12.105 --> 00:30:12.939
Two million, 200 thousand.

Something like
"Three Cents Off,"

637
00:30:46.056 --> 00:30:47.806
it was so... it was so unlikely

638
00:30:47.807 --> 00:30:49.724
that another one would
ever be on the market

639
00:30:49.725 --> 00:30:51.351
or there would be one
in this great condition

640
00:30:51.352 --> 00:30:55.231
with a great provenance and
his signature in red crayon,

641
00:30:55.232 --> 00:30:56.149
&lt;i&gt;and all the wonderful history.&lt;/i&gt;

642
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.110
That's what inspired that
collector to keep going.

643
00:30:59.111 --> 00:31:03.197
Two million, 650 thousand
dollars on the telephone.

649
00:31:15.335 --> 00:31:17.169
&lt;i&gt;that had once been
part of my childhood,&lt;/i&gt;

650
00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:22.170
&lt;i&gt;with auction house fees,
sold for over $3 million,&lt;/i&gt;

651
00:31:22.925 --> 00:31:26.179
and disappeared from us again.

652
00:31:27.388 --> 00:31:29.472
Lisanne: Was there ever a
point where you thought about

653
00:31:29.473 --> 00:31:31.892
&lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; Brillo Box or wished
that you had kept it?

654
00:31:31.893 --> 00:31:36.147
Martin: &lt;i&gt;Well, very recently I
did, to my chagrin.&lt;/i&gt;(laughs)

655
00:31:36.148 --> 00:31:39.774

658
00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:47.699
Lisanne: What do you think would
make someone pay $3 million

659
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.701
&lt;i&gt;for a&lt;/i&gt; Brillo Box now?

660
00:31:49.702 --> 00:31:53.081
Martin: It's a piece
of art history...

661
00:31:53.998 --> 00:31:57.877
&lt;i&gt;an irreplaceable piece
of art history.&lt;/i&gt;

662
00:31:58.836 --> 00:32:01.255
Rita: &lt;i&gt;When I see the&lt;/i&gt; Brillo Box,

663
00:32:01.256 --> 00:32:04.633
&lt;i&gt;I could only have fond memories.&lt;/i&gt;

664
00:32:04.634 --> 00:32:08.553
&lt;i&gt;It was a point in time
in New York history.&lt;/i&gt;

665
00:32:08.554 --> 00:32:11.057
&lt;i&gt;It was a point in time
in artists" lives,&lt;/i&gt;

666
00:32:11.058 --> 00:32:13.642
&lt;i&gt;and that was a point
in time in our home.&lt;/i&gt;

667
00:32:13.643 --> 00:32:16.312
Martin: She probably would
have preferred that I kept it.

668
00:32:16.313 --> 00:32:18.521
Lisanne: Why do you think she
would have preferred you kept it?

669
00:32:18.522 --> 00:32:21.524
Martin: I think she had a
more innate appreciation

670
00:32:21.525 --> 00:32:22.692
&lt;i&gt;of art and art objects.&lt;/i&gt;

671
00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:26.198
If it were up to her, I
would have kept all of it.

672
00:32:26.864 --> 00:32:30.825
Of course, it would be great if you
could hold everything, you know.

673
00:32:30.826 --> 00:32:35.331
But many years ago, that
was not an option for me.

674
00:32:35.332 --> 00:32:39.418
If I wanted to get more art, I
had to sell something I had,

675
00:32:39.419 --> 00:32:43.298
uh, and I often did that.

676
00:32:45.466 --> 00:32:47.509
&lt;i&gt;As my career in law
practice grew,&lt;/i&gt;

677
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.719
&lt;i&gt;I had less and less
time for that.&lt;/i&gt;

678
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.472
&lt;i&gt;Going to art galleries
every Saturday&lt;/i&gt;

679
00:32:52.473 --> 00:32:55.809
&lt;i&gt;was not something that
I was able to carry on&lt;/i&gt;

680
00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:58.729
through the rest of my career.

681
00:33:06.405 --> 00:33:07.570
Lisanne: &lt;i&gt;As my siblings
and I got older,&lt;/i&gt;

682
00:33:07.571 --> 00:33:12.244
&lt;i&gt;visiting the galleries was something
we stopped doing together as a family.&lt;/i&gt;

683
00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:17.706
And eventually, most of the
art my parents once owned

684
00:33:17.707 --> 00:33:21.836
moved on to other living
rooms and other lives.

685
00:33:24.797 --> 00:33:29.797
&lt;i&gt;And some years later, my parents
went their separate ways too.&lt;/i&gt;

686
00:33:32.888 --> 00:33:37.888
&lt;i&gt;When I see the&lt;/i&gt; Brillo Box, I think about
my parents when they were young...

687
00:33:39.937 --> 00:33:42.356
&lt;i&gt;and the life we once
had as a family,&lt;/i&gt;

688
00:33:42.357 --> 00:33:45.693
&lt;i&gt;our life with art
all around us...&lt;/i&gt;

689
00:33:47.987 --> 00:33:49.238
&lt;i&gt;and how none of us
can really know&lt;/i&gt;

690
00:33:49.239 --> 00:33:52.492
&lt;i&gt;the things that will
endure over time.&lt;/i&gt;

691
00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:27.650
A lot of collectors add to their
