00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.630


2
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.330
pox on't! I had rather notbe so noble as I am;

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.470
they dare not fight withme, because of the queen

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.030
my mother: every Jack-slavehath his bellyful

5
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.430
of fighting, and I must goup and down like a cock

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.970
that nobody can match.

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.170
Sayest thou?

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.130
It is not fit yourlordship should undertake

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.330
every companion thatyou give offence to.

10
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.270
No, I know that: but it isfit I should commit

11
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.930
offence to my inferiors.

12
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.770
Ay, it is fit for yourlordship only.

13
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.000
Why, so I say.

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.270
Did you hear of a strangerthat's come to court to-night?

15
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.200
A stranger, and I not knowon't!

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.770
There's an Italian come;and, 'tis thought,

17
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.000
one of Leonatus' friends.

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.800
Leonatus! a banishedrascal; and he's another,

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
whatsoever he be. Who toldyou of this stranger?

20
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.100
One of your lordship'spages.

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.800
Is it fit I wentto look upon him?

22
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.270
is there no derogationin't?

23
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.030
You cannot derogate, mylord.

24
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.200
Not easily, I think.

25
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.200
Come, I'll go see thisItalian: Come, go.

26
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.100
I'll attend your lordship.

27
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.600
That such a crafty devilas is his mother

28
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.370
Should yield the worldthis ass! a woman that

29
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.700
Bears all down with herbrain; and this her son

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.500
Cannot take two fromtwenty, for his heart,

31
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.530
And leave eighteen.

32
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.770
Who's there? my womanHelen?

33
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.600
Please you, madam

34
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.130
What hour is it?

35
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.870
Almost midnight, madam.

36
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.270
I have read three hoursthen: mine eyes are weak:

37
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.070
Fold down the leaf where Ihave left: to bed:

38
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.430
Take not away the taper,leave it burning;

39
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.730
And if thou canst awake byfour o' the clock,

40
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.230
I prithee, call me.

41
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.200
Sleep hath seized mewholly

42
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.230
To your protection Icommend me, gods.

43
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.030
From fairies and thetempters of the night

44
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030
Guard me, beseech ye.

45
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.300
The crickets sing, andman's o'er-labour'd sense

46
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300
Repairs itself by rest.

47
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.900
Our Tarquin thus

48
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.630
Did softly press therushes, ere he waken'd

49
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.600
The chastity he wounded.

50
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.370
Cytherea,

51
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.300
How bravely thou becomestthy bed, fresh lily,

52
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.070
And whiter than the sheets!That I might touch!

53
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:08.130
But kiss; one kiss! Rubiesunparagon'd,

54
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.700
How dearly they do't! 'Tisher breathing that

55
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.270
Perfumes the chamber thus:the flame o' the taper

56
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.070
Bows toward her, and wouldunder-peep her lids,

57
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.670
To see the enclosedlights, now canopied

58
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.600
Under these windows, whiteand azure laced

59
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:38.900
With blue of heaven's owntinct. But my design,

60
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.930
To note the chamber: Iwill write all down:

61
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.500
Such and such pictures;there the window;

62
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.870
such the adornment of herbed; the arras; figures,

63
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.600
Why, such and such; andthe contents o' the story.

64
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.070
Ah, but some natural notesabout her body,

65
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.100
Above ten thousand meanermoveables

66
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.930
Would testify, to enrichmine inventory.

67
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:45.300
O sleep, thou ape ofdeath, lie dull upon her!

68
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.800
And be her sense but as amonument,

69
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.800
Thus in a chapel lying!

70
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.530
Come off, come off:

71
00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.370
As slippery as the Gordianknot was hard!

72
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.370
'Tis mine; and this willwitness outwardly,

73
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.730
As strongly as theconscience does within,

74
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.230
To the madding of herlord.

75
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.770
On her left breast

76
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.700
A mole cinque-spotted,like the crimson drops

77
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.370
I' the bottom of acowslip: here's a voucher,

78
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.800
Stronger than everlaw could make:

79
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.570
this secret will forcehim think

80
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.600
I have pick'dthe lock and ta'en

81
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.270
The treasure of herhonour.

82
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.500
No more. To whatend?

83
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.670
Why should I write thisdown, that's riveted,

84
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.670
Screw'd to my memory?

85
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.730
She hath been reading late

86
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:23.470
The tale of Tereus; herethe leaf's turn'd down

87
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.300
Where Philomel gave up.

88
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.830
I have enough:

89
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.700
To the trunk again, andshut the spring of it.

90
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.930
Swift, swift, you dragonsof the night, that dawning

91
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.300
May bare the raven's eye!

92
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.770
I lodge in fear;

93
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:57.870
Though this a heavenlyangel, hell is here.

94
00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.770
(Clock strikes)

95
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:10.530
One, two, three: time,time!

96
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.030
It's almost morning, is'tnot?

97
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.030
Day, my lord.

98
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:29.700
I am advised to givethis foolish Imogen

99
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.300
music o' mornings; theysay it will penetrate.

100
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.070
Come on; tune: if youcan penetrate her

101
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.630

Attend you here the doorof our stern daughter?

Will she not forth?

114
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.030
I have assailed her withmusic,

115
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.300
but she vouchsafesno notice.

116
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.770
The exile of her minion istoo new;

00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:59.870
She hath not yet forgothim: some more time

118
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.430
Must wear the print of hisremembrance out,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.900
And then she's yours.

120
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.000
You are most bound to theking,

Prefer you to his daughter.

123
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.500
So like you, sir,ambassadors from Rome;

124
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.900
The one is Caius Lucius.

125
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.630
A worthy fellow,

126
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.470
Albeit he comes on angrypurpose now;

127
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.000
But that's no fault ofhis:

128
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Our dear son,

129
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.930
When you have given goodmorning to your mistress,

130
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.670
Attend the queen and us;we shall have need

131
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:46.730
To employ you towards thisRoman. Come, our queen.

132
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.670
If she be up, I'll speakwith her; if not,

133
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.570
Let her lie still anddream.

134
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.370
By your leave, ho!

135
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.600
Good morrow, fairest:sister, your sweet hand.

136
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.870
Good morrow, sir. You layout too much pains

137
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.770
For purchasing buttrouble; the thanks I give

138
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.100
Is telling you that I ampoor of thanks

139
00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.670
And scarce can spare them.

140
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.400
Still, I swear I love you.

141
00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.170
If you but said so, 'twereas deep with me:

142
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.030
If you swear still, yourrecompense is still

143
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.070
That I regard it not.

144
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.300
This is no answer.

145
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.500
But that you shall not sayI yield being silent,

146
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.430
I would not speak. I prayyou, spare me: 'faith,

147
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.000
I shall unfold equaldiscourtesy

148
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.800
To your best kindness: oneof your great knowing

149
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.900
Should learn, beingtaught, forbearance.

150
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.630
To leave you in yourmadness, 'twere my sin:

151
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.430
I will not.

152
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.630
Fools are not mad folks.

153
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.570
Do you call me fool?

154
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.800
As I am mad, I do:

155
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.270
If you'll be patient, I'llno more be mad;

156
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:49.930
That cures us both. I ammuch sorry, sir,

157
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.000
You put me to forget alady's manners,

158
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.100
By being so verbal: andlearn now, for all,

159
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.330
That I, which know myheart, do here pronounce,

160
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:08.530
By the very truth of it, Icare not for you,

161
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.630
And am so near the lack ofcharity--

162
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.830
To accuse myself--I hateyou; which I had rather

163
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.770
You felt than make't myboast.

164
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.870
You sin against obedience,

165
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.330
which you owe your father.

166
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.430
For the contract you pretendwith that base wretch,

167
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.530
One bred of alms andfoster'd with cold dishes,

168
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.530
With scraps o' the court,it is no contract, none:

169
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.430
And though it be allow'din meaner parties--

170
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.000
Yet who than he moremean?--to knit their souls,

171
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.970
On whom there is no moredependency

172
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.230
But brats and beggary, inself-figured knot;

173
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.770
Yet you are curb'dfrom that enlargement

174
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.300
by the consequence o' thecrown, and must not soil

175
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.430
The precious note of itwith a base slave.

176
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.070
A hilding for a livery, asquire's cloth,

177
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.470
A pantler, not so eminent.

178
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:52.030
Profane fellow

179
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.530
Wert thou the son ofJupiter and no more

180
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.800
But what thou art besides,thou wert too base

181
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.570
To be his groom: thou wertdignified enough,

182
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.130
Even to the point of envy,if 'twere made

183
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.170
Comparative for yourvirtues, to be styled

184
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.030
The under-hangman of hiskingdom, and hated

185
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.870
For being preferred sowell.

186
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.830
The south-fog rot him!

187
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.170
He never can meet moremischance than come

188
00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:23.300
To be but named of thee.His meanest garment,

189
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.200
That ever hath but clipp'dhis body, is dearer

190
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.100
In my respect than all thehairs above thee,

191
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.800
Were they all made suchmen. How now, Pisanio!

192
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.470
'His garment!' Now thedevil--

193
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.000
To Dorothy my woman hiethee presently--

194
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.670
'His garment!'

195
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.770
I am sprited with a fool.

196
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.400
Frighted, and anger'dworse: go bid my woman

197
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.830
Search for a jewel thattoo casually

198
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.530
Hath left mine arm: it wasthy master's: 'shrew me,

199
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.570
If I would lose it for arevenue

200
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.000
Of any king's in Europe. Ido think

201
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.670
I saw't this morning:

202
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.430
confident I am Last night 'twason mine arm; I kiss'd it:

203
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.570
I hope it be not gone totell my lord

204
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:05.970
That I kiss aught but he.

205
00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:06.730
'Twill not be lost.

206
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.100
I hope so: go and search.

207
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.830
You have abused me:

208
00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.530
'His meanest garment!'

209
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:16.230
Ay, I said so, sir:

210
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.700
If you will make't anaction, call witness to't.

211
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.300
I will inform your father.

212
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.670
Your mother too:

213
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.030
She's my good lady, andwill conceive, I hope,

214
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.070
But the worst of me. So, Ileave you, sir,

215
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.900
To the worst ofdiscontent.

216
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:35.630
I'll be revenged:

217
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.970
'His meanest garment!'Well.

218
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:43.000
Fear it not, sir: I wouldI were so sure

219
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
To win the king as I ambold her honour

220
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.300
Will remain hers.

221
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.170
What means do you make tohim?

222
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.270
Not any, but abide thechange of time,

223
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.300
Quake in the presentwinter's state and wish

224
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:59.400
That warmer days would come:in these sear'd hopes,

225
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.700
I barely gratify yourlove; they failing,

226
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.500
I must die much yourdebtor.

227
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.000
Your very goodness andyour company

228
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.330
O'erpays all I can do. Bythis, your king

229
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.970
Hath heard of greatAugustus: Caius Lucius

230
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.230
Will do's commissionthroughly: and I think

231
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.400
He'll grant the tribute,send the arrearages,

232
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.000
Or look upon our Romans,whose remembrance

233
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.170
Is yet fresh in theirgrief.

234
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:25.100
I do believe,

235
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.600
Statist though I am none,nor like to be,

236
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.200
That this will prove awar; and you shall hear

237
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200
The legions now in Galliasooner landed

238
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.900
In our not-fearing Britainthan have tidings

239
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.800
Of any penny tribute paid.Our countrymen

240
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.830
Are men more order'd thanwhen Julius Caesar

241
00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.900
Smiled at their lack ofskill, but found

242
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.400
their courage

243
00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.200
Worthy his frowning at:their discipline,

244
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.270
Now mingled with theircourages, will make known

245
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.770
To their approvers theyare people such

246
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:49.830
That mend upon the world.

247
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.130
See! Iachimo!

248
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.830
The swiftest harts haveposted you by land;

249
00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.100
And winds of all thecomers kiss'd your sails,

250
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.570
To make your vesselnimble.

251
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.530
Welcome, sir.

252
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.000
I hope the briefness ofyour answer made

253
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.870
The speediness of yourreturn.

254
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.700
Your lady

255
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.570
Is one of the fairest thatI have look'd upon.

256
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:09.630
And therewithal the best;or let her beauty

257
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.700
Look through a casement toallure false hearts

258
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.830
And be false with them.

259
00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:13.970
Here are letters for you.

260
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.970
Their tenor good, I trust.

261
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.230
'Tis very like.

262
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.400
Was Caius Lucius in theBritain court

263
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.570
When you were there?

264
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:20.600
He was expected then,

265
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.930
But not approach'd.

266
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.800
All is well yet.

267
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.000
Sparkles this stone as itwas wont? or is't not

268
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.270
Too dull for your goodwearing?

269
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.230
If I had lost it,

270
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.800
I should have lost theworth of it in gold.

271
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.700
I'll make a journey twiceas far, to enjoy

272
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.270
A second night of suchsweet shortness which

273
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.870
Was mine in Britain, forthe ring is won.

274
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.400
The stone's too hard tocome by.

275
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.970
Not a whit,

276
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.870
Your lady being so easy.

277
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.870
Make not, sir,

278
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.630
Your loss your sport: Ihope you know that we

279
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.270
Must not continue friends.

280
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.330
Good sir, we must,

281
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.300
If you keep covenant. HadI not brought

282
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.770
The knowledge of yourmistress home, I grant

283
00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.400
We were to questionfurther: but I now

284
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.530
Profess myself the winnerof her honour,

285
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:16.200
Together with your ring;and not the wronger

286
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.000
Of her or you, havingproceeded but

287
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.400
By both your wills.

288
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.530
If you can make't apparent

289
00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.000
That you have tasted herin bed, my hand

290
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.770
And ring is yours; if not,the foul opinion

291
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.070
You had of her pure honourgains or loses

292
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.270
Your sword or mine, ormasterless leaves both

293
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.100
To who shall find them.

294
00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.300
Sir, my circumstances,

295
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.670
Being so near the truth asI will make them,

296
00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.770
Must first induce you tobelieve: whose strength

297
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.730
I will confirm with oath;which, I doubt not,

298
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.370
You'll give me leave tospare, when you shall find

299
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.800
You need it not.

300
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.530
Proceed.

301
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.430
First, her bedchamber,--

302
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.400
Where, I confess, I sleptnot, but profess

303
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.270
Had that was well worthwatching--it was hang'd

304
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.830
With tapesty of silk andsilver; the story

305
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.570
Proud Cleopatra, when shemet her Roman,

306
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.370
And Cydnus swell'd abovethe banks, or for

307
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.570
The press of boats orpride: a piece of work

308
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.370
So bravely done, so rich,that it did strive

309
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.400
In workmanship and value;which I wonder'd

310
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.770
Could be so rarely andexactly wrought,

311
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.930
Since the true life on'twas--

312
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:19.570
This is true;

313
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:23.100
And this you might haveheard of here, by me,

314
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.800
Or by some other.

315
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:25.430
More particulars

316
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.370
Must justify my knowledge.

317
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.030
So they must,

318
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.830
Or do your honour injury.

319
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.830
The chimney

320
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.530
Is south the chamber, andthe chimney-piece

321
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.230
Chaste Dian bathing: neversaw I figures

322
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.670
So likely to reportthemselves: the cutter

323
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.900
Was as another nature,dumb; outwent her,

324
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.730
Motion and breath leftout.

325
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.700
This is a thing

326
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.600
Which you might fromrelation likewise reap,

327
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.770
Being, as it is, muchspoke of.

328
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.070
The roof o' the chamber

329
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.730
With golden cherubins isfretted: her andirons--

330
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.500
I had forgot them--weretwo winking Cupids

331
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.900
Of silver, each on onefoot standing, nicely

332
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.900
Depending on their brands.

333
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.700
This is her honour!

334
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.070
Let it be granted you haveseen all this--and praise

335
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.030
Be given to yourremembrance--the description

336
00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.800
Of what is in her chambernothing saves

337
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.330
The wager you have laid.

338
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:22.330
Then, if you can,

339
00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:27.130
Be pale: I beg but leaveto air this jewel; see!

340
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.070
And now 'tis up again: itmust be married

341
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.670
To that your diamond; I'llkeep them.

342
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.200
Jove!

343
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.570
Once more let me beholdit:

344
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.130
is it that whichI left with her?

345
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.500
Sir--I thank her--that:

346
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:54.870
She stripp'd it from herarm; I see her yet;

347
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.600
Her pretty action didoutsell her gift,

348
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.070
And yet enrich'd it too:she gave it me, and said

349
00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.070
She prized it once.

350
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.200
May be she pluck'd it off

351
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.530
To send it me.

352
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.370
She writes so to you, dothshe?

353
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:35.370
O, no, no, no! 'tis true.

354
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.270
Here, take this too;

355
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.830
It is a basilisk unto mineeye,

356
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.900
Kills me to look on't. Letthere be no honour

357
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:57.200
Where there is beauty; truth,where semblance; love,

358
00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.700
Where there's another man:the vows of women

359
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.000
Of no more bondage be, towhere they are made,

360
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.900
Than they are to theirvirtues; which is nothing.

361
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.770
O, above measure false!

362
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.970
Have patience, sir,

363
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.100
And take your ring again;'tis not yet won:

364
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.670
It may be probable shelost it;

365
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.170
or who knows if one of herwomen, being corrupted,

366
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.030
Hath stol'n it from her?

367
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.700
Very true;

368
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.400
And so, I hope, he cameby't. Back my ring:

369
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:38.230
Render to me some corporalsign about her,

370
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.930
More evident than this;for this was stolen.

371
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:48.370
By Jupiter, I had it fromher arm.

372
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.470
Hark you, he swears; byJupiter he swears.

373
00:22:57.030 --> 00:23:03.730
'Tis true:--nay, keep thering--'tis true: I am sure

374
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.830
She would not lose it:her attendants are all

375
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:12.530
sworn and honourable:--theyinduced to steal it!

376
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:18.800
And by a stranger!--No, hehath enjoyed her:

377
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.870
The cognizance of herincontinency

378
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.770
Is this: she hath boughtthe name of whore

379
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.100
thus dearly.

380
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.170
There, take thy hire; andall the fiends of hell

381
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.270
Divide themselves betweenyou!

382
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.000
Sir, be patient:

383
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.070
This is not strong enoughto be believed

384
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.330
Of one persuaded well of--

385
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.030
Never talk on't;

386
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.900
She hath been colted byhim.

387
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.830
If you seek

388
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.230
For further satisfying,under her breast--

389
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.200
Worthy the pressing--liesa mole, right proud

390
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.400
Of that most delicatelodging:

391
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.000
I kiss'd it; and it gaveme present hunger

392
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.030
To feed again, thoughfull. You do remember

393
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.100
This stain upon her?

394
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.700
Ay, and it doth confirm

395
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.030
Another stain, as big ashell can hold,

396
00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.000
Were there no more but it.

397
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Will you hear more?

398
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.170
Spare your arithmetic:never count the turns;

399
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.070
Once, and a million!

400
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.670
I'll be sworn--

401
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.570
No swearing.

402
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.570
If you will swear you havenot done't, you lie;

403
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.500
And I will kill thee, ifthou dost deny

404
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:28.970
Thou'st made me cuckold.

405
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:30.000
I'll deny nothing.

406
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.570
O, that I had her here, totear her limb-meal!

407
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:46.500
I will go there anddo't, i' the court,

408
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:53.530
before her father.I'll do something--

409
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.270
Quite besides

410
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:12.500
The government ofpatience! You have won:

411
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.130
Let's follow him, andpervert the present wrath

412
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.970
He hath against himself.

413
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.330
With all my heart.

414
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.670
Is there no way for men tobe but women

415
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:34.600
Must be half-workers? Weare all bastards;

416
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:39.670
And that most venerableman which I

417
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.130
Did call my father, was Iknow not where

418
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:49.270
When I was stamp'd; somecoiner with his tools

419
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:54.570
Made me a counterfeit: yetmy mother seem'd

420
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.630
The Dian of that time sodoth my wife

421
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:10.570
The nonpareil of this. O,vengeance, vengeance!

422
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.000
Me of my lawful pleasureshe restrain'd

423
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.070
And pray'd me oftforbearance; did it with

424
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.530
A pudency so rosy thesweet view on't

425
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.200
Might well have warm'd oldSaturn; that I thought her

426
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.600
As chaste as unsunn'dsnow. O, all the devils!

427
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.900
This yellow Iachimo, in anhour,--wast not?--

428
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:46.400
Or less,--at first?--perchancehe spoke not, but,

429
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.630
Like a full-acorn'd boar,a German one,

430
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:56.230
Cried 'O!' and mounted;found no opposition

431
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.400
But what he look'd forshould oppose and she

432
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:04.930
Should from encounterguard. Could I find out

433
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:09.730
The woman's part in me!For there's no motion

434
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.300
That tends to vice in man,but I affirm

435
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:20.130
It is the woman's part: beit lying, note it,

436
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:26.030
The woman's; flattering,hers; deceiving, hers;

437
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:31.470
Lust and rank thoughts,hers, hers; revenges, hers;

438
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.330
Ambitions, covetings,change of prides, disdain,

439
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.570
Nice longing, slanders,mutability,

440
00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.330
All faults that may benamed, nay, that hell knows,

441
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:45.570
Why, hers, in part or all;but rather, all;

442
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.300
For even to vice

443
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.970
They are not constant butare changing still

444
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.770
One vice, but of a minuteold, for one

445
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:56.870
Not half so old as that.I'll write against them,

446
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:04.170
Detest them, curse them:yet 'tis greater skill

447
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.330
In a true hate, to praythey have their will:

448
00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.330
The very devils cannotplague them better.

449
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.370
