00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.270


2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:02.970
The miserable have no other medicine,

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.670
But only hope:

4
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.400
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.200
Be absolute for death; either death or life

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.000
Shall thereby be the sweeter.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.230
Reason thus with life:

8
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.330
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing

9
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.870
That none but fools would keep:

10
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.400
a breath thou art,

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.130
Servile to all the skyey influences,

12
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.970
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,

13
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.270
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;

14
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.800
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.030
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;

16
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.700
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.630
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;

18
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.970
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork

19
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.870
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,

20
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.670
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st

21
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.900
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;

22
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.370
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains

23
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.800
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;

24
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.330
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,

25
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.630
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;

26
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.470
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,

27
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.000
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;

28
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.800
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.400
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.970
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;

31
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.570
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,

32
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.500
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,

33
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.130
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,

34
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.000
For ending thee no sooner.

35
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.100
Thou hast nor youth nor age,

36
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.800
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.930
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth

38
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.470
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms

39
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.870
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,

40
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.430
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,

41
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.670
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this thing

42
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.270
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life

43
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.830
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,

44
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.330
That makes these odds all even.

45
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.430
I humbly thank you.

46
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.330
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;

47
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.200
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

48
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.730
Provost, a word.

49
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.900
As many as you please.

50
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.030
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

51
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.200
Now, sister, what's the comfort?

52
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.730
Why, as all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.

53
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.700
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,

54
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.230
Intends you for his swift ambassador,

55
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.530
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:

56
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.200
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;

57
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.000
To-morrow you set on.

58
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.070
Is there no remedy?

59
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.070
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,

60
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.230
To cleave a heart in twain.

61
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.000
But is there any?

62
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.570
Yes, brother, you may live:

63
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.700
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,

64
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.630
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.130
But fetter you till death.

66
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.130
Perpetual durance?

67
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.500
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,

68
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.270
Though all the world's vastidity you had,

69
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.670
To a determined scope.

70
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.030
But in what nature?

71
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.530
In such a one as, you consenting to't,

72
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.670
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,

73
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.170
And leave you naked.

74
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.230
Let me know the point.

75
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.270
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,

76
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.300
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,

77
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.770
And six or seven winters more respect

78
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.400
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?

79
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.270
The sense of death is most in apprehension;

80
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.370
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,

81
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.230
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great

82
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.830
As when a giant dies.

83
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.500
Why give you me this shame?

84
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.800
Think you I can a resolution fetch

85
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.000
From flowery tenderness?

86
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.170
If I must die,

87
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.330
I will encounter darkness as a bride,

88
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.030
And hug it in mine arms.

89
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.170
There spake my brother; there my father's grave

90
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.030
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:

91
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.970
Thou art too noble to conserve a life

92
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.530
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,

93
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.770
Whose settled visage and deliberate word

94
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.530
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew

95
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.370
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil

96
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.170
His filth within being cast, he would appear

97
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.370
A pond as deep as hell.

98
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.700
The precise Angelo!

99
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.530
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,

100
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.370
The damned'st body to invest and cover

101
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.930
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?

102
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.570
If I would yield him my virginity,

103
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.630
Thou mightst be freed.

104
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.600
O heavens! it cannot be.

105
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.630
Yes, he would give't thee, out this rank offence,

106
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.130
So to offend him still. This night's the time

107
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.530
That I should do what I abhor to name,

108
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.470
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

109
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.100
Thou shalt not do't.

110
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.300
O, were it but my life,

111
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.730
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance

112
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.500
As frankly as a pin.

113
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:09.230
Thanks, dear Isabel.

114
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.170
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

115
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.430
Yes.

116
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.830
Has he affections in him,

117
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.170
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,

118
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.900
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,

119
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.370
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

120
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:42.400
Which is the least?

121
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.170
If it were damnable, he being so wise,

122
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.000
Why would he for the momentary trick

123
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.630
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

124
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.430
What says my brother?

125
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.300
Death is a fearful thing.

126
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.530
And shamed life a hateful.

127
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.700
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;

128
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.200
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;

129
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.900
This sensible warm motion to become

130
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.700
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit

131
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.600
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside

132
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.070
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;

133
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.600
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,

134
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.930
And blown with restless violence round about

135
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.330
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst

136
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.100
Of those that lawless and incertain thought

137
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.370
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!

138
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.930
The weariest and most loathed worldly life

139
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.600
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment

140
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.600
Can lay on nature is a paradise

141
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.200
To what we fear of death.

142
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.530
Alas, alas!

143
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.930
Sweet sister, let me live:

144
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.400
What sin you do to save a brother's life,

145
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.870
Nature dispenses with the deed so far

146
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.000
That it becomes a virtue.

147
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.300
O you beast!

148
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.470
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!

149
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.970
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?

150
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.830
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life

151
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:18.330
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?

152
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.900
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!

153
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.400
For such a warped slip of wilderness

154
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.870
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!

155
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:29.770
Die, perish! Might but my bending down

156
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.600
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:

157
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.600
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,

158
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.030
No word to save thee.

159
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.330
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

160
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.530
O, fie, fie, fie!

161
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.200
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.

162
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.670
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:

163
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.600
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

164
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.470
O hear me, Isabella!

165
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.270
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

166
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.570
What is your will?

167
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.000
Might you dispense with your leisure,

168
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.230
I would by and by have some speech with you:

169
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.630
the satisfaction I would require

170
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.300
is likewise your own benefit.

171
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.800
I have no superfluous leisure;

172
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.200
my stay must be stolen out of other affairs;

173
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.030
but I will attend you awhile.

174
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.030
Son, I have overheard what hath passed

175
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.930
between you and your sister.

176
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.370
Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her;

177
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.100
only he hath made an essay of her virtue

178
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.470
to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures:

179
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.870
she, having the truth of honour in her,

180
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.530
hath made him that gracious denial

181
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.430
which he is most glad to receive.

182
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.800
I am confessor to Angelo,

183
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.300
and I know this to be true;

184
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.400
therefore prepare yourself to death:

185
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.100
do not satisfy your resolution with hopes

186
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.000
that are fallible:

187
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.800
tomorrow you must die;

188
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.230
go to your knees and make ready.

189
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.730
Let me ask my sister pardon.

190
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.930
I am so out of love with life

191
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.530
that I will sue to be rid of it.

192
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.930
Hold you there: farewell.

193
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.400
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:

194
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.830
the goodness that is cheap in beauty

195
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.500
makes beauty brief in goodness;

196
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.300
but grace, being the soul of your complexion,

197
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.070
shall keep the body of it ever fair.

198
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.630
The assault that Angelo hath made to you,

199
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.100
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding;

200
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.970
and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling,

201
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.500
I should wonder at Angelo.

202
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.700
How will you do to content this substitute,

203
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.800
and to save your brother?

204
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.000
I am now going to resolve him:

205
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.930
I had rather my brother die by the law

206
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.500
than my son should be unlawfully born.

207
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.330
But, O, how much is the good duke

208
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.400
deceived in Angelo!

209
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.900
If ever he return and I can speak to him,

210
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.470
I will open my lips in vain,

211
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.400
or discover his government.

212
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.570
That shall not be much amiss:

213
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.770
Yet, as the matter now stands,

214
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.470
he will avoid your accusation;

215
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.870
he made trial of you only.

216
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.830
Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings:

217
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.370
to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself.

218
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.770
I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously

219
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.330
do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit;

220
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.430
redeem your brother from the angry law;

221
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.000
do no stain to your own gracious person;

222
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.600
and much please the absent duke,

223
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.100
if peradventure he shall ever return

224
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.700
to have hearing of this business.

225
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.600
Let me hear you speak farther.

226
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.600
I have spirit to do anything

227
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.030
that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

228
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.830
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.

229
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.970
Have you not heard speak of Mariana,

230
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.900
the sister of Frederick the great soldier

231
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.170
who miscarried at sea?

232
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.430
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

233
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.870
She should this Angelo have married;

234
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.670
was affianced to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed:

235
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.770
between which time of the contract

236
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.700
and limit of the solemnity,

237
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.470
her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,

238
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.430
having in that perished vessel

239
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.270
the dowry of his sister.

240
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.130
But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:

241
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.130
there she lost a most renowned brother,

242
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.530
in his love toward her ever most kind and natural;

243
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.700
with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune,

244
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.800
her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate husband,

245
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.830
this well-seeming Angelo.

246
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.030
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

247
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.100
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them

248
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.900
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,

249
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.130
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour:

250
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.400
in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation,

251
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.870
which she yet wears for his sake; and he,

252
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.500
a marble to her tears,

253
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.100
is washed with them, but relents not.

254
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.700
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid

255
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.830
from the world! What corruption in this life,

256
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:02.230
that it will let this man live!

257
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.330
But how out of this can she avail?

258
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.900
It is a rupture that you may easily heal:

259
00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.300
and the cure of it not only saves your brother,

260
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.930
but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.

261
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.030
Show me how, good father.

262
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.130
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance

263
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.600
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness,

264
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.470
that in all reason should have quenched her love,

265
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.500
hath made it more violent and unruly.

266
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.900
Go you to Angelo; answer his requiring

267
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.300
with a plausible obedience;

268
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.030
agree with his demands to the point;

269
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.830
only refer yourself to this advantage,

270
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.130
first, that your stay with him may not be long;

271
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.730
that the time may have all shadow and silence in it;

272
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.300
and the place answer to convenience.

273
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.230
This being granted in course,

274
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.030
and now follows all,

275
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.270
we shall advise this wronged maid

276
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.000
to stead up your appointment,

277
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.370
go in your place;

278
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.800
if the encounter

279
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.970
acknowledge itself hereafter,

280
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:59.770
it may compel him to her recompense:

281
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.800
and here, by this, is your brother saved,

282
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.300
your honour untainted,

283
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.330
the poor Mariana advantaged,

284
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.970
and the corrupt deputy scaled.

285
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.970
The maid will I frame

286
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.470
and make fit for his attempt.

287
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.470
If you think well to carry this as you may,

288
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:16.530
the doubleness of the benefit

289
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.130
defends the deceit from reproof.

290
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.230
What think you of it?

291
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.400
The image of it gives me content already;

292
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.270
and I trust it will grow

293
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.070
to a most prosperous perfection.

294
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.370
It lies much in your holding up.

295
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.430
Haste you speedily to Angelo:

296
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.700
if for this night he entreat you

297
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.900
to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction.

298
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.970
I will presently to Saint Luke's:

299
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.200
there, at the moated grange,

300
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.270
resides this dejected Mariana.

301
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.070
At that place call upon me;

302
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.830
and dispatch with Angelo,

303
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.070
that it may be quickly.

304
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:49.400
I thank you for this comfort.

305
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.300
Fare you well, good father.

306
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:04.030
Nay, you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts,

307
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.170
we shall have all the world

308
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.130
drink brown and white bastard.

309
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.930
O heavens! what stuff is here

310
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.370
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries,

311
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.100
the merriest was put down,

312
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.300
and the worser allowed by order of law

313
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.830
a furred gown to keep him warm;

314
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:20.330
and furred with fox and lamb-skins too,

315
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.570
to signify, that craft, being richer than innocency,

316
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.730
stands for the facing.

317
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.600
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

318
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.930
And you, good brother father.

319
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:31.070
What offence hath this man made you, sir?

320
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.200
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law:

321
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.300
and, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir;

322
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:37.330
for we have found upon him

323
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.370
a strange picklock,

324
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.930
which we have sent to the deputy.

325
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.530
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!

326
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.230
The evil that thou causest to be done,

327
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:47.770
That is thy means to live.

328
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.000
Do thou but think

329
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.970
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back

330
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.830
From such a filthy vice:

331
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.770
say to thyself,

332
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.700
From their abominable and beastly touches

333
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:59.070
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.

334
00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.230
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,

335
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.600
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

336
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.300
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir;

337
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.170
but yet, sir, I would prove--

338
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.370
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,

339
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.930
Thou wilt prove his.

340
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.330
Take him to prison, officer:

341
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.230
Correction and instruction must both work

342
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.170
Ere this rude beast will profit.

343
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:19.230
He must before the deputy, sir;

344
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.370
he has given him warning:

345
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.100
the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster:

346
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.070
if he be a whoremonger,

347
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.000
and comes before him,

348
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.200
he were as good go a mile on his errand.

349
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.800
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

350
00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.700
I spy comfort; I cry bail.

351
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.300
Here's a gentleman and a friend of mine.

352
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:41.300
How now, noble Pompey!

353
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.330
What, at the wheels of Caesar?

354
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.470
art thou led in triumph?

355
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.200
What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,

356
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.030
newly made woman, to be had now,

357
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.730
for putting the hand in the pocket

358
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.630
and extracting it clutch'd?

359
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:00.830
What sayest thou, Trot?

360
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.770
Is the world as it was, man?

361
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:06.770
Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how?

362
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.730
The trick of it?

363
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.070
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

364
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.030
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress?

365
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.730
Procures she still, ha?

366
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.700
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef,

367
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.900
she is herself in the tub.

368
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.870
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it;

369
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.430
it must be so:

370
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.630
ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:

371
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.970
an unshunned consequence; it must be so.

372
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.430
Art going to prison, Pompey?

373
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.670
Yes, faith, sir.

374
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.830
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey.

375
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.270
Farewell: go, say I sent thee thither.

376
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.300
For debt, Pompey? or how?

377
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.670
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

378
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.600
Well, then, imprison him:

379
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.800
if imprisonment be the due of a bawd,

380
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.170
why, 'tis his right: bawd is he doubtless,

381
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:54.770
and of antiquity too; bawd-born.

382
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.600
Farewell, good Pompey.

383
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.030
Commend me to the prison, Pompey:

384
00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.430
you will turn good husband now, Pompey;

385
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.600
you will keep the house.

386
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:13.900
Sir, I hope your good worship will be my bail.

387
00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.470
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey;

388
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.170
it is not the wear.

389
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.130
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage:

390
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.030
If you take it not patiently,

391
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.200
why, your mettle is the more.

392
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.030
Adieu, trusty Pompey.

393
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.870
'Bless you, friar.

394
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.470
And you.

395
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.400
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

396
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.300
Come your ways, sir; come.

397
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.970
You will not bail me, then, sir?

398
00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.570
Then, Pompey, nor now.

399
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:49.770
What news abroad, friar? what news?

400
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.000
Come your ways, sir; come.

401
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.

402
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.300
What news, friar, of the duke?

403
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.670
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

404
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.170
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;

405
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.230
other some, he is in Rome:

406
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.830
but where is he, think you?

407
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.130
I know not where; but wheresoever,

408
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.670
I wish him well.

409
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.770
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal

410
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.330
from the state, and usurp the beggary

411
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.200
he was never born to.

412
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.770
Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence;

413
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.600
he puts transgression to 't.

414
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.700
He does well in 't.

415
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.230
A little more lenity to lechery

416
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.700
would do no harm in him:

417
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.870
something too crabbed that way, friar.

418
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.030
It is too general a vice,

419
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.470
and severity must cure it.

420
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.430
Yes, in good sooth,

421
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.870
the vice is of a great kindred;

422
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.200
it is well allied:

423
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.930
but it is impossible to extirp it quite,

424
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.830
friar, till eating and drinking be put down.

425
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.000
They say this Angelo was not made

426
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.300
by man and woman

427
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.430
after this downright way of creation:

428
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:50.970
is it true, think you?

429
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.870
How should he be made, then?

430
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.600
Some report a sea-maid spawned him;

431
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.470
some, that he was begot between two stock-fishes.

432
00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.830
But it is certain that when he makes water

433
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.500
his urine is congealed ice;

434
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.230
that I know to be true:

435
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.800
and he is a motion generative;

436
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.700
that's infallible.

437
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.130
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

438
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.630
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him,

439
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.370
for the rebellion of a codpiece

440
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.430
to take away the life of a man!

441
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:21.900
Would the duke that is absent have done this?

442
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.330
Ere he would have hanged a man

443
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.130
for the getting a hundred bastards,

444
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.500
he would have paid for the nursing a thousand:

445
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.230
he had some feeling of the sport:

446
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.470
he knew the service,

447
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.270
and that instructed him to mercy.

448
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.770
I never heard the absent duke

449
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.930
much detected for women;

450
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.200
he was not inclined that way.

451
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.770
O, sir, you are deceived.

452
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:40.600
'Tis not possible.

453
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.330
Who, not the duke?

454
00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.270
yes, your beggar of fifty;

455
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.670
and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish:

456
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.370
the duke had crotchets in him.

457
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.330
He would be drunk too;

458
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.030
that let me inform you.

459
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.870
You do him wrong, surely.

460
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.970
Sir, I was an inward of his.

461
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:03.000
A shy fellow was the duke:

462
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.470
and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.

463
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.600
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

464
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.500
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked

465
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.070
within the teeth and the lips:

466
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.600
but this I can let you understand,

467
00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.770
the greater file of the subject

468
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.170
held the duke to be wise.

469
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.870
Wise! why, no question but he was.

470
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:27.270
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

471
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.670
Either this is the envy in you,

472
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.170
folly, or mistaking:

473
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.000
the very stream of his life

474
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.400
and the business he hath helmed

475
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.630
must upon a warranted need

476
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.400
give him a better proclamation.

477
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.870
Let him be but testimonied

478
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.070
in his own bringings-forth,

479
00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.270
and he shall appear to the envious a scholar,

480
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.830
a statesman and a soldier.

481
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:47.700
Therefore you speak unskilfully:

482
00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.570
or if your knowledge be more

483
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.830
it is much darkened in your malice.

484
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.430
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

485
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:55.070
Love talks with better knowledge,

486
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.600
and knowledge with dearer love.

487
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.530
Come, sir, I know what I know.

488
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.100
I can hardly believe that,

489
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.600
since you know not what you speak.

490
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.000
But, if ever the duke return,

491
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.400
as our prayers are he may,

492
00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.400
let me desire you to make your answer before him.

493
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400
If it be honest you have spoke,

494
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.970
you have courage to maintain it:

495
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:14.030
I am bound to call upon you;

496
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.100
and, I pray you, your name?

497
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.930
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

498
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:19.700
He shall know you better, sir,

499
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.370
if I live to report you.

500
00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.800
I fear you not.

501
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.570
O, you hope the duke will return no more;

502
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.470
or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.

503
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.730
But indeed I can do you little harm;

504
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.730
you'll forswear this again.

505
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.500
I'll be hanged first:

506
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.500
thou art deceived in me, friar.

507
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.800
But no more of that.

508
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.430
Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?

509
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.230
Why should he die, sir?

510
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.400
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish.

511
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.800
I would the duke we talk of were returned again:

512
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.970
the ungenitured agent

513
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.900
will unpeople the province with continency;

514
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.730
sparrows must not build in his house-eaves,

515
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.170
because they are lecherous.

516
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.500
The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered;

517
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.530
he would never bring them to light:

518
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.330
would he were returned!

519
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.200
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.

520
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:21.730
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me.

521
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:23.100
The duke, I say to thee again,

522
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.200
would eat mutton on Fridays.

523
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.430
He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,

524
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.930
he would mouth with a beggar,

525
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.030
though she smelt brown bread and garlic:

526
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.000
say that I said so. Farewell.

527
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.330
No might nor greatness in mortality

528
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.830
Can censure 'scape;

529
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.300
back-wounding calumny

530
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.970
The whitest virtue strikes.

531
00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.300
What king so strong

532
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.470
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?

533
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.900
Go; away with her to prison!

534
00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.470
Good my lord, be merciful to me;

535
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.470
you are accounted a merciful man; good my lord.

536
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.630
Double and treble admonition,

537
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.430
and still forfeit in the same kind!

538
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:13.400
This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.

539
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.070
A bawd of eleven years' continuance,

540
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.230
may it please your honour.

541
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.770
My lord, this is one Lucio's

542
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.030
information against me.

543
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.670
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him

544
00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.730
in the duke's time; he promised her marriage:

545
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.230
his child is a year and a quarter old,

546
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.970
come Philip and Jacob:

547
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.100
I have kept it myself;

548
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.530
and see how he goes about to abuse me!

549
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.100
That fellow is a fellow of much licence:

550
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.100
let him be called before us.

551
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.030
Away with her to prison!

552
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.970
Go to; no more words.

553
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:46.570
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;

554
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.670
Claudio must die to-morrow:

555
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.770
let him be furnished with divines,

556
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.130
and have all charitable preparation.

557
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.730
if my brother wrought by my pity,

558
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.730
it should not be so with him.

559
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.830
So please you,

560
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.870
this friar hath been with him,

561
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.070
and advised him for the entertainment of death.

562
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.070
Good even, good father.

563
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.300
Bliss and goodness on you!

564
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.230
Of whence are you?

565
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.800
Not of this country,

566
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.830
though my chance is now

567
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.200
To use it for my time:

568
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.600
I am a brother of gracious order,

569
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.600
late come from the See

570
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.330
In special business from his holiness.

571
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.300
What news abroad i' the world?

572
00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.800
None, but that there is so great

573
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.900
a fever on goodness,

574
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.270
that the dissolution of it must cure it:

575
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.000
novelty is only in request;

576
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.700
and it is as dangerous to be aged

577
00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.030
in any kind of course,

578
00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.230
as it is virtuous

579
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.370
to be constant in any undertaking.

580
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:45.130
There is scarce truth enough alive

581
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.900
to make societies secure;

582
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:52.130
but security enough to make fellowships accurst:

583
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.370
much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world.

584
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.170
This news is old enough,

585
00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.870
yet it is every day's news.

586
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:07.570
I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

587
00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.800
One that, above all other strifes,

588
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.330
contended especially to know himself.

589
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.630
What pleasure was he given to?

590
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.530
Rather rejoicing to see another merry,

591
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:21.870
than merry at any thing

592
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.370
which professed to make him rejoice:

593
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.870
a gentleman of all temperance.

594
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.670
But leave we him to his events,

595
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.870
with a prayer they may prove prosperous;

596
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:31.970
and let me desire to know

597
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.870
how you find Claudio prepared.

598
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:36.830
I am made to understand

599
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.370
that you have lent him visitation.

600
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.470
He professes to have received no sinister measure

601
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.230
from his judge,

602
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.030
but most willingly humbles himself

603
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.170
to the determination of justice:

604
00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.870
yet had he framed to himself,

605
00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.770
by the instruction of his frailty,

606
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.400
many deceiving promises of life;

607
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.630
which I by my good patience have discredited to him,

608
00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.270
and now is he resolved to die.

609
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.930
You have paid the heavens your function,

610
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.100
and the prisoner the very debt of your calling.

611
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.530
I have laboured for the poor gentleman

612
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.400
to the extremest shore of my modesty:

613
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.570
but my brother justice have I found so severe,

614
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.770
that he hath forced me to tell him

615
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.200
he is indeed Justice.

616
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.370
If his own life answer

617
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.970
the straitness of his proceeding,

618
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.300
it shall become him well;

619
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.000
wherein if he chance to fail,

620
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.800
he hath sentenced himself.

621
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.030
I am going to visit the prisoner.

622
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.000
Fare you well.

623
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.500
Peace be with you!

624
00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.000
He who the sword of heaven will bear

625
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.900
Should be as holy as severe;

626
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.670
Pattern in himself to know,

627
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.730
Grace to stand, and virtue go;

628
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.230
More nor less to others paying

629
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.970
Than by self-offences weighing.

630
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.770
Shame to him whose cruel striking

631
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.670
Kills for faults of his own liking!

632
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.630
Twice treble shame on Angelo,

633
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:17.270
To weed my vice and let his grow!

634
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:19.430
O, what may man within him hide,

635
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.830
Though angel on the outward side!

636
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.500
How may likeness made in crimes,

637
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.900
Making practise on the times,

638
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.900
To draw with idle spiders' strings

639
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:36.570
Most ponderous and substantial things!

640
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.230
Craft against vice I must apply:

641
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.400
With Angelo to-night shall lie

642
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.400
His old betrothed but despised;

643
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.170
So disguise shall, by the disguised,

644
00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.270
Pay with falsehood false exacting,

645
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.400
And perform an old contracting.

646
00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.930
