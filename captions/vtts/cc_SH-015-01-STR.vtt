00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:52.700


2
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.000
Nay, but this dotage of ourgeneral's overflows the measure.

3
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.900
Those his goodly eyes that overthe files

4
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.400
and musters of the war haveglowed like plated Mars

5
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
now bend, now turn the officeand devotion

6
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.300
of their view upon a tawnyfront.

7
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.570
His captain's heart, which, inthe scuffles of great fights,

8
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.300
hath burst the buckles on hisbreast,

9
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.570
reneges all temper

10
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
and is become the bellows andthe fan to cool a gypsy's lust.

11
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.400
Here they come.

12
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.570
Take a good note,

13
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.900
and you will see in him, thetriple pillar of the world,

14
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.630
transformed into a strumpet'sfool.

15
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.000
If it be love indeed, tell mehow much.

16
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.830
There's beggary in the love thatcan be reckoned.

17
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.830
I'll set a bourn how far to bebeloved.

18
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.730
Then must thou needs find outnew heaven, new earth.

19
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.030
News, my good lord, from Rome.

20
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.300
Grates me: the sum.

21
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.100
Nay, hear them, Antony.

22
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400
Fulvia perchance is angry,

23
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.270
or who knows if thescarce-bearded Caesar

24
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.330
have not sent his powerfulmandate to you?

25
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.730
"Do this or this.

26
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.330
"Take in that kingdom andenfranchise that.

27
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.600
Perform it, or else we damnthee."

28
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.170
Oh, my love.

29
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.030
Perchance nay and most like:

30
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.370
You must not stay here longer.

31
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.000
Your dismission is come fromCaesar.

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.400
Therefore, hear it, Antony.

33
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.770
Where's Fulvia's process?

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.800
Caesar's I would say? Both?

35
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.830
As I am Egypt's queen, thoublushest, Antony,

36
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.730
and that blood of thine isCaesar's homager.

37
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.400
Else so thy cheek pays shame

38
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.500
when shrill-tongued Fulviascolds.

39
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.230
The messengers.

40
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770
Let Rome in Tiber melt

41
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.300
and the wide arch of the rangedempire fall.

42
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.400
Here is my space.

43
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.470
Kingdoms are clay.

44
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.500
Our dungy earth alike feedsbeast as man.

45
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.130
The nobleness of life is to dothus.

46
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.970
When such a mutual pair and sucha twain can do it,

47
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.770
in which I bind on pain ofpunishment

48
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.470
the world to weet, we stand uppeerless.

49
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.800
Excellent falsehood.

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
Why, did he marry Fulvia and notlove her?

51
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.330
I'll seem the fool, I am not.

52
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.200
Antony will be himself.

53
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.630
But stirred by Cleopatra.

54
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.570
Now, for the love of love andher soft hours,

55
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.530
let's not confound the time withconference harsh.

56
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.070
There's not a minute of ourlives should stretch

57
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.600
without some pleasure now.

58
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.800
What sport tonight?

59
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.130
Hear the ambassadors.

60
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.770
Fie, wrangling queen,

61
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.770
whom everything becomes tochide, to laugh, to weep,

62
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.270
whose every passion fullystrives

63
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.800
to make itself in thee fair andadmired!

64
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.870
No messenger but thine.

65
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.870
And all alone tonight we'llwander through the streets

66
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.800
and note the qualities ofpeople.

67
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.070
Come, my queen.

68
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.070
Last night, you did desire it.Speak not to us.

69
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.170
Is Caesar with Antonius prizedso slight?

70
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.070
Sir, sometimes when he is notAntony,

71
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.130
he comes too short of that greatproperty,

72
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.430
which still should go withAntony.

73
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.430
I am full sorry he approves thecommon liar,

74
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.070
who thus speaks of him at Rome.

75
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.570
I'll have of better deedstomorrow.

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.570
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, mostanything Alexas,

77
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.930
almost most absolute Alexas,

78
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.400
where's the soothsayer

79
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.100
that you praised so to thequeen?

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.130
Soothsayer.

81
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.370
Your will?

82
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.600
Is this the man?

83
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.530
Is it you, sir, that knowthings?

84
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.470
In nature's infinite book ofsecrecy, a little I can read.

85
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.000
Show him your hand.

86
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.930
Good sir, give me good fortune.

87
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.430
I make not but foresee.

88
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.830
Pray, then, foresee me one.

89
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.270
You shall be yet far fairer thanyou are.

90
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.630
He means in flesh.

91
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.370
No, you shall paint when you'reold.

92
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.470
Wrinkles forbid!

93
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.130
Vex not his prescience; beattentive.

94
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.230
Hush.

95
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.970
You shall be more beloving thanbeloved.

96
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.230
I'd rather heat my liver withdrinking.

97
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.230
Nay, hear him.

98
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.130
Good now, some excellentfortune.

99
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.500
Let me be married to three kingsin a forenoon

100
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.330
and widow them all.

101
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.530
Find me to marry me withOctavius Caesar,

102
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.270
and companion me with mymistress.

103
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.030
You shall outlive the lady whomyou serve.

104
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.470
Excellent! I love long lifebetter than figs.

105
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.570
You have seen and proved afairer former fortune

106
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.100
than that which is to approach.

107
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.930
Prithee, how many boys andwenches must I have?

108
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.300
If every of your wishes had awomb

109
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.900
and fertile every wish, amillion.

110
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.230
Out, fool! I forgive thee for awitch.

111
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.570
You think none but your sheetsare privy to your wishes.

112
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.000
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

113
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.930
We'll know all our fortunes.

114
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.070
Mine and most of our fortunestonight

115
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.600
shall be drunk to bed.

116
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.930
There's a palm presageschastity, if nothing else.

117
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.100
Even as the o'erflowing Niluspresageth famine?

118
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.800
Go, you wild bedfellow.

119
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.900
You cannot soothsay.

120
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.130
Prithee, tell her but aworky-day fortune.

121
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.370
Your fortunes are alike.

122
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.000
Oh, but how? But how?

123
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Give me particulars.

124
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.130
I have said.

125
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.270
Am I not an inch of fortunebetter than she?

126
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.670
Well, if you were but an inch offortune better than I,

127
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.430
where would you choose it?

128
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.970
Not in my husband's nose.

129
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.600
Our worser thoughts heavensmend!

130
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.730
Alexas, come; his fortune, hisfortune.

131
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.200
Let him marry a woman thatcannot go,

132
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.300
sweet Isis, I beseech thee!

133
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.370
And let her die too and give hima worse.

134
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.400
And let worse follow worse,

135
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.830
till the worst of all follow himlaughing to his grave,

136
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.970
fifty-fold a cuckold!

137
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.170
Amen.

138
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.600
Dear goddess, hear that prayerof the people,

139
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.170
for as it is a heartbreaking

140
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.170
to see a handsome manloose-wived,

141
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.700
so it is a deadly sorrow

142
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.870
to behold a foul knaveuncuckolded.

143
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.130
Saw you my lord?

144
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.130
No, lady.

145
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.130
Was he not here?

146
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.130
No, madam.

147
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.700
He was disposed to mirth,

148
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.800
but on the sudden a Romanthought hath struck him.

149
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800
Enobarbus!

150
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Madam?

151
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.630
Seek him and bring him hither.

152
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.670
Where's Alexas?

153
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.800
Here, at your service.

154
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.670
My lord approaches.

155
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.800
We will not look upon him.

156
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.670
Go with us.

157
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.900
Fulvia, thy wife, first cameinto the field.

158
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.900
Against my brother Lucius?

159
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.200
Aye, but soon that war had end,

160
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.470
and the time's state madefriends of them,

161
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.230
jointing their force againstCaesar

162
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.370
whose better issue in the warfrom Italy

163
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.670
upon the first encounter dravethem.

164
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.870
Well, what worst?

165
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.970
The nature of bad news infectsthe teller.

166
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.530
When it concerns the fool orcoward.

167
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.300
On, things that are past aredone with me.

168
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.030
'Tis thus who tells me true,though in his tale lie death,

169
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.470
I hear him as he flattered.

170
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.900
Labienusó this is stiff newsó

171
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.500
hath with his Parthian forceextended Asia from Euphrates.

172
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.130
His conquering banner shook

173
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.300
from Syria to Lydia and toIonia, whilstó

174
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.870
Antony, thou wouldst sayó

175
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.870
Oh, my lord.

176
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.100
Speak to me home.

177
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.500
Mince not the general tongue.

178
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.330
Name Cleopatra as she is calledin Rome.

179
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.200
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase,

180
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.100
and taunt my faults with suchfull licence

181
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.700
as both truth and malice havepower to utter.

182
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.100
Then we bring forth weeds

183
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.530
when our quick minds lie still

184
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.100
and our ills told us is as ourearing.

185
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.730
Fare thee well awhile.

186
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.470
At your noble pleasure.

187
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.230
These strong Egyptian fetters Imust break

188
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.900
or lose myself in dotage.

189
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.230
What are you?

190
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.030
Fulvia, thy wife, is dead.

191
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.800
Where died she?

192
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.370
In Sicyon.

193
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.700
Her length of sickness with whatelse more serious

194
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.000
importeth thee to know, thisbears.

195
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.330
Forbear me.

196
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.930
There's a great spirit gone!

197
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.430
Thus did I desire it.

198
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.870
What our contempts doth oftenhurl from us,

199
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.170
we wish it ours again.

200
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.970
The present pleasure byrevolution

201
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.470
lowerings become the opposite ofitself.

202
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.570
She's good being gone.

203
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.400
The hand could pluck her backthat shoved her on.

204
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.700
I must from this enchantingqueen break off.

205
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.100
Ten thousand harms more than theills

206
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.470
that I know my idleness dothhatch.

207
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.970
How now. Enobarbus.

208
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.500
What's your pleasure, sir?

209
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.900
I must with haste from hence.

210
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.000
Why, then, we kill all ourwomen.

211
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We see how mortal an unkindnessis to them.

212
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.470
If they suffer our departure,death's the word.

213
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.630
I must be gone.

214
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.900
Under a compelling occasion, letwomen die.

215
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.370
It were pity to cast them awayfor nothing.

216
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.430
Though between them and a greatcause,

217
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.470
they should be esteemed nothing.

218
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.600
Cleopatra, catching but theleast noise of this,

219
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.070
dies instantly.

220
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.200
I've seen her die twenty timesupon a far poorer moment.

221
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.200
I do think there is mettle indeath,

222
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.970
which commits some loving actupon her.

223
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.870
She hath such a celerity indying.

224
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.530
She is cunning past man'sthought.

225
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.900
Alack, sir, no.

226
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.770
Her passions are made of nothing

227
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.530
but the finest part of purelove.

228
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.330
We cannot call her winds andwaters, sighs and tears.

229
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.000
They are greater storms andtempests

230
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.230
than almanacs can report.

231
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.530
Would I had never seen her.

232
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.630
Oh, sir.

233
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.770
You had then left unseen awonderful piece of work,

234
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.900
which not to have been blestwithal

235
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.630
would have discredited yourtravel.

236
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.830
Fulvia is dead.

237
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.800
Sir?

238
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.070
Fulvia is dead.

239
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.170
Fulvia?

240
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.830
Dead!

241
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.770
Why, sir, give the gods athankful sacrifice.

242
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.430
When it pleaseth their deities

243
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.430
to take the wife of a man fromhim,

244
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.670
it shows to man the tailors ofthe earth,

245
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.070
comforting therein that when oldrobes are worn out,

246
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.670
there are members to make new.

247
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.070
If there were no more women butFulvia,

248
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.370
then had you indeed a cut andthe case to be lamented.

249
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.600
The tears live in an onion thatshould water this sorrow.

250
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.900
The business she hath broachedin the state

251
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.300
cannot endure my absence.

252
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.000
The business you have broachedhere

253
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.500
cannot be without you,

254
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.970
especially that of Cleopatra,

255
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.770
which wholly depends on yourabode.

256
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.900
No more light answers.

257
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.470
Let our officers have noticewhat we purpose.

258
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.470
I shall break the cause of ourexpedience to the queen

259
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.330
and get her leave to part.

260
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.130
For not alone the death ofFulvia

261
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.200
with more urgent touches dostrongly speak to us,

262
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.370
but the letters, too, of manyour contriving friends

263
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.770
in Rome petition us at home.

264
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.530
Sextus Pompeius hath given thedare to Caesar

265
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.800
and commands the empire of thesea.

266
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.230
Say our pleasure to such whoseplace is under us

267
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.830
requires our quick remove fromhence.

268
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.500
I shall do it.

269
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.930
Where is he?

270
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.230
See where he is,

271
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.430
who's with him, what he does.

272
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.770
I did not send you.

273
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.870
If you find him sad, say I amdancing.

274
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.700
If in mirth, report that I amsudden sick.

275
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.770
Quick and return.

276
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:01.830
Madam, methinks if you did lovehim dearly,

277
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.370
you do not hold the method toenforce the like from him.

278
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.600
What should I do, I do not?

279
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.270
In each thing, give him way.Cross him in nothing.

280
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.630
Thou teachest like a fool theway to lose him.

281
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.730
Tempt him not so too far, I wishforbear.

282
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.470
In time we hate that which weoften fear.

283
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.000
But here comes Antony.

284
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.370
I am sick and sullen.

285
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.170
I am sorry to give breathing tomy purpose.

286
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.370
Help me away, dear Charmian; Ishall fall.

287
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.870
It cannot be thus long.

288
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.370
The sides of nature will notsustain it.

289
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.070
Now, my dearest queenó

290
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.030
Pray you, stand farther from me.

291
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.330
What's the matter?

292
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.470
I know by that same eye there'ssome good news.

293
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.070
What says the married woman?

294
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.570
You may go.

295
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.430
Would she had never given youleave to come!

296
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.400
Let her not say 'tis I that keepyou here.

297
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.500
I have no power upon you; hersyou are.

298
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.800
The gods best knowó

299
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.470
Oh, never was there a queen somightily betrayed.

300
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.500
Yet at the first, I saw thetreasons planted.

301
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.600
Cleopatraó

302
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
Why should I think you can bemine and true

303
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.130
though you in swearing shake thethroned gods

304
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.900
who have been false to Fulvia?

305
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.100
Most sweet queenó

306
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.800
Nay, pray you, seek no color foryour going

307
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.100
but bid farewell and go.

308
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.730
When you sued staying, then wasthe time for words.

309
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.800
No going then.

310
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.670
Eternity was in our lips andeyes,

311
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.200
bliss in our brows bent.

312
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.370
None our parts so poor but was arace of heaven.

313
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.570
They are so still.

314
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.430
Or thou, the greatest soldier ofthe world,

315
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:32.670
art turned the greatest liar.

316
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.670
How now, lady!

317
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.900
I would I had thy inches.

318
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.800
Thou shouldst know there were aheart in Egypt.

319
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.100
Hear me, queen.

320
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.730
The strong necessity of timecommands our services awhile,

321
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:48.070
but my full heart remains in usewith you.

322
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.130
Our Italy shines o'er with civilswords.

323
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.630
Sextus Pompeius makes hisapproaches to the port of Rome.

324
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.270
Equality of two domestic powersbreed scrupulous faction.

325
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.730
The hated, grown to strength,are newly grown to love.

326
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.730
My more particular

327
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.200
and that which most with youshould safe my going

328
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.530
is Fulvia's death.

329
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.930
Though age from folly could notgive me freedom,

330
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.630
it does from childishness.

331
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.730
Can Fulvia die?

332
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.570
She's dead, my queen.

333
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.030
Look here,

334
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.930
and at thy sovereign leisureread the garboils she awaked.

335
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:40.200
At the last best, see when andwhere she died.

336
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.230
O most false love!

337
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.500
Where be the sacred vials

338
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.730
thou shouldst fill withsorrowful water?

339
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.300
Now I see, I see in Fulvia'sdeath,

340
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.730
how mine received shall be.

341
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.770
Quarrel no more, but be preparedto know the purposes I bear,

342
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.500
which are or cease as you shallgive the advice.

343
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.870
By the fire that quickens Nilus'slime,

344
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.800
I go from hence thy soldier,servant,

345
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.300
making peace or war as thouaffect'st.

346
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.000
Cut my lace, Charmian, come, butlet it be.

347
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.700
I am quickly ill and well, soAntony loves.

348
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.300
My precious queen, forbear,

349
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.900
and give true evidence to hislove,

350
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.430
which stands an honorable trial.

351
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.530
So Fulvia told me.

352
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.830
I prithee, turn aside and weepfor her,

353
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.530
then bid adieu to me and say thetears belong to Egypt.

354
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.270
Good now, play one scene ofexcellent dissembling

355
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.900
and let it look like perfecthonor.

356
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.230
You'll heat my blood no more.

357
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.500
You can do better yet, but thisis meetly.

358
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.670
I'll leave you, lady.

359
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.370
Courteous lord, one word, sir.

360
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.000
You and I must part.

361
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.430
Oh, that's not it.

362
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:58.000
Sir, you and I have loved, butthere's not it.

363
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.200
That you know well ,something itis I would.

364
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.370
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,

365
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.370
and I am all forgotten.

366
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.500
But that your royalty holdsidleness your subject,

367
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.430
I should take you for idlenessitself.

368
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.330
Sir, forgive me.

369
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.230
Since my becomings kill me whenthey do not eye well to you.

370
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.500
Your honor calls you hence.

371
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.000
Therefore, be deaf to myunpitied folly,

372
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.070
and all the gods go with you.

373
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.030
Upon your sword sit laurelvictory,

374
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.770
and smooth success be strewedbefore your feet.

375
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.200
Let us go. Come.

376
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.830
Our separation so abides andflies

377
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.930
that thou residing here goes yetwith me,

378
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.730
and I, hence fleeting here,remain with thee.

379
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.400
Away.

380
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.170
You may see, Lepidus, andhenceforth know

381
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.630
it is not Caesar's natural viceto hate our great competitor.

382
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.030
From Alexandria, this is thenews.

383
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:32.700
He fishes, drinks, and wastesthe lamps of night in revel.

384
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.730
Is not more man-like thanCleopatra.

385
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.330
Nor the queen of Ptolemy morewomanly than he.

386
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.300
Hardly gave audience

387
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.600
or vouchsafed to think he hadpartners.

388
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.830
You shall find there a man whois the abstract

389
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.630
of all faults that all menfollow.

390
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:54.100
I must not think there are evilsenough to darken all hisgoodness.

391
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.870
His faults in him seem as thespots of heavenó

392
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.470
more fiery by night's blackness,

393
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.570
hereditary rather thanpurchased,

394
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.800
what he cannot change than whathe chooses.

395
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.000
You are too indulgent.

396
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.870
Let's grant, it is not amiss totumble on the bed of Ptolemy,

397
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.530
to give a kingdom for a mirth,

398
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.400
to sit and keep the turn oftippling with a slave,

399
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.470
to reel the streets at noon

400
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.270
and stand the buffet with knavesthat smell of sweat.

401
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.370
Say this becomes him.

402
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.230
As his composure must be rareindeed

403
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.830
whom these things cannotblemish,

404
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.870
yet must Antony no way excusehis foils

405
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.100
when we do bear so great weightin his lightness.

406
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.270
If he filled his vacancy withhis voluptuousness,

407
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.530
full surfeits and the dryness ofhis bones call on him for it.

408
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.000
But to confound such time thatdrums him from his sport

409
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.470
and speaks as loud as his ownstate and ours,

410
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.400
'tis to be chid

411
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.900
as we rate boys, who, beingmature in knowledge,

412
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.100
pawn their experience to theirpresent pleasure

413
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.800
and so rebel to judgment.

414
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.570
Here's more news.

415
00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.330
Thy biddings have been done.

416
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.900
And every hour, most nobleCaesar,

417
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.100
shalt thou have report how 'tisabroad.

418
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.800
Pompey is strong at sea,

419
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.330
and it appears he is beloved bythose that only have fearedCaesar.

420
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
To the ports the discontentsrepair,

421
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.400
and men's reports give him muchwronged.

422
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.400
I should have known no less.

423
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.900
It hath been taught us from theprimal state

424
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.200
that he which is was wisheduntil he were.

425
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.070
And the ebbed man, ne'er lovedtill ne'er worth love,

426
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.630
comes deared by being lacked.

427
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.900
This common body,

428
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.670
like to a vagabond flag upon thestream,

429
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.130
goes to and back, lackeying thevarying tide

430
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.070
to rot itself with motion.

431
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.370
Caesar, I bring thee word,

432
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.800
Menecrates and Menas, famouspirates,

433
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.430
make the sea serve them,

434
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.970
which they ear and wound withkeels of every kind.

435
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.000
Many hot inroads they make inItaly.

436
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.800
The borders maritime lack bloodto think on't

437
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.570
and flush youth revolt.

438
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.530
No vessel can peep forth, but'tis as soon taken as seen,

439
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.230
for Pompey's name strikes morethan could his war resisted.

440
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.030
Antony, leave thy lasciviouswassails.

441
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.830
When thou once was beaten fromModena,

442
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.800
where thou slewest Hirtius andPansa, consuls,

443
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.630
at thy heel did famine follow,

444
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.030
whom thou fought'st against,though daintily brought up,

445
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.570
with patience more than savagescould suffer.

446
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.730
Thou didst drink the stale ofhorses

447
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.000
and the gilded puddle whichbeasts would cough at.

448
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.100
Thy palate then did deign theroughest berry on the rudesthedge.

449
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.000
Yea, like the stag, when snowthe pasture sheets,

450
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.770
the barks of trees thou browsed.

451
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.570
On the Alps, it is reported thoudidst eat strange flesh,

452
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.030
which some did die to look on.

453
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.270
And all thisó

454
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.400
it wounds thine honor that Ispeak it nowó

455
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.400
was borne so like a soldier

456
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.470
that thy cheek so much as lankednot.

457
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.070
'Tis pity of him.

458
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.800
Let his shames quickly drive himto Rome.

459
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.570
'Tis time we twain did showourselves in the field.

460
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.800
To that end, assemble weimmediate council.

461
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.670
Pompey thrives in our idleness.

462
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.200
Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall befurnished to inform you rightly

463
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.630
both what by sea and land I canbe able to front this presenttime.

464
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.700
Till which encounter, it is mybusiness too. Farewell.

465
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.800
Farewell, my lord.

466
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.230
What you shall know of meantimestirs abroad,

467
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.300
I shall beseech you, sir, to letme be partaker.

468
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.470
Doubt not, sir; I knew it for mybond.

469
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.270
Charmian.

470
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.400
Madam?

471
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.770
Give me to drink mandragora.

472
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.600
Why, madam?

473
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.400
That I might sleep out thisgreat gap of time my Antony isaway.

474
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.830
You think of him too much.

475
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.470
O, 'tis treason.

476
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.830
Madam, I trust not so.

477
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.830
Thou, eunuch Mardian!

478
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.400
What's your majesty pleasure?

479
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.000
Not now to hear thee sing.

480
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.530
I take no pleasure in aught aneunuch has.

481
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.330
Hast thou affections?

482
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.570
Yes, gracious madam.

483
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.730
Indeed!

484
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.130
Not in deed, madam, for I can donothing,

485
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.000
but what indeed is honest to bedone.

486
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.130
Yet have I fierce affections

487
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.170
and think what Venus did withMars.

488
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.570
O Charmian,

489
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.200
where think'st thou he is now?

490
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.130
Stands he, or sits he?

491
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.800
Or does he walk, or is he on hishorse?

492
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.870
O happy horse, to bear theweight of Antony!

493
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:56.070
Do bravely, horse, for wot'stthou whom thou movest?

494
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.270
The demi-Atlas of this earth,

495
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.000
the arm and burgonet of men.

496
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.270
He's speaking now

497
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:11.130
or murmuring, "Where's myserpent of old Nile?"ó

498
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.630
so he calls me.

499
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.700
Now I feed myself with mostdelicious poison.

500
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.730
Think on me,

501
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.830
that I am with Phoebus' amorouspinches black

502
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.300
and wrinkled deep in time.

503
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.300
Broad-fronted Caesar,

504
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.930
when thou wast here above theground,

505
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.630
I was a morsel for a monarch.

506
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.770
And great Pompey would stand

507
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.300
and make his eyes grow in mybrow.

508
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.000
There would he anchor his aspectand die

509
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.370
with looking on his life.

510
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.270
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

511
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.830
How much unlike art thou MarkAntony.

512
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.270
Yet coming from him,

513
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.770
that great medicine hath withhis tinct gilded thee.

514
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.100
How goes it with my brave MarkAntony?

515
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.070
Last thing he did, dear queen,

516
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.800
he kissedóthe last of manydoubled kissesó

517
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.370
this orient pearl.

518
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.170
His speech sticks in my heart.

519
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.170
Mine ear must pluck it thence.

520
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.670
"Good friend," quoth he,

521
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.500
"say, the firm Roman to greatEgypt

522
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.300
"sends this treasure of anoyster

523
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.030
"at whose foot to mend the pettypresent,

524
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.230
"I will piece her opulent thronewith kingdoms.

525
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:38.570
All the east, say thou, shallcall her mistress."

526
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.630
What was he, sad or merry?

527
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.170
Like to the time of the year

528
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.270
between the extremes of hot andcold,

529
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.770
he was nor sad nor merry.

530
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.630
O well-divided disposition!

531
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.030
Note him; note him, goodCharmian.

532
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.430
'Tis the man, but note him.

533
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.770
He was not sad,

534
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.170
for he would shine on those thatmake their looks by his.

535
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.170
He was not merry, which seemedto tell them

536
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.770
his remembrance lay in Egyptwith his joy,

537
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.030
but between both.

538
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.700
O heavenly mingle!

539
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.970
Be'st thou sad or merry.

540
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:20.100
The violence of either theebecomes so does it no man else.

541
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.370
