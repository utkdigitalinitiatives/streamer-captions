00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.300
AT HONG KONG
UNIVERSITY.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.930
>>IN RECENT WRITINGS,
DR. JING YIN VIEWS

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.230
GOVERNMENT EFFORTS
TO "MANAGE" BUDDHISM

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.900
WITH SOME SUSPICION.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.600
MANY SACRED SITES ARE NOW
BUDDHIST THEME PARKS,

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.930
HE SAYS.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.460
STATE-SPONSORED BUDDHISM
IS BECOMING BIG BUSINESS

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.700
OF THE SORT THE
GOVERNMENT ENDORSES

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.760
IN SPORTS
AND THE ARTS.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.360

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.660
HE BELIEVES CHINA'S
COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.830
AIMS TO USE RELIGION AS
A STRATEGY FOR SURVIVAL.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.000
THERE'S A CRISIS
OF BELIEF IN CHINA.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.160
PEOPLE USED TO
BELIEVE IN COMMUNISM

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.900
AND THAT ISN'T
THE CASE ANYMORE.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.800
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING
FOR ALTERNATIVES

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.700
AND RELIGION
IS ONE OF THESE.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.630
ALSO, THE GOVERNMENT
IS USING RELIGION

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.760
AS A KIND OF LEVER
TO PROMOTE NATIONALISM,

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.730
TO PROMOTE
CHINESE CULTURE,

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.730
TO PROP UP ITS
OWN SUPPORT AMONGST THE PEOPLE.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.930
TRANSLATOR: I HOPE
BUDDHISM WILL BE FURTHER

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:29.230
PROMOTED AND RESTORED
IN THIS SPECIAL TIME.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.760
>>CHINA'S MOST POWERFUL
LEADERS AIM TO

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.330
BIND RELIGION TO
BUSINESS, POLITICS,

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:39.760
AND FOREIGN RELATIONS.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:53.660
I AM VERY HAPPY TO
BE HERE WITH YOU.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.600
THIS TIME I'M
SPEAKING TO YOU

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.730
AS AN HONORARY CITIZEN
OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.700
>>AS THE WORLD'S MOST
REVERED BUDDHIST,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.930
THE DALAI LAMA, HEAD OF THE
TIBETAN GOVERNMENT IN EXILE,

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:12.600
POSSIBLY KNOWS MORE
ABOUT RELIGION IN CHINA

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.730
THAN ANYONE
ELSE ALIVE.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.030
AND A LOT OF WHAT HE'S
SEEN THROUGH THE DECADES

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:19.160
SINCE THE CHINESE FORCED
HIM OUT OF HIS COUNTRY

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.100
HASN'T BEEN PRETTY.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.930
SIXTY YEARS AFTER THE
CHINESE CLAIMED TIBET

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.200
AND ITS THREE
MILLION INHABITANTS,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.930
THE DALAI LAMA
PROTESTS WHAT HE TERMS

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.160
"A CULTURAL GENOCIDE".

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.000
BY SOME ESTIMATES, AS MANY
AS A MILLION TIBETANS DIED

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.960
AND SIX THOUSAND
MONASTERIES AND TEMPLES

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.330
WERE DESTROYED BY
CHINESE OFFICIALS.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.930
IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE
TORCH WAS LIT TO LAUNCH

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.460
THE BEIJING OLYMPICS
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.930
UNLEASHED A HEAVILY
ARMED RESPONSE

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:54.800
TO PROTESTS AMONG
MONKS AND TIBETANS.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.260
WESTERN SUPPORT OF THE DALAI
LAMA CONTINUES TO GROW.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.760
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
SAYS IT WILL NOT NEGOTIATE

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.930
WITH A SEPARATIST.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:12.460
THE DALAI LAMA
DENIES BEING THAT.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.430
TIBETAN BUDDHISM ISN'T
JUST ABOUT SPIRITUALITY.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.600
TRADITIONALLY, THE
BUDDHIST LEADERS IN TIBET

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.560
HAVE ALSO BEEN THE
LEADERS OF THE COUNTRY.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.700
AND THEREFORE, FOR THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT,

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.730
THE QUESTION OF TIBETAN
BUDDHISM IS ESSENTIALLY

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.730
A POLITICAL QUESTION:
WHO HAS AUTHORITY

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:28.500
OVER THE
LAND OF TIBET?

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.130
>>JAMES MILLER OF QUEENS
UNIVERSITY SAYS BEIJING

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.230
HAS BEEN TOUGH ON
TIBETAN BUDDHISM

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.960
BECAUSE OF ITS
POLITICAL CORE.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.360
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS
VERY HAPPY TO TOLERATE

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.730
RELIGION SO LONG AS IT
CONFINES ITSELF TO THESE

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.760
KINDS OF SPIRITUAL
QUESTIONS - QUESTIONS OF

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.800
BELIEF AND PRACTICE AND
THAT KIND OF THING

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.000
- BUT WHEN A RELIGION
SPILLS OVER INTO THE

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.960
POLITICAL ARENA,
THIS IS SOMETHING

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.830
THAT IS DANGEROUS FOR
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.760
AND THIS IS THE BIG
PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.000
IN DEALING WITH THE
DALAI LAMA AND TIBET.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.630
>>BUT POLITICAL BUDDHISM
IN TIBET ISN'T THE ONLY

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.960
RELIGIOUS THORN
DIGGING AT BEIJING.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.060
IN 1999 THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT, WHICH WAS

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.060
GRADUALLY RELAXING
RELIGIOUS RESTRICTIONS,

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.000
GOT A NASTY SHOCK WHEN
10,000 WORSHIPPERS

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.500
STAGED A SURPRISE RALLY
IN CENTRAL BEIJING.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:19.900
A POLICE CRACKDOWN
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.430
PUBLIC EVENTS IN CENTRAL
BEIJING ARE TIGHTLY

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:25.000
CONTROLLED - ESPECIALLY
NEAR THE HOLY SHRINE OF

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.430
CHINESE COMMUNISM, THE
TOMB OF MAO TSE-TUNG.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.000
THE WORSHIPPERS WERE
MEMBERS OF A NEW RELIGIOUS

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.660
MOVEMENT CALLED FALUN GONG
WHICH USED A RANGE OF

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:37.930
POWERFUL SYMBOLS TO
WEAVE TOGETHER ELEMENTS

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:41.060
OF BUDDHISM, TAOISM,
CONFUCIANISM,

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:48.360
AND TRADITIONAL HEALING
PRACTICES KNOWN AS QIGONG.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.160
AT THE HEAD OF THE FALUN
GONG IS LI HONGZHI,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.460
A CHARISMATIC LEADER AND
FORMER COMMUNIST OFFICIAL

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.630
EXILED IN AMERICA WHO
BUNDLED HIS KNOWLEDGE OF

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:02.700
BUDDHISM AND OTHER FAITHS
INTO A NEW PACKAGE.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.060
IN THIS RARE 1999
INTERVIEW HE ADDRESSED

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.960
OFFICIAL CLAIMS HE
ATTRACTED 100 MILLION

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.230
FOLLOWERS WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT APPROVAL.

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.330
TRANSLATOR: FOR ORDINARY
PEOPLE FALUN GONG HAS A

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.600
MIRACLE EFFECT TO CURE
PEOPLE OF THEIR ILLNESSES.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.700
>>THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
IS NOT AMUSED BY

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.330
FALUN GONG, CLAIMING
IT IS CONTROLLED FROM

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:29.330
OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY BY
A MAN ABOVE CHINESE LAW.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.930
THE FALUN GONG WAS
BANNED AND FOLLOWERS

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.460
WERE RUTHLESSLY
REPRESSED, ACCORDING TO

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.700
NUMEROUS CREDIBLE
HUMAN RIGHTS AGENCIES.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.200
TRANSLATOR: WE DON'T GET
INVOLVED IN POLITICS.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.360
IT IS TABOO FOR
PRACTITIONERS

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.600
TO GET INVOLVED
IN POLITICS.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.060
I ALWAYS TELL MY
PRACTITIONERS, IF THEY

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:52.000
DON'T LOVE THEIR ENEMY
THEY WON'T BE ENLIGHTENED.

FREEDOM, ASSERTING CONTROL
WHETHER IN TIBET, BEIJING,

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.830

TRANSLATOR: NO ONE CAN
EXPECT THE RISEN CHINESE

TO SWALLOW
BITTER FRUIT

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.400
THAT WOULD HARM ITS
FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.960
WE CANNOT SWALLOW IT.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.400
>>WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.900
IS FAR FROM PERFECT,
THE MINISTER PROTESTS

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.960
AGAINST FOREIGN
CRITICISM.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.200
TRANSLATOR: CHINA IS
NOT ALL SO PERFECT.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.560
THERE ARE MANY PLACES TO
BE DEVELOPED AND IMPROVED.

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.630
WE KNOW THERE ARE
MANY PROBLEMS.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.060
BUT CHINA IS
NOT SO BAD

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.430
AS IT IS IN SOME
PEOPLES' EYES.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.030
THE FOREIGN MEDIA,
ESPECIALLY THE ONES

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.530
IN THE U.S., MANY
ARE RIGHT-WING.

WHATEVER THE
CASE IS,

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.400
THEY WOULD SAY
THAT YOU ARE BAD.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.860
AND THE MEDIA LIKE TO
REPORT NEGATIVE THINGS.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.130
DOG BITING MAN
IS NOT NEWS,

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.630
BUT MAN BITING
DOG<i> IS</i> NEWS.

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.830

IF YOU ELEVATE YOURSELF TO
A HIGH LEVEL OF THINKING,

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.860
HOW CAN THEY CALL
US AN EVIL CULT?

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:13.160
CHINESE HISTORY IS
LITTERED WITH EXAMPLES

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.200
WHERE RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS
HAVE BECOME POLITICAL

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.660
AND HAVE THREATENED THE
LEGITIMACY OF DYNASTIC

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:20.360
RULERS AND THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT THE CHINESE

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.600

TRANSLATOR: WHEN THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.300
DENOUNCED FALUN GONG I
WONDERED HOW THEY COULD

HAVE ATTRACTED SO MANY
PRACTITIONERS SO QUICKLY.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.700
WE CONCLUDED OUR
REAL RELIGION

PROMOTED;

- BUDDHISM, TAOISM,
ISLAMISM, CATHOLICISM,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.960
AND PROTESTANTISM - CAN
BE LEGALLY PRACTICED.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.430

RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES AND
FORBID RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.260
POSITIVELY, AND BRING THEM
INTO THEIR POSITIVE ROLES

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.930
WHILE ADMINISTERING
THEM BY LAW

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:29.830
SO THEY WON'T
CAUSE NEW CHAOS.

TRANSLATOR: SOCIETY IS
DEVELOPING RAPIDLY

NEEDS ARE MULTIPLYING.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.860
IN THE PAST DAYS OF
THE PLANNED ECONOMY

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:42.830
MOST PEOPLE
STAYED AT HOME.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.960
NOW THEIR WORLD IS
BECOMING DIVERSE

REVEALS MORE OF IT.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.160
WITH GROWING
SPIRITUAL NEEDS,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.100
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
IN RELIGION INCREASES

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.430
AS WELL AS THE
NUMBER OF RELIGIONS.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:55.800
THE GOVERNMENT
ACKNOWLEDGES THE EXISTENCE

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.330
OF RELIGIONS AND IT WANTS
TO TREAT THEM AND GUIDE

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:01.830
THEM IN A CORRECT WAY, LET
THEM PLAY POSITIVE ROLES.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.060
THE GROWTH IN
RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.060
SHOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO DAMAGE

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.660
NON-RELIGIOUS
PEOPLES' RIGHTS.

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.100
WE MUST PROTECT THEIR
LEGAL RIGHTS TOO.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.230
SO RELIGIOUS AND
NON-RELIGIOUS PEOPLE

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.630
SHOULD HOLD TOGETHER
TO WORK POSITIVELY.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:17.830

THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT.

PEOPLE FROM ALL PATHS

ATHEIST FUTURE
