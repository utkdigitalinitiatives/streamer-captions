00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800


2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.270
Gone to be married.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.730
Gone to swear a peace.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:18.070
False blood to false bloodjoin'd! gone to be friends!

5
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:26.570
Shall Lewis have Blanch,and Blanch those provinces?

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.870
It is not so; thou hastmisspoke, misheard:

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.600
Be well advised, tell o'erthy tale again:

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
It cannot be; thou dostbut say 'tis so:

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.070
I trust I may not trustthee; for thy word

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.070
Is but the vain breath ofa common man:

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.070
Believe me, I do notbelieve thee, man;

12
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.800
I have a king's oath tothe contrary.

13
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.770
Thou shalt be punish'd forthus frighting me,

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.400
For I am sick and capableof fears,

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.430
Oppress'd with wrongs andtherefore full of fears,

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.570
A widow, husbandless,subject to fears,

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.900
A woman, naturally born tofears;

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500
And though thou now confessthou didst but jest,

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.800
With my vex'd spirits Icannot take a truce,

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.130
But they will quake andtremble all this day.

21
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.870
What dost thou mean byshaking of thy head?

22
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.370
Why dost thou look sosadly on my son?

23
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.930
What means that hand uponthat breast of thine?

24
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170
Why holds thine eye thatlamentable rheum,

25
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.870
Like a proud river peeringo'er his bounds?

26
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.930
Be these sad signsconfirmers of thy words?

27
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.000
Then speak again; not allthy former tale,

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.600
But this one word, whetherthy tale be true.

29
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.770
As true as I believe youthink them false

30
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.230
That give you cause toprove my saying true.

31
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.030
O, if thou teach me tobelieve this sorrow,

32
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.070
Teach thou this sorrow howto make me die,

33
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.430
And let belief and lifeencounter so

34
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.670
As doth the fury of twodesperate men

35
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:22.470
Which in the very meetingfall and die.

36
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:34.800
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy,then where art thou?

37
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.370
France friend with England,what becomes of me?

38
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.530
Fellow, be gone: I cannotbrook thy sight:

39
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.430
This news hath made thee amost ugly man.

40
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.000
What other harm have I,good lady, done,

41
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.930
But spoke the harm that isby others done?

42
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.500
Which harm within itselfso heinous is

43
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.570
As it makes harmful allthat speak of it.

44
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.470
I do beseech you, madam,be content.

45
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.900
If thou, that bid'st me becontent, wert grim,

46
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.530
Ugly and slanderous to thymother's womb,

47
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.800
Full of unpleasing blotsand sightless stains,

48
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.730
Lame, foolish, crooked,swart, prodigious,

49
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.970
Patch'd with foul molesand eye-offending marks,

50
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.900
I would not care, I thenwould be content,

51
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.500
For then I should not lovethee, no, nor thou

52
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.170
Become thy great birth nordeserve a crown.

53
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.700
But thou art fair, and atthy birth, dear boy,

54
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.300
Nature and Fortune join'dto make thee great:

55
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.530
Of Nature's gifts thoumayst with lilies boast,

56
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.100
And with the half-blownrose. But Fortune,

57
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.400
O, She is corrupted,changed and won from thee;

58
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.900
She adulterates hourlywith thine uncle John,

59
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.400
And with her golden handhath pluck'd on France

60
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.070
To tread down fair respectof sovereignty,

61
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.300
And made his majesty thebawd to theirs.

62
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.930
France is a bawd toFortune and King John,

63
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.930
That strumpet Fortune,that usurping John!

64
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.300
Tell me, thou fellow, isnot France forsworn?

65
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.370
Envenom him with words, orget thee gone

66
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.470
And leave those woes alonewhich I alone

67
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.670
Am bound to under-bear.

68
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.800
Pardon me, madam,

69
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.270
I may not go without youto the kings.

70
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:45.970
Thou mayst, thou shalt; Iwill not go with thee:

71
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.630
I will instruct my sorrowsto be proud;

72
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.930
For grief is proud andmakes his owner stoop.

73
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.330
To me and to the state ofmy great grief

74
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.530
Let kings assemble; for mygrief's so great

75
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.070
That no supporter but thehuge firm earth

76
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:14.970
Can hold it up: here I andsorrows sit;

77
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.230
Here is my throne, bidkings come bow to it.

78
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.300
'Tis true, fair daughter;and this blessed day

79
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.370
Ever in France shall bekept festival:

80
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.470
To solemnize this day theglorious sun

81
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.130
Stays in his course andplays the alchemist,

82
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.270
Turning with splendor ofhis precious eye

83
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.530
The meagre cloddy earth toglittering gold:

84
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.370
The yearly course thatbrings this day about

85
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.130
Shall never see it but aholiday.

86
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.800
A wicked day, and not aholy day!

87
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.570
What hath this day deserved?what hath it done,

88
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.400
That it in golden lettersshould be writ

89
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.330
Among the high tides ofthe calendar?

90
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.500
Nay, rather turn this dayout of the week,

91
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.270
This day of shame,oppression, perjury.

92
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.030
Or, if it must stand still,let wives with child

93
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.200
Pray that their burthensmay not fall this day,

94
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.630
Lest that their hopesprodigiously be cross'd:

95
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.500
But on this day let seamenfear no wreck;

96
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.670
No bargains break that arenot this day made:

97
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.030
This day, all things beguncome to ill end,

98
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.130
Ney, faith itself tohollow falsehood change!

99
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.100
By heaven, lady, you shallhave no cause

100
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.200
To curse the fairproceedings of this day:

101
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.130
Have I not pawn'd to youmy majesty?

102
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.770
You have beguiled me witha counterfeit

103
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.400
Resembling majesty, which,being touch'd and tried,

104
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.330
Proves valueless: you areforsworn, forsworn;

105
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.370
You came in arms to spillmine enemies' blood,

106
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.500
But now in arms youstrengthen it with yours:

107
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.430
The grappling vigour andrough frown of war

108
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.470
Is cold in amity andpainted peace,

109
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.700
And our oppression hathmade up this deed.

110
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.870
Arm, arm, you heavens,against these perjured kings!

111
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.730
A widow cries; be husbandto me, heavens!

112
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.570
Let not the hours of thisungodly day

113
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.570
Wear out the day in peace;but, ere sunset,

114
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.600
Set armed discord 'twixtthese perjured kings!

115
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.570
Hear me, O, hear me!

116
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.570
Lady Constance, peace!

117
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:41.800
War! war! no peace! peaceis to me a war

118
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.900
O Lymoges! O Austria! thoudost shame

119
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.370
That bloody spoil: thou slave,thou wretch, thou coward!

120
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.200
Thou little valiant, greatin villany!

121
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.470
Thou ever strong upon thestronger side!

122
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.270
Thou Fortune's championthat dost never fight

123
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.700
But when her humorousladyship is by

124
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.770
To teach thee safety! thouart perjured too,

125
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.500
And soothest up greatness.What a fool art thou,

126
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.870
A ramping fool, to bragand stamp and swear

127
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.030
Upon my party! Thoucold-blooded slave,

128
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.030
Hast thou not spoke likethunder on my side,

129
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.600
Been sworn my champion,bidding me depend

130
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.570
Upon thy fate, thyfortune and thy strength,

131
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.700
And dost thou now fallover to my foes?

132
00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.530
Thou wear a lion's hide!doff it for shame,

133
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.630
And hang a calf's-skin onthose recreant limbs.

134
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.630
O, that a man should speakthose words to me!

135
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.230
And hang a calf's-skin onthose recreant limbs.

136
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.470
Thou darest not say so,villain, for thy life.

137
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:51.230
And hang a calf's-skin onthose recreant limbs.

138
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.130
We like not this; thoudost forget thyself.

139
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.370
Here comes the holy legateof the pope.

140
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.770
(♪singing)

141
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.200
Hail, you anointeddeputies of heaven!

142
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.930
To thee, King John, myholy errand is.

143
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.670
I Pandulph, of fair Milancardinal,

144
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.130
And from Pope Innocent thelegate here,

145
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.270
Do in his name religiouslydemand

146
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.330
Why thou against thechurch, our holy mother,

147
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.930
So wilfully dost spurn;and force perforce

148
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.270
Keep Stephen Langton,chosen archbishop

149
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.670
Of Canterbury, from thatholy see?

150
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.770
This, in our foresaid holyfather's name,

151
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:58.930
Pope Innocent, I do demandof thee.

152
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.500
What earthy name tointerrogatories

153
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.700
Can task the free breathof a sacred king?

154
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.670
Thou canst not, cardinal,devise a name

155
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.630
So slight, unworthy andridiculous,

156
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:16.800
To charge me to an answer,as the pope.

157
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.300
Tell him this tale; andfrom the mouth of England

158
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.930
Add thus much more, thatno Italian priest

159
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.230
Shall tithe or toll in ourdominions;

160
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.300
But as we, under God,are supreme head,

161
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.270
So under Him that greatsupremacy,

162
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.370
Where we do reign, we willalone uphold,

163
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.870
Without the assistance ofa mortal hand:

164
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.600
So tell the pope, allreverence set apart

165
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.800
To him and his usurp'dauthority.

166
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.500
Brother of England, youblaspheme in this.

167
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.070
Though you and all thekings of Christendom

168
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:50.800
Are led so grossly by thismeddling priest,

169
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.470
Dreading the curse thatmoney may buy out;

170
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.900
And by the merit of vilegold, dross, dust,

171
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.870
Purchase corrupted pardonof a man,

172
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.530
Who in that sale sellspardon from himself,

173
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.770
Though you and all therest so grossly led

174
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.930
This juggling witchcraftwith revenue cherish,

175
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.370
Yet I alone, alone do meoppose

176
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.600
Against the pope and counthis friends my foes.

177
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.830
Then, by the lawful powerthat I have,

178
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:25.530
Thou shalt stand cursedand excommunicate.

179
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.500
And blessed shall he bethat doth revolt

180
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.070
From his allegiance to anheretic;

181
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.900
And meritorious shall thathand be call'd,

182
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.730
Canonized and worshippedas a saint,

183
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.230
That takes away by anysecret course

184
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.900
Thy hateful life.

185
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.530
O, lawful let it be

186
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.270
That I have room with Rometo curse awhile!

187
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.870
Good father cardinal, crythou amen

188
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.370
To my keen curses; forwithout my wrong

189
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.200
There is no tongue hathpower to curse him right.

190
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.630
There's law and warrant,lady, for my curse.

191
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.600
And for mine too: since lawcan do no right,

192
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.770
Let it be lawful that lawbar no wrong:

193
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.330
Law cannot give my childhis kingdom here,

194
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.100
For he that holds hiskingdom holds the law;

195
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:22.800
Therefore, since lawitself is perfect wrong,

196
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.370
How can the law forbid mytongue to curse?

197
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.430
Philip of France, on perilof a curse,

198
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:32.600
Let go the hand of thatarch-heretic;

199
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.870
And raise the power ofFrance upon his head,

200
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.970
Unless he do submithimself to Rome.

201
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.770
Look'st thou pale, France?do not let go thy hand.

202
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.070
Philip, what say'st thouto the cardinal?

203
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.970
What should he say, but asthe cardinal?

204
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.530
Bethink you, father; forthe difference

205
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.500
Is purchase of a heavycurse from Rome,

206
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.730
Or the light loss ofEngland for a friend:

207
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.100
Forego the easier.

208
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.270
That's the curse of Rome.

209
00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.630
O Lewis, stand fast! thedevil tempts thee here

210
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.670
In likeness of a newuntrimmed bride.

211
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.830
The Lady Constance speaksnot from her faith,

212
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.370
But from her need.

213
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.830
O, if thou grant my need,

214
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.830
Which only lives but bythe death of faith,

215
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.200
That need must needs inferthis principle,

216
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.670
That faith would liveagain by death of need.

217
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.800
O then, tread down myneed, and faith mounts up;

218
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.400
Keep my need up, and faithis trodden down!

219
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.370
The king is moved, andanswers not to this.

220
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.500
O, be removed from him,and answer well!

221
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.830
I am perplex'd, and knownot what to say.

222
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.570
What canst thou say butwill perplex thee more,

223
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.300
If thou standexcommunicate and cursed?

224
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.470
Good reverend father, makemy person yours,

225
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.370
And tell me how you wouldbestow yourself.

226
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.100
This royal hand and mineare newly knit,

227
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.900
And the conjunction of ourinward souls

228
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.530
Married in league, coupledand linked together

229
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.330
With all religiousstrength of sacred vows;

230
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:00.700
The latest breath thatgave the sound of words

231
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.400
Was deep-sworn faith,peace, amity, true love

232
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.400
Between our kingdoms andour royal selves,

233
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.870
And even before thistruce, but new before,

234
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.070
No longer than we wellcould wash our hands

235
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.100
To clap this royal bargainup of peace,

236
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.970
Heaven knows, they werebesmear'd and over-stain'd

237
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:24.730
With slaughter's pencil,where revenge did paint

238
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.930
The fearful difference ofincensed kings:

239
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:34.330
And shall these hands, solately purged of blood,

240
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:40.300
So newly sworn in faith,so strong in both,

241
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.830
Unyoke this seizure andthis kind regreet?

242
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:51.970
Play fast and loose withfaith? so jest with heaven,

243
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.230
Make such unconstantchildren of ourselves,

244
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.770
As now again to snatch ourpalm from palm,

245
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:04.400
Unswear faith sworn, andon the marriage-bed

246
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.800
Of smiling peace to marcha bloody host,

247
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.870
And make a riot on thegentle brow

248
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.870
Of true sincerity? O, holysir,

249
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:19.370
My reverend father, let itnot be so!

250
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:24.830
Out of your grace, devise,ordain, impose

251
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:31.470
Some gentle order; andthen we shall be blest

252
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.730
To do your pleasure andcontinue friends.

253
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.670
All form is formless,order orderless,

254
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.770
Save what is opposite toEngland's love.

255
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.300
Therefore to arms! bechampion of our church,

256
00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.570
Or let the church, ourmother, breathe her curse,

257
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:56.100
A mother's curse, on herrevolting son.

258
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.900
France, thou mayst hold aserpent by the tongue,

259
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.070
A chafed lion by themortal paw,

260
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.330
A fasting tiger safer bythe tooth,

261
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:07.170
Than keep in peace thathand which thou dost hold.

262
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.630
I may disjoin my hand, butnot my faith.

263
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.170
So makest thou faith anenemy to faith;

264
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.330
And like a civil warset'st oath to oath,

265
00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.070
Thy tongue against thytongue. O, let thy vow

266
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.170
First made to heaven, firstbe to heaven perform'd,

267
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.900
That is, to be thechampion of our church!

268
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.870
What since thou sworest issworn against thyself

269
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.100
And may not be performedby thyself,

270
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.470
For that which thou hastsworn to do amiss

271
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.930
Is not amiss  if it betruly done,

272
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.900
And being not done, wheredoing tends to ill,

273
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.400
The truth is then bestdone not doing it:

274
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.070
The better act in purposesmistook

275
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.200
Is to mistake again;though indirect,

276
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.430
Yet indirection therebygrows direct,

277
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.200
And falsehood falsehoodcures, as fire cools fire

278
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:10.530
Within the scorched veinsof one new-burn'd.

279
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.970
It is religion that dothmake vows kept;

280
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.530
But thou hast swornagainst religion,

281
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.030
By what thou swear'st againstthe thing thou swear'st,

282
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.100
And makest an oath thesurety for thy truth

283
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.770
Against an oath: the truththou art unsure

284
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.030
To swear, swears only notto be forsworn;

285
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.630
Else what a mockery shouldit be to swear!

286
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.430
But thou hast sworn onlyto be forsworn;

287
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.630
And most forsworn, to keepwhat thou dost swear.

288
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.870
Therefore thy later vowsagainst thy first

289
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:50.630
Is in thyself rebellion 'gainstthyself;

290
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.300
And better conquest nevercanst thou make

291
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.830
Than arm thy constant andthy nobler parts

292
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:59.600
Against these giddy loosesuggestions:

293
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.100
Upon which better part ourprayers come in,

294
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:08.800
If thou vouchsafe them.But if not, then know

295
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.500
The peril of our curseslight on thee

296
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:17.170
So heavy as thou shalt notshake them off,

297
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.700
But in despair die undertheir black weight.

298
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.700
Rebellion, flat rebellion!

299
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.730
Will't not be?

300
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.330
Will not a calfs-skin stopthat mouth of thine?

301
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.170
Father, to arms!

302
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:37.200
Upon thy wedding-day?

303
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.400
Against the blood thatthou hast married?

304
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.200
What, shall our feast bekept with slaughter'd men?

305
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.770
Shall braying trumpets andloud churlish drums,

306
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.970
Clamours of hell, bemeasures to our pomp?

307
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.500
O husband, hear me!alack, how new

308
00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:55.700
Is husband in my mouth!even for that name,

309
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.070
Which till this time mytongue did ne'er pronounce,

310
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.630
Upon my knee I beg, go notto arms

311
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.870
Against mine uncle.

312
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:02.800
O, upon my knee,

313
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.470
Made hard with kneeling, Ido pray to thee,

314
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.830
Thou virtuous Dauphin,alter not the doom

315
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.530
Forethought by heaven!

316
00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.730
Now shall I see thy love:what motive may

317
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:13.070
Be stronger with thee thanthe name of wife?

318
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.030
That which upholdeth himthat thee upholds,

319
00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:23.400
His honour: O, thine honour,Lewis, thine honour!

320
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.770
I muse your majesty dothseem so cold,

321
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.700
When such profoundrespects do pull you on.

322
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.930
I will denounce a curseupon his head.

323
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:47.930
Thou shalt not need. England,I will fall from thee.

324
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.770
(♪drums)

325
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.630
O fair return of banish'dmajesty!

326
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.800
O foul revolt of Frenchinconstancy!

327
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.430
France, thou shalt rue thishour within this hour.

328
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:11.100
Old Time the clock-setter,that bald sexton Time,

329
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:16.370
Is it as he will? wellthen, France shall rue.

330
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:34.930
The sun's o'ercast withblood: fair day, adieu!

331
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.670
Which is the side that Imust go withal?

332
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.700
I am with both: each armyhath a hand;

333
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.130
And in their rage, Ihaving hold of both,

334
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.570
They swirl asunder anddismember me.

335
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.100
Husband, I cannot praythat thou mayst win;

336
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.170
Uncle, I needs must praythat thou mayst lose;

337
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:56.730
Father, I may not wish thefortune thine;

338
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.870
Grandam, I may not wishthy wishes thrive:

339
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:04.100
Whoever wins, on that sideshall I lose

340
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.330
Assured loss before thematch be play'd.

341
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:14.500
Lady, with me, with me thyfortune lies.

342
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:21.300
There where my fortunelives, there my life dies.

343
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.470
Cousin, go draw ourpuissance together.

344
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.770
France, I am burn'd upwith inflaming wrath;

345
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.570
A rage whose heat haththis condition,

346
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.100
That nothing can allay,nothing but blood,

347
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.930
The blood, and dearest-valuedblood, of France.

348
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:44.130
Thy rage sham burn theeup, and thou shalt turn

349
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:49.170
To ashes, ere our bloodshall quench that fire:

350
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.570
Look to thyself, thou artin jeopardy.

351
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.930
No more than he thatthreats. To arms let's hie!

352
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.700
Now, by my life, this daygrows wondrous hot;

353
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.630
Some airy devil hovers inthe sky

354
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:15.430
And pours down mischief.Austria's head lie thou there,

355
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.800
While Philip breathes.

356
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.130
Hubert, keep this boy.Philip, make haste:

357
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.730
My mother is assailed inour tent,

358
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.630
And ta'en, I fear.

359
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.900
My lord, I rescued her;

360
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.700
Her highness is in safety,fear you not:

361
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.930
But on, my liege; for verylittle pains

362
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.930
Will bring this labour toan happy end.

363
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.100
So shall it be; yourgrace shall stay behind

364
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.300
So strongly guarded.

365
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.330
Cousin, look not sad:

366
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:43.530
Thy grandam loves thee;and thy uncle will

367
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.470
As dear be to thee as thyfather was.

368
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.370
O, this will make mymother die with grief!

369
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.630
Cousin, away for England! haste before:

370
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.000
And, ere our coming, seethou shake the bags

371
00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.270
Of hoarding abbots;imprisoned angels

372
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.770
Set at liberty: the fatribs of peace

373
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.100
Must by the hungry now befed upon:

374
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.230
Use our commission in hisutmost force.

375
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.700
Bell, book, and candleshall not drive me back,

376
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.930
When gold and silver becksme to come on.

377
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.870
I leave your highness.Grandam, I will pray,

378
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.330
If ever I remember to beholy,

379
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:22.430
For your fair safety; so,I kiss your hand.

380
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.630
Farewell, gentle cousin.

381
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.630
Coz, farewell.

382
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:41.930
Come hither, littlekinsman; hark, a word.

383
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.930
Come hither, Hubert.

384
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.400
O my gentle Hubert,

385
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.700
We owe thee much! withinthis wall of flesh

386
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.370
There is a soul countsthee her creditor

387
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.730
And with advantage meansto pay thy love:

388
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.100
And my good friend, thyvoluntary oath

389
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.030
Lives in this bosom,dearly cherished.

390
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.700
Give me thy hand.

391
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:17.770
I had a thing to say,

392
00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:22.300
But I will fit it withsome better tune.

393
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.100
By heaven, Hubert, I amalmost ashamed

394
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.500
To say what good respect Ihave of thee.

395
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.130
I am much bounden to yourmajesty.

396
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.570
Good friend, thou hast nocause to say so yet,

397
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.200
But thou shalt have; andcreep time ne'er so slow,

398
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.500
Yet it shall come from meto do thee good.

399
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.630
I had a thing to say, butlet it go:

400
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.230
The sun is in the heaven,and the proud day,

401
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.800
Attended with thepleasures of the world,

402
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.430
Is all too wanton and toofull of gawds

403
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.000
To give me audience: ifthe midnight bell

404
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.930
Did, with his iron tongueand brazen mouth,

405
00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.800
Sound on into the drowsyrace of night;

406
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.170
If this same were achurchyard where we stand,

407
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.000
And thou possessed with athousand wrongs,

408
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.630
Or if that surly spirit,melancholy,

409
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.830
Had baked thy blood andmade it heavy-thick,

410
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.030
Which else runs ticklingup and down the veins,

411
00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.830
Making that idiot,laughter, keep men's eyes

412
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:25.130
And strain their cheeks toidle merriment,

413
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.500
A passion hateful to mypurposes,

414
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.670
Or if that thou couldstsee me without eyes,

415
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.100
Hear me without thineears, and make reply

416
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.430
Without a tongue, usingconceit alone,

417
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.500
Without eyes, ears andharmful sound of words;

418
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.530
Then, in despite ofbrooded watchful day,

419
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:46.770
I would into thy bosompour my thoughts:

420
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:53.900
But, ah, I will not! yet Ilove thee well;

421
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.000
And, by my troth, I thinkthou lovest me well.

422
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.400
So well, that what you bidme undertake,

423
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.300
Though that my death wereadjunct to my act,

424
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.530
By heaven, I would do it.

425
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.000
Do not I know thouwouldst?

426
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.500
Good Hubert, Hubert,Hubert, throw thine eye

427
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.030
On yon young boy: I'lltell thee what, my friend,

428
00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:17.700
He is a very serpent in myway;

429
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.970
And whereso'er this footof mine doth tread,

430
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.330
He lies before me: dostthou understand me?

431
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.030
Thou art his keeper.

432
00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.270
And I'll keep him so,

433
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.970
That he shall not offendyour majesty.

434
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:29.800
Death.

435
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.530
My lord?

436
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.630
A grave.

437
00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.000
He shall not live.

438
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.600
Enough.

439
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:48.400
I could be merry now.Hubert, I love thee;

440
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.830
Well, I'll not say what Iintend for thee:

441
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.970
Remember. Madam, fare youwell:

442
00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:58.300
I'll send those powerso'er to your majesty.

443
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.530
My blessing go with thee!

444
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.170
Cousin, Away for England, go:

445
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.200
Hubert shall be your man,attend on you

446
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.270
With all true duty. Ontoward Calais, ho!

447
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.130
So, by a roaring tempeston the flood,

448
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.270
A whole armado ofconvicted sail

449
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.930
Is scatter'd and disjoin'dfrom fellowship.

450
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:36.930
Courage and comfort! allshall yet go well.

451
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:40.300
What can go well, when wehave run so ill?

452
00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.130
Are we not beaten? Is notAngiers lost?

453
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:47.900
Arthur ta'en prisoner?divers dear friends slain?

454
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.400
And bloody England intoEngland gone,

455
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.900
O'erbearing interruption,spite of France?

456
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.330
What he hath won, thathath he fortified:

457
00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.870
So hot a speed with suchadvice disposed,

458
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.700
Such temperate order in sofierce a cause,

459
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.130
Doth want example: whohath read or heard

460
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.370
Of any kindred action liketo this?

461
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.330
Well could I bear thatEngland had this praise,

462
00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:15.030
So we could find somepattern of our shame.

463
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:20.700
Look, who comes here! agrave unto a soul;

464
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.030
Holding the eternal spiritagainst her will,

465
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:28.330
In the vile prison ofafflicted breath.

466
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.100
I prithee, lady, go awaywith me.

467
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:36.730
Lo, now I now see theissue of your peace.

468
00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.970
Patience, good lady!comfort, gentle Constance!

469
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.100
No, I defy all counsel,all redress,

470
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.200
Save that which ends allcounsel, true redress,

471
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:54.970
Death, death; O amiablelovely death!

472
00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:01.770
Thou odouriferous stench!sound rottenness!

473
00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.200
Arise forth from the couchof lasting night,

474
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.070
Thou hate and terror toprosperity,

475
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.900
And I will kiss thydetestable bones

476
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.700
And put my eyeballs in thyvaulty brows

477
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.330
And ring my fingerswith thy household worms

478
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:22.430
And be a carrion monsterlike thyself:

479
00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.630
Come, grin on me, and Iwill think thou smilest

480
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:32.030
And buss thee as thy wife.Misery's love,

481
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.830
O, come to me!

482
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.000
O fair affliction, peace!

483
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.430
No, no, I will not, havingbreath to cry:

484
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.600
O, that my tongue were inthe thunder's mouth!

485
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.170
Then with a passion wouldI shake the world;

486
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:46.300
And rouse from sleep thatfell anatomy

487
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.170
That cannot hear a lady'sfeeble voice,

488
00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:52.330
Which scorns a moderninvocation.

489
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.670
Lady, you utter madness,and not sorrow.

490
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.530
Thou art not holy to belieme so;

491
00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:07.130
I am not mad: this hair Itear is mine;

492
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:09.270
My name is Constance; Iwas Geffrey's wife;

493
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:14.170
Young Arthur is my son,and he is lost:

494
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.730
I am not mad: I would toheaven I were!

495
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.270
For then, 'tis like Icould forget myself:

496
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.630
O, if I could, what griefshould I forget!

497
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:33.100
Preach some philosophy tomake me mad,

498
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.170
And thou shalt becanonized, cardinal;

499
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:41.100
For being not mad butsensible of grief,

500
00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.830
My reasonable partproduces reason

501
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.870
How I may be deliver'd ofthese woes,

502
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:53.170
And teaches me to kill orhang myself:

503
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.270
If I were mad, I shouldforget my son,

504
00:30:57.270 --> 00:31:00.300
Or madly think a babe ofclouts were he:

505
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.630
I am not mad; too well,too well I feel

506
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:09.700
The different plague ofeach calamity.

507
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.170
Bind up those tresses. O,what love I note

508
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.400
In the fair multitude ofthose her hairs!

509
00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.500
Where but by chance asilver drop hath fallen,

510
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.130
Even to that drop tenthousand wiry friends

511
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.530
Do glue themselves insociable grief,

512
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:29.870
Like true, inseparable,faithful loves,

513
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.830
Sticking together incalamity.

514
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.630
To England, if you will.

515
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.500
Bind up your hairs.

516
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.430
Aye, that I will; andwherefore will I do it?

517
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.530
I tore them from theirbonds and cried aloud

518
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.730
'O that these hands couldso redeem my son,

519
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:47.400
As they have given thesehairs their liberty!'

520
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.970
But now I envy at theirliberty,

521
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.730
And will again commit themto their bonds,

522
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.170
Because my poor boy is aprisoner.

523
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:59.770
And, father cardinal, Ihave heard you say

524
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:04.900
That we shall see and knowour friends in heaven:

525
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:08.700
If that be so, I shallsee my child again;

526
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.930
For since the birth ofCain, the first male child,

527
00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:14.130
To him that did butyesterday suspire,

528
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:18.270
There was not such agracious creature born.

529
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:22.330
And now will canker-sorroweat my bud

530
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:26.530
And chase the nativebeauty from his cheek

531
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.100
And he will look as hollowas a ghost,

532
00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.730
As dim and meagre as anague's fit,

533
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:42.100
And so he'll die; and,rising so again,

534
00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:47.230
When I shall meet him atthe court of heaven

535
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:53.500
I shall not know him:therefore never, never

536
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.900
Must I behold my prettyArthur more.

537
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.770
You hold too heinous arespect of grief.

538
00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.030
He talks to me that neverhad a son.

539
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:06.600
You are as fond of griefas of your child.

540
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:15.270
Grief fills the room up ofmy absent child,

541
00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.900
Lies in his bed, walks upand down with me,

542
00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.370
Puts on his pretty looks,repeats his ways,

543
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:29.830
Stuffs out his graciousgarments with his form;

544
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:32.930
Then, have I reason to befond of grief?

545
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:43.070
So fare you well: had yousuch a loss as I,

546
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.830
I could give bettercomfort than you have.

547
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:54.930
I will not keep this formupon my head,

548
00:33:54.930 --> 00:34:01.700
When there is suchdisorder in my wit.

549
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:12.370
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur,my fair son!

550
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:20.000
My life, my joy, my food,my all the world!

551
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:27.370
My widow-comfort, and mysorrows' cure!

552
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.930
I fear some outrage, andI'll follow her.

553
00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:48.270
There's nothing in thisworld can make me joy:

554
00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.700
Life is as tedious as atwice-told tale

555
00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:02.300
Vexing the dull ear of adrowsy man;

556
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:05.370
And bitter shame hath spoil'dthe sweet world's taste

557
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:10.000
That it yields nought butshame and bitterness.

558
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.670
Before the curing of astrong disease,

559
00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.530
Even in the instant ofrepair and health,

560
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.430
The fit is strongest;evils that take leave,

561
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:26.530
On their departure most ofall show evil:

562
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:32.500
What have you lost bylosing of this day?

563
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:37.270
All days of glory, joy andhappiness.

564
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:40.400
If you had won it,certainly you had.

565
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.430
No, no; when Fortune meansto men most good,

566
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.930
She looks upon them with athreatening eye.

567
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:53.770
'Tis strange to think howmuch King John hath lost

568
00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:58.430
In this which he accountsso clearly won:

569
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.170
Are not you grieved thatArthur is his prisoner?

570
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.770
As heartily as he is gladhe hath him.

571
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:09.930
Your mind is all asyouthful as your blood.

572
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.470
Now hear me speak with aprophetic spirit;

573
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.930
For even the breath ofwhat I mean to speak

574
00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.900
Shall blow each dust, eachstraw, each little rub,

575
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.930
Out of the path thatshall directly lead

576
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:32.900
Thy foot to England'sthrone; and therefore mark.

577
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.100
John hath seized Arthur;and it cannot be

578
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.330
That, whiles warm life playsin that infant's veins,

579
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.400
The misplaced John shouldentertain an hour,

580
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.670
One minute, nay, one quietbreath of rest.

581
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.530
A sceptre snatch'd with anunruly hand

582
00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:52.170
Must be as boisterouslymaintain'd as gain'd;

583
00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.570
And he that stands upon aslippery place

584
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:59.730
Makes nice of no vile holdto stay him up:

585
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:06.030
That John may stand, thenArthur needs must fall;

586
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.330
So be it, for it cannot bebut so.

587
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:15.100
But what shall I gain byyoung Arthur's fall?

588
00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:22.570
You, in the right of LadyBlanch your wife,

589
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:27.000
May then make all theclaim that Arthur did.

590
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.930
And lose it, life and all,as Arthur did.

591
00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:35.500
How green you are andfresh in this old world!

592
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:41.800
John lays you plots; thetimes conspire with you;

593
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.030
For he that steeps hissafety in true blood

594
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.830
Shall find but bloodysafety and untrue.

595
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:50.530
This act so evilly bornshall cool the hearts

596
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.000
Of all his people andfreeze up their zeal,

597
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.130
That none so smalladvantage shall step forth

598
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.870
To cheque his reign, butthey will cherish it;

599
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:02.370
No natural exhalation inthe sky,

600
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:06.100
No scope of nature, nodistemper'd day,

601
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.900
No common wind, nocustomed event,

602
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.630
But they will pluck awayhis natural cause

603
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:15.570
And call them meteors,prodigies and signs,

604
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.030
Abortives, presages andtongues of heaven,

605
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.570
Plainly denouncingvengeance upon John.

606
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.200
May be he will not touchyoung Arthur's life,

607
00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.970
But hold himself safe inhis prisonment.

608
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:33.330
O, sir, when he shall hearof your approach,

609
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:38.500
If that young Arthur benot gone already,

610
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:45.730
Even at that news he dies;and then the hearts

611
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.230
Of all his people shallrevolt from him

612
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:53.270
And kiss the lips ofunacquainted change

613
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.170
And pick strong matter ofrevolt and wrath

614
00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:58.430
Out of the bloody fingers'ends of John.

615
00:38:58.430 --> 00:39:01.570
Methinks I see this hurlyall on foot:

616
00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.970
And, O, what better matterbreeds for you

617
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:07.370
Than I have named! Thebastard Faulconbridge

618
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:11.070
Is now in England,ransacking the church,

619
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.170
Offending charity: if buta dozen French

620
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.870
Were there in arms, theywould be as a call

621
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.500
To train ten thousandEnglish to their side,

622
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.470
Or as a little snow,tumbled about,

623
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:30.800
Anon becomes a mountain. Onoble Dauphin,

624
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.370
Go with me to the king:'tis wonderful

625
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.730
What may be wrought out oftheir discontent,

626
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.330
Now that their souls aretopful of offence.

627
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:47.570
For England go: I willwhet on the king.

628
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:59.730
Strong reasons make strongactions: let us go:

629
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.270
If you say ay, the kingwill not say no.

630
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.200
(♪singing)

631
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.730
