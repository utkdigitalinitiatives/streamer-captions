00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.500


2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.370
Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,

3
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.770
With written pamphlets studiously devised,

4
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.330
Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,

5
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.230
Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,

6
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.500
Do it without invention, suddenly;

7
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.630
As I with sudden and extemporal speech

8
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.230
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.

9
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.070
Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,

10
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.430
Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.

11
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.770
Think not, although in writing I preferr'd

12
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.930
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,

13
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.430
That therefore I have forged, or am not able

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.770
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:

15
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.000
No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.800
Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.230
As very infants prattle of thy pride.

18
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.730
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.370
Forward by nature, enemy to peace;

20
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.630
Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems

21
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.470
A man of thy profession and degree;

22
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.270
And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?

23
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.830
In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,

24
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.230
As well at London bridge as at the Tower.

25
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.400
Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.030
The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt

27
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.570
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.

28
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.530
Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe

29
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.800
To give me hearing what I shall reply.

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:55.170
If covetous, ambitious or perverse,

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.730
As he will have me, how am I so poor?

32
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.000
Or how haps it I seek not to advance

33
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.800
Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?

34
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.370
And for dissension, who preferreth peace

35
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.400
More than I do?--except I be provoked.

36
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.500
No, my good lords, it is not that offends;

37
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.330
It is not that that hath incensed the duke:

38
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.000
It is, because no one should sway but he;

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.930
No one but he should be about the king;

40
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.000
And that engenders thunder in his breast

41
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.700
And makes him roar these accusations forth.

42
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.130
But he shall know I am as good--

43
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.300
As good!

44
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.700
Thou bastard of my grandfather!

45
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.670
Ay, lordly sir; and what are you, I pray,

46
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.470
But one imperious in another's throne?

47
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.530
Am I not protector, saucy priest?

48
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.570
And am not I a prelate of the church?

49
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.630
Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps

50
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.400
And useth it to patronage his theft.

51
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.930
Unreverent Gloster!

52
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.370
Thou art reverent

53
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.500
Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.

54
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.370
Rome shall remedy this.

55
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.600
Roam thither, then.

56
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.370
My lord, it were your duty to forbear.

57
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.900
Methinks my lord should be religious

58
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.870
And know the office that belongs to such.

59
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.630
Methinks his lordship should be humbler;

60
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.070
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.

61
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.730
Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.

62
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.370
State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?

63
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.430
Is not his grace protector to the king?

64
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.830
Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,

65
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.300
Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;

66
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.030
Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'

67
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.400
Else would I have a fling at Winchester.

68
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.100
Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,

69
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.970
The special watchmen of our English weal,

70
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.370
I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,

71
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.970
To join your hearts in love and amity.

72
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.700
O, what a scandal is it to our crown,

73
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.600
That two such noble peers as ye should jar!

74
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.900
Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell

75
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.200
Civil dissension is a viperous worm

76
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.330
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.

77
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.200
What tumult's this?

78
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.170
An uproar, I dare warrant,

79
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.670
Begun through malice of the bishop's men.

80
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.800
O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,

81
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.630
Pity the city of London, pity us!

82
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.400
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,

83
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,

84
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.530
Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones

85
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.730
And banding themselves in contrary parts

86
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.230
Do pelt so fast at one another's pate

87
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.630
That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:

88
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.400
Our windows are broke down in every street

89
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.170
And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.

90
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.500
We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,

91
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.170
To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.

92
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.300
Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.

93
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.770
First Serving-man: Nay, if we be forbidden stones,

94
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.600
We'll fall to it with our teeth.

95
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.530
Second Serving-man: Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.

96
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.270
You of my household, leave this peevish broil

97
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.830
And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.

98
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.570
Third Serving-man: My lord, we know your grace to be a man

99
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.930
Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,

100
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.700
Inferior to none but to his majesty:

101
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.530
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,

102
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.830
So kind a father of the commonweal,

103
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.130
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,

104
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.430
We and our wives and children all will fight

105
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.630
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.

106
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.600
First Serving-man: Ay, and the very parings of our nails

107
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.370
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.

108
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.700
Stay, stay, I say!

109
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.630
And if you love me, as you say you do,

110
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.500
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.

111
00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.270
O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!

112
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.430
Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold

113
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.870
My sighs and tears and will not once relent?

114
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.470
Who should be pitiful, if you be not?

115
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.970
Or who should study to prefer a peace.

116
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.530
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?

117
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.700
My lord protector, yield; yield, Winchester;

118
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.700
Except you mean with obstinate repulse

119
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.130
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.

120
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.030
He shall submit, or I will never yield.

121
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.300
Compassion on the king commands me stoop;

122
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.430
Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest

123
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.270
Should ever get that privilege of me.

124
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.470
Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke

125
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.900
Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,

126
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.370
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:

127
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.570
Why look you still so stern and tragical?

128
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.900
Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.

129
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.070
Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach

130
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.530
That malice was a great and grievous sin;

131
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.130
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,

132
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.030
But prove a chief offender in the same?

133
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.630
For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!

134
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.930
What, shall a child instruct you what to do?

135
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;

136
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.300
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.

137
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.130
Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--

138
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:56.100
See here, my loving friends and countrymen,

139
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.800
This token serveth for a flag of truce

140
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.970
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:

141
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.200
So help me God, as I dissemble not!

142
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.600
So help me God, as I intend it not!

143
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.200
O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,

144
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.630
How joyful am I made by this contract!

145
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.770
Away, my masters! trouble us no more;

146
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.430
But join in friendship, as your lords have done.

147
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.800
First Serving-man: Content: I'll to the surgeon's.

148
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.000
Second Serving-man: And so will I.

149
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.770
Third-man: And I will see what physic the tavern affords.

150
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.500
Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,

151
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.930
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet

152
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:41.130
We do exhibit to your majesty.

153
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.200
Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,

154
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.200
And if your grace mark every circumstance,

155
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.630
You have great reason to do Richard right;

156
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.930
Especially for those occasions

157
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.470
At Eltham Place I told your majesty.

158
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.070
And those occasions, uncle, were of force:

159
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.000
Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is

160
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.830
That Richard be restored to his blood.

161
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.370
Let Richard be restored to his blood;

162
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.100
So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.

163
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:14.800
As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.

164
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.530
If Richard will be true, not that alone

165
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.370
But all the whole inheritance I give

166
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.830
That doth belong unto the house of York,

167
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.870
From whence you spring by lineal descent.

168
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.100
Thy humble servant vows obedience

169
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.230
And humble service till the point of death.

170
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.870
Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;

171
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.070
And, in reguerdon of that duty done,

172
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.270
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:

173
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.700
Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,

174
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:52.230
And rise created princely Duke of York.

175
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.830
And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!

176
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.270
And as my duty springs, so perish they

177
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.830
That grudge one thought against your majesty!

178
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.630
Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!

179
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.530
Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!

180
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.430
Now will it best avail your majesty

181
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.800
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:

182
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.230
The presence of a king engenders love

183
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.000
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,

184
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.770
As it disanimates his enemies.

185
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.670
When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;

186
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.330
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.

187
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.170
Your ships already are in readiness.

188
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.900
Ay, we may march in England or in France,

189
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.630
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.

190
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.900
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers

191
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.200
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love

192
00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.300
And will at last break out into a flame:

193
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.570
As fester'd members rot but by degree,

194
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.400
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,

195
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.300
So will this base and envious discord breed.

196
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.600
And now I fear that fatal prophecy

197
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.770
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth

198
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.600
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;

199
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.530
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all

200
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:40.630
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:

201
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.600
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish

202
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.470
His days may finish ere that hapless time.

203
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.600
These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,

204
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.170
Through which our policy must make a breach:

205
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.400
Take heed, be wary how you place your words;

206
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.400
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men

207
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.000
That come to gather money for their corn.

208
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.170
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,

209
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.730
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,

210
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.170
I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,

211
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.270
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.

212
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:52.570
Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,

213
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:57.130
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;

214
00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:00.930
Therefore we'll knock.

215
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.430
Qui est la?

216
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.370
Paysans, pauvres gens de France;

217
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.530
Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.

218
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:23.530
Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.

219
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:30.200
Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.

220
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.200
Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!

221
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.670
And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.

222
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.830
Now she is there, how will she specify

223
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.330
Where is the best and safest passage in?

224
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.230
By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;

225
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.270
Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,

226
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.830
No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.

227
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.770
Behold, this is the happy wedding torch

228
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.800
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,

229
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.430
But burning fatal to the Talbotites!

230
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.430
Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;

231
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.870
Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,

232
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.770
And then do execution on the watch.

233
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.570
France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,

234
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.370
If Talbot but survive thy treachery.

235
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:29.630
Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,

236
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.870
Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,

237
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.670
That hardly we escaped the pride of France.

238
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:54.070
Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?

239
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.070
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast

240
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.470
Before he'll buy again at such a rate:

241
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.800
Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!

242
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.530
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own

243
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.030
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.

244
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.070
Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.

245
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.670
O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!

246
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.000
What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,

247
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.700
And run a tilt at death within a chair?

248
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.870
Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,

249
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.570
Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!

250
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.330
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age

251
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.100
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?

252
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.970
Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,

253
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.270
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.

254
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:44.270
Are ye so hot? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;

255
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.870
If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.

256
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.770
The English whisper together in council

257
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:02.030
God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?

258
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:12.970
Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?

259
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:16.470
Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,

260
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.870
To try if that our own be ours or no.

261
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.300
I speak not to that railing Hecate,

262
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.630
But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;

263
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.170
Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?

264
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.700
Signior, no.

265
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:39.830
Signior, hang! base muleters of France!

266
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.370
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls

267
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.430
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.

268
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.470
Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;

269
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.500
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.

270
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.930
God bye my lord! we came but to tell you

271
00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.530
That we are here.

272
00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.630
And there will we be too, ere it be long,

273
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.000
Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!

274
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.670
Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,

275
00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.630
Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,

276
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.770
Either to get the town again or die:

277
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.600
And I, as sure as English Henry lives

278
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.600
And as his father here was conqueror,

279
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.870
As sure as in this late-betrayed town

280
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:23.370
Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,

281
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:27.630
So sure I swear to get the town or die.

282
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:35.400
My vows are equal partners with thy vows.

283
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.900
But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,

284
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.170
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,

285
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.470
We will bestow you in some better place,

286
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.900
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.

287
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.830
Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:

288
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.900
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen

289
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.330
And will be partner of your weal or woe.

290
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.770
Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.

291
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.100
Not to be gone from hence; for once I read

292
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.070
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick

293
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.830
Came to the field and vanquished his foes:

294
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.130
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,

295
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:16.070
Because I ever found them as myself.

296
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.770
Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!

297
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:27.170
Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!

298
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:30.870
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,

299
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:35.170
But gather we our forces out of hand

300
00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:41.270
And set upon our boasting enemy.

301
00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.170
Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?

302
00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.270
Whither away! to save myself by flight:

303
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.100
We are like to have the overthrow again.

304
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.170
What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?

305
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.170
Ay,

306
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.530
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!

307
00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:01.730
Cowardly knight! ill fortune follow thee!

308
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.470
Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,

309
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:23.100
For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.

310
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.630
What is the trust or strength of foolish man?

311
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.930
They that of late were daring with their scoffs

312
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:38.770
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.

313
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.770
Lost, and recover'd in a day again!

314
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.970
This is a double honour, Burgundy:

315
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.600
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!

316
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.600
Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy

317
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.370
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects

318
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.470
Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.

319
00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.500
The noble Duke of Bedford is deceased,

320
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.000
A braver soldier never couched lance,

321
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.600
A gentler heart did never sway in court;

322
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.100
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,

323
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.430
For that's the end of human misery.

324
00:21:52.430 --> 00:22:00.230
Thou see'ist his exucust performed in Rouen.

325
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.830
Then we will take some order in this town.

326
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:11.530
Placing therein some expert offices

327
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.100
and then depart to Paris to the King

328
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.100
For there young Henry and his nobles lie.

329
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:25.100
What wills Lord Talbot, pleaseth Burgandy.

330
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.770
Dismay not, princes, at this accident,

331
00:22:55.770 --> 00:23:00.530
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:

332
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.800
Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,

333
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.370
For things that are not to be remedied.

334
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.600
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while

335
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.930
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;

336
00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:16.770
We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,

337
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.970
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.

338
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.570
We have been guided by thee hitherto,

339
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.770
And of thy cunning had no diffidence:

340
00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.630
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.

341
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.970
Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:

342
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.930
By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words

343
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.230
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy

344
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.330
To leave the Talbot and to follow us.

345
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.630
Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,

346
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.970
France were no place for Henry's warriors;

347
00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.830
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,

348
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.330
But be extirped from our provinces.

349
00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.600
For ever should they be expulsed from France

350
00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.570
And not have title of an earldom here.

351
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.670
Your honours shall perceive how I will work

352
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.770
To bring this matter to the wished end.

353
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.700
Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive

354
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.870
Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.

355
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.630
There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,

356
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:15.170
And all the troops of English after him.

357
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.830
Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:

358
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:21.100
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.

359
00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.170
Summon a parley; we will talk with him.

360
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.170
A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!

361
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.400
Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?

362
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.370
The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.

363
00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.300
What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.

364
00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.670
Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.

365
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:50.000
Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!

366
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.500
Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.

367
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.600
Speak on; but be not over-tedious.

368
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:06.730
Look on thy country, look on fertile France,

369
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.930
And see the cities and the towns defaced

370
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.270
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.

371
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.430
As looks the mother on her lowly babe

372
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.570
When death doth close his tender dying eyes,

373
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:28.470
See, see the pining malady of France;

374
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:33.970
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,

375
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:38.170
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.

376
00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.630
O, turn thy edged sword another way;

377
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:47.800
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.

378
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.930
One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom

379
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:55.830
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:

380
00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:00.130
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,

381
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:05.470
And wash away thy country's stained spots.

382
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.900
Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,

383
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.330
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.

384
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.770
Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,

385
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.330
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.

386
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.600
Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation

387
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.270
That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?

388
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.370
When Talbot hath set footing once in France

389
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.030
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,

390
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.400
Who then but English Henry will be lord

391
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.200
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?

392
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:41.300
See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen

393
00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:45.530
And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.

394
00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:52.000
Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:

395
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.800
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.

396
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:08.530
I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers

397
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:12.170
Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,

398
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:19.200
And made me almost yield upon my knees.

399
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.170
Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,

400
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:30.000
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:

401
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
My forces and my power of men are yours:

402
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.600
So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.

403
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.600
Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!

404
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.900
Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.

405
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.200
And doth beget new courage in our breasts.

406
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.670
Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,

407
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:59.230
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.

408
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.400
Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,

409
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.130
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.

410
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:32.870
My gracious prince, and honourable peers,

411
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:34.630
Hearing of your arrival in this realm,

412
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.570
I have awhile given truce unto my wars,

413
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.230
To do my duty to my sovereign:

414
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.930
In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd

415
00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.200
Through your obedience fifty fortresses,

416
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.570
Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,

417
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.930
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,

418
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.370
Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,

419
00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.100
And with submissive loyalty of heart

420
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.500
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got

421
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.570
First to my God and next unto your grace.

422
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.830
Is this the Talbot, uncle Gloucester,

423
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:08.370
That hath so long been resident in France?

424
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.630
Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.

425
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.830
Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!

426
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.500
When I was young, as yet I am not old,

427
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.070
I do remember how my father said

428
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.530
A stouter champion never handled sword.

429
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.670
Long since we were resolved of your truth,

430
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:29.930
Your faithful service and your toil in war;

431
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.930
Yet never have you tasted our reward,

432
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:34.270
Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,

433
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.870
Because till now we never saw your face:

434
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:41.870
Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,

435
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.500
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;

436
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.600
And in our coronation take your place.

437
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.770
Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,

438
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.600
Disgracing of these colours that I wear

439
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.870
In honour of my noble Lord of York:

440
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.270
Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?

441
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:27.270
Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage

442
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.770
The envious barking of your saucy tongue

443
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.700
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.

444
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.030
Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.

445
00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.230
Why, what is he? as good a man as York.

446
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:45.600
Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.

447
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.500
Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such

448
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.300
That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,

449
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:56.900
Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.

450
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.430
But I'll unto his majesty, and crave

451
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:02.530
I may have liberty to venge this wrong;

452
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.630
When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.

453
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.870
Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;

454
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.400
And, after, meet you sooner than you would.

455
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.070
