00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:54.300


2
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.770
Oh, for a muse of fire that would ascend

3
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.100
the brightest heaven of invention,

4
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.930
a kingdom for a stage, princes to act,

5
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.630
and monarchs to behold the swelling scene.

6
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.730
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,

7
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.500
assume the port of Mars;

8
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.730
and at his heels, leash'd in like hounds,

9
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.030
should famine, sword, and fire crouch for employment.

10
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.570
But pardon, gentles all,

11
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.270
the flat unraised spirits that have dared

12
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.070
on this unworthy scaffold

13
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.100
to bring forth so great an object.

14
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.030
Can this cockpit hold the vasty fields of France?

15
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.570
Or may we cram within this wooden O

16
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.700
the very casques

17
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.600
that did affright the air at Agincourt?

18
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.570
Oh, pardon,

19
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.030
since a crooked figure

20
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.370
may attest in little place a million,

21
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.400
and let us, ciphers to this great accompt,

22
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.030
on your imaginary forces work.

23
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.200
Suppose within the girdle of these walls

24
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.130
are now confined two mighty monarchies,

25
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.770
whose high upreared and abutting fronts

26
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.630
the perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.

27
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.700
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts.

28
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.630
Into a thousand parts divide one man,

29
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.600
and make imaginary puissance.

30
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.130
Think, when we talk of horses,

31
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.470
that you see them printing their proud hoofs

32
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.900
i' the receiving earth.

33
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.570
For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,

34
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.330
carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,

35
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.270
turning the accomplishment of many years

36
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.570
into an hourglass.

37
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.800
For the which supply, admit me chorus to this history,

38
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.530
who, prologue-like, your humble patience pray,

39
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.770
gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

40
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.970
My lord, I'll tell you:

41
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.400
that self bill is urged

42
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.600
which in the 11th year of the last king's reign

43
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.800
was like and had indeed against us passed,

44
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.600
but that the scambling and unquiet time

45
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.870
did push it out of further question.

46
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.400
How, my lord, shall we resist it now?

47
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.970
It must be thought on.

48
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.070
If it pass against us,

49
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.930
we lose the better half of our possession,

50
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.230
for all the temporal lands

51
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.630
which men devout by testament have given to the church

52
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.000
would they strip from us;

53
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.730
being valued thus:

54
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.870
as much as would maintain, to the king's honor,

55
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.400
full 15 earls and 1,500 knights,

56
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.100
6,200 good esquires;

57
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.070
and to relief of lazars and weak age,

58
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.500
of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,

59
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.630
100 almshouses right well supplied;

60
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.330
and to the coffers of the king beside,

61
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.030
1,000 pounds by the year.

62
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.570
Thus runs the bill.

63
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.330
This would drink deep.

64
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.300
'Twould drink the cup and all.

65
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.130
But what prevention?

66
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
The king is full of grace and fair regard.

67
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.230
And a true lover of the holy Church.

68
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.370
The courses of his youth promised it not.

69
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.670
The breath no sooner left his father's body

70
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.130
but that his wildness, mortified in him,

71
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.270
seemed to die too.

72
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.370
Yea, at that very moment,

73
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.270
consideration like an angel came

74
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.770
and whipped the offending Adam out of him,

75
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.630
leaving his body as a paradise

76
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.870
to envelop and contain celestial spirits.

77
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.270
Never was such a sudden scholar made.

78
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.370
Never came reformation

79
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.030
in a flood with such a heady currance,

80
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.270
scouring faults.

81
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.930
Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness

82
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.070
so soon did lose his seat, and all at once,

83
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.270
as in this king.

84
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.600
We are blessed in the change.

85
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.700
Hear him but reason in divinity,

86
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.670
and, all-admiring, with an inward wish

87
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.070
you would desire the king were made a prelate.

88
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.930
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,

89
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.770
you would say it hath been all in all his study.

90
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.000
List his discourse of war,

91
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.600
and you shall hear a fearful battle

92
00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.200
rendered you in music.

93
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.300
Turn him to any cause of policy,

94
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.030
the Gordian knot of it he will unloose,

95
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.330
familiar as his garter;

96
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.370
that, when he speaks,

97
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.830
the air, a chartered libertine,

98
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.730
is still;

99
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.000
and the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears

100
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.030
to steal his sweet and honeyed sentences

101
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.030
so that the art and practic' part of life

102
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.930
must be the mistress to this theoric--

103
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.030
which is a wonder how His Grace should glean it,

104
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.300
for his addiction was to courses vain;

105
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.800
his companies unlettered, rude, and shallow;

106
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.670
his hours filled up with riots, banquets, sports;

107
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.370
and never noted in him any study, any retirement,

108
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.370
any sequestration from open haunts and popularity.

109
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.030
How now for mitigation

110
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.530
of this bill urged by the commons?

111
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.470
Doth His Majesty incline to it or no?

112
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.200
He seems indifferent,

113
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.530
or rather swaying more upon our part

114
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:59.230
than cherishing the exhibiters against us,

115
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.100
for I have made an offer to His Majesty,

116
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.770
upon our spiritual convocation

117
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.800
and in regard of causes now in hand,

118
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.100
which I have opened to His Grace at large,

119
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.400
as touching France,

120
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.000
to give a greater sum

121
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.500
than ever at one time the clergy yet did

122
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.400
to his predecessors part withal.

123
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.970
How did this offer seem received, my lord?

124
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.670
With good acceptance of His Majesty,

125
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.600
save that there was not time enough to hear,

126
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.070
as I perceive His Grace would fain have done,

127
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.100
the severals and unhidden passages

128
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.130
of his true titles to some certain dukedoms

129
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.130
and generally to the crown and seat of France

130
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.270
derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.

131
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.570
What was the impediment that broke this off?

132
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.630
The French ambassador, upon that instant,

133
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.670
craved audience.

134
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.870
And the hour, I think, is come to give him hearing.

135
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.870
Is it 4:00?

136
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:51.870
It is.

137
00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.630
Then go we in to know his embassy.

138
00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.800
God and His angels guard your sacred throne

139
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.670
and make you long become it.

140
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.070
Sure, we thank you.

141
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.100
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed

142
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.630
and justly and religiously unfold

143
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.170
why the law Salique that they have in France

144
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.900
or should or should not bar us in our claim.

145
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.130
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,

146
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.870
that you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading

147
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.200
or nicely charge your understanding soul

148
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.100
with opening titles miscreate,

149
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.100
whose right suits

150
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.230
not in native colors with the truth,

151
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.300
for God doth know how many now in health

152
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.030
shall drop their blood in approbation

153
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.230
of what your reverence shall incite us to.

154
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.900
Therefore, take heed how you impawn our person,

155
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.200
how you awake our sleeping sword of war.

156
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.930
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed.

157
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.500
Then hear me, gracious sovereign,

158
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.630
and you peers

159
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.730
that owe yourselves, your lives, and services

160
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.470
to this imperial throne.

161
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.570
There is no bar to make against Your Highness' claim to France

162
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.130
but this...

163
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.430
which they produce from Pharamond.

164
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.100
"In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant."

165
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.270
"No woman shall succeed in Salique land,"

166
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.630
which Salique land

167
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.070
the French unjustly gloze to be the realm of France,

168
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.430
and Pharamond the found of this law and female bar.

169
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.270
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm

170
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.630
that the land Salique is in Germany

171
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.900
between the floods of Sala and of Elbe,

172
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.670
where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,

173
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.130
there left behind and settled certain French,

174
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.170
who, holding in disdain the German women

175
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.430
for some dishonest manners of their life,

176
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.770
established then this law, to wit,

177
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:53.130
no female should be inheritrix in Salique land--

178
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.400
which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,

179
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.230
is at this day in Germany called Meisen.

180
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.030
Then doth it well appear the Salique law

181
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.170
was not devised for the realm of France,

182
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.830
howbeit they would hold up this Salique law

183
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.300
to bar Your Highness claiming from the female

184
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.200
and rather choose to hide them in a net

185
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.130
than amply to imbar their crooked titles

186
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.900
usurp'd from you and your progenitors.

187
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.170
May I with right and conscience make this claim?

188
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.430
The sin upon my head, dread sovereign,

189
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.930
for in the book of Numbers is it writ,

190
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:23.830
"When the man dies,

191
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.500
let the inheritance descend unto the daughter."

192
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.600
Gracious lord,

193
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.630
stand for your own.

194
00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.930
Unwind your bloody flag!

195
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.200
Look back into your mighty ancestors.

196
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.930
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,

197
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.400
from whom you claim.

198
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.730
Invoke his warlike spirit

199
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.970
and your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince.

200
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.430
Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,

201
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.530
and with your puissant arm renew their feats.

202
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.470
Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth

203
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.470
do all expect that you should rouse yourself,

204
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.130
as did the former lions of your blood.

205
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.230
They know Your Grace hath cause and means and might,

206
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.930
so hath Your Highness.

207
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.100
Never king of England

208
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.300
had nobles richer nor more loyal subjects,

209
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.930
whose hearts have left their bodies

210
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.030
here in England

211
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.030
and lie pavilioned in the fields of France!

212
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.270
Oh, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,

213
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.670
with blood and sword and fire to win your right.

214
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.830
In aid whereof, we of the spiritualty

215
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.570
will raise Your Highness such a mighty sum

216
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.330
as never did the clergy at one time bring in

217
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.470
to any of your ancestors.

218
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.700
We must not only arm to invade the French

219
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.270
but lay down our proportion to defend against the Scot,

220
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.630
who will make road upon us with all advantages.

221
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.970
There is a saying,

222
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.330
very old and true.

223
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.670
"If that you will France win,

224
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.930
then with Scotland first begin."

225
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.700
For once the eagle England being in prey,

226
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.700
to her unguarded nest the weasel Scot comes sneaking

227
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.800
and so sucks her princely eggs,

228
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.270
playing the mouse in absence of the cat

229
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.430
to tear and havoc more than she can eat.

230
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.370
Well, it follows then, the cat must stay at home.

231
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.930
Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,

232
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.530
since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,

233
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.500
pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.

234
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.800
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,

235
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.330
the advised head defends itself at home.

236
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.470
For government, though high and low and lower,

237
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.300
put into parts doth keep in one consent,

238
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.800
congreeing in a full and natural close,

239
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.830
like music.

240
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.000
Therefore doth heaven

241
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.670
divide the state of man in divers functions,

242
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.230
setting endeavour in continual motion,

243
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.430
to which is fixed, as an aim or butt, obedience,

244
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.430
for thus work the honey bees,

245
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.070
creatures that, by a rule in nature,

246
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.630
teach the act of order to a peopled kingdom.

247
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.730
They have a king and officers of sorts,

248
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.070
where some, like magistrates, correct at home;

249
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.200
others, like merchants, venture trade abroad;

250
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.700
others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,

251
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.430
make root upon the summer's velvet buds,

252
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.470
which pillage they with merry march

253
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.670
bring home to the tent royal of their emperor,

254
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.900
who, busied in His Majesty,

255
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.870
surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold,

256
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.270
the civil citizens kneading up the honey,

257
00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.530
the poor mechanic porters

258
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.630
crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,

259
00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.070
the sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,

260
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.230
delivering o'er to executors pale

261
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.930
the lazy yawning drone.

262
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.100
I this infer:

263
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.670
that many things,

264
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.870
having full reference to one consent,

265
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.200
may work contrariously,

266
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.300
so many a thousand actions once afoot

267
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.370
end in one purpose

268
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:33.700
and be all well-borne without defeat.

269
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.830
Therefore to France, my liege!

270
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.770
Divide your happy England into four,

271
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.870
whereof take you one quarter into France,

272
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.070
and you withal shall make all Gallia shake.

273
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.000
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,

274
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.830
cannot defend our own doors from the dog,

275
00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.330
let us be worried

276
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.370
and our nation

277
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.130
lose the name of hardiness and policy.

278
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.500
Call in the messengers sent from the dauphin.

279
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.700
Now are we well-resolved,

280
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.300
and by God's help and yours,

281
00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.700
the noble sinews of our power,

282
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.900
France, being ours,

283
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.670
#we'll bend it to our awe or break it all to pieces.

284
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.000
Now are we well-prepared

285
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.300
to know the pleasure of our fair cousin dauphin,

286
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.870
for we hear your greeting is from him, not from the king.

287
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.200
May it please Your Majesty to give us leave

288
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.770
freely to render what we have in charge,

289
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.400
or shall we sparingly

290
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.070
show you far off

291
00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.070
the dauphin's meaning

292
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.330
and our embassy?

293
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.870
We are no tyrant but a Christian king

294
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.830
unto whose grace our passion is as subject

295
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.400
as are our wretches fettered in our prisons.

296
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.700
Therefore, with frank and with uncurbed plainness,

297
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.000
tell us the dauphin's mind.

298
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.970
Thus, then, in few.

299
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.800
Your Highness, lately sending into France,

300
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.070
did order certain dukedoms

301
00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:30.670
that you claimed of your great predecessor,

302
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.900
King Edward III.

303
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:38.370
In answer of which claim, the prince, our master,

304
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.470
says that you savor too much of your youth

305
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.500
and bids you be advised there's nought in France

306
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.330
that can be with a nimble galliard won.

307
00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.100
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.

308
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.430
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,

309
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.870
this ton of treasure,

310
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:58.870
and in lieu of this

311
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.470
desires you let the dukedoms that you claim

312
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.600
hear no more of you.

313
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.370
This the dauphin speaks.

314
00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.500
What treasure, Uncle?

315
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.330
Tennis balls, my liege.

316
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.200
We are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us.

317
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.530
His present and your pains we thank you for.

318
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.430
When we have matched our rackets to these balls,

319
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.600
we will, in France, by God's grace,

320
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.070
play a set shall strike his father's crown

321
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:52.430
into the hazard.

322
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.670
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler

323
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.600
that all the courts of France shall be disturbed with chaces.

324
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.930
And we understand him well,

325
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.500
how he comes o'er us with our wilder days,

326
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.630
not measuring what use we made of them.

327
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.630
We never valued this poor seat of England.

328
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.930
And therefore, living hence,

329
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.770
did give ourself to barbarous license,

330
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.600
as 'tis ever common that men are merriest

331
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.670
when they are from home.

332
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:20.670
But tell the dauphin I will keep my state,

333
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:22.930
be like a king,

334
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.330
and show my sail of greatness

335
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.430
when I do rouse me in my throne of France.

336
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:32.300
For that I have laid by my majesty

337
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.000
and plodded like a man for working days,

338
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.730
but I will rise there with so full a glory

339
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.500
that I shall dazzle all the eyes of France...

340
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.470
yea, strike the dauphin blind to look on us.

341
00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.700
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his

342
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.470
hath turned his balls to gunstones,

343
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.830
and his soul shall stand sore charged

344
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.000
for the wasteful vengeance that shall fly with them,

345
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.670
for many a thousand widows shall this, his mock,

346
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.430
mock out of their dear husbands,

347
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.470
mock mothers from their sons,

348
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.830
mock castles down.

349
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:21.270
And some are yet ungotten and unborn

350
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.570
that shall have cause to curse the dauphin's scorn.

351
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.270
But this lies all within the will of God,

352
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.470
to whom I do appeal

353
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.330
and in whose name, tell you the dauphin,

354
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:40.870
I am coming on to venge me as I may

355
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.600
and to put forth my rightful hand

356
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.400
in a well-hallow'd cause.

357
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.230
So get you hence in peace.

358
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.500
And tell the dauphin his jest will savor but of shallow wit

359
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.770
when thousands weep more than did laugh at it.

360
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.170
Convey them with safe conduct.

361
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.170
Fare you well.

362
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.670
This was a merry message.

363
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.700
We hope to make the sender blush at it.

364
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.570
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour

365
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.070
that may give furtherance to our expedition,

366
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.530
for we have now no thought in us but France,

367
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:25.070
save those to God, that run before our business.

368
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.170
Therefore, let our proportions for these wars

369
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.400
be soon collected

370
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.900
and all things thought upon

371
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.770
that may with reasonable swiftness

372
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.700
add more feathers to our wings,

373
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.030
for, God before,

374
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.570
we'll chide this dauphin at his father's door.

375
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.430
Now all the youth of England are on fire,

376
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.300
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies.

377
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.800
Now thrive the armorers,

378
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.970
and honor's thought

379
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.730
reigns solely in the breast of every man.

380
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:58.430
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,

381
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.600
following the mirror of all Christian kings,

382
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.670
with winged heels, as English Mercuries,

383
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.730
for now sits expectation in the air

384
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.330
and hides a sword from hilts unto the point

385
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.000
with crowns imperial,

386
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.100
crowns and coronets

387
00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.630
promised to Harry and his followers.

388
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.400
The French, advised by good intelligence

389
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.370
of this most dreadful preparation,

390
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.230
shake in their fear

391
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.470
and with pale policy

392
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.330
seek to divert the English purposes.

393
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.130
Oh, England,

394
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.530
model to thy inward greatness,

395
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.200
like little body with a mighty heart,

396
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.400
what mightst thou do-- that honor would thee do--

397
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.570
were all thy children kind and natural.

398
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.300
But see thy fault.

399
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.500
France hath in thee found out a nest of hollow bosoms,

400
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.700
which he fills with treacherous crowns,

401
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:48.100
and three corrupted men--

402
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.370
one Richard, Earl of Cambridge;

403
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.200
and the second, Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham;

404
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.330
and the third, Sir Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland--

405
00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.070
have, for the gilt of France-- oh, guilt indeed--

406
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.230
confirmed conspiracy with fearful France.

407
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.670
And by their hands,

408
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.830
this grace of kings must die

409
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.830
if hell and treason hold their promises

410
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:14.170
ere he take ship for France and in Southampton.

411
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.170
Linger your patience on,

412
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.970
and we'll digest the abuse of distance,

413
00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.270
force a play.

414
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:22.630
The sum is paid,

415
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.130
the traitors are agreed,

416
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.230
the king is set from London,

417
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.130
and the scene is now transported, gentles,

418
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.100
to Southampton.

419
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.800
There is the playhouse now.

420
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.500
There must you sit,

421
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.130
and thence to France shall we convey you safe

422
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.600
and bring you back,

423
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.430
charming the narrow seas to give you gentle pass,

424
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:44.630
for, if we may,

425
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.570
we'll not offend one stomach with our play.

426
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.670
But, till the king come forth and not till then,

427
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.270
unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

428
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.100
Well met, Corporal Nym.

429
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.230
What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?

430
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.430
For my part, I care not.

431
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.430
I say little,

432
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.970
but when time shall serve,

433
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.400
there shall be smiles.

434
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.570
But that shall be as it may.

435
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.130
I dare not fight,

436
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.470
but I will wink and hold out mine iron.

437
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.300
It is a simple one, but what, though?

438
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.030
It will toast cheese,

439
00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.600
and it will endure cold as another man's sword will,

440
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.300
and there's an end.

441
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.430
I will bestow a breakfast to make you two friends,

442
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.830
and we'll be, all three, sworn brothers to France.

443
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:36.530
Let it be so, good Corporal Nym.

444
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.330
Faith, I will live so long as I may,

445
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:39.770
that's the certain of it,

446
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.570
and when I cannot live any longer,

447
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.300
I will do as I may.

448
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.630
That is my rest.

449
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.900
That is the rendezvous of it.

450
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.030
It is certain he is married to Nell Quickly,

451
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.530
and certainly, she did you wrong,

452
00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:57.000
for you was trothplight to her.

453
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.400
I cannot tell.

454
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.230
Things must be as they may.

455
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.700
Men may sleep,

456
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.500
and they may have their throats about them

457
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.500
at that time,

458
00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.170
and some say knives have edges.

459
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.730
It must be as it may.

460
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.000
Though patience be a tired mare, yet she will plod.

461
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.530
There must be conclusions.

462
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.500
Well, I cannot tell.

463
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.730
How now, mine host, Pistol.

464
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.830
Base tike, call'st thou me host?

465
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.070
Now, by this hand, I scorn the term.

466
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.900
Nor will my Nell keep lodgers.

467
00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.030
No, by my troth,

468
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.100
for we cannot lodge or board

469
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:36.970
a dozen or 14 gentlewomen

470
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.070
that live honestly by the prick of their needles,

471
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.900
but it will be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.

472
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.070
Ha!

473
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.770
Oh, well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn.

474
00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.770
Now we shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.

475
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:50.770
Good Lieutenant!

476
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.770
Good Corporal!

477
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:52.900
Offer nothing here.

478
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.130
Pish!

479
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.130
Pish for thee, Iceland dog,

480
00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.830
thou prick-eared cur of Iceland.

481
00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.870
Good Corporal Nym, show thy valor.

482
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:02.870
Put up your sword!

483
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:03.870
Hear me!

484
00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.370
Hear me what I say!

485
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.430
He that strikes the first stroke,

486
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.470
I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.

487
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.600
An oath of mickle might,

488
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.870
and fury will abate.

489
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.700
Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master,

490
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.370
and you, hostess.

491
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.700
He is very sick and would to bed.

492
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.630
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets,

493
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.200
and do the office of a warming pan.

494
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.270
Away, you rogue.

495
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.330
Faith, he's very ill.

496
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.930
By my troth,

497
00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:34.170
he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days.

498
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.170
The king has killed his heart.

499
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.270
Come, shall I make you friends?

500
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.470
We must to France together.

501
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.030
Why the devil should we keep knives

502
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.670
to cut one another's throats?

503
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:51.070
Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on.

504
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:54.070
You'll pay me the 8 shillings I won of you at betting.

505
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.570
Base is a slave that pays.

506
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:57.800
That now I will have.

507
00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.830
That's the humor of it.

508
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.800
As manhood shall compound.

509
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.030
Push home!

510
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:05.270
By this sword,

511
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.370
he that makes the first thrust, I'll kill him.

512
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.630
By this sword, I will.

513
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.430
A sword is an oath,

514
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.030
and oaths must have their course.

515
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:18.370
Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends,

516
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.030
be friends!

517
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.930
An thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.

518
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.700
Prithee, put up.

519
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.330
I shall have my 8 shillings I won of you at betting?

520
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:33.830
A noble shalt thou have and present pay,

521
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.900
and liquor likewise will I give to thee,

522
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.470
and friendship shall combine and brotherhood.

523
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.600
I shall live by Nym,

524
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.830
and Nym shall live by me.

525
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.570
Is not that just?

526
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.770
For I shall sutler be unto the camp,

527
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.800
and profits will accrue.

528
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:55.170
Give me thy hand.

529
00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.600
I shall have my noble.

530
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.670
In cash most justly paid.

531
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.300
Well, then, that's the humor of't.

532
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.500
As ever you come of women, come in quickly to Sir John.

533
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.700
Ah, poor heart.

534
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.330
He is so shaked of a burning quotidian tertian

535
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.530
'tis most lamentable to behold.

536
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.630
Sweet men, come to him.

537
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.130
The king hath run bad humors on the knight.

538
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.130
That's the even of it.

539
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.400
Nym, thou hast spoke the right.

540
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.570
His heart is fracted and corroborate.

541
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.730
The king is a good king,

542
00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:24.230
but it must be as it may.

543
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.370
He passes some humors and careers.

544
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.230
Let us condole the knight,

545
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:33.130
for, lambkins, we will live.

546
00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.630
'Fore God, His Grace is bold to trust such traitors.

547
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:44.030
They shall be apprehended by and by.

548
00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.530
How smooth and even they do bear themselves,

549
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.330
as if allegiance in their bosoms

550
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.500
sat crowned with faith and constant loyalty!

551
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.870
Shh.

552
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.000
The king hath note of all that they intend

553
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.200
by interception which they dream not of.

554
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.230
Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,

555
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.770
whom he hath dulled and cloyed with gracious favors--

556
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.500
that he should, for a foreign purse,

557
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.270
so sell his sovereign's life to death and treachery.

558
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:16.730
Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.

559
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:21.730
My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham

560
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.570
and you, my gentle knight,

561
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.730
give me your thoughts.

562
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.670
Think you not that the powers we bear with us

563
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.070
will cut their passage through the force of France,

564
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.430
doing the execution and the act

565
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.430
for which we have in head assembled them?

566
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.630
No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

567
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.970
I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded

568
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.630
we carry not a heart with us from hence

569
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.300
that grows not in a fair consent with ours

570
00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.400
nor leave not one behind

571
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.170
that doth not wish success and conquest

572
00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.170
to attend on us.

573
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.330
Never was monarch

574
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.370
better feared and loved than is Your Majesty.

575
00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:49.730
There's not, I think, a subject

576
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.600
that sits in heart grief and uneasiness

577
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.470
under the sweet shade of your government.

578
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.570
True.

579
00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.300
Those that were your father's enemies

580
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.870
have steeped their galls in honey

581
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.970
and do serve you

582
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.030
with hearts create of duty and of zeal.

583
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.130
We therefore have great cause of thankfulness

584
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:05.870
and shall forget the office of our hand

585
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.730
sooner than quittance of desert and merit

586
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.730
according to the weight and worthiness.

587
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.130
So service shall with steeled sinews toil,

588
00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.000
and labor shall refresh itself with hope

589
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.630
to do Your Grace incessant services.

590
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.130
We judge no less.

591
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.130
Uncle of Exeter,

592
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.800
enlarge the man committed yesterday

593
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.200
that railed against our person.

594
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.670
We consider it was excess of wine

595
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:24.700
that set him on,

596
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.400
and on his more advice, we pardon him.

597
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.070
That's mercy, but too much security.

598
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.200
Let him be punished, sovereign,

599
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.170
lest example breed, by his sufferance,

600
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.570
more of such a kind.

601
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.870
Oh, let us yet be merciful.

602
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.230
So may Your Highness, and yet punish too.

603
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:43.600
Sir, you show great mercy if you give him life

604
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.570
after the taste of much correction.

605
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.400
Alas, your too much love and care of me

606
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.900
are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch.

607
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.030
If little faults, proceeding on distemper,

608
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.370
shall not be winked at,

609
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.870
how shall we stretch our eye when capital crimes,

610
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.470
chewed, swallowed, and digested,

611
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.370
appear before us?

612
00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.600
We'll yet enlarge that man,

613
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.400
though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey,

614
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.430
in their dear care

615
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.170
and tender preservation of our person,

616
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.300
would have him punished.

617
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.100
And now to our French causes.

618
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.500
Who are the late commissioners?

619
00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.530
I one, my lord.

620
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.270
Your Highness bade me ask for it today.

621
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.270
So did you me, my liege.

622
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:17.830
And I, my royal sovereign.

623
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.400
Then, Richard, Earl of Cambridge,

624
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.200
there is yours;

625
00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.030
there yours, Lord Scroop of Masham;

626
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.330
and, Sir Knight Grey of Northumberland,

627
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.830
this same is yours.

628
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:29.500
Read them,

629
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.330
and know I know your worthiness.

630
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.570
My Lord of Westmoreland, Uncle Exeter,

631
00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:36.570
we will aboard tonight.

632
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.370
Why, how now, gentlemen?

633
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.570
What see you in those papers

634
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.700
that you lose so much complexion?

635
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.100
Look, ye, how they change.

636
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.130
Their cheeks are paper.

637
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.700
Why, what read you there that have so cowarded

638
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.700
and chased your blood out of appearance?

639
00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.830
I do confess my fault

640
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:03.000
and do submit me to Your Highness' mercy.

641
00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.730
To which we all appeal.

642
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.400
The mercy that was quick in us but late

643
00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.900
by your own counsel is suppressed and killed.

644
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.630
You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy,

645
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.570
for your own reasons turn into your bosoms,

646
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:22.170
as dogs upon their masters, worrying you.

647
00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.930
See you, my princes and my noble peers,

648
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.130
these English monsters.

649
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.430
My Lord of Cambridge here,

650
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.970
you know how apt our love was to accord to furnish him

651
00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:36.170
with all appurtenants belonging to his honor;

652
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.130
and this man hath for a few light crowns,

653
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.770
lightly conspired and sworn unto the practices of France

654
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.200
to kill us here in Hampton;

655
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.500
to the which this knight,

656
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.170
no less for bounty bound to us than Cambridge is,

657
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.170
hath likewise sworn.

658
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:05.400
But, oh, what shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop?

659
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.570
Thou cruel,

660
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.130
ingrateful,

661
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.270
savage,

662
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.570
and inhuman creature?

663
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:24.300
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,

664
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.730
that knew'st the very bottom of my soul,

665
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.530
that almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,

666
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.400
wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use?

667
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.430
May it be possible that foreign hire

668
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.530
could out of thee extract one spark of evil

669
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.770
that might annoy my finger?

670
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.330
'Tis so strange that, though the truth of it

671
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.300
stand off as gross as black and white,

672
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.200
my eye will scarcely see it.

673
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.900
Oh, how hast thou with jealousy

674
00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.700
infected the sweetness of affiance.

675
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.030
Show men dutiful?

676
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:07.570
Why...

677
00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.070
so didst thou.

678
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.600
Seem they grave and learned?

679
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.700
Why...

680
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.200
so didst thou.

681
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.170
Come they of noble family?

682
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.000
Why...

683
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.500
so didst thou.

684
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.630
Seem they religious?

685
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.430
Why...

686
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.930
so didst thou.

687
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.730
And thus, thy fall hath left a kind of blot

688
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:42.500
to mark the full-fraught man and best indued

689
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.930
with some suspicion.

690
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.670
I will weep for thee,

691
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.530
for this revolt of thine, methinks,

692
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.570
is like another fall of man.

693
00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.800
Their faults are open.

694
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.430
Arrest them to the answer of the law,

695
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.430
and God acquit them of their practices.

696
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.500
Our purposes God justly hath discovered,

697
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.100
and I repent my fault more than my death,

698
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.770
which I beseech Your Highness to forgive

699
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.370
although my body pay the price of it.

700
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.600
For me, the gold of France did not seduce,

701
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.170
although I did admit it as a motive

702
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.300
the sooner to effect what I intended.

703
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.370
But God be thanked for prevention,

704
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.100
which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,

705
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.230
beseeching God and you to pardon me.

706
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.000
Never did faithful subject

707
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.870
more rejoice at the discovery of most dangerous treason

708
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.300
than I do at this hour joy o'er myself,

709
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.430
prevented from a damned enterprise.

710
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.530
My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

711
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.600
God quit you in His mercy.

712
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.100
Hear your sentence.

713
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.770
You have conspired against our royal person,

714
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.370
joined with an enemy proclaimed,

715
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:05.730
and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death,

716
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.570
wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,

717
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.600
his princes and his peers to servitude,

718
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.570
his subjects to oppression and contempt,

719
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.830
and his whole kingdom into desolation.

720
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:21.270
Touching our person, seek we no revenge,

721
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:23.970
but we our kingdom's safety must so tender,

722
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:26.000
whose ruin you have sought,

723
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.030
that to her laws we do deliver you.

724
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.800
Get you therefore hence, poor, miserable wretches,

725
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.030
to your death,

726
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.170
the taste whereof

727
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.100
God of His mercy give you patience to endure

728
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.200
and true repentance of all your dear offences.

729
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800
Bear them hence.

730
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.500
Now, lords, for France,

731
00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.530
the enterprise whereof

732
00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.670
shall be to you, as us, like glorious.

733
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:05.500
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,

734
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.530
since God so graciously hath brought to light

735
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.770
this dangerous treason lurking in our way

736
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.770
to hinder our beginnings.

737
00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:15.370
We doubt not now but every rub is smoothed on our way.

738
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.100
Then forth, dear countrymen.

739
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.370
Let us deliver our puissance into the hand of God,

740
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:22.000
putting it straight in expedition.

741
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.400
Cheerly to sea.

742
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.330
The signs of war advance.

743
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:31.530
No king of England if not king of France.

744
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.170
God save the king!

745
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.270
God save the king!

746
00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.000
Honey, sweet husband,

747
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.430
let me bring thee to Staines.

748
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.430
No, for my manly heart doth yearn.

749
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:57.200
Bardolph, be blithe.

750
00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.830
Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins.

751
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.400
Boy, bristle thy courage up,

752
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.100
for Falstaff,

753
00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.830
he is dead,

754
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.800
and we must yearn therefore.

755
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:11.870
Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is,

756
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.770
either in heaven or in hell.

757
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.770
Nay, sure, he's not in hell.

758
00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.730
He's in Arthur's bosom,

759
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.470
if ever man went to Arthur's bosom.

760
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.300
A' made a finer end

761
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.470
and went away

762
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.000
an it had been any christom child.

763
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.730
A' parted even just between 12:00 and 1:00,

764
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.170
even at the turning of the tide,

765
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:40.900
for after I saw him

766
00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.670
fumble with the sheets

767
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.170
and play with flowers

768
00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.530
and smile upon his fingers' ends,

769
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.330
I knew there was but one way.

770
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:56.370
For his nose was as sharp as a pen,

771
00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.930
and a' babbled o' green fields.

772
00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:02.800
"How now, Sir John?" quoth I.

773
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:04.900
"Come, man.

774
00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.770
Be of good cheer."

775
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.270
So a' cried out,

776
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.870
"God,

777
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.230
God, God,"

778
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.570
three or four times.

779
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.870
Now I, to comfort him,

780
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:21.470
bid him a' should not think of God.

781
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:24.100
I hoped there was no need to trouble himself

782
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.670
with any such thoughts yet.

783
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:31.700
So a' bade me put more clothes on his feet.

784
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.430
And I put my hand in the bed, and I felt them,

785
00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.530
and they were as cold as any stone.

786
00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.270
And then I felt up to his knees,

787
00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.700
and so upward and upward,

788
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.530
and all was as cold as any stone.

789
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.530
They say he cried out of sack.

790
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.000
Aye, that a' did.

791
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
And of women.

792
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.400
Nay, that a' did not.

793
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.730
That a' did, and said they were devils incarnate.

794
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.100
A' could never abide carnation.

795
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.470
'Twas a color he never liked.

796
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.670
A' said once the devil would have him about women.

797
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:10.530
A' did in some sorts handle women,

798
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:11.630
but then he was rheumatic

799
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.070
and talked of the whore of Babylon.

800
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:15.330
Do you not remember?

801
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:18.230
A' saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose

802
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.270
and said it was a black soul burning in hell?

803
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.430
Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire.

804
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.070
That's all the riches I got in his service.

805
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.300
Shall we shog?

806
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.330
Yeah, the king will be gone from Southampton.

807
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.070
Come, let's away.

808
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.430
My love,

809
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.400
give me thy lips.

810
00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.530
Look to my chattels and my movables.

811
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.900
Go, clear thy crystals.

812
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.630
Yokefellows in arms, let us to France,

813
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:50.200
like horseleeches, my boys,

814
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.700
to suck,

815
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.200
to suck,

816
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:56.300
the very blood to suck!

817
00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.430
And that's but unwholesome food, they say.

818
00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.600
Touch her soft mouth, and march.

819
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.600
Farewell, hostess.

820
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.330
I cannot kiss.

821
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.430
That's the humor of it.

822
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:19.430
But, adieu.

823
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.330
Let housewifery appear.

824
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.500
Keep close, I thee command!

825
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.170
Farewell.

826
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:40.470
Farewell!

827
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.470
Farewell!

828
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.370
Adieu.

829
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.430
Thus comes the English with full power upon us,

830
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.470
and more than carefully it us concerns

831
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.000
to answer royally in our defenses.

832
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.400
Therefore, the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,

833
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.530
of Brabant and Orleans

834
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.700
shall make forth,

835
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.970
and you, Prince Dauphin,

836
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.730
with all swift dispatch

837
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:16.100
to line and new repair our towns of war

838
00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.830
with men of courage and with means defendant.

839
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.070
My most redoubted father,

840
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.270
it is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe.

841
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.170
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,

842
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.400
though war nor no known quarrel were in question

843
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.230
but that defenses, musters, preparations

844
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.970
should be maintained, assembled, and collected,

845
00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.770
as were a war in expectation.

846
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.530
Therefore, I say, 'tis meet we all go forth

847
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:45.000
to view the sick and feeble parts of France.

848
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.700
And let us do it with no show of fear.

849
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.030
No, with no more than if we heard that England

850
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.270
were busied with a Whitsun morris dance,

851
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.200
for, my good liege, she is so idly kinged,

852
00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.830
her sceptre so fantastically borne

853
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.330
by a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,

854
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:02.470
that fear attends her not.

855
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.730
Oh, peace, Prince Dauphin.

856
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.900
You are too much mistaken in this king.

857
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.230
Question Your Grace the late ambassadors

858
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.270
with what great state he heard their embassy,

859
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.200
how well supplied with noble counselors,

860
00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.570
how modest in exception,

861
00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:17.600
and withal how terrible in constant resolution,

862
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.930
and you shall find his vanities forspent

863
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.630
were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,

864
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:25.200
covering discretion with a coat of folly.

865
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.270
Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable,

866
00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.500
but though we think it so, it is no matter.

867
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.500
Ah!

868
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.970
In cases of defense,

869
00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:37.130
'tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems

870
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.500
so the proportions of defense are filled,

871
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.570
which, of a weak and niggardly projection,

872
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:44.070
doth, like a miser, spoil his coat

873
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.530
with scanting a little cloth.

874
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:47.270
Think we King Harry strong,

875
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.300
and, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.

876
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.630
The kindred of him hath been fleshed upon us,

877
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.170
and he is bred out of that bloody strain

878
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.530
that haunted us in our familiar paths.

879
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:02.670
Witness our too much memorable shame

880
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.000
when CrÈcy battle fatally was struck

881
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.700
and all our princes captived

882
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:11.170
by the hand of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales.

883
00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.230
This is a stem of that victorious stock,

884
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.530
and let us fear the native mightiness

885
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.370
and fate of him.

886
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.600
Ambassadors from Harry, King of England,

887
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.800
do crave admittance to Your Majesty.

888
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.870
We'll give them present audience.

889
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:30.870
Your Majesty!

890
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:32.100
Go, and bring them.

891
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:38.300
You see, this chase is hotly followed, friends.

892
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.430
Turn head, and stop pursuit,

893
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.800
for coward dogs most spend their mouths

894
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.170
when what they seem to threaten runs far before them.

895
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.130
Good my sovereign,

896
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.530
take up the English short,

897
00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:51.600
and let them know

898
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.330
of what a monarchy you are the head.

899
00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.800
Self-love, my liege,

900
00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.270
is not so vile a sin as self-neglecting.

901
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:16.630
From our brother of England?

902
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:17.870
From him,

903
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:21.300
and thus he greets Your Majesty.

904
00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.270
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,

905
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.670
that you divest yourself

906
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:28.530
and lay apart the borrowed glories

907
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:29.600
that by gift of heaven,

908
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.500
by law of nature and of nations

909
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.370
'longs to him and to his heirs,

910
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.530
namely the crown--

911
00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.900
and all wide-stretched honors

912
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.100
that pertain by custom and the ordinance of times

913
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.970
unto the crown of France.

914
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.000
Or else what follows?

915
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.700
Bloody constraint,

916
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.000
for if you hide the crown even in your hearts,

917
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.630
there will he rake for it.

918
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.600
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,

919
00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.330
in thunder and in earthquake--

920
00:44:00.330 --> 00:44:03.870
like a Jove that, if requiring fail,

921
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.200
he will compel--

922
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.070
and bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,

923
00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:09.830
deliver up the crown

924
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.800
and to take mercy on the poor souls

925
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.670
for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws--

926
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:19.100
and on your head turning the widows' tears,

927
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.730
the orphans' cries, the dead men's blood,

928
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.300
the privy maidens' groans

929
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.830
for husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers

930
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:30.070
that shall be swallowed in this controversy.

931
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.630
This is his claim,

932
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:35.470
his threatening,

933
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:36.670
and my message.

934
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:41.570
Unless the dauphin be in presence here,

935
00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.970
to whom expressly I bring greeting to.

936
00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.970
For us, we will consider of this further.

937
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.100
Your Majesty!

938
00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.870
Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent

939
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:52.700
back to our brother of England.

940
00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:59.000
For the dauphin,

941
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.570
I stand here for him.

942
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.730
What to him from England?

943
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.070
Scorn and defiance,

944
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.400
slight regard, contempt,

945
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.530
and anything

946
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:16.570
that may not misbecome the mighty sender

947
00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:20.430
doth he prize you at.

948
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.570
Say...

949
00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.330
if my father render fair return,

950
00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.530
it is against my will,

951
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:32.770
for I desire nothing but odds with England.

952
00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:37.130
To that end, as matching to his youth and vanity,

953
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.600
I did present him with the Paris balls.

954
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.730
He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,

955
00:45:43.730 --> 00:45:47.900
were it the mistress court of mighty Europe.

956
00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.770
And be assured, you'll find a difference,

957
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.300
as we his subjects have in wonder found,

958
00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.400
between the promise of his greener days

959
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.030
and these he masters now.

960
00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:03.230
Now he weighs time even to the utmost grain.

961
00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.600
That you shall read in your own losses

962
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.230
if he stay in France.

963
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:10.900
Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.

964
00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.600
Dispatch us with all speed,

965
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.400
lest that our king come here himself

966
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.400
to question our delay,

967
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.130
for he is footed in this land already.

968
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.370
You shall be soon dispatched with fair conditions.

969
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.330
A night is but small breath and little pause

970
00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:27.530
to answer matters of this consequence!

971
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.130
Thus with imagined wing, our swift scene flies

972
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.770
in motion of no less celerity than that of thought.

973
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.930
Suppose that you have seen the well-appointed king

974
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.830
at Hampton pier embark his royalty

975
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.070
and his brave fleet with silken streamers

976
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.530
the young Phoebus fanning.

977
00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:50.630
Play with your fancies,

978
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.630
and in them behold upon the hempen tackle

979
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.570
ship boys climbing.

980
00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:55.730
Hear the shrill whistle

981
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.770
which doth order give to sounds confused.

982
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.730
Behold the threaden sails,

983
00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.200
borne with the invisible and creeping wind,

984
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.830
draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,

985
00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:07.800
breasting the lofty surge.

986
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.900
Oh, do but think you stand upon the rivage

987
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.230
and behold a city

988
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.370
on the inconstant billows dancing,

989
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:16.670
for so appears this fleet majestical,

990
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.230
holding due course to Harfleur.

991
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.270
Follow, follow.

992
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.330
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,

993
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:28.530
and leave your England, as dead midnight still,

994
00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.330
guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,

995
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:34.730
either past or not arrived at pith and puissance,

996
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:36.670
for who is he whose chin

997
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.030
is but enriched with one appearing hair,

998
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:40.200
that will not follow

999
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.330
these culled and choice-drawn cavaliers

1000
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:43.330
to France?

1001
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:45.500
Work, work your thoughts,

1002
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.830
and therein see a siege.

1003
00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.030
Behold the ordnance on their carriages,

1004
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:53.970
with fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.

1005
00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:57.270
Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back,

1006
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.730
tells Harry that the king

1007
00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:00.870
doth offer him Katharine his daughter

1008
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.300
and with her, to dowry,

1009
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.530
some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.

1010
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.630
The offer likes not,

1011
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:08.900
and the nimble gunner

1012
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.870
with linstock now the devilish cannon touches,

1013
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.570
and down goes all before them.

1014
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.470
Still be kind,

1015
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.700
and eke out our performance with your mind.

1016
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.830
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!

1017
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.000
Or close the wall up with our English dead!

1018
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.570
In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man

1019
00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:39.500
as modest stillness and humility.

1020
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:42.570
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,

1021
00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.000
then imitate the action of the tiger.

1022
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.930
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,

1023
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.130
disguise fair nature with hard-favored rage.

1024
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:52.770
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect.

1025
00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:54.600
Let it pry through the portage of the head

1026
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.300
like the brass cannon!

1027
00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.270
Let the brow o'erwhelm it as fearfully

1028
00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:01.470
as doth a galled rock o'erhang and jutty his confounded base,

1029
00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.870
swilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.

1030
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.970
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,

1031
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:07.970
hold hard the breath,

1032
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:11.130
and bend up every spirit to his full height!

1033
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.530
On, on, you noblest English,

1034
00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:16.030
whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof.

1035
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.530
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,

1036
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.700
have in these parts from morn till even fought

1037
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.130
and sheathed their swords for lack of argument.

1038
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.700
Dishonor not your mothers!

1039
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.730
Now attest that those whom you called fathers

1040
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.430
did beget you.

1041
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.200
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,

1042
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.530
and teach them how to war.

1043
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.070
And you, good yeomen,

1044
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.570
whose limbs were made in England,

1045
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.900
show us here the mettle of your pasture.

1046
00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.600
Let us swear that you are worth your breeding,

1047
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.600
which I doubt not,

1048
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.430
for there is none of you so mean and base

1049
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:49.700
that hath not noble luster in your eyes.

1050
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:54.130
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,

1051
00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:56.730
straining upon the start.

1052
00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.100
The game's afoot.

1053
00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.570
Follow your spirit,

1054
00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.200
and upon this charge cry,

1055
00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.900
"God for Harry,

1056
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.330
"England,

1057
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.470
and Saint George!"

1058
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.070
On!

1059
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:11.070
To the breach!

1060
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:12.070
To the breach!

1061
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.270
Pray thee, Corporal, stay!

1062
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.270
To the breach!

1063
00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:16.230
The knocks are too hot!

1064
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.470
And, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives.

1065
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:19.830
The humor of it is too hot.

1066
00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.770
That's the very plainsong of it.

1067
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.130
Plainsong is most just, for humors do abound.

1068
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:26.500
"Knocks go and come.

1069
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.300
"God's vassals drop and die,

1070
00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.400
"and sword and shield, in bloody field,

1071
00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.100
doth win immortal fame!"

1072
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.970
Would I were in an alehouse in London.

1073
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.700
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.

1074
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.100
And I.

1075
00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.730
"If wishes would prevail with me,

1076
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.370
"my purpose should not fail with me,

1077
00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:43.630
but thither would I hie."

1078
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.500
"As duly, but not as truly,

1079
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.870
as bird doth sing on bough."

1080
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:50.000
Up to the breach, you dogs!

1081
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.870
Avaunt, you cullions!

1082
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:55.370
Be merciful, great Duke, to men of mold.

1083
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:56.670
Abate thy rage!

1084
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.130
Abate thy manly rage!

1085
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.100
Bate thy rage, great duke!

1086
00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.600
Good bawcock, bate thy rage!

1087
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.130
Use lenity, sweet chuck!

1088
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:06.430
These be good humors.

1089
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.170
Your honor wins bad humors.

1090
00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.170
Ah!

1091
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:16.670
As young as I am,

1092
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.100
I have observed these three swashers,

1093
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.200
and I am boy to them, all three.

1094
00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.530
but all they three,

1095
00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:23.930
though they would serve me,

1096
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:25.430
could not be man to me,

1097
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:28.930
for indeed, three such antics do not amount to a man.

1098
00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:31.230
For Bardolph,

1099
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.370
he is white-livered and red-faced.

1100
00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:37.900
The means whereof, he faces it out but fights not.

1101
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:39.000
For Pistol,

1102
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.330
he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword.

1103
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:42.630
The means whereof,

1104
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:45.000
he breaks words and keeps whole weapons.

1105
00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.430
For Nym,

1106
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:48.930
he have heard that men of few words

1107
00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.100
are the best men

1108
00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.370
and therefore scorns to say his prayers

1109
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.470
lest he should be thought a coward.

1110
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:55.700
But his few bad words

1111
00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.630
are matched with as few good deeds.

1112
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.700
He never broke any man's head but his own,

1113
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.730
and that was against a post when he was drunk.

1114
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:05.770
They will steal anything and call it purchase.

1115
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:07.930
Bardolph stole a lute case,

1116
00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:11.430
bore it 12 leagues, and sold it for 3 halfpence.

1117
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.200
Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching,

1118
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.100
and in Calais, they stole a fire shovel.

1119
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.970
I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals.

1120
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.430
They would have me familiar with men's pockets

1121
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:24.270
as their gloves or handkerchiefs,

1122
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.500
which makes much against my manhood

1123
00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.800
if I should take from another's pocket

1124
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.400
to put into mine own,

1125
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.430
for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.

1126
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.870
I must leave them and seek some better service.

1127
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:39.730
Their villainy goes much against my weak stomach,

1128
00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.800
and therefore, I must cast it up.

1129
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:43.530
Captain Fluellen,

1130
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.200
you must come presently to the mines.

1131
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.170
The Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.

1132
00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:48.170
To the mines?

1133
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.300
Tell you the duke

1134
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.970
it is not so good to come to the mines.

1135
00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.800
The mines is not according to the disciplines of the war.

1136
00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.300
The concavities of it is not sufficient.

1137
00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:59.330
The adversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look you now,

1138
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:03.670
is digged himself 4 yard under the countermines.

1139
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:06.700
By Cheshu, I think he will blow up all

1140
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.830
if there is not better direction.

1141
00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:10.600
The Duke of Gloucester,

1142
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.030
to whom the order of the siege is given,

1143
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.030
is altogether directed by an Irishman...

1144
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.230
a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.

1145
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:25.230
It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?

1146
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:26.730
I think it be.

1147
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.600
By Cheshu!

1148
00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.000
He is an ass as in the world!

1149
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.800
I will verify as much in his beard.

1150
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:34.900
He has no more directions

1151
00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.730
in the true disciplines of the war,

1152
00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.670
the Roman disciplines,

1153
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:40.400
than is a puppy dog.

1154
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:45.070
Here a' comes now,

1155
00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.670
and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.

1156
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:50.070
Captain Jamy is a marvelous valorous gentleman,

1157
00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.470
that is certain,

1158
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:54.330
and of great expedition and knowledge in the aunchient wars,

1159
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:56.530
upon my particular knowledge of his directions.

1160
00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.000
By Cheshu,

1161
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.370
he will maintain his argument

1162
00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.400
as well as any military man in the world

1163
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.870
in the disciplines

1164
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.430
of the pristine wars of the Romans.

1165
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:13.530
I say good day to you, Captain Fluellen.

1166
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:16.000
God-den to your worship, good Captain James.

1167
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.800
How now, Captain Macmorris?

1168
00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.130
Have you quit the mines?

1169
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.800
Have the pioneers given o'er?

1170
00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.100
By Chrish, la'!

1171
00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.370
'Tish ill done!

1172
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.370
The work is give over.

1173
00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.370
The trumpet sound the retreat.

1174
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:29.630
By my hand, I swear, and my father's soul,

1175
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.200
the work is ill done.

1176
00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.100
'Tis give over.

1177
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.830
I would have blowed up the town,

1178
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.730
so Christ save me, la', in an hour.

1179
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.070
Oh, 'tish ill done.

1180
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:40.430
'Tish ill done.

1181
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:42.430
By my hand, 'tish ill done.

1182
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:46.970
Captain Macmorris...

1183
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.370
I beseech you, will you vouchsafe me

1184
00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:52.970
a few disputations with you

1185
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:56.230
as touching or concerning the disciplines of the war,

1186
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:57.630
the Roman wars,

1187
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.430
in the way of argument and friendly communication?

1188
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.930
Partly to satisfy my opinion

1189
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:03.930
and partly also for the satisfaction,

1190
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:05.870
look you, of my mind,

1191
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:09.900
as touching the directions of the military discipline?

1192
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.370
That is the point.

1193
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:12.870
It shall be very good, good faith,

1194
00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:14.030
good captains bath.

1195
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:15.730
and I shall quit you with good love,

1196
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:16.930
as I may pick occasion.

1197
00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.070
And that shall I, marry.

1198
00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:22.800
It is no time to discourse, so Christ save me.

1199
00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.970
The day is hot--

1200
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:25.370
and the weather and the wars

1201
00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:26.500
and the king and the dukes.

1202
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.830
It is no time to discourse!

1203
00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:30.530
The town is beseeched,

1204
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.530
and the trumpet call us to the breach,

1205
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:35.970
and we talk and, be Christ, do nothing!

1206
00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:38.500
'Tis shame for us all, so God save me.

1207
00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.100
'Tis shame to stand still.

1208
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.000
'Tis shame, by my hand.

1209
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.600
And there is throats to be cut and works to be done.

1210
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:50.200
And there is nothing done, so Christ save me, la'!

1211
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.500
By the mess,

1212
00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.770
ere these eyes of mine take themselves to slumber,

1213
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:54.930
I'll do good service,

1214
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:56.330
or I'll lig i' the ground for it.

1215
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.870
Aye, or go to death.

1216
00:55:58.870 --> 00:56:01.500
But I'll pay it as valorously as I may,

1217
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:04.500
that shall I surely do, that at the brief and the long.

1218
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:07.830
Marry, I'd full fain heard some question 'tween you tway.

1219
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:09.300
Captain Macmorris,

1220
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.570
look you, under your correction,

1221
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:13.970
I do not think there is not many of your nation.

1222
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.130
Nation?

1223
00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:18.100
Of my nation?

1224
00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.900
What is my nation?

1225
00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:22.400
Ish a villain?

1226
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.970
And a bastard?

1227
00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.600
And a knave?

1228
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.200
And a rascal?

1229
00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.470
What is my nation?

1230
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.530
Who talks of my nation?

1231
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.030
Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is meant,

1232
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.230
Captain Macmorris,

1233
00:56:35.230 --> 00:56:37.170
peradventure I shall think you do not use me

1234
00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:38.470
with that love and affability

1235
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.700
as in discretion you ought to use me, look you,

1236
00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.400
being as good a man as yourself

1237
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.370
both in the disciplines of the war

1238
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.230
and in the derivation of my birth

1239
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:48.370
and in other particularities.

1240
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.770
I do not know you so good a man as myself.

1241
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:53.370
So Christ save me,

1242
00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:54.870
I will cut off your head!

1243
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:58.100
Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other!

1244
00:56:58.100 --> 00:56:59.800
Aye, a foul fault.

1245
00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:07.570
The town sounds a parley.

1246
00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.300
Captain Macmorris,

1247
00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.170
when there is more better opportunity

1248
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:15.700
to be required, look you,

1249
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.530
I will be so bold as to tell you

1250
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.370
I know the disciplines of the war.

1251
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:23.800
And there is an end.

1252
00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:28.100
How yet resolves the governor of the town?

1253
00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:32.170
This is the latest parle we will admit.

1254
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:34.530
Therefore, to our best mercy give yourselves,

1255
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.230
or, like to men proud of destruction,

1256
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:39.670
defy us to our worst,

1257
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:41.470
for as I am a soldier,

1258
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:43.570
a name that in my thoughts becomes me best,

1259
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.430
if I begin the battery once again,

1260
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:47.900
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur

1261
00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.900
till in her ashes she lie buried.

1262
00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:54.600
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,

1263
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.030
and the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,

1264
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.370
in liberty of bloody hand

1265
00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.300
shall range with conscience wide as hell,

1266
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.570
mowing like grass

1267
00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:05.970
your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants.

1268
00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:12.070
What say you?

1269
00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:14.230
Will you yield and this avoid

1270
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:17.300
or, guilty in defense, be thus destroyed?

1271
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:22.700
Our expectation hath this day an end.

1272
00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:25.200
The dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,

1273
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.500
returns us that his powers are not yet ready

1274
00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.500
to raise so great a siege.

1275
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:31.730
Therefore, great King,

1276
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:36.400
we yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.

1277
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.770
Enter our gates.

1278
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:40.730
Dispose of us and ours,

1279
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.570
for we no longer are defensible.

1280
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:44.970
Open your gates.

1281
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:50.030
Come, Uncle Exeter,

1282
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:52.630
go you, and enter Harfleur.

1283
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:53.830
There remain,

1284
00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.170
and fortify it strongly 'gainst the French.

1285
00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:57.600
And use mercy to them all.

1286
00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.630
For us, dear Uncle,

1287
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:59.730
the winter coming on

1288
00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:02.070
and sickness growing upon our soldiers,

1289
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:04.530
we will retire to Calais.

1290
00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:07.600
Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest.

1291
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:09.870
Tomorrow for the march are we addressed.

1292
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:25.800
Alice, tu as ete en Angleterre, et tu parles bien le langage.

1293
00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.800
Un peu, madame.

1294
00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:35.970
Je te prie, m'enseignez.

1295
00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.100
Il faut que j'apprenne a parler.

1296
00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:41.570
Comment appelez-vous la main en anglais?

1297
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:42.570
La main?

1298
00:59:42.570 --> 00:59:44.770
Elle est appelee de hand.

1299
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.330
De hand.

1300
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:48.530
Et les doigts?

1301
00:59:48.530 --> 00:59:50.470
Les doigts? Ma foi, j'oublie les doigts.

1302
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:51.500
Mais je me souviendrai.

1303
00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.700
Les doigts?

1304
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.670
Je pense qu'ils sont appeles de fingres.

1305
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:55.670
Oui, de fingres.

1306
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:59.300
La main, de hand.

1307
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:03.200
Les doigts, de fingres.

1308
01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.370
Je pense que je suis le bon ecolier.

1309
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.530
J'ai gagnee deux mots d'anglais vitement.

1310
01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.030
Comment appelez-vous les ongles?

1311
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:10.100
Les ongles?

1312
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.330
Nous les appelons de nails.

1313
01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:15.170
De nails.

1314
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.170
Ecoutez.

1315
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.570
Dites-moi si je parle bien.

1316
01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.870
De hand,

1317
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.770
de fingres,

1318
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:27.800
et de nails.

1319
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.830
C'est bien dit, madame.

1320
01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:31.300
Il est fort bon anglais.

1321
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.070
Dites-moi l'anglais pour le bras.

1322
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:34.870
De arm, madame.

1323
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.570
De arm.

1324
01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:38.570
Et le coude?

1325
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.170
De elbow.

1326
01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.770
De elbow.

1327
01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.770
Oui.

1328
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:47.600
Je m'en fais la repetition de tous les mots

1329
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.270
que vous m'avez appris des a present.

1330
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.870
Il est trop difficile, madame, comme je pense.

1331
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.200
Excusez-moi, Alice.

1332
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.530
Ecoutez.

1333
01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.000
De hand,

1334
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.800
de fingres,

1335
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.970
de nails,

1336
01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.000

1337
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.030

1338
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.470
D'elbow, madame.

1339
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:14.770
Oh, Seigneur Dieu, je m'en oublie.

1340
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:16.930
D'elbow.

1341
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:19.130
Comment appelez-vous le col?

1342
01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.670
De nick, madame.

1343
01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:22.270
De nick.

1344
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.270
Et le menton?

1345
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:24.900
De chin.

1346
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.870
De sin.

1347
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:28.800
Le col, de nick.

1348
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.570
Le menton, de sin.

1349
01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.530
Oui, sauf votre honneur, en verite,

1350
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:33.630
vous prononcez les mots

1351
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:34.770
aussi droit que les natifs

1352
01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:35.800
d'Angleterre.

1353
01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.430
Je ne doute point d'apprendre,

1354
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:39.470
par la grace de Dieu, et en peu de temps.

1355
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:42.230
N'avez-vous pas deja oublie ce que je vous ai enseigne?

1356
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:46.930
Non, je reciterai a vous promptement.

1357
01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:49.230
De hand,

1358
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:51.100
de fingres,

1359
01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.100
de mails--

1360
01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:53.800
De nails, madame.

1361
01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.170
De nails,

1362
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:58.270
d'arm,

1363
01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:59.270
de ilbow.

1364
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.770
Sauf votre honneur, de elbow.

1365
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:05.970
Ainsi dis-je.

1366
01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:09.000
De elbow,

1367
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.730
de nick,

1368
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.030
de sin.

1369
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:19.700
Comment appelez-vous le pied et la robe?

1370
01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.130
Le foot et le coun.

1371
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:27.330
Le foot et le coun.

1372
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.900
Mm-hmm.

1373
01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.130
Oh, Seigneur Dieu.

1374
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:36.630
Ce sont mots de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique,

1375
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:39.170
et non pour les dames d'honneur d'user.

1376
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:41.000
Je ne voudrais prononcer ces mots devant

1377
01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.930
les seigneurs de France pour tout le monde.

1378
01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:43.930
Foh.

1379
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:46.170
Le foot et le coun.

1380
01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:51.370
Neanmoins, je reciterai

1381
01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.200
une autre fois ma lecon ensemble.

1382
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.330
De hand,

1383
01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:58.530
de fingres,

1384
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:00.830
de nails,

1385
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.230
d'arm,

1386
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:03.800
de elbow...

1387
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.100
de nick,

1388
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.670
de sin,

1389
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:09.730
de foot,

1390
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:10.730
et le coun.

1391
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:13.130
Excellent, madame.

1392
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:14.800
C'est assez pour une fois.

1393
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.230
Allons-nous a diner.

1394
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.400
'Tis certain he has passed the river Somme!

1395
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.530
And if he be not fought withal, my lord,

1396
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:35.670
let us not live in France.

1397
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.870
Let us quit all

1398
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:39.100
and give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

1399
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.600
Oh, Dieu vivant.

1400
01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.370
Shall a few sprays of us,

1401
01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:44.770
the emptying of our fathers' luxury,

1402
01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:47.400
our scions put in wild and savage stock,

1403
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.500
spurt up so suddenly into the clouds

1404
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:50.800
and overlook their grafters?

1405
01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.100
Normans, but bastard Normans!

1406
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.000
Norman bastards!

1407
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.200
Mort de ma vie!

1408
01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.130
If they march along unfought withal,

1409
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.800
but I will sell my dukedom

1410
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.270
to buy a slobbery and a dirty farm

1411
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:04.870
in that nook-shotten isle of Albion!

1412
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:06.470
By faith and honor,

1413
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:08.500
our madams mock at us

1414
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.830
and plainly say our mettle is bred out,

1415
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:13.570
and they will give their bodies to the lust of English youth

1416
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:16.370
to new-store France with bastard warriors.

1417
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:17.970
Where is Montjoy the herald?

1418
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:19.730
Speed him hence!

1419
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:22.130
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.

1420
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:23.130
Up, princes,

1421
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.370
and with spirit of honor

1422
01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:26.030
edged more sharper than your swords,

1423
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.330
hie to the field.

1424
01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:30.230
Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land

1425
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:33.100
with pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.

1426
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.930
Go down upon him-- you have power enough--

1427
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:38.670
and in a captive chariot into Rouen,

1428
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.730
bring him our prisoner.

1429
01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:41.500
This becomes the great.

1430
01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:42.530
Ha!

1431
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:44.500
Sorry am I his numbers are so few,

1432
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.830
his soldiers sick and famished in their march,

1433
01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:48.800
for I am sure, when he shall see our army,

1434
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.430
he'll drop his heart into the sink of fear

1435
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:54.930
and for achievement offer us his ransom.

1436
01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:57.400
Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy,

1437
01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.370
and let him say to England that we send to know

1438
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.230
what willing ransom he will give.

1439
01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:04.130
Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.

1440
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.230
Not so, I do beseech Your Majesty.

1441
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:09.070
Be patient, for you shall remain with us.

1442
01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:12.130
Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all,

1443
01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:15.170
and quickly bring us word of England's fall.

1444
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:16.700
Aye!

1445
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:31.300
How now, Captain Fluellen.

1446
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.400
Come you from the bridge?

1447
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.670
I assure you,

1448
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:36.270
there is very excellent services committed at the bridge.

1449
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.830
Is the Duke of Exeter safe?

1450
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.770
The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon

1451
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.330
and a man that I love and honor with my soul and my heart

1452
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:45.030
and my duty and my life and my living

1453
01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:46.470
and my uttermost power.

1454
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:49.330
He is not-- God be praised and blessed--

1455
01:05:49.330 --> 01:05:50.600
any hurt in the world

1456
01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.700
but keeps the bridge most valiantly,

1457
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.030
with excellent discipline.

1458
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.770
There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the bridge.

1459
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.230
I think in my very conscience now

1460
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:01.230
he's as valiant a man as Mark Antony,

1461
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.070
and he is a man of no estimation in the world,

1462
01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:06.530
but I did see him do as gallant service.

1463
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:07.530
What do you call him?

1464
01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.270
He is called Aunchient Pistol.

1465
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:10.300
I know him not.

1466
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.670
Captain!

1467
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:12.770
Here is the man.

1468
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.800
I thee beseech to do me favors.

1469
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.730
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.

1470
01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:18.770
Aye, I praise God.

1471
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.570
I have merited some love at his hands.

1472
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:21.830
Bardolph, a soldier,

1473
01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:24.130
firm and sound of heart and of buxom valor,

1474
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:25.370
hath by cruel fate

1475
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:28.300
and giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,

1476
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:29.570
that goddess blind

1477
01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:32.300
that stands upon the rolling restless stone--

1478
01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.970
By your patience, Aunchient Pistol.

1479
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:36.500
Fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes

1480
01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.870
to signify to you that Fortune is blind.

1481
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.300
She is painted also with a wheel

1482
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.500
to signify to you, which is the moral of it,

1483
01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.730
that she is turning and inconstant and mutability

1484
01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:47.230
and variation.

1485
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:49.630
And her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone

1486
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:53.170
which rolls and rolls and rolls.

1487
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:54.700
In good truth, the poet makes

1488
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.400
a most excellent description of it.

1489
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.270
Fortune is an excellent moral.

1490
01:06:58.270 --> 01:07:01.330
Fortune is Bardolph's foe and frowns on him,

1491
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:04.900
for he hath stolen a pax and hanged must be,

1492
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.230
a damned death.

1493
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:07.830
Let gallows gape for dog,

1494
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:09.600
let man go free,

1495
01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.570
and let not hemp his windpipe suffocate,

1496
01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:14.630
for Exeter hath given the doom of death

1497
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.430
for pax of little price.

1498
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:17.500
Therefore, go speak.

1499
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.900
The duke will hear thy voice.

1500
01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.070
And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut

1501
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:24.130
with edge of penny cord and vile reproach.

1502
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:28.770
Speak, Captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.

1503
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:32.100
Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.

1504
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:35.270
Why, then, rejoice therefore.

1505
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:37.700
Certainly, Aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at,

1506
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:39.330
for, look you, if he were my brother,

1507
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:41.430
I would desire the duke to use his good pleasure

1508
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:42.930
and to put him to execution,

1509
01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:45.870
for discipline ought to be used!

1510
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:49.970
Die, and be damned.

1511
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:52.370
And figo for thy friendship!

1512
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.970
Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal.

1513
01:07:56.970 --> 01:07:58.830
I remember him now--

1514
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:01.430
a bawd, a cutpurse!

1515
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:03.430
I tell you what, Captain Gower.

1516
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.000
I do perceive he is not the man

1517
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.270
he would gladly make show to the world he is.

1518
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:09.300
If I find a hole in his coat,

1519
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.970
I will tell him my mind.

1520
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.570
Hark you, the king is coming,

1521
01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:17.230
and I must speak with him from the bridge.

1522
01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:18.630
God bless Your Majesty.

1523
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.630
How now, Fluellen.

1524
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:20.900
Camest thou from the bridge?

1525
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:22.300
Aye, so please Your Majesty.

1526
01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.100
The Duke of Exeter hath very gallantly

1527
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.930
maintained the bridge.

1528
01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:27.930
The French is gone off, look you.

1529
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.330
And there is gallant and most brave passages.

1530
01:08:34.530 --> 01:08:36.070
Marry, th' adversary

1531
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:38.670
was have possession of the bridge.

1532
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.430
But he is enforced to retire,

1533
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:46.330
and the Duke of Exeter is master of the bridge.

1534
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.770
I can tell Your Majesty, the duke is a very brave man.

1535
01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:50.270
What men have you lost, Fluellen?

1536
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.670
The perdition of the adversary hath been very great--

1537
01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:57.330
well, reasonable great.

1538
01:08:57.330 --> 01:08:59.600
For my part, I think the duke hath lost never a man

1539
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.870
but one that is like to be executed

1540
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:03.170
for robbing a church,

1541
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:04.170
one Bardolph,

1542
01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:07.430
if Your Majesty know the man.

1543
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:08.770
His face is all bubukles

1544
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:11.330
and whelks and knobs and flames of fire,

1545
01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:13.830
and his lips blows at his nose.

1546
01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:15.370
It is like a coal of fire,

1547
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:17.870
sometimes blue, sometimes red,

1548
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:19.700
but his nose is executed,

1549
01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.870
and his fire is out.

1550
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:27.500
We would have all such offenders so cut off.

1551
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.630
And we give express charge

1552
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:30.400
that in our marches through the country,

1553
01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.500
there be nothing compelled from the villages,

1554
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.330
nothing taken but paid for,

1555
01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:35.470
none of the French

1556
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:38.700
upbraided or abused in disdainful language.

1557
01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.130
When lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom,

1558
01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:43.100
the gentler gamester is the soonest winner.

1559
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:48.400
You know me by my habit.

1560
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.630
Well, then, I know thee.

1561
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:52.830
What shall I know of thee?

1562
01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:55.870
My master's mind.

1563
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:58.200
Unfold it.

1564
01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.600
Thus says my king.

1565
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.830
"Say thou to Harry of England

1566
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:08.470
"though we seemed dead, we did but sleep.

1567
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:12.100
"Advantage is a better soldier than rashness.

1568
01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.300
"Tell him we could have rebuked him at Harfleur,

1569
01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.800
"but that we thought not good

1570
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.330
"to bruise an injury till it were full ripe.

1571
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:23.770
"Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial.

1572
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:27.000
"England shall repent his folly,

1573
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.200
"see his weakness, and admire our sufferance.

1574
01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.970
"Bid him therefore consider of his ransom,

1575
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.670
"which must proportion the losses we have borne,

1576
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.970
"the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested,

1577
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:42.670
"which in weight to re-answer,

1578
01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:46.000
"his pettiness would bow under.

1579
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.700
"To this add defiance,

1580
01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.630
"and tell him, for conclusion,

1581
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:53.330
"he hath betrayed his followers,

1582
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.770
whose condemnation is pronounced."

1583
01:10:57.570 --> 01:11:01.000
So far my king and master,

1584
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.930
so much my office.

1585
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:05.600
What is thy name?

1586
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600
I know thy quality.

1587
01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.430
Montjoy.

1588
01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:15.300
Thou dost thy office fairly.

1589
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:16.430
Turn thee back,

1590
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.170
and tell thy king I do not seek him now

1591
01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:20.130
but could be willing to march on to Calais

1592
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.270
without impeachment,

1593
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:23.700
for, to say the sooth,

1594
01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.470
though it is no wisdom to confess so much

1595
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:28.170
unto an enemy of craft and vantage,

1596
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:31.530
my people are with sickness much enfeebled,

1597
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:34.170
my numbers lessened,

1598
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.230
and those few I have

1599
01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:38.300
almost no better than so many French,

1600
01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.530
who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,

1601
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.570
I thought upon one pair of English legs

1602
01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:44.970
did march three Frenchmen.

1603
01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:48.230
Yet, forgive me, God, that I do brag thus.

1604
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:51.270
This your air of France hath blown that vice in me.

1605
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:52.270
I must repent.

1606
01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:55.470
Go therefore tell thy master,

1607
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.700
here I am.

1608
01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:01.070
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,

1609
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:03.430
my army but a weak and sickly guard.

1610
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:06.330
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,

1611
01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:08.530
though France himself and such another neighbor

1612
01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:09.630
stand in our way.

1613
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.570
There's for thy labor, Montjoy.

1614
01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:16.600
Go, bid thy master well advise himself.

1615
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.430
If we may pass, we will.

1616
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:20.470
If we be hindered, we shall your tawny ground

1617
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:22.870
with your red blood discolor.

1618
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:24.070
So, Montjoy, fare you well.

1619
01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:32.400
The sum of all our answer is but this.

1620
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.830
We would not seek a battle as we are,

1621
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:38.030
nor as we are, we say we will not shun it.

1622
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:39.030
So tell your master.

1623
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.500
I shall deliver so.

1624
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.900
Thanks to Your Highness.

1625
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.870
I hope they will not come upon us now.

1626
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:59.470
We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.

1627
01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:00.770
March to the bridge.

1628
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:01.770
March to the bridge.

1629
01:13:01.770 --> 01:13:03.230
It now draws toward night.

1630
01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:05.630
Beyond the river, we'll encamp ourselves,

1631
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:07.670
and on tomorrow bid them march away.

1632
01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.170
Tut; I have the best armor in the world.

1633
01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:35.230
Would it were day.

1634
01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:44.730
You have an excellent armor,

1635
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:46.800
but let my horse have his due.

1636
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.300
It is the best horse of Europe.

1637
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:59.630
Will it never be morning?

1638
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.900
My Lord of Orleans

1639
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.700
and my Lord High Constable,

1640
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:10.800
you talk of horse and armor?

1641
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.270
You are as well-provided of both as any prince in the world.

1642
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:16.030
What a long night is this.

1643
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:20.370
I will not change my horse

1644
01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:23.000
with any that treads but on four pasterns.

1645
01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:26.170
Ca,

1646
01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:27.170
ha.

1647
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.700
He bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs.

1648
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:40.830
Le cheval volant, the Pegasus, chez les narines de feu.

1649
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:43.970
When I bestride him, I soar,

1650
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:46.200
I am a hawk.

1651
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:49.300
He trots the air.

1652
01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.830
The earth sings when he touches it.

1653
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:54.100
The basest horn of his hoof is more musical

1654
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.600
than the pipe of Hermes.

1655
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.970
He's of the color of the nutmeg.

1656
01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:02.170
And of the heat of the ginger.

1657
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.700
It is a beast for Perseus.

1658
01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:08.000
He is pure air and fire.

1659
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.630
And the dull elements of earth and water

1660
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:12.170
never appear in him,

1661
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:19.200
but only in patient stillness when his rider mounts him.

1662
01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.600
He is indeed a horse,

1663
01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.330
and all other jades you may call beasts.

1664
01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:26.570
Indeed, my lord,

1665
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:30.000
it is a most absolute and excellent horse.

1666
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.930
It is the prince of palfreys.

1667
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.030
His neigh is like the bidding of a monarch,

1668
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:36.870
and his countenance enforces homage.

1669
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:38.900
No more, Cousin.

1670
01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:47.170
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot,

1671
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:50.530
from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb,

1672
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:54.500
vary deserved praise on my palfrey.

1673
01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.330
It is a theme as fluent as the sea.

1674
01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:00.130
Turn the sands into eloquent tongues,

1675
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.400
and my horse is an argument for them all.

1676
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:06.100
It is a subject for a sovereign to reason on

1677
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:08.730
and for a sovereign's sovereign to ride on

1678
01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:12.970
and for the world, familiar to us and unknown,

1679
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:15.230
to lay apart their particular function

1680
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:17.500
and wonder at him.

1681
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:24.130
I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus.

1682
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:27.200
"Wonder of nature"--

1683
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.400
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.

1684
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:36.270
Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser,

1685
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:38.400
for my horse is my mistress.

1686
01:16:45.130 --> 01:16:47.130
My Lord Constable,

1687
01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:51.300
the armor I saw in your tent tonight,

1688
01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:55.200
are those stars or suns upon it?

1689
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.370
Stars, my lord.

1690
01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:59.130
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.

1691
01:16:59.130 --> 01:17:02.500
Yet my sky shall not want.

1692
01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.970
That may be,

1693
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:05.900
for you bear a many superfluously,

1694
01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.570
and 'twere more honor some were away.

1695
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:10.770
Even as your horse bears your praises,

1696
01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:11.870
who would trot as well

1697
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:13.900
were some of your brags dismounted.

1698
01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:17.900
Would I were able to load him with his desert.

1699
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.900
Will it never be day?

1700
01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:28.970
I will trot tomorrow a mile,

1701
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:31.830
and my way shall be paved with English faces.

1702
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:33.430
I will not say so,

1703
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:37.130
for fear I should be faced out of my way.

1704
01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:43.370
Yet I would it were morning.

1705
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:47.000
I would fain be about the ears of the English.

1706
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:52.100
Who will go to hazard with me for 20 prisoners?

1707
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:55.270
You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.

1708
01:17:57.570 --> 01:17:58.630
'Tis midnight.

1709
01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:01.530
I'll go arm myself.

1710
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:06.370
The dauphin longs for morning.

1711
01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:10.700
He longs to eat the English.

1712
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.470
I think he will eat all he kills.

1713
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:15.030
By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.

1714
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.500
Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath.

1715
01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.570
He is simply

1716
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:20.300
the most active gentleman of France.

1717
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.830
Doing is activity,

1718
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:24.330
and he will still be doing.

1719
01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.430
He never did harm that I heard of.

1720
01:18:26.430 --> 01:18:27.570
Nor will do none tomorrow.

1721
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.070
He will keep that good name still.

1722
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:32.170
I know him to be valiant.

1723
01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:35.530
I was told that by one who knows him better than you.

1724
01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:36.730
What's he?

1725
01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:39.230
Marry, he told me so himself,

1726
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:41.070
and he said he cared not who knew it.

1727
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:43.200
My Lord High Constable...

1728
01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:49.900
the English lie within 1,500 paces of your tents.

1729
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:55.800
Who hath measured the ground?

1730
01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.000
The Lord Grandpre.

1731
01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:02.170
A most expert and valiant gentleman.

1732
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:11.270
Would it were day!

1733
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:19.770
Alas, poor Harry of England,

1734
01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:22.830
he longs not for the dawning as we do.

1735
01:19:22.830 --> 01:19:25.100
What a wretched and peevish fellow

1736
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:26.900
is this King of England

1737
01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:29.370
to mope with his fat-brained followers

1738
01:19:29.370 --> 01:19:31.600
so far out of his knowledge.

1739
01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.570
If the English had any apprehension,

1740
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:34.570
they would run away.

1741
01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.700
That they lack, for if their heads

1742
01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.970
had any intellectual armor,

1743
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:40.070
they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.

1744
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:44.630
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures.

1745
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:47.100
Their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

1746
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.600
Then shall we find tomorrow

1747
01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.230
they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight.

1748
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:59.170
Now is it time to arm.

1749
01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:01.730
Come, shall we about it?

1750
01:20:02.970 --> 01:20:04.930
It is now 2:00,

1751
01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:06.970
but, let me see, by 10:00,

1752
01:20:06.970 --> 01:20:09.470
we shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

1753
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:18.230
Now entertain conjecture of a time

1754
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.170
when creeping murmur and the poring dark

1755
01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:24.000
fills the wide vessel of the universe.

1756
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.030
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night,

1757
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:31.770
the hum of either army stilly sounds

1758
01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:34.030
that the fixed sentinels almost receive

1759
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:36.530
the secret whispers of each other's watch.

1760
01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:40.170
Fire answers fire,

1761
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.770
and through their paly flames,

1762
01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:45.200
each battle sees the other's umbered face.

1763
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.630
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs,

1764
01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:50.300
piercing the night's dull ear.

1765
01:20:51.370 --> 01:20:53.970
And from the tents, the armorers,

1766
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:55.230
accomplishing the knights,

1767
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:57.170
with busy hammers closing rivets up,

1768
01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:59.130
give dreadful note of preparation.

1769
01:21:01.930 --> 01:21:03.600
The country cocks do crow,

1770
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.470
the clocks do toll,

1771
01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.530
and the third hour of drowsy morning name.

1772
01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:15.300
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,

1773
01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:17.230
the confident and over-lusty French

1774
01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:20.670
do the low-rated English play at dice

1775
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:23.800
and chide the cripple tardy-gaited Night,

1776
01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:27.970
who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp so tediously away.

1777
01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:38.030
The poor condemned English, like sacrifices,

1778
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:40.270
by their watchful fires sit patiently

1779
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:43.030
and inly ruminate the morning's danger

1780
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:44.870
and their gesture sad,

1781
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:47.730
investing lank-lean cheeks and warworn coats,

1782
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:49.730
presenteth them unto the gazing moon

1783
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:51.670
so many horrid ghosts.

1784
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:55.200
Oh, now, who will behold

1785
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.770
the royal captain of this ruined band

1786
01:21:57.770 --> 01:22:00.600
walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,

1787
01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.830
let him cry, "Praise and glory on his head,"

1788
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:06.900
for forth he goes and visits all his host,

1789
01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.000
bids them good morrow with a modest smile

1790
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.030
and calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.

1791
01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:14.430
Upon his royal face, there is no note

1792
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.630
how dread an army hath enrounded him,

1793
01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:18.830
nor doth he dedicate one jot of color

1794
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:21.400
unto the weary and all-watched night,

1795
01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.400
but freshly looks and overbears attaint

1796
01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:27.670
with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty

1797
01:22:27.670 --> 01:22:30.600
that every wretch, pining and pale before,

1798
01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.070
beholding him plucks comfort from his looks.

1799
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:36.930
A largess universal, like the sun,

1800
01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:39.370
his liberal eye doth give to every one,

1801
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:40.930
thawing cold fear

1802
01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:44.170
that mean and gentle all behold,

1803
01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:47.070
as may unworthiness define,

1804
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.400
a little touch of Harry in the night.

1805
01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:55.030
And so our scene must to the battle fly,

1806
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:57.700
where--oh, for pity--

1807
01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.300
we shall much disgrace

1808
01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.330
with four or five most vile and ragged foils,

1809
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:05.270
right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,

1810
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:08.370
the name of Agincourt.

1811
01:23:08.370 --> 01:23:10.600
Yet sit and see,

1812
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.830
minding true things by what their mockeries be.

1813
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:23.070


1814
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:24.470
Good morrow, Brother Bedford.

1815
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:25.630
God Almighty,

1816
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:27.800
there is some soul of goodness in things evil,

1817
01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.330
would men observingly distill it out,

1818
01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:32.630
for our bad neighbor makes us early stirrers,

1819
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:35.730
which is both healthful and good husbandry.

1820
01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:38.570
Besides, they are our outward consciences

1821
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:40.000
and preachers to us all,

1822
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.570
admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end.

1823
01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:45.330
Thus may we gather honey from the weed

1824
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:47.600
and make a moral of the devil himself.

1825
01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.600
Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham.

1826
01:23:52.170 --> 01:23:54.030
A good soft pillow for that good white head

1827
01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.970
were better than a churlish turf of France.

1828
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:57.170
Not so, my liege.

1829
01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:58.800
This lodging likes me better,

1830
01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:03.270
since I may say, "Now lie I like a king."

1831
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:04.900
'Tis good for men

1832
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.370
to love their present pains upon example,

1833
01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:09.370
so the spirit is eased.

1834
01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:15.100
Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas.

1835
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.430
Brothers both, commend me to the princes in our camp.

1836
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:18.800
Do my good morrow to them,

1837
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.670
and anon desire them all to my pavilion.

1838
01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:21.670
We shall, my liege.

1839
01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.000
Shall I attend Your Grace?

1840
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.130
No, my good knight.

1841
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:26.170
Go with my brothers to my lords of England.

1842
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:27.700
I and my bosom must debate a while,

1843
01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:30.000
and then I would no other company.

1844
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry.

1845
01:24:35.670 --> 01:24:37.200
God-a-mercy, old heart.

1846
01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.200
Thou speakest cheerfully.

1847
01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.970
Qui va la?

1848
01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:13.300
A friend.

1849
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.270
Discuss unto me, art thou officer?

1850
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:18.370
Or art thou base, common, and popular?

1851
01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:19.730
I am a gentleman of a company.

1852
01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:22.370
Trailest thou the puissant pike?

1853
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:23.930
Even so.

1854
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:24.930
What are you?

1855
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:27.530
As good a gentleman as the emperor.

1856
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:28.870
Then you are a better than the king.

1857
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:31.330
Ah, the king's a bawcock with a heart of gold,

1858
01:25:31.330 --> 01:25:32.700
a lad of life, an imp of fame,

1859
01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.770
of parents good, of fist most valiant.

1860
01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:39.130
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heartstring,

1861
01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:42.730
I love the lovely bully.

1862
01:25:42.730 --> 01:25:43.800
What is thy name?

1863
01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.900
Harry le Roy.

1864
01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.900
Le Roy!

1865
01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:47.430
A Cornish name.

1866
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:48.970
Art thou of Cornish crew?

1867
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:50.900
No, I am a Welshman.

1868
01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:52.370
Knowest thou Fluellen?

1869
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:53.630
Yes.

1870
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:55.630
Tell him I'll knock his leek about his pate

1871
01:25:55.630 --> 01:25:56.930
upon Saint Davy's day.

1872
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:59.070
Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,

1873
01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:00.700
lest he knock that about yours.

1874
01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.230
Are you his friend?

1875
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:04.570
And his kinsman too.

1876
01:26:04.570 --> 01:26:06.400
A figo for thee, then!

1877
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.870
Ouch!

1878
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:09.130
I thank you.

1879
01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:11.930
God be with you.

1880
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:16.330
My name is Pistol called.

1881
01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.530
It sorts well with your fierceness.

1882
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:30.030
Captain Fluellen.

1883
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:33.270
Shh!

1884
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:36.300
In the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer.

1885
01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:38.930
It is the greatest admiration in the universal world

1886
01:26:38.930 --> 01:26:40.230
when the true and aunchient

1887
01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:42.130
prerogatives and the laws of the wars

1888
01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.130
is not kept.

1889
01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:44.430
If you would take

1890
01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:46.800
the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great,

1891
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.000
I warrant you shall find

1892
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.430
there is no tiddle-taddle nor pibble-pabble

1893
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:51.430
in Pompey's camp.

1894
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:52.570
I warrant you,

1895
01:26:52.570 --> 01:26:54.400
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars

1896
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:56.400
and the cares of it and the forms of it

1897
01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.130
and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it

1898
01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:00.400
to be otherwise.

1899
01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.300
Why, the enemy is very loud.

1900
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.500
You hear him all night.

1901
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:07.670
If the enemy is an ass and a fool

1902
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:09.230
and a prating coxcomb,

1903
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:10.370
is it meet, think you,

1904
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.930
that we should also be, look you,

1905
01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:14.600
an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb?

1906
01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.600
Shh!

1907
01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:16.600
Shh!

1908
01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.430
In your own conscience, now?

1909
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:19.630
I will speak lower.

1910
01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:21.630
I pray you and beseech you that you will.

1911
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.670
Though it appear a little out of fashion,

1912
01:27:32.670 --> 01:27:35.330
there is much care and valor in this Welshman.

1913
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.570
Brother John Bates,

1914
01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:42.530
is not that the morning which breaks yonder?

1915
01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:45.800
I think it be.

1916
01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:48.630
But we have no great cause to desire the approach of it.

1917
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:52.000
Ah, we see yonder the beginning of the day.

1918
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.870
I do not think we'll ever see the end of it.

1919
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:56.400
Who goes there?

1920
01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.830
A friend.

1921
01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:00.730
Under what captain serve you?

1922
01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:03.670
Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.

1923
01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:07.430
A good old commander, a most kind gentleman.

1924
01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:18.100
I pray you,

1925
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:20.170
what thinks he of our estate?

1926
01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:22.270
Even as men wrecked upon a sand,

1927
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:24.670
that look to be washed off the next tide.

1928
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:26.430
He hath not told his thought to the king.

1929
01:28:26.430 --> 01:28:29.100
No, nor it is not meet he should,

1930
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.300
for though I speak it to you,

1931
01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.030
I think the king is but a man as I am.

1932
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:37.800
The violet smells to him as it doth to me.

1933
01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.270
The element shows to him as it doth to me.

1934
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:42.370
All his senses have but human conditions.

1935
01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:43.630
His ceremonies laid by,

1936
01:28:43.630 --> 01:28:46.870
in his nakedness, he appears but a man.

1937
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:49.370
And though his affections are higher mounted than ours,

1938
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:50.370
yet, when they stoop,

1939
01:28:50.370 --> 01:28:52.230
they stoop with the like wing.

1940
01:28:52.230 --> 01:28:54.970
Therefore, when he sees reason of fears as we do,

1941
01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:56.430
his fears, out of doubt,

1942
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:58.470
be of the same relish as ours are.

1943
01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:00.370
Yet, in reason, no man should possess him

1944
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:02.070
with any appearance of fear,

1945
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.170
lest he, by showing it, should dishearten his army.

1946
01:29:05.170 --> 01:29:06.930
He may show what outward courage he may,

1947
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:09.430
but I believe, as cold a night as 'tis,

1948
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:11.930
he could wish himself in the Thames up to the neck.

1949
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:14.370
And I would he were and I by him at all adventures,

1950
01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:15.830
so we were quit here.

1951
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:18.070
By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king.

1952
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:19.930
I think he would not wish himself anywhere

1953
01:29:19.930 --> 01:29:20.930
but where he is.

1954
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:22.370
Then I would he were here alone.

1955
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:25.570
So he's sure to be ransomed and many poor men's lives saved.

1956
01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:28.230
I dare say you love him not so ill

1957
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:30.400
to wish him here alone,

1958
01:29:32.330 --> 01:29:36.030
howsoever you speak this to feel other men's minds.

1959
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:38.130
Methinks I could not die anywhere so contented

1960
01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:39.700
as in the king's company,

1961
01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:44.700
his cause being just, his quarrel honorable.

1962
01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.600
That's more than we know.

1963
01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:49.530
Aye, or more than we should seek after,

1964
01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.170
for we know enough if we know we are the king's subjects.

1965
01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:53.530
If his cause be wrong,

1966
01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:56.270
our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.

1967
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:58.400
But if the cause be not good,

1968
01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.170
the king himself hath a heavy reckoning to make,

1969
01:30:01.170 --> 01:30:05.130
when all those legs and arms and heads,

1970
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:06.770
chopped off in a battle,

1971
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:09.870
shall join together at the latter day and cry all,

1972
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:14.200
"We died at--at such a place"--

1973
01:30:16.170 --> 01:30:18.300
some swearing,

1974
01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:21.300
some crying for a surgeon,

1975
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:25.130
some upon their wives left poor behind them,

1976
01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:27.600
some upon the debts they owe,

1977
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.700
some upon their children

1978
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:33.730
rawly left.

1979
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:38.000
I am afeard there are few die well

1980
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.530
that die in a battle,

1981
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:43.270
for how can they charitably dispose of anything

1982
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:46.070
when blood is their argument?

1983
01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.630
Now if these men do not die well,

1984
01:30:50.630 --> 01:30:51.870
it will be a black matter

1985
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:53.530
for the king that led them to it,

1986
01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:56.670
who to disobey were against all proportion

1987
01:30:56.670 --> 01:30:59.670
of subjection.

1988
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:10.630
So if a son that is by his father

1989
01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:14.430
sent about merchandise

1990
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:18.200
do sinfully miscarry upon the sea,

1991
01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.670
the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,

1992
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:24.630
should be imposed upon his father that sent him.

1993
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:28.000
Or if a servant under his master's command

1994
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.070
transporting a sum of money

1995
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:34.970
be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities,

1996
01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:38.970
you may call the business of the master

1997
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:40.930
the author of the servant's damnation.

1998
01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:42.600
But this is not so.

1999
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:43.900
The king is not bound to answer

2000
01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:46.030
the particular endings of his soldiers,

2001
01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:49.330
the father of his son, nor the master of his servant,

2002
01:31:49.330 --> 01:31:51.500
for they purpose not their death

2003
01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.470
when they purpose their services.

2004
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:58.330
Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless,

2005
01:31:58.330 --> 01:32:00.170
if it come to the arbitrament of swords,

2006
01:32:00.170 --> 01:32:03.300
can try it out with all unspotted soldiers.

2007
01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.870
Some peradventure have on them

2008
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:08.100
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;

2009
01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:09.600
some of beguiling virgins

2010
01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.830
with the broken seals of perjury;

2011
01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:15.770
some making the wars their bulwark

2012
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:18.530
that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace

2013
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:20.130
with pillage and robbery.

2014
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:23.570
Now, if these men have defeated the law

2015
01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:25.600
and outrun native punishment,

2016
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.130
though they can outstrip men,

2017
01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:28.900
they have no wings to fly from God.

2018
01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:32.770
War is his beadle, war is his vengeance

2019
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:34.430
so that here men are punished

2020
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:37.200
for before-breach of the king's laws

2021
01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.870
in now the king's quarrel.

2022
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.800
Where they feared the death, they have borne life away,

2023
01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:46.530
Where they would be safe, they perish.

2024
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:50.670
Then if they die unprovided,

2025
01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:52.870
no more is the king guilty of their damnation

2026
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:54.930
than he was before guilty of those impieties

2027
01:32:54.930 --> 01:32:56.600
for the which they are now visited.

2028
01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:59.530
Every subject's duty is the king's,

2029
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:01.700
but every subject's soul is his own.

2030
01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:04.830
Therefore should every soldier in the wars

2031
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:06.130
do as every sick man in his bed,

2032
01:33:06.130 --> 01:33:08.570
wash every mote out of his conscience;

2033
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:11.400
and dying so, death is to him advantage;

2034
01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
or not dying, the time was blessedly lost

2035
01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.600
wherein such preparation was gained.

2036
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:19.170
And in him that escapes,

2037
01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:23.500
it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer,

2038
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.730
He let him outlive that day to see His greatness

2039
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.330
and to teach others how they should prepare.

2040
01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:36.430
'Tis certain, every man that dies ill,

2041
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:37.630
the ill upon his own head,

2042
01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:41.130
the king is not to answer for it.

2043
01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:43.930
I do not desire he should answer for me,

2044
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.900
and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.

2045
01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:49.930
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.

2046
01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:53.230
Aye, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully,

2047
01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:54.870
but when our throats are cut,

2048
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:56.970
he may be ransomed and we ne'er the wiser.

2049
01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:57.970
If I live to see it,

2050
01:33:57.970 --> 01:33:59.430
I'll never trust his word after.

2051
01:33:59.430 --> 01:34:01.600
Oh, you pay him, then.

2052
01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.800
Oh, that's a perilous shot out of an elder-gun

2053
01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.100
that a poor and a private displeasure

2054
01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.600
can do against a monarch.

2055
01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.000
You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice

2056
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:14.300
with fanning in its face with a peacock's feather.

2057
01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.200
You'll never trust his word after.

2058
01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.900
Come, it is a foolish saying.

2059
01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:19.300
Your reproof is something too round.

2060
01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:20.630
I should be angry with you, if the time were convenient.

2061
01:34:20.630 --> 01:34:23.070
Well, let it be a quarrel between us if you live.

2062
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.630
I embrace it.

2063
01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:28.170
How shall I know thee again?

2064
01:34:28.170 --> 01:34:30.630
Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my bonnet.

2065
01:34:30.630 --> 01:34:32.500
If ever thou darest acknowledge it,

2066
01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.600
I will make it my quarrel.

2067
01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:34.830
There is my glove.

2068
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:36.300
Give me another of thine.

2069
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.830
There.

2070
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:40.500
This will I also wear in my cap,

2071
01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.700
and if ever you come to me and say, after tomorrow,

2072
01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.000
"This is my glove,"

2073
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.170
by this hand, I'll take thee a box on the ear.

2074
01:34:46.170 --> 01:34:47.800
If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.

2075
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.100
Thou darest as well be hanged.

2076
01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.300
Well, I will do it,

2077
01:34:50.300 --> 01:34:52.130
though I take thee in the king's company!

2078
01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:54.130
Keep thy word!

2079
01:34:56.230 --> 01:34:57.670
Fare thee well.

2080
01:34:57.670 --> 01:35:00.230
Be friends, you English fools, be friends.

2081
01:35:00.230 --> 01:35:03.070
We have French quarrels enough, if you could tell how to reckon.

2082
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:05.170
Indeed, the French may lay 20 French crowns to 1

2083
01:35:05.170 --> 01:35:06.270
they will beat us,

2084
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:08.830
for they bear them on their shoulders.

2085
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:12.030
But it is no English treason to cut French crowns.

2086
01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:16.200
And tomorrow the king himself will be a clipper!

2087
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:31.430
Upon the king.

2088
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:34.430
Let us our lives,

2089
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:36.930
our souls,

2090
01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:39.330
our debts,

2091
01:35:39.330 --> 01:35:43.470
our careful wives,

2092
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:47.400
our children,

2093
01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.000
and our sins

2094
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
lay on the king.

2095
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:55.570
We must bear all.

2096
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.370
Oh, hard condition,

2097
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:06.070
twin-born with greatness,

2098
01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.970
subject to the breath of every fool

2099
01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:14.000
whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing.

2100
01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:17.670
What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect

2101
01:36:17.670 --> 01:36:19.100
that private men enjoy?

2102
01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:23.730
And what have kings that privates have not too

2103
01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:25.770
save ceremony,

2104
01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:27.800
save general ceremony?

2105
01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:32.870
And what art thou,

2106
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.600
thou idle ceremony?

2107
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:38.130
What kind of god art thou

2108
01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:39.800
that sufferest more of mortal griefs

2109
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.230
than do thy worshippers?

2110
01:36:41.230 --> 01:36:43.000
What are thy rents?

2111
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:44.130
What are thy comings in?

2112
01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:46.100
Oh, ceremony, show me but thy worth.

2113
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.970
What is thy soul of adoration?

2114
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.070
Art thou aught else

2115
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:54.630
but place, degree, and form

2116
01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:57.130
creating awe and fear in other men?

2117
01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:00.470
Wherein thou art less happy, being feared,

2118
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:02.470
than they in fearing?

2119
01:37:05.130 --> 01:37:07.330
What drinkest thou oft, instead of homage sweet,

2120
01:37:07.330 --> 01:37:08.830
but poisoned flattery?

2121
01:37:11.230 --> 01:37:13.570
Oh, be sick, great greatness.

2122
01:37:13.570 --> 01:37:16.430
Bid thy ceremony give thee cure.

2123
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.270
Thinkest thou the fiery fever will go out

2124
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:20.270
with titles blown from adulation?

2125
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:21.500
Will it...

2126
01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.000
give place to flexure and low bending?

2127
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:28.770
Canst thou, when thou commandest the beggar's knee,

2128
01:37:28.770 --> 01:37:30.100
command the health of it?

2129
01:37:31.530 --> 01:37:33.330
No, thou proud dream

2130
01:37:33.330 --> 01:37:36.070
that playest so subtly with a king's repose.

2131
01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.900
I am a king that find thee.

2132
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:49.500
And I know 'tis not the balm,the sceptre, and the ball;

2133
01:37:51.570 --> 01:37:56.600
the sword, the mace, the crown imperial;

2134
01:37:59.430 --> 01:38:02.330
the intertissued robe of gold and pearl;

2135
01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:06.070
the farced title running 'fore the king;

2136
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:08.230
the throne he sits on;

2137
01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:09.770
nor the tide of pomp

2138
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:12.230
that beats upon the high shore of this world--

2139
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:17.230
no, not all these,

2140
01:38:17.230 --> 01:38:21.470
thrice-gorgeous ceremony.

2141
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:23.630
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,

2142
01:38:23.630 --> 01:38:26.130
can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,

2143
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:29.900
who with a body filled and vacant mind

2144
01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:33.770
gets him to rest, crammed with distressful bread,

2145
01:38:36.930 --> 01:38:38.630
never sees horrid night,

2146
01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.700
the child of hell,

2147
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.530
but, like a lackey, from the rise to set

2148
01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:52.270
sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night sleeps in Elysium.

2149
01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:57.530
Next day after dawn

2150
01:38:57.530 --> 01:39:00.230
doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse

2151
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.370
and follows so the ever-running year,

2152
01:39:05.370 --> 01:39:09.070
with profitable labor, to his grave.

2153
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:16.270
And but for ceremony,

2154
01:39:17.530 --> 01:39:19.230
such a wretch,

2155
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:23.000
winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,

2156
01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.600
had the forehand and vantage of a king.

2157
01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:30.130
The slave, a member of the country's peace,

2158
01:39:30.130 --> 01:39:32.300
enjoys it,

2159
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:35.330
but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps

2160
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:38.370
to maintain the peace,

2161
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.870
whose hours the peasant best advantages.

2162
01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:45.770
My lord.

2163
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:51.030
My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,

2164
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:53.300
seek through your camp to find you.

2165
01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:55.900
Good old knight,

2166
01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:58.430
collect them all together at my tent.

2167
01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:00.130
I'll be before thee.

2168
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:02.030
I shall do it, my lord.

2169
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:10.370
Oh, God of battles,

2170
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:12.470
steel my soldiers' hearts.

2171
01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:16.670
Possess them not with fear.

2172
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:23.400
Take from them now the sense of reckoning,

2173
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.800
if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.

2174
01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:31.470
Not today, oh, Lord,

2175
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.600
oh, not today.

2176
01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.670
Think not upon the fault

2177
01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:37.730
my father made in compassing the crown.

2178
01:40:37.730 --> 01:40:39.570
I Richard's body have interred anew

2179
01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.470
and on it have bestowed more contrite tears

2180
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:46.130
than from it issued forced drops of blood.

2181
01:40:48.170 --> 01:40:52.200
500 poor I have in yearly pay,

2182
01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:53.830
who twice a day their withered hands

2183
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:56.130
hold up toward heaven to pardon blood.

2184
01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:01.400
And I have built two chantries,

2185
01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:07.270
where the sad and solemn priests sing still for Richard's soul.

2186
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.230
More would I do,

2187
01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:13.400
but all that I can do is nothing worth,

2188
01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.900
since that my penitence comes after all,

2189
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:20.400
imploring pardon.

2190
01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.400
My liege.

2191
01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:27.100
My brother Gloucester's voice.

2192
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:29.170
Aye.

2193
01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:32.070
I know thy errand.

2194
01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:34.070
I will go with thee.

2195
01:41:35.370 --> 01:41:37.900
The day,

2196
01:41:37.900 --> 01:41:41.170
my friends,

2197
01:41:41.170 --> 01:41:43.170
and all things stay for me.

2198
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:51.730
The sun doth gild our armor.

2199
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:52.730
Up, my lords.

2200
01:41:52.730 --> 01:41:54.170
Montez a cheval!

2201
01:41:54.170 --> 01:41:55.730
My horse, varlet!

2202
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:57.130
Laquais! Ha!

2203
01:41:57.130 --> 01:41:58.370
Oh, brave spirit.

2204
01:41:58.370 --> 01:41:59.370
Via.

2205
01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:00.830
Les eaux et la terre.

2206
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:01.970
Rien puis.

2207
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:03.370
L'air et le feu.

2208
01:42:03.370 --> 01:42:06.370
Ciel, Cousin Orleans.

2209
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:07.800
Now, my Lord Constable.

2210
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.030
Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh.

2211
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:13.900
Mount them and make incision in their hides

2212
01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:16.430
that their hot blood may spin in English eyes

2213
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:19.000
and dout them with superfluous courage, ha.

2214
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.530
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?

2215
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:24.500
How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?

2216
01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:26.530
The English are embattled, you French peers.

2217
01:42:26.530 --> 01:42:29.900
To horse, you gallant princes, straight to horse.

2218
01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.630
Do but behold yon poor and starved band,

2219
01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:35.470
and your fair show shall suck away their souls,

2220
01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:39.270
leaving them but the shales and husks of men.

2221
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:41.170
There is not work enough for all our hands,

2222
01:42:41.170 --> 01:42:43.400
scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins

2223
01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.970
to give each naked curtal ax a stain,

2224
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:48.400
that our French gallants shall today draw out

2225
01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.970
and sheathe for lack of sport.

2226
01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:52.470
If we but blow on them,

2227
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:54.930
the vapor of our valor will o'erturn them.

2228
01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:58.530
Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?

2229
01:42:58.530 --> 01:43:01.300
Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,

2230
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:03.570
ill-favoredly become the morning field.

2231
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:06.200
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,

2232
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:09.430
and our air shakes them passing scornfully.

2233
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:11.700
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks

2234
01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.670
with torch-staves in their hand.

2235
01:43:13.670 --> 01:43:16.670
And their poor jades lob down their heads,

2236
01:43:16.670 --> 01:43:18.330
dropping the hides and hips,

2237
01:43:18.330 --> 01:43:21.930
the gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,

2238
01:43:21.930 --> 01:43:24.070
and in their pale dull mouths,

2239
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:27.470
the gimmal bit lies foul with chewed grass,

2240
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:29.270
dull and motionless.

2241
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:31.100
And their executors, the knavish crows,

2242
01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:34.200
fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.

2243
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.130
They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.

2244
01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:39.570
Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits

2245
01:43:39.570 --> 01:43:41.800
and give their fasting horses provender,

2246
01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:44.230
and after fight with them?

2247
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:45.800
I stay but for my guidon.

2248
01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:47.030
Let's away.

2249
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:48.430
The sun is high,

2250
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:50.330
and we outwear the day.

2251
01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.000
Where is the king?

2252
01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.600
The king himself

2253
01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.800
is rode to view their battle.

2254
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.000
Of fighting men, they have full three-score thousand.

2255
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.670
There's five to one.

2256
01:44:05.670 --> 01:44:07.170
Besides, they all are fresh.

2257
01:44:07.170 --> 01:44:09.630
God's arm strike with us; 'tis a fearful odds.

2258
01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:12.700
God by you, princes all.

2259
01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:14.030
I'll to my charge.

2260
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:15.830
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,

2261
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:20.070
then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,

2262
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:22.530
my dear Lord Gloucester,

2263
01:44:22.530 --> 01:44:25.130
my good Lord Exeter,

2264
01:44:25.130 --> 01:44:27.270
and my kind kinsman,

2265
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:29.300
warriors all, adieu.

2266
01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:31.070
Farewell, good Salisbury,

2267
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:32.200
and good luck go with thee.

2268
01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:33.730
Farewell, kind lord.

2269
01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:35.600
Fight valiantly today.

2270
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.300
Yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,

2271
01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:39.330
for thou art framed of the firm truth of valor.

2272
01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:43.700
He is as full of valor as of kindness,

2273
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.700
princely in both.

2274
01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.870
Oh, that we now had here

2275
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:49.230
but one 10,000 of those men in England

2276
01:44:49.230 --> 01:44:50.930
that do no work today.

2277
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:52.900
What's he that wishes so?

2278
01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.400
My cousin Westmoreland.

2279
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.130
No, my fair cousin.

2280
01:45:00.130 --> 01:45:01.600
We are marked to die,

2281
01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:04.900
we are enow to do our country loss;

2282
01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.070
and if to live, the fewer men, the greater share of honor.

2283
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:09.100
God's will.

2284
01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.670
I pray thee, wish not one man more.

2285
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:14.000
By Jove, I am not covetous for gold

2286
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.900
nor care I who doth feed upon my cost.

2287
01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.900
It yearns me not if men my garments wear.

2288
01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:22.700
Such outward things dwell not in my desires.

2289
01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:24.230
But if it be a sin to covet honor,

2290
01:45:24.230 --> 01:45:27.500
I am the most offending soul alive.

2291
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:30.270
No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.

2292
01:45:30.270 --> 01:45:31.270
God's peace.

2293
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:33.230
I would not lose so great an honor

2294
01:45:33.230 --> 01:45:35.600
as one man more, methinks, would share from me

2295
01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600
for the best hope I have.

2296
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:39.730
Oh, do not wish one more.

2297
01:45:39.730 --> 01:45:42.070
Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,

2298
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:44.930
that he which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart.

2299
01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:46.300
His passport shall be made

2300
01:45:46.300 --> 01:45:49.630
and crowns for convoy put into his purse.

2301
01:45:49.630 --> 01:45:51.430
We would not die in that man's company

2302
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:53.670
that fears his fellowship to die with us.

2303
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:03.100
This day is called

2304
01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:05.800
the feast of Crispian.

2305
01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:07.730
He that outlives this day

2306
01:46:07.730 --> 01:46:08.930
and comes safe home

2307
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:11.130
will stand at tiptoe when this day is named

2308
01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:13.630
and rouse him at the name of Crispian.

2309
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.270
He that shall live this day

2310
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:18.500
and see old age

2311
01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.730
will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors

2312
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:23.170
and say, "Tomorrow is Saint Crispian."

2313
01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:25.770
Then shall he strip his sleeve and show his scars

2314
01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:29.870
and say, "These wounds I had on Crispian's day."

2315
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:31.570
Old men forget,

2316
01:46:31.570 --> 01:46:32.630
yet all shall be forgot,

2317
01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.300
but he'll remember with advantages

2318
01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:35.870
what feats he did that day.

2319
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:38.970
Then shall our names,

2320
01:46:38.970 --> 01:46:42.270
familiar in his mouth as household words--

2321
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:44.070
Harry the king,

2322
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:45.830
Bedford and Exeter,

2323
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:49.430
Warwick and Talbot,

2324
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:51.800
Salisbury and Gloucester--

2325
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.670
be in their flowing cups freshly remembered.

2326
01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:03.970
This story shall the good man teach his son.

2327
01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:06.800
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,

2328
01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.100
from this day to the ending of the world,

2329
01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:10.830
but we in it shall be remembered,

2330
01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.100
we few,

2331
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.000
we happy few,

2332
01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:21.330
we band of brothers;

2333
01:47:22.730 --> 01:47:25.000
for he today that sheds his blood with me

2334
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.200
shall be my brother.

2335
01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.400
Be he ne'er so vile,

2336
01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.800
this day shall gentle his condition.

2337
01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.430
And gentlemen in England now abed

2338
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:37.700
shall think themselves accursed they were not here

2339
01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:40.130
and hold their manhoods cheap

2340
01:47:40.130 --> 01:47:43.770
whiles any speaks that fought with us

2341
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:45.770
upon Saint Crispin's day.

2342
01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.630
My sovereign lord,

2343
01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:49.800
bestow yourself with speed.

2344
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.170
The French are bravely in their battles set

2345
01:47:51.170 --> 01:47:52.500
and will with all expedience charge on us.

2346
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:55.700
All things are ready if our minds be so.

2347
01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:59.270
Perish the man whose mind is backward now.

2348
01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:02.170
Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz.

2349
01:48:02.170 --> 01:48:05.100
God's will, my liege, would you and I alone,

2350
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.470
without more help, could fight this royal battle.

2351
01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:12.370
Why, now thou hast unwished 5,000 men,

2352
01:48:12.370 --> 01:48:15.270
which likes me better than to wish us one.

2353
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:16.770
You know your places.

2354
01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:20.100
God be with you all.

2355
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:24.000
Once more, I come to know of thee,

2356
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.100
King Harry,

2357
01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:28.230
if for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,

2358
01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:30.970
before thy most assured overthrow,

2359
01:48:30.970 --> 01:48:33.200
for certainly thou art so near the gulf,

2360
01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:36.270
thou needs must be englutted.

2361
01:48:36.270 --> 01:48:39.970
Besides, in mercy, the constable desires thee

2362
01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:42.770
thou wilt mind thy followers of repentance

2363
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:47.030
that their souls may make a peaceful and a sweet retire

2364
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:50.030
from off these fields, where, wretches,

2365
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:53.970
their poor bodies must lie and fester.

2366
01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:55.600
Who hath sent thee now?

2367
01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.730
The constable of France.

2368
01:48:57.730 --> 01:48:59.670
I pray thee, bear my former answer back.

2369
01:48:59.670 --> 01:49:02.330
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.

2370
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:05.370
Good God, why should they mock poor fellows thus?

2371
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:07.200
The man that once did sell the lion's skin

2372
01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.300
while the beast lived

2373
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.330
was killed with hunting him.

2374
01:49:10.330 --> 01:49:11.370
A many of our bodies

2375
01:49:11.370 --> 01:49:13.770
shall no doubt find native graves,

2376
01:49:13.770 --> 01:49:15.100
upon the which, I trust,

2377
01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:18.930
shall witness live in brass of this day's work.

2378
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:21.930
Those that leave their valiant bones in France,

2379
01:49:21.930 --> 01:49:25.300
dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,

2380
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:27.530
they shall be famed,

2381
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:29.100
for there, the sun shall greet them

2382
01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.030
and draw their honors reeking up to heaven,

2383
01:49:31.030 --> 01:49:33.430
leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,

2384
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:37.400
the smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.

2385
01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:39.430
Let me speak proudly.

2386
01:49:39.430 --> 01:49:40.570
Tell the constable

2387
01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:43.300
we are but warriors for the working day.

2388
01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:45.470
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched

2389
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:47.530
with rainy marching in the painful field.

2390
01:49:47.530 --> 01:49:49.900
There's not a piece of feather in our host--

2391
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.130
good argument, I hope, we will not fly--

2392
01:49:53.130 --> 01:49:55.870
and time hath worn us into slovenry.

2393
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:58.870
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim.

2394
01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:00.400
And my poor soldiers tell me,

2395
01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:02.330
yet ere night, they'll be in fresher robes,

2396
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:03.900
or they will pluck the gay new coats

2397
01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:05.300
o'er the French soldiers' heads

2398
01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:06.570
and turn them out of service.

2399
01:50:06.570 --> 01:50:09.070
If they do this-- as, if God please, they shall--

2400
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:12.170
my ransom then shall soon be levied.

2401
01:50:12.170 --> 01:50:14.770
Herald, save thou thy labor.

2402
01:50:14.770 --> 01:50:16.970
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald,

2403
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:19.530
for they shall have none, I swear, but these my joints,

2404
01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.400
which if they have as I will leave 'em them,

2405
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:23.670
shall yield them little, tell the constable.

2406
01:50:23.670 --> 01:50:26.300
I shall, King Harry.

2407
01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.930
And so fare thee well.

2408
01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:32.200
Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.

2409
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:42.400
I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom.

2410
01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:50.070
My lord, most humbly on my knee,

2411
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:52.830
I beg the leading of the vaward.

2412
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:54.400
Take it,

2413
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.400
brave York.

2414
01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:01.170
Now, soldiers,

2415
01:51:01.170 --> 01:51:02.600
march away!

2416
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:07.900
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day.

2417
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:24.500
Yield, cur!

2418
01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:27.700
Je pense que vous etes le gentilhomme de bonne qualite.

2419
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:28.700
Art thou a gentleman?

2420
01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:30.330
What is thy name? Discuss.

2421
01:51:30.330 --> 01:51:32.200
Oh, Seigneur Dieu.

2422
01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.000
Oh, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman.

2423
01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:40.300
Perpend my words, Oh, Signieur Dew, and mark.

2424
01:51:40.300 --> 01:51:44.200
Oh, Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,

2425
01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.430
except, oh, Signieur,

2426
01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:50.800
you do give to me egregious ransom.

2427
01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:52.530
Oh, prenez misericorde.

2428
01:51:52.530 --> 01:51:54.700
Ayez pitie de moi.

2429
01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:57.100
Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras.

2430
01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.300
Brass, cur?

2431
01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:02.830
You damned and luxurious mountain goat,

2432
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:04.700
offerest thou me brass?

2433
01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.830
Oh, pardonnez-moi.

2434
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:08.770
What sayest thou so to me?

2435
01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:10.930
A ton of moys?

2436
01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:12.330
Come hither, boy!

2437
01:52:12.330 --> 01:52:16.770
Ask me this slave in French what is his name.

2438
01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:18.000
Ecoutez?

2439
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.630
Comment etes-vous appele?

2440
01:52:21.230 --> 01:52:22.700
Monsieur le Fer.

2441
01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:25.000
He says his name is Master Fer.

2442
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.170
Master Fer?

2443
01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:27.970
I'll fer him, firk him, and ferret him.

2444
01:52:27.970 --> 01:52:29.900
Discuss the same in French unto him.

2445
01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.570
I do not know the French for fer and ferret and firk.

2446
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:35.270
Well, bid him prepare, for I will cut his throat.

2447
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:36.970
Que dit-il, Monsieur?

2448
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:41.730
Il me commande a vous dire que vous faites vous pret.

2449
01:52:41.730 --> 01:52:46.230
Car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette heure

2450
01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:48.430
de couper votre gorge.

2451
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:51.930
Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,

2452
01:52:51.930 --> 01:52:54.570
peasant, unless you give me crowns,

2453
01:52:54.570 --> 01:52:55.870
brave crowns,

2454
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:59.500
or mangled shalt thou be by this, my sword.

2455
01:52:59.500 --> 01:53:01.700
Oh, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu,

2456
01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:03.130
me pardonner!

2457
01:53:03.130 --> 01:53:05.600
Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison.

2458
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.130
Gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.

2459
01:53:09.130 --> 01:53:10.900
What are his words?

2460
01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:12.630
He prays for you to save his life.

2461
01:53:12.630 --> 01:53:14.230
He is a gentleman of good house.

2462
01:53:14.230 --> 01:53:17.330
And for his ransom, he will give you 200 crowns.

2463
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:18.600
Oui, monsieur.

2464
01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:20.070
Tell him my fury will abate,

2465
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:22.500
but I the crowns will take.

2466
01:53:22.500 --> 01:53:25.330
Petit monsieur, que dit-il?

2467
01:53:25.330 --> 01:53:28.870
Encore qu'il est contre son jurement

2468
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:31.170
de pardonner aucun prisonnier.

2469
01:53:31.170 --> 01:53:34.970
Neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous l'avez promis,

2470
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:40.230
il est content de vous donner la liberte, le franchisement.

2471
01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:45.030
Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens.

2472
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:47.470
Et je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre

2473
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:49.030
les mains d'un chevalier,

2474
01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:52.230
je pense, le plus brave, vaillant,

2475
01:53:52.230 --> 01:53:55.470
et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre!

2476
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:57.470
Merci, monsieur.

2477
01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:01.000
Expound unto me, boy.

2478
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.100
He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks.

2479
01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:06.530
And he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen

2480
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:08.930
into the hands of one, as he thinks,

2481
01:54:08.930 --> 01:54:11.800
the most brave, valorous,

2482
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.130
and thrice-worthy signieur of England.

2483
01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:20.170
As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.

2484
01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:21.570
Follow me!

2485
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:23.570
Follow me!

2486
01:54:23.570 --> 01:54:25.870
Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.

2487
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:28.930
Follow me!

2488
01:54:28.930 --> 01:54:32.930
I did never know so full a voice issue from so empty a heart.

2489
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:34.470
But the saying is true,

2490
01:54:34.470 --> 01:54:37.370
"The empty vessel makes the greatest sound."

2491
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:39.370
Bardolph and Nym had ten times more valor

2492
01:54:39.370 --> 01:54:41.870
than this roaring devil i' the old play,

2493
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:43.530
and they are both hanged.

2494
01:54:43.530 --> 01:54:44.670
And so would this be

2495
01:54:44.670 --> 01:54:46.600
if he durst steal anything adventurously.

2496
01:54:49.230 --> 01:54:52.870
I must stay with the lackey with the luggage of our camp.

2497
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:54.600
The French might have a good prey of us,

2498
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:56.770
if he knew of it,

2499
01:54:56.770 --> 01:54:58.800
for there is none to guard it but boys.

2500
01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:02.600
Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!

2501
01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:04.100
Oh, let us die in honor.

2502
01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:05.770
Once more back again!

2503
01:55:05.770 --> 01:55:09.870
And he who will not follow Bourbon now, let him go hence,

2504
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:12.330
and with his cap in hand, like a base pander,

2505
01:55:12.330 --> 01:55:14.670
hold the chamber door whilst by a slave,

2506
01:55:14.670 --> 01:55:16.200
no gentler than my dog,

2507
01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:18.300
his fairest daughter is contaminated.

2508
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:21.230
Disorder, that hath spoiled us, friend us now.

2509
01:55:21.230 --> 01:55:23.930
Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.

2510
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:26.270
We are enow yet living in the field

2511
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:28.870
to smother up the English in our throngs

2512
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:31.070
if any order might be thought upon.

2513
01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:32.430
Oh, the devil take order now.

2514
01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:34.000
I'll to the throng!

2515
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.430
Let life be short, else shame will be too long.

2516
01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:57.830
Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen.

2517
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:59.300
But all's not done.

2518
01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:01.070
Yet keep the French the field.

2519
01:56:01.070 --> 01:56:03.370
The Duke of York commends him to Your Majesty.

2520
01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:06.530
Lives he, good Uncle?

2521
01:56:06.530 --> 01:56:08.300
Thrice within this hour, I saw him down,

2522
01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.970
thrice up again and fighting.

2523
01:56:09.970 --> 01:56:12.670
From helmet to the spur, all blood he was.

2524
01:56:12.670 --> 01:56:16.400
In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie, larding the plain.

2525
01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:17.570
And by his bloody side,

2526
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:20.000
yokefellow to his honor-owing wounds,

2527
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.300
the noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.

2528
01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.130
Suffolk first died.

2529
01:56:25.130 --> 01:56:28.800
York, all haggled over, comes to him,

2530
01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.800
where in gore he lay insteeped,

2531
01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:31.800
takes him by the beard,

2532
01:56:31.800 --> 01:56:32.830
and kisses the gashes

2533
01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:35.700
that bloodily did yawn upon his face.

2534
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:37.800
He cries aloud, "Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.

2535
01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.770
"My soul shall thine keep company to heaven.

2536
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:42.700
"Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,

2537
01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:46.130
"as in this glorious and well-foughten field

2538
01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:50.630
we--we kept together in our chivalry."

2539
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:54.830
Upon these words, I came and cheered him up.

2540
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:56.970
He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,

2541
01:56:56.970 --> 01:56:59.630
and, with a feeble grip, says, "Dear my lord,

2542
01:56:59.630 --> 01:57:01.600
commend my service to my sovereign."

2543
01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:05.370
So did he turn,

2544
01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:06.500
and over Suffolk's neck,

2545
01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.000
he threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips.

2546
01:57:10.630 --> 01:57:13.300
And so espoused to death, with blood,

2547
01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:16.300
he sealed a testament of noble-ending love.

2548
01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:20.370
The pretty and sweet manner of it

2549
01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:23.700
forced those waters from me which I would have stopped.

2550
01:57:25.500 --> 01:57:27.170
I had not so much of man in me,

2551
01:57:27.170 --> 01:57:29.330
and all my mother came into mine eyes

2552
01:57:29.330 --> 01:57:31.570
and gave me up to tears.

2553
01:57:34.130 --> 01:57:35.500
I blame you not,

2554
01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:36.630
for, hearing this,

2555
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:38.930
I must perforce compound with mistful eyes,

2556
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:39.970
or they will issue too.

2557
01:57:42.670 --> 01:57:45.170
But hark, what new alarum is this same?

2558
01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:47.370
The French have reinforced their scattered men.

2559
01:57:47.370 --> 01:57:49.130
Then every soldier kill his prisoners.

2560
01:57:49.130 --> 01:57:51.130
Give the word through.

2561
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.330
Kill the poys and the luggage!

2562
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:03.300
'Tis expressly against the law of arms!

2563
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.800
'Tis as arrant a piece of knavery,

2564
01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.630
mark you now, as can be offered.

2565
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:08.430
In your conscience, is it not?

2566
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:10.870
'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive.

2567
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:13.200
And the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle

2568
01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.230
have done this slaughter.

2569
01:58:15.230 --> 01:58:17.800
Besides, they have burned and carried away

2570
01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:19.900
all that was in the king's tent.

2571
01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:21.670
Wherefore the king, most worthily,

2572
01:58:21.670 --> 01:58:24.870
hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner's throat.

2573
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:27.070
Oh, 'tis a gallant king.

2574
01:58:27.070 --> 01:58:32.130
Aye, he was born at Monmouth, Captain Gower.

2575
01:58:32.130 --> 01:58:33.670
What call you the name of the town

2576
01:58:33.670 --> 01:58:36.000
where Alexander the Pig is born?

2577
01:58:37.130 --> 01:58:40.570
Alexander the Great.

2578
01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:42.200
Why, I pray you, is pig not great?

2579
01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.170
The pig or the great or the huge or the mighty

2580
01:58:44.170 --> 01:58:45.330
or the magnificence?

2581
01:58:45.330 --> 01:58:46.570
It's all one reckoning,

2582
01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:49.400
save the phrase, a little variation.

2583
01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:52.530
I think Alexander the Great was born at Macedon.

2584
01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:54.670
His father was called Philip of Macedon,

2585
01:58:54.670 --> 01:58:56.070
as I take it.

2586
01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:59.100
I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is born.

2587
01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:00.270
I tell you, Captain,

2588
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:03.070
if you look in the maps of the 'orld,

2589
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:04.300
I warrant you shall find

2590
01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:08.470
in the situations between Macedon and Monmouth

2591
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:11.670
that the situations, look you, is both alike.

2592
01:59:11.670 --> 01:59:13.870
There is a river in Macedon.

2593
01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:17.270
There is also moreover a river at Monmouth,

2594
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:20.300
the Wye at Monmouth.

2595
01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:21.330
But it is out of my brains

2596
01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:22.900
what is the name of the other river.

2597
01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:24.100
But it is all one,

2598
01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.770
such as my fingers is to my fingers,

2599
01:59:26.770 --> 01:59:29.030
and there is salmons--

2600
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:31.270
mm--

2601
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:32.270
in both.

2602
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:34.100
Oh, shh.

2603
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:35.970
If you mark Alexander's life well,

2604
01:59:35.970 --> 01:59:37.230
Harry of Monmouth's life

2605
01:59:37.230 --> 01:59:39.230
is come after it indifferent well,

2606
01:59:39.230 --> 01:59:40.930
for there is figures in all things.

2607
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:45.270
Alexander, God knows and you know,

2608
01:59:45.270 --> 01:59:46.600
in his rages and his wraths

2609
01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:48.830
and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures

2610
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:51.200
and his indignations and also being

2611
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.530
a little intoxicates in his brains,

2612
01:59:54.530 --> 01:59:58.300
did, in his ales and his angers, kill his best friend, Cleitus.

2613
01:59:58.300 --> 02:00:00.270
Our king is not like him in that.

2614
02:00:00.270 --> 02:00:02.200
He never killed any of his friends.

2615
02:00:04.570 --> 02:00:06.030
It is not well done, mark you now,

2616
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:07.430
to take the tales out of my mouth

2617
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:09.000
ere it is made and finished.

2618
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.800
I speak but in the figures and comparisons of it.

2619
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.730
As Alexander did kill his friend Cleitus,

2620
02:00:14.730 --> 02:00:16.000
in his ales and in his cups,

2621
02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.970
so also Harry Monmouth,

2622
02:00:17.970 --> 02:00:20.230
being in his right wits and his good judgments,

2623
02:00:20.230 --> 02:00:23.470
turned away the fat knight with the great belly doublet.

2624
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:26.270
He was full of jests and gipes and mocks and knaveries.

2625
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:28.570
Oh, I forgot his name now.

2626
02:00:28.570 --> 02:00:30.700
Sir John Falstaff.

2627
02:00:30.700 --> 02:00:31.730
That is he.

2628
02:00:31.730 --> 02:00:32.830
I'll tell you, Captain,

2629
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:35.200
there is good men born at Monmouth.

2630
02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:37.230
Here comes His Majesty.

2631
02:00:59.900 --> 02:01:03.800
I was not angry since I came to France

2632
02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.800
until this instant.

2633
02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:10.870
Take a trumpet, herald.

2634
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:12.700
Ride thou unto the horsemen on yond hill.

2635
02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:13.830
If they will fight with us,

2636
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:16.970
bid them come down or void the field.

2637
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:19.470
They do offend our sight.

2638
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:20.770
If they'll do neither,

2639
02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:22.730
we'll come to them and make them skirr away,

2640
02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:25.300
as swift as stones enforced from the old Assyrian slings.

2641
02:01:25.300 --> 02:01:27.430
Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,

2642
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:29.100
and not a man of them that we shall take

2643
02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.030
shall taste our mercy!

2644
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:32.330
Go and tell them so.

2645
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:34.600
Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.

2646
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:40.430
How now.

2647
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:43.730
What means this, herald?

2648
02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:46.500
Comest thou again for ransom?

2649
02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:50.000
No, great king.

2650
02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.200
I come to thee for charitable license,

2651
02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:56.800
that we may wander o'er this bloody field

2652
02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:59.730
to book our dead and then to bury them,

2653
02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:03.330
to sort our nobles from our common men,

2654
02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:07.630
for many of our princes-- woe the while--

2655
02:02:07.630 --> 02:02:10.630
lie drowned and soaked in mercenary blood.

2656
02:02:10.630 --> 02:02:13.000
So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs

2657
02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.270
in blood of princes,

2658
02:02:15.270 --> 02:02:18.570
and their wounded steeds fret fetlock deep in gore

2659
02:02:18.570 --> 02:02:19.830
and with wild rage

2660
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:22.300
yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,

2661
02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:23.600
killing them twice.

2662
02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:29.200
Oh, give us leave, great king, to view the field in safety

2663
02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.000
and dispose of their dead bodies.

2664
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.770
I tell thee truly, herald,

2665
02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:37.700
I know not if the day be ours or no,

2666
02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:40.470
for yet a many of your horsemen peer and gallop o'er the field.

2667
02:02:42.530 --> 02:02:44.130
The day is yours.

2668
02:02:49.170 --> 02:02:51.600
Praised be God,

2669
02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:53.600
and not our strength, for it.

2670
02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:15.200
What is this castle called that stands hard by?

2671
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:19.270
They call it Agincourt.

2672
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:29.600
Then call we this the field of Agincourt,

2673
02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:32.400
fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.

2674
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:46.070
Your grandfather of famous memory--

2675
02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:48.170
an't please Your Majesty--

2676
02:03:48.170 --> 02:03:51.930
and your great-uncle Edward, the Black Prince of Wales,

2677
02:03:51.930 --> 02:03:54.830
as I have read in the chronicles,

2678
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:57.830
fought a most famous battle here in France.

2679
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:59.000
They did, Fluellen.

2680
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.800
Your Majesty says very true.

2681
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:03.230
If Your Majesties is remembered of it,

2682
02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:04.930
the Welshmen did good service

2683
02:04:04.930 --> 02:04:06.830
in the garden where leeks did grow,

2684
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:08.570
wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps,

2685
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:10.300
which, Your Majesty know, to this hour

2686
02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:12.230
to be an honorable badge of the service.

2687
02:04:12.230 --> 02:04:15.030
And I do believe Your Majesty takes no scorn

2688
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:17.170
to wear the leek upon Saint Tavy's day.

2689
02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:19.070
I wear it for a memorable honor,

2690
02:04:19.070 --> 02:04:21.070
for I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.

2691
02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:26.800
All the water in Wye cannot wash

2692
02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.870
the Welsh blood out of Your Majesty's body,

2693
02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:30.700
I can tell you that!

2694
02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:33.270
God bless it and preserve it

2695
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:37.730
as long as it pleases His Grace and His Majesty too!

2696
02:04:37.730 --> 02:04:39.000
Thanks, good my countryman.

2697
02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.730
By Jeshu, I am Your Majesty's countryman!

2698
02:04:44.730 --> 02:04:46.300
I care not who know it!

2699
02:04:46.300 --> 02:04:48.930
I will confess it to all the 'orld!

2700
02:04:48.930 --> 02:04:54.130
I need not be ashamed of Your Majesty, praised be God,

2701
02:04:54.130 --> 02:04:57.970
as long as Your Majesty is an honest man.

2702
02:04:57.970 --> 02:04:59.470
God keep me so.

2703
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:09.970
Our herald go with him,

2704
02:05:09.970 --> 02:05:11.900
and bring me just notice of the numbers dead

2705
02:05:11.900 --> 02:05:12.900
on both our parts.

2706
02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:23.030
Call yonder fellow hither.

2707
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:30.900
Soldier, you must come to the king.

2708
02:05:40.170 --> 02:05:42.530
Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?

2709
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:43.930
Oh.

2710
02:05:43.930 --> 02:05:45.300
An't please Your Majesty,

2711
02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:48.500
it is the gage of one I should fight withal,

2712
02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:49.500
if he be alive.

2713
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:50.500
An Englishman?

2714
02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:51.800
An't please Your Majesty,

2715
02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:53.730
a rascal that swaggered with me last night,

2716
02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:55.500
who, if ever dare challenge this glove,

2717
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.230
I have sworn to take him a box o' the ear.

2718
02:05:57.230 --> 02:05:58.830
Or if I should see my glove in his cap--

2719
02:05:58.830 --> 02:06:00.470
which he swore, as he were a soldier,

2720
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:01.870
he would wear if alive--

2721
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:03.700
I will strike it out soundly.

2722
02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:05.700
What think you, Captain Fluellen?

2723
02:06:08.230 --> 02:06:10.000
Is it fit this soldier keep his oath?

2724
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
He is a villain and a craven,

2725
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.400
an't please Your Majesty, in my conscience.

2726
02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:19.330
Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.

2727
02:06:19.330 --> 02:06:20.970
So I will, my liege, as I live.

2728
02:06:20.970 --> 02:06:22.170
Who servest thou under?

2729
02:06:22.170 --> 02:06:23.530
Under Captain Gower, my liege.

2730
02:06:23.530 --> 02:06:24.900
Call him hither to me, soldier.

2731
02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.600
Oh, I will, my liege.

2732
02:06:31.730 --> 02:06:33.000
Here, Fluellen.

2733
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.030
Wear thou this favor for me and stick it in thy cap.

2734
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:39.030
When Alencon and myself were down together,

2735
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:41.430
I plucked this glove from his helm.

2736
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:42.800
If any man challenge this,

2737
02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:45.600
he is a friend to Alencon and an enemy to our person.

2738
02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:47.530
If thou encounter any such, apprehend him,

2739
02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:49.200
an thou dost me love.

2740
02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:50.300
Your Grace does me

2741
02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.770
as great honors as can be desired

2742
02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.070
in the hearts of his subjects.

2743
02:06:53.070 --> 02:06:54.800
I fain see the man that hath but two legs

2744
02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:57.000
that shall find himself aggrieved at this glove.

2745
02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
That is all.

2746
02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.600
But I'd fain see it once,

2747
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.930
an please God of His grace that I might see.

2748
02:07:02.930 --> 02:07:04.130
Knowest thou Gower?

2749
02:07:04.130 --> 02:07:06.070
Oh, he is my very dear friend, an please you.

2750
02:07:06.070 --> 02:07:08.170
Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.

2751
02:07:08.170 --> 02:07:10.500
I will fetch him.

2752
02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:12.870
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester,

2753
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:16.000
follow Fluellen closely at the heels.

2754
02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.530
Go you with me, Uncle Exeter.

2755
02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:20.730
I warrant it is to knight you, Captain.

2756
02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:23.000
God's will and his pleasure, Captain,

2757
02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:24.630
you must come apace to the king.

2758
02:07:24.630 --> 02:07:26.630
There is more good toward you peradventure

2759
02:07:26.630 --> 02:07:28.930
than is in your knowledge to dream of.

2760
02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:30.630
Sir,

2761
02:07:30.630 --> 02:07:33.830
know you this glove?

2762
02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:36.030
Know the glove?

2763
02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:37.800
I know a glove is a glove.

2764
02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:39.230
Hmm.

2765
02:07:39.230 --> 02:07:40.800
I know this,

2766
02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:42.300
and therefore, I challenge it!

2767
02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:43.900
'Sblood!

2768
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:46.130
An arrant a traitor as any is in the universal world

2769
02:07:46.130 --> 02:07:47.270
or in France or in England!

2770
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:48.270
How now, sir!

2771
02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:49.270
You villain.

2772
02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:50.270
Do you think I'll be forsworn?

2773
02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:51.730
Stand aside, Captain Gower!

2774
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:53.200
I'll give his treason payment into plows, I warrant you!

2775
02:07:53.200 --> 02:07:54.200
I am no traitor!

2776
02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:55.330
That's a lie in thy throat!

2777
02:07:55.330 --> 02:07:56.900
I charge you in His Majesty's name,

2778
02:07:56.900 --> 02:07:58.100
apprehend him!

2779
02:07:58.100 --> 02:07:59.730
He's a friend of the Duke Alencon's!

2780
02:07:59.730 --> 02:08:00.800
How now, how now.

2781
02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:01.900
What's the matter?

2782
02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.600
My Lord of Warwick, here is a villain,

2783
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:06.400
and a contagious treason come to light

2784
02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.870
as you shall desire in a summer's day.

2785
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:10.900
Here is His Majesty.

2786
02:08:10.900 --> 02:08:12.170
How now, what's the matter?

2787
02:08:12.170 --> 02:08:13.970
My liege, here is a villain and a traitor

2788
02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:15.070
that has struck the glove

2789
02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:16.170
which Your Majesty

2790
02:08:16.170 --> 02:08:18.070
is take out of the helmet of Alencon.

2791
02:08:18.070 --> 02:08:19.070
My liege, this was my glove.

2792
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:20.070
Here is the fellow to it,

2793
02:08:20.070 --> 02:08:21.070
and he that I gave it to in charge

2794
02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:22.100
promised to wear it in his cap.

2795
02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:23.370
I promised to strike him if he did.

2796
02:08:23.370 --> 02:08:24.800
I met this man with my glove in his cap,

2797
02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:26.200
and I have been as good as my word.

2798
02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:28.470
Your Majesty hear now, saving Your Majesty's manhood,

2799
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:30.770
what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is.

2800
02:08:30.770 --> 02:08:33.070
I hope Your Majesty will bear me witness and testament

2801
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:34.070
and will avouchment

2802
02:08:34.070 --> 02:08:35.530
that this is the glove of Alencon

2803
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:37.330
which Your Majesty is give me.

2804
02:08:37.330 --> 02:08:38.830
In your conscience, now.

2805
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:43.730
Give me thy glove, soldier.

2806
02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.730
Look, here is the fellow of it.

2807
02:08:58.430 --> 02:09:01.430
'Twas I, indeed, thou promisedst to strike.

2808
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:03.570
And thou hast given me most bitter terms.

2809
02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:05.800
Let his neck answer for it, an please Your Majesty,

2810
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:07.630
if there is any martial law in the world.

2811
02:09:07.630 --> 02:09:09.170
How canst thou make me satisfaction?

2812
02:09:09.170 --> 02:09:13.570
All offences, my lord, come from the heart.

2813
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:16.300
Never came any from mine to offend Your Majesty.

2814
02:09:16.300 --> 02:09:17.630
It was ourself thou didst abuse.

2815
02:09:17.630 --> 02:09:22.000
Your Majesty came not like yourself.

2816
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.170
You appeared to me but as a common man.

2817
02:09:25.170 --> 02:09:27.800
Witness the night,

2818
02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:30.570
your garments, your lowliness,

2819
02:09:30.570 --> 02:09:32.800
and what Your Highness suffered under that shape,

2820
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.070
I beseech you take for your own fault and not mine,

2821
02:09:37.770 --> 02:09:39.300
for had you been as I took you for,

2822
02:09:39.300 --> 02:09:41.300
I made no offence.

2823
02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:45.230
Therefore, I beseech Your Highness,

2824
02:09:45.230 --> 02:09:46.230
pardon me.

2825
02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:51.600
Here, Uncle Exeter.

2826
02:09:54.670 --> 02:09:55.930
Fill this glove with crowns,

2827
02:09:55.930 --> 02:09:57.630
and give it to this fellow.

2828
02:09:57.630 --> 02:09:59.100
Keep it, fellow,

2829
02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:01.100
and wear it for an honor in thy cap

2830
02:10:01.100 --> 02:10:02.100
till I do challenge it.

2831
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:06.930
Give him the crowns.

2832
02:10:06.930 --> 02:10:09.700
And, Captain, you must needs be friends with him.

2833
02:10:14.130 --> 02:10:17.830
By this day and this light,

2834
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:21.230
the fellow hath enough mettle in his belly.

2835
02:10:21.230 --> 02:10:23.030
Hold.

2836
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:28.700
Here is, ah, 12 pence for you.

2837
02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.670
And I pray you to serve God

2838
02:10:30.670 --> 02:10:31.770
and keep you out of prawls

2839
02:10:31.770 --> 02:10:34.270
and prabbles and quarrels and dissensions,

2840
02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:36.000
I warrant you, it is the better for you.

2841
02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.200
I will none of your money.

2842
02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:39.730
Oh, come, it is with a good will.

2843
02:10:39.730 --> 02:10:41.630
It will serve to mend your shoes.

2844
02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:44.900
Come, wherefore be you so bashful, huh?

2845
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.900
Your shoes is not so good.

2846
02:10:46.900 --> 02:10:48.070
'Tis a good shilling.

2847
02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:49.170
Hmm?

2848
02:10:49.170 --> 02:10:50.670
Or I will change it.

2849
02:10:58.370 --> 02:11:00.300
Now, herald, are the dead numbered?

2850
02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:02.470
Here is the number of the slaughtered French.

2851
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:04.500
What prisoners of good sort are taken, Uncle?

2852
02:11:09.670 --> 02:11:13.630
Charles, Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king.

2853
02:11:13.630 --> 02:11:14.970
John, Duke of Bourbon.

2854
02:11:14.970 --> 02:11:16.600
Lord Bouciqualt.

2855
02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:19.300
Of other lords, barons, knights, and squires,

2856
02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:23.700
full 1,500, besides common men.

2857
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:31.100
This note doth tell me of 10,000 French

2858
02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:32.870
that in the field lie slain.

2859
02:11:34.670 --> 02:11:38.530
Princes in this number and nobles bearing banners,

2860
02:11:38.530 --> 02:11:42.300
there lie dead 126.

2861
02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:45.070
Added to these, of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,

2862
02:11:45.070 --> 02:11:48.830
8,400;

2863
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:52.530
of the which, 500 were but yesterday dubbed knights;

2864
02:11:52.530 --> 02:11:54.300
so that in these 10,000 they have lost,

2865
02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:57.800
there are but 1,600 mercenaries.

2866
02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:03.200

gentlemen of blood and quality.

2868
02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.170

That's the brother to the Duke of Burgundy.

02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:33.830
And Edward, Duke of Bar.

2877
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:38.070

Vaudemont and Lestrale.

2881
02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:53.170
Here was a royal fellowship of death.

2882
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:59.630
Where is the number of our English dead?

2883
02:13:10.670 --> 02:13:13.070

2884
02:13:14.970 --> 02:13:16.070

Davy Gam, Esquire.

2887
02:13:28.230 --> 02:13:30.130
None else...

2888
02:13:30.130 --> 02:13:31.230
of name.

2889
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:37.630
And of all other men but 5 and 20--

2890
02:13:48.570 --> 02:13:50.470
Oh, God, Thy arm was here.

2891
02:13:52.670 --> 02:13:54.730
And not to us, but to Thy arm alone,

2892
02:13:54.730 --> 02:13:56.070
ascribe we all.

2893
02:13:58.030 --> 02:14:01.770
When, without stratagem,

2894
02:14:01.770 --> 02:14:04.870
but in plain shock and even play of battle,

2895
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:08.270
was ever known so great and little loss

2896
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:10.000
on one part and on the other?

2897
02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:17.500
Take it, God, for it is none but Thine.

2898
02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:21.030
'Tis wonderful.

2899
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:24.300
Come, go we in procession to the village.

2900
02:14:24.300 --> 02:14:26.230
And be it death proclaimed through our host

2901
02:14:26.230 --> 02:14:28.170
to boast of this or take that praise from God

2902
02:14:28.170 --> 02:14:29.270
which is His only.

2903
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:30.700
Is it not lawful, an please Your Majesty,

2904
02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:31.700
to tell how many is killed?

2905
02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:32.700
Yes, Captain.

2906
02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:34.100
But with this acknowledgment,

2907
02:14:34.100 --> 02:14:35.500
that God fought for us.

2908
02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:37.470
Yes, my conscience, He did us great good.

2909
02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:42.100
Do we all holy rites.

2910
02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:46.830
Let there be sung, "Non nobis te Deum,"

2911
02:14:46.830 --> 02:14:50.970
the dead with charity enclosed in clay,

2912
02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:53.530
and then to Calais

2913
02:14:53.530 --> 02:14:56.130
and to England then,

2914
02:14:56.130 --> 02:14:59.500
and where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.

2915
02:15:01.730 --> 02:15:04.330
Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,

2916
02:15:04.330 --> 02:15:06.230
that I may prompt them.

2917
02:15:06.230 --> 02:15:08.230
And of such as have,

2918
02:15:08.230 --> 02:15:10.770
I humbly pray them to admit the excuse of time,

2919
02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:12.400
of numbers and due course of things,

2920
02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:14.970
which cannot in their huge and proper life

2921
02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:16.700
be here presented.

2922
02:15:16.700 --> 02:15:19.630
Now we bear the king toward Calais.

2923
02:15:19.630 --> 02:15:20.970
Grant him there.

2924
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:23.570
There seen, heave him away upon your winged thoughts

2925
02:15:23.570 --> 02:15:25.170
athwart the sea.

2926
02:15:25.170 --> 02:15:29.200
Behold, the English beach pales in the flood with men,

2927
02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:30.500
with wives and boys,

2928
02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:34.200
whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouthed sea,

2929
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:36.170
which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king

2930
02:15:36.170 --> 02:15:37.870
seems to prepare his way.

2931
02:15:37.870 --> 02:15:43.230
So let him land, and solemnly see him set on to London.

2932
02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:46.070
So swift a pace hath thought that even now

2933
02:15:46.070 --> 02:15:48.900
you may imagine him upon Blackheath,

2934
02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:51.000
where that his lords desire him

2935
02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.600
to have borne his bruised helmet

2936
02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.500
and his bended sword before him through the city.

2937
02:15:55.500 --> 02:15:57.530
He forbids it,

2938
02:15:57.530 --> 02:16:00.670
being free from vainness and self-glorious pride,

2939
02:16:00.670 --> 02:16:02.900
giving full trophy, signal, and ostent

2940
02:16:02.900 --> 02:16:05.970
quite from himself to God.

2941
02:16:05.970 --> 02:16:07.700
But now behold,

2942
02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:10.230
in the quick forge and working house of thought,

2943
02:16:10.230 --> 02:16:13.500
how London doth pour out her citizens.

2944
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:17.230
The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,

2945
02:16:17.230 --> 02:16:19.300
like to the senators of the antique Rome

2946
02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.630
with the plebeians swarming at their heels,

2947
02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:24.370
go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in.

2948
02:16:24.370 --> 02:16:27.500
As, by a lower but loving likelihood,

2949
02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:29.930
were now the general of our gracious empress,

2950
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:33.530
as in good time he may, from Ireland coming,

2951
02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:36.300
bringing rebellion broached on his sword,

2952
02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.770
how many would the peaceful city quit,

2953
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:40.930
to welcome him.

2954
02:16:40.930 --> 02:16:45.770
Much more and much more cause did they this Harry.

2955
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:47.870
Now in London place him.

2956
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:50.500
As yet the lamentations of the French

2957
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.330
invites the king of England's stay at home--

2958
02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:55.300
the emperor's coming in behalf of France

2959
02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:56.730
to order peace between them--

2960
02:16:56.730 --> 02:17:00.470
and omit all the occurrences, whatever chanced,

2961
02:17:00.470 --> 02:17:03.370
till Harry's back return again to France.

2962
02:17:03.370 --> 02:17:05.570
There must we bring him,

2963
02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:07.800
and myself have played the interim

2964
02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.370
by remembering you 'tis past.

2965
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:11.630
Then brook abridgment,

2966
02:17:11.630 --> 02:17:14.100
and your eyes advance after your thoughts,

2967
02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.730
straight back again to France.

2968
02:17:15.730 --> 02:17:17.470
Nay, that's right.

2969
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:19.430
But why wear you your leek today?

2970
02:17:19.430 --> 02:17:21.270
Saint Davy's day is past.

2971
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:26.100
There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things.

2972
02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:29.030
I will tell you as my friend, Captain Gower.

2973
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:34.000
The rascally, scald, beggarly, lousy, pragging knave, Pistol,

2974
02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.100
which you and yourself and all the world know

2975
02:17:37.100 --> 02:17:38.770
to be a man of no merits,

2976
02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:43.100
he is come to me yesterday and brings me bread and salt

2977
02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:45.400
and bids me eat my leek.

2978
02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:46.500
It was in a place

2979
02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:48.600
where I could bear no contention with him.

2980
02:17:48.600 --> 02:17:52.230
But I'll be so bold as to wear my leek in my cap

2981
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:54.170
till I see him again,

2982
02:17:54.170 --> 02:17:57.270
and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires.

2983
02:17:57.270 --> 02:18:00.530
Here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.

2984
02:18:00.530 --> 02:18:03.570
'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his turkey-cocks.

2985
02:18:03.570 --> 02:18:05.830
God bless you, Aunchient Pistol!

2986
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:09.700
You scurvy, lousy knave, God bless you.

2987
02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:10.700
Ha!

2988
02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:12.700
Art thou bedlam?

2989
02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:15.870
Would'st thou have me fold up Parca's fatal web?

2990
02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:16.970
Hence.

2991
02:18:16.970 --> 02:18:19.200
I am qualmish at the smell of leek.

2992
02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.230
I beseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave,

2993
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:24.630
at my requests and my petitions and my desires

2994
02:18:24.630 --> 02:18:26.630
to eat, look you, this leek,

2995
02:18:26.630 --> 02:18:28.600
because, look you, you do not love it,

2996
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:30.470
nor your affections and your appetites

2997
02:18:30.470 --> 02:18:33.300
and your digestions does not agree with it,

2998
02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:36.230
I would desire you therefore to eat it.

2999
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:40.830
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.

3000
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:43.070
Ow!

3001
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:44.430
Ah!

3002
02:18:44.430 --> 02:18:46.300
There is one goat for you.

3003
02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:47.500
Oh!

3004
02:18:47.500 --> 02:18:50.370
Will you be so good, scald knave, as eat it?

3005
02:18:50.370 --> 02:18:52.530
Base Troyan, thou shalt die.

3006
02:18:52.530 --> 02:18:55.470
You say very true, scald knave, when God's will is.

3007
02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:57.770
I will desire you to live in the meantime

3008
02:18:57.770 --> 02:18:59.330
and eat your victuals.

3009
02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:01.530
Come, there is sauce for it.

3010
02:19:01.530 --> 02:19:03.200
Ow!

3011
02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:04.900
Bite, I pray you.

3012
02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:08.470
It's good for your green wound and your bloody coxcomb.

3013
02:19:08.470 --> 02:19:10.100
Must I bite?

3014
02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.530
Yes, certainly, out of doubt

3015
02:19:11.530 --> 02:19:12.830
and out of question too

3016
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:14.630
and ambiguities.

3017
02:19:14.630 --> 02:19:18.870
By this leek, I will be most horribly revenged.

3018
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:22.100
I eat--I eat, I swear!

3019
02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:24.130
Eat, I pray you.

3020
02:19:24.130 --> 02:19:27.430
Will you have some more sauce to your leek?

3021
02:19:27.430 --> 02:19:30.600
I have another leek in my pocket.

3022
02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:32.770
There's not enough leek to swear by.

3023
02:19:32.770 --> 02:19:34.130
Quiet thy cudgel!

3024
02:19:34.130 --> 02:19:36.370
Thou dost see I eat.

3025
02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:38.600
Much good do you, heartily, scald knave.

3026
02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:41.370
Oh, no, throw none away.

3027
02:19:41.370 --> 02:19:44.400
The skin is good for your broken coxcomb.

3028
02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:47.930
God be wi' you and keep you

3029
02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:50.130
and heal your pate.

3030
02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:14.530
Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?

3031
02:20:14.530 --> 02:20:18.670
News have I that my Nell is dead i' the spital

3032
02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:21.370
of malady of France.

3033
02:20:21.370 --> 02:20:27.370
And there, my rendezvous is quite cut off.

3034
02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:32.200
Old I do wax.

3035
02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:38.030
And from my weary limbs, honor is cudgelled.

3036
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:45.000
Well, bawd I'll turn

3037
02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.570
and something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.

3038
02:20:49.570 --> 02:20:53.130
To England will I steal,

3039
02:20:53.130 --> 02:20:56.470
and there, I'll steal.

3040
02:20:56.470 --> 02:21:01.300
And patches will I get unto these scars,

3041
02:21:01.300 --> 02:21:05.430
and say I got them in the Gallia wars.

3042
02:21:05.430 --> 02:21:07.470
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3043
02:21:25.230 --> 02:21:28.100
Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met.

3044
02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:30.330
Unto our brother France and to our sister,

3045
02:21:30.330 --> 02:21:32.200
health and fair time of day.

3046
02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:34.200
Joy and good wishes

3047
02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:36.700
to our most fair and princely cousin Katharine.

3048
02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:40.370
And as a branch and member of this royalty

3049
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:42.670
by whom this great assembly is contrived,

3050
02:21:42.670 --> 02:21:46.470
we do salute you, Duke of Burgundy.

3051
02:21:46.470 --> 02:21:49.900
And princes French and peers, health to you all.

3052
02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:53.030
Right joyous are we to behold your face,

3053
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:54.630
most worthy brother England.

3054
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:56.330
Fairly met.

3055
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:59.430
And so are you, princes English, every one.

3056
02:22:01.870 --> 02:22:05.100
So happy be the issue, brother England,

3057
02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:07.930
of this good day and of this gracious meeting

3058
02:22:07.930 --> 02:22:11.930
as we are now glad to behold your eyes,

3059
02:22:11.930 --> 02:22:13.900
your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them

3060
02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:16.870
against the French that met them in their bent

3061
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:20.200
the fatal balls of murdering basilisks.

3062
02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.300
The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,

3063
02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:23.830
have lost their quality

3064
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:26.000
and that this day shall change

3065
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.030
all griefs and quarrels into love.

3066
02:22:28.030 --> 02:22:30.900
To cry amen to that, thus we appear.

3067
02:22:30.900 --> 02:22:33.330
You English princes all,

3068
02:22:33.330 --> 02:22:35.030
I do salute you.

3069
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:40.270
My duty to you both, on equal love,

3070
02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:42.870
great kings of France and England.

3071
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:44.130
That I have labored

3072
02:22:44.130 --> 02:22:47.130
with all my wits, my pains, and strong endeavors

3073
02:22:47.130 --> 02:22:49.400
to bring Your Most Imperial Majesties

3074
02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:52.030
unto this barand royal interview,

3075
02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:56.670
your mightiness on both parts best can witness.

3076
02:22:58.330 --> 02:23:02.030
Since then, my office hath so far prevailed

3077
02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:04.170
that, face to face and royal eye to eye,

3078
02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:05.830
you have congreeted,

3079
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:07.430
let it not disgrace me

3080
02:23:07.430 --> 02:23:11.000
if I demand, before this royal view,

3081
02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.830
what rub or what impediment there is,

3082
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:18.130
why that the naked, poor, and mangled peace--

3083
02:23:18.130 --> 02:23:22.970
dear nurse of arts, plenties, and joyful births--

3084
02:23:22.970 --> 02:23:26.700
should not in this best garden of the world,

3085
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:29.000
our fertile France,

3086
02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:32.270
put up her lovely visage?

3087
02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:37.230
Alas, from France, she hath too long been chased,

3088
02:23:37.230 --> 02:23:41.700
and all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,

3089
02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:46.170
corrupting in its own fertility.

3090
02:23:46.170 --> 02:23:48.600
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,

3091
02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:49.930
unpruned dies.

3092
02:23:49.930 --> 02:23:52.400
Her hedges even-pleached,

3093
02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:56.630
like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,

3094
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:59.600
put forth disordered twigs.

3095
02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:01.270
Her fallow leas,

3096
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:03.900
the darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory

3097
02:24:03.900 --> 02:24:05.170
doth root upon,

3098
02:24:05.170 --> 02:24:07.470
while that the coulter rusts

3099
02:24:07.470 --> 02:24:10.430
that should deracinate such savagery.

3100
02:24:12.730 --> 02:24:14.400
The even mead

3101
02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:17.770
that erst brought sweetly forth

3102
02:24:17.770 --> 02:24:20.570
the freckled cowslip, burnet, and green clover,

3103
02:24:20.570 --> 02:24:23.670
wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,

3104
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:26.600
conceives by idleness,

3105
02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:29.000
and nothing teems but hateful docks,

3106
02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.570
rough thistles, kexes, burs,

3107
02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:35.630
losing both beauty and utility.

3108
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:39.000
And as our vineyards, fallows, meads, and hedges,

3109
02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:42.330
defective in their natures, grow to wildness,

3110
02:24:42.330 --> 02:24:47.330
even so our houses and ourselves and children have lost

3111
02:24:47.330 --> 02:24:49.500
or do not learn for want of time

3112
02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:54.330
the sciences that should become our country

3113
02:24:54.330 --> 02:24:56.130
but grow like savages--

3114
02:24:56.130 --> 02:24:59.730
as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood--

3115
02:24:59.730 --> 02:25:05.500
to swearing and stern looks, diffused attire,

3116
02:25:05.500 --> 02:25:09.800
and everything that seems unnatural,

3117
02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:12.430
which to reduce into our former favor

3118
02:25:12.430 --> 02:25:14.500
you are assembled.

3119
02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:18.200
And my speech entreats that I may know the let,

3120
02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:20.470
why gentle peace

3121
02:25:20.470 --> 02:25:24.630
should not expel these inconveniences

3122
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:26.900
and bless us

3123
02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:29.530
with her former qualities.

3124
02:25:29.530 --> 02:25:32.370
If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,

3125
02:25:32.370 --> 02:25:33.600
whose want gives growth

3126
02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:35.700
to the imperfections which you have cited,

3127
02:25:35.700 --> 02:25:37.100
you must buy that peace

3128
02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:40.030
with full accord to all our just demands,

3129
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:41.700
whose tenors and particular effects

3130
02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.800
you have enscheduled briefly in your hands.

3131
02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:45.800
The king hath heard them.

3132
02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:49.170
To the which, as yet, there is no answer made.

3133
02:25:49.170 --> 02:25:50.400
Well, then, the peace,

3134
02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:52.430
which you before so urged,

3135
02:25:52.430 --> 02:25:53.970
lies in his answer.

3136
02:25:57.130 --> 02:26:00.270
I have but with a cursorary eye o'erglanced the articles.

3137
02:26:00.270 --> 02:26:02.030
Pleaseth Your Grace

3138
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:03.400
to appoint some of your council

3139
02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.270
presently to sit with us once more,

3140
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:07.570
with better heed to re-survey them,

3141
02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:09.900
and we will suddenly pass

3142
02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:12.470
our accept and peremptory answer.

3143
02:26:12.470 --> 02:26:13.570
Brother, we shall.

3144
02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:15.900
Go, Uncle Exeter and Brother Clarence

3145
02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:17.930
and you, Brother Gloucester and Warwick too.

3146
02:26:17.930 --> 02:26:19.330
Go with the king,

3147
02:26:19.330 --> 02:26:22.600
and take with you free power to ratify, augment, or alter

3148
02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:26.000
as your wisdoms best shall see advantagable for our dignity,

3149
02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.470
anything in or out of our demands,

3150
02:26:28.470 --> 02:26:29.830
and we'll consign thereto.

3151
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:05.330
Will you,

3152
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:06.970
fair sister,

3153
02:27:06.970 --> 02:27:10.330
go with the princes or stay here with us?

3154
02:27:10.330 --> 02:27:12.900
Our gracious brother, I will go with them.

3155
02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:15.570
Haply, a woman's voice may do some good

3156
02:27:15.570 --> 02:27:18.930
when articles too nicely urged be stood on.

3157
02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:24.430
Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us.

3158
02:27:24.430 --> 02:27:25.830
She is our capital demand,

3159
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:28.070
comprised within the fore-rank of our articles.

3160
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:30.030
She hath good leave.

3161
02:27:52.970 --> 02:27:56.230
Fair Katharine, and most fair,

3162
02:27:56.230 --> 02:27:59.400
will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier

3163
02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:02.170
terms such as will enter at a lady's ear

3164
02:28:02.170 --> 02:28:04.100
and plead his love suit

3165
02:28:04.100 --> 02:28:05.130
to her gentle heart?

3166
02:28:10.330 --> 02:28:13.330
Your Majesty shall at mock me.

3167
02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:15.370
I cannot speak your England.

3168
02:28:15.370 --> 02:28:16.630
Oh, fair Katharine,

3169
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:18.670
if you will love me soundly with your French heart,

3170
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:20.400
I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly

3171
02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:21.400
with your English tongue.

3172
02:28:26.370 --> 02:28:32.130
Do you like me, Kate?

3173
02:28:34.530 --> 02:28:38.630
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell what is "like me."

3174
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:40.500
An angel is like you, Kate,

3175
02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:43.630
and you are like an angel.

3176
02:28:45.370 --> 02:28:47.100
Que dit-il?

3177
02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:48.870
Que je suis semblable a les anges?

3178
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:51.870
Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.

3179
02:28:51.870 --> 02:28:52.900
I said so, dear Katharine,

3180
02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:54.270
and I must not blush to affirm it.

3181
02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:57.430
Oh, bon Dieu.

3182
02:28:57.430 --> 02:28:59.870
Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.

3183
02:28:59.870 --> 02:29:01.600
What says she, fair one?

3184
02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:04.000
That the tongues of men are full of deceits?

3185
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:08.400
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceit.

3186
02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:09.700
That is the princess.

3187
02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:12.000
The princess is the better Englishwoman.

3188
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.730
I' faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding.

3189
02:29:14.730 --> 02:29:16.700
I'm glad thou canst speak no better English,

3190
02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:17.800
for if thou couldst,

3191
02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:19.470
thou would find me such a plain king

3192
02:29:19.470 --> 02:29:20.930
thou would think I'd sold my farm

3193
02:29:20.930 --> 02:29:21.930
to buy my crown.

3194
02:29:26.070 --> 02:29:28.030
I know no ways to mince it in love

3195
02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:30.070
but directly to say, "I love you."

3196
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:33.070
Then if you urge me farther than to say, "Do you i' faith?"

3197
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:35.330
I wear out my suit.

3198
02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:36.330
Give me your answer.

3199
02:29:36.330 --> 02:29:37.330
I' faith, do.

3200
02:29:37.330 --> 02:29:39.630
And so clap hands and a bargain.

3201
02:29:39.630 --> 02:29:40.630
How say you, lady?

3202
02:29:44.330 --> 02:29:47.300
Sauf votre honneur, me understand well.

3203
02:29:51.230 --> 02:29:53.500
Marry, if you would put me to verses

3204
02:29:53.500 --> 02:29:56.270
or to dance for your sake, Kate,

3205
02:29:56.270 --> 02:29:58.800
why, you undid me.

3206
02:29:58.800 --> 02:30:01.770
For the one, I have neither words nor measure.

3207
02:30:01.770 --> 02:30:05.330
For the other, I have no strength in measure,

3208
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:07.070
yet a reasonable measure in strength.

3209
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:08.530
If I could win a lady at leapfrog

3210
02:30:08.530 --> 02:30:11.130
or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back,

3211
02:30:11.130 --> 02:30:13.170
under the correction of bragging be it spoke,

3212
02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:14.800
I should quickly leap into a wife.

3213
02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:17.370
Or if I might buffet for my love

3214
02:30:17.370 --> 02:30:19.130
or bound my horse for her favors,

3215
02:30:19.130 --> 02:30:21.270
I could lay on like a butcher,

3216
02:30:21.270 --> 02:30:25.630
sit like a jackanapes, never off.

3217
02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:26.830
But, before God, Kate,

3218
02:30:26.830 --> 02:30:28.830
I cannot look greenly

3219
02:30:28.830 --> 02:30:31.800
nor gasp out my eloquence,

3220
02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:33.530
nor I have no cunning in protestation,

3221
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:35.630
only downright oaths,

3222
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:38.930
which I never use till urged

3223
02:30:38.930 --> 02:30:40.630
nor never break for urging.

3224
02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:44.430
If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate,

3225
02:30:44.430 --> 02:30:46.070
whose face is not worth sunburning,

3226
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:47.270
who never looks in his glass

3227
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:49.030
for love of anything he sees there,

3228
02:30:49.030 --> 02:30:51.430
let thine eye be thy cook.

3229
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:59.030
I speak to thee plain soldier.

3230
02:30:59.030 --> 02:31:02.200
If thou canst love me for this, take me.

3231
02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:08.070
If not, to say to thee that I shall die is true.

3232
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:12.270
But for thy love, by the Lord, no.

3233
02:31:12.270 --> 02:31:14.300
And yet I love thee too.

3234
02:31:14.300 --> 02:31:16.270
Whilst thou livest, dear Kate,

3235
02:31:16.270 --> 02:31:18.670
take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy,

3236
02:31:18.670 --> 02:31:20.970
for he perforce must do thee right,

3237
02:31:20.970 --> 02:31:23.870
because he hath not the gift to woo in other places.

3238
02:31:23.870 --> 02:31:25.370
These fellows of infinite tongue

3239
02:31:25.370 --> 02:31:27.500
that can rhyme themselves into ladies' favors,

3240
02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:30.270
they do always reason themselves out again.

3241
02:31:30.270 --> 02:31:31.930
What?

3242
02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:34.170
A speaker is but a prater.

3243
02:31:34.170 --> 02:31:36.930
A rhyme is but a ballad.

3244
02:31:36.930 --> 02:31:38.930
A good leg will fall.

3245
02:31:38.930 --> 02:31:43.030
A straight back will stoop.

3246
02:31:43.030 --> 02:31:44.770
A black beard will turn white.

3247
02:31:44.770 --> 02:31:48.130
A curled pate will grow bald.

3248
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:49.800
A fair face will wither

3249
02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.570
and a full eye wax hollow,

3250
02:31:52.570 --> 02:31:54.400
but a good heart, Kate,

3251
02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:56.730
is the sun and moon--

3252
02:31:56.730 --> 02:31:59.030
or rather the sun and not the moon,

3253
02:31:59.030 --> 02:32:01.070
for it shines bright

3254
02:32:01.070 --> 02:32:02.970
and never changes

3255
02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:04.470
but keeps his course truly.

3256
02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:08.970
If thou would have such a one,

3257
02:32:08.970 --> 02:32:10.700
take me.

3258
02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:12.500
And take me, take a soldier.

3259
02:32:12.500 --> 02:32:14.830
Take a soldier, take a king.

3260
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:19.400
What sayest thou, then, to my love?

3261
02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:22.330
Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.

3262
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.970
Is it possible dat I should love de enemy of France?

3263
02:32:37.970 --> 02:32:39.200
No, it is not possible

3264
02:32:39.200 --> 02:32:41.300
that you should love the enemy of France, Kate.

3265
02:32:41.300 --> 02:32:42.330
But in loving me,

3266
02:32:42.330 --> 02:32:44.000
you should love the friend of France,

3267
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.430
for I love France so well,

3268
02:32:45.430 --> 02:32:47.000
I will not part with a village of it.

3269
02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.230
I will have it all mine.

3270
02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:52.370
Kate, when France is mine

3271
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:54.070
and I am yours,

3272
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:56.830
then yours is France, and you are mine.

3273
02:32:58.130 --> 02:32:59.930
I cannot tell what is dat.

3274
02:32:59.930 --> 02:33:03.400
No, Kate.

3275
02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:05.370
I will tell thee in French,

3276
02:33:05.370 --> 02:33:07.100
which I am sure will hang upon my tongue

3277
02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:09.370
as a newly married wife about her husband's neck,

3278
02:33:09.370 --> 02:33:13.430
hardly to be shook off.

3279
02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:14.430
Je...

3280
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:18.970
quand sur le possession de France...

3281
02:33:18.970 --> 02:33:21.400
et quand vous avez le possession de moi--

3282
02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:28.100
Let me see, what then?

3283
02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:30.000
Saint Denis be my speed.

3284
02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:35.770
Donc votre est France et vous etes mienne.

3285
02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:39.530
It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom

3286
02:33:39.530 --> 02:33:40.900
as to speak so much more French.

3287
02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:42.670
I shall never move thee in French, Kate,

3288
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:44.630
unless it be to laugh at me.

3289
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:47.000
But dost thou understand thus much English?

3290
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.870
Canst thou love me?

3291
02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:52.330
I cannot tell.

3292
02:33:52.330 --> 02:33:54.700
Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate?

3293
02:33:54.700 --> 02:33:55.700
I'll ask them.

3294
02:33:55.700 --> 02:33:59.300
Come, I know thou lovest me.

3295
02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:01.330
And at night, when you come into your closet,

3296
02:34:01.330 --> 02:34:03.300
you'll question this gentlewoman about me.

3297
02:34:03.300 --> 02:34:05.530
And I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise

3298
02:34:05.530 --> 02:34:08.770
those parts in me you love with your heart.

3299
02:34:08.770 --> 02:34:10.670
But, good Kate, mock me mercifully.

3300
02:34:10.670 --> 02:34:14.700
The rather, gentle princess, because I love thee cruelly.

3301
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:18.330
If ever thou beest mine,

3302
02:34:18.330 --> 02:34:21.730
as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt,

3303
02:34:21.730 --> 02:34:24.300
I get thee with scambling,

3304
02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:26.730
and thou must therefore needs prove

3305
02:34:26.730 --> 02:34:29.000
a good soldier breeder.

3306
02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.300
Shall not thou and I,

3307
02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:32.100
between Saint Denis and Saint George,

3308
02:34:32.100 --> 02:34:34.970
compound a boy, half French, half English,

3309
02:34:34.970 --> 02:34:37.570
who'll go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?

3310
02:34:37.570 --> 02:34:39.100
Shall we not?

3311
02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:43.470
What sayest thou, my fair flower-de-luce?

3312
02:34:43.470 --> 02:34:45.000
I do not know dat.

3313
02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:51.870
No, 'tis hereafter to know but now to promise.

3314
02:34:51.870 --> 02:34:53.900
Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor

3315
02:34:53.900 --> 02:34:56.400
for your French part of such a boy.

3316
02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.930
And for my English moiety,

3317
02:34:57.930 --> 02:35:01.770
take the word of a king and a bachelor.

3318
02:35:01.770 --> 02:35:03.770
How answer you,

3319
02:35:03.770 --> 02:35:07.200
la plus belle Katherine du monde,

3320
02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:10.770
mon tres cher et divin deesse?

3321
02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:17.970
Your Majestee have false French enough

3322
02:35:17.970 --> 02:35:20.170
to deceive de most sage damoiselle

3323
02:35:20.170 --> 02:35:21.600
dat is en France.

3324
02:35:21.600 --> 02:35:22.970
Now, fie upon my false French.

3325
02:35:22.970 --> 02:35:27.530
By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate.

3326
02:35:27.530 --> 02:35:29.600
By which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me,

3327
02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.800
yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost.

3328
02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.770
Therefore tell me, most fair Katharine,

3329
02:35:37.770 --> 02:35:39.770
will you have me?

3330
02:35:42.470 --> 02:35:44.130
Put off your maiden blushes.

3331
02:35:44.130 --> 02:35:45.870
Avouch the thoughts of your heart

3332
02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:47.570
with the looks of an empress.

3333
02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:48.730
Take me by the hand,

3334
02:35:48.730 --> 02:35:51.370
and say, "Harry of England, I am thine,"

3335
02:35:51.370 --> 02:35:54.330
which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal,

3336
02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:56.030
but I shall tell thee aloud,

3337
02:35:57.030 --> 02:36:00.130
"England is thine,

3338
02:36:00.130 --> 02:36:03.270
"Ireland is thine,

3339
02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:05.700
"France is thine,

3340
02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:09.600
and Henry Plantagenet is thine."

3341
02:36:13.930 --> 02:36:15.430
Though I speak it before his face,

3342
02:36:15.430 --> 02:36:17.430
if he be not fellow with the best king,

3343
02:36:17.430 --> 02:36:19.770
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.

3344
02:36:19.770 --> 02:36:23.770
Come, your answer in broken music,

3345
02:36:23.770 --> 02:36:28.630
for thy voice is music and thy English broken.

3346
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:30.570
Therefore, queen of all, Katharine,

3347
02:36:30.570 --> 02:36:33.930
break thy mind to me in broken English.

3348
02:36:33.930 --> 02:36:35.700
Wilt thou have me?

3349
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:40.670
That is as it shall please de roi mon pere.

3350
02:36:40.670 --> 02:36:43.800
Nay, it will please him well, Kate.

3351
02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:45.600
It shall please him, Kate.

3352
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:51.130
Den it shall also content me.

3353
02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:56.170
Upon that, I kiss your hand and call you my queen.

3354
02:36:56.170 --> 02:36:58.500
Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez!

3355
02:37:05.170 --> 02:37:06.900
Ma foi, je ne veux point

3356
02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:09.300
que vous abaissez votre grandeur en baisant la main

3357
02:37:09.300 --> 02:37:14.770
d'une de votre seigeurie indigne serviteur.

3358
02:37:14.770 --> 02:37:16.500
Excusez-moi,

3359
02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:17.930
je vous supplie,

3360
02:37:17.930 --> 02:37:19.230
mon tres-puissant seigneur.

3361
02:37:19.230 --> 02:37:20.700
Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.

3362
02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:21.800
Les dames et demoiselles

3363
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:23.470
pour etre baisees devant leur noces,

3364
02:37:23.470 --> 02:37:24.970
il n'est pas la coutume de France.

3365
02:37:24.970 --> 02:37:27.030
Madame my interpreter, what says she?

3366
02:37:27.030 --> 02:37:29.900
Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of France--

3367
02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:32.100
I cannot tell what is baiser en Anglish.

3368
02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:33.200
To kiss.

3369
02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:35.700
Your Majestee entendre bettre que moi.

3370
02:37:35.700 --> 02:37:37.370
It is not a fashion for the maids in France

3371
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:39.270
to kiss before they are married, would she say?

3372
02:37:39.270 --> 02:37:43.130
Oui, vraiment.

3373
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:49.270
Oh, Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.

3374
02:37:49.270 --> 02:37:50.370
Dear Kate, you and I

3375
02:37:50.370 --> 02:37:52.130
cannot be confined within the weak list

3376
02:37:52.130 --> 02:37:54.070
of a country's fashion.

3377
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:57.000
We are the makers of manners, Kate.

3378
02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.700
The liberty that follows our places

3379
02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:01.000
stops the mouth of all findfaults...

3380
02:38:03.130 --> 02:38:04.300
as I will do yours

3381
02:38:04.300 --> 02:38:06.900
for upholding the nice fashion of your country

3382
02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:08.670
in denying me a kiss.

3383
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:15.800
Therefore, patiently and yielding.

3384
02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:27.930
You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate.

3385
02:38:27.930 --> 02:38:30.200
There is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them

3386
02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:32.670
than in the tongues of the French council.

3387
02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:34.870
And they should sooner persuade Henry of England

3388
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:37.370
than a general petition of monarchs.

3389
02:38:40.570 --> 02:38:42.030
Here comes your father.

3390
02:38:43.470 --> 02:38:45.800
God save Your Majesty.

3391
02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:50.570
My royal cousin, teach you our princess English?

3392
02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:52.900
I would have her learn, my fair cousin,

3393
02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:55.170
how perfectly I love her.

3394
02:38:55.170 --> 02:38:59.170
And that is good English.

3395
02:38:59.170 --> 02:39:02.470
We have consented to all terms of reason.

3396
02:39:02.470 --> 02:39:04.070
Is't so, my lords of England?

3397
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:06.700
The king hath granted every article.

3398
02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:10.130
His daughter first and then in sequel all

3399
02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:13.430
according to their firm proposed natures.

3400
02:39:13.430 --> 02:39:15.930
Take her, fair son,

3401
02:39:15.930 --> 02:39:18.200
and from her blood,

3402
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.400
raise up issue to me

3403
02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:23.500
that the contending kingdoms of France and England,

3404
02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:26.130
whose very shores look pale with envy

3405
02:39:26.130 --> 02:39:27.800
of each other's happiness,

3406
02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:30.230
may cease their hatred.

3407
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:33.830
And this dear conjunction

3408
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:37.900
plant neighborhood and Christian-like accord

3409
02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.570
in their sweet bosoms,

3410
02:39:39.570 --> 02:39:43.900
that never war advance his bleeding sword

3411
02:39:43.900 --> 02:39:44.900
'twixt England

3412
02:39:46.930 --> 02:39:48.430
and fair France.

3413
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:51.470
Amen.

3414
02:39:51.470 --> 02:39:53.100
Now, welcome, Kate.

3415
02:39:53.100 --> 02:39:55.030
And bear me witness all,

3416
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:57.930
that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.

3417
02:40:02.930 --> 02:40:05.370
God, the best maker of all marriages,

3418
02:40:05.370 --> 02:40:09.230
combine your hearts in one, your realms in one.

3419
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:12.170
As man and wife, being two, are one in love,

3420
02:40:12.170 --> 02:40:15.400
so be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal

3421
02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:18.070
that never may ill office or fell jealousy,

3422
02:40:18.070 --> 02:40:20.570
which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,

3423
02:40:20.570 --> 02:40:23.200
thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms

3424
02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:26.200
to make divorce of their incorporate league,

3425
02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:29.370
that English may as French, French Englishmen,

3426
02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:31.570
receive each other.

3427
02:40:31.570 --> 02:40:33.530
God speak this Amen.

3428
02:40:33.530 --> 02:40:35.530
Amen.

3429
02:40:35.530 --> 02:40:37.530
Prepare we for our marriage,

3430
02:40:37.530 --> 02:40:39.470
on which day, my Lord of Burgundy,

3431
02:40:39.470 --> 02:40:41.230
we'll take your oath,

3432
02:40:41.230 --> 02:40:44.170
and all the peers', for surety of our leagues.

3433
02:40:44.170 --> 02:40:46.330
Then shall I swear to Kate

3434
02:40:46.330 --> 02:40:48.500
and you to me.

3435
02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:52.200
And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be.

3436
02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:18.170
Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,

3437
02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:20.930
our bending author hath pursued the story,

3438
02:41:20.930 --> 02:41:25.470
in little room confining mighty men,

3439
02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:29.200
mangling by starts the full course of their glory.

3440
02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:30.630
Small time,

3441
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:31.930
but in that small,

3442
02:41:31.930 --> 02:41:35.570
most greatly lived this star of England.

3443
02:41:35.570 --> 02:41:37.230
Fortune made his sword,

3444
02:41:37.230 --> 02:41:40.230
by which the world's best garden he achieved

3445
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:42.700
and of it left his son imperial lord.

3446
02:41:42.700 --> 02:41:44.930
Henry VI, in infant bands

3447

crowned King Of France and England,

3448
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:49.070

whose state so many had the managing

3450
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:55.700
that they lost France and made his England bleed,

3451
02:41:55.700 --> 02:41:58.730
which oft our stage hath shown,

3452
02:41:58.730 --> 02:42:00.630
and for their sake,

3453
02:42:00.630 --> 02:42:02.600
