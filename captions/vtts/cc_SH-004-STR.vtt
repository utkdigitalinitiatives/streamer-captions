00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:15.570


2
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.400
Old John of Gaunt,

3
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100
time-honored Lancaster,

4
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.070
hast thou, according tothy oath and band,

5
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.670
brought hither HenryHereford, thy bold son,

6
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.130
here to make good theboisterous late appeal,

7
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.970
which then our leisurewould not let us hear,

8
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.700
against the duke ofNorfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

9
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.870
I have, my liege.

10
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.000
Tell me, moreover, hastthou sounded him

11
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.570
if he appeal the duke onancient malice,

12
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.100
or worthily, as a goodsubject should,

13
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.030
on some known ground oftreachery in him?

14
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.870
As near as I could sifthim on that argument,

15
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.870
on some apparent dangerseen in him aimed atYour Highness.

16
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.500
No inveterate malice.

17
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.300
Then call them to ourpresence.

18
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.100
Face to face and frowningbrow to brow,

19
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.070
ourselves will hear theaccuser and the accusedfreely speak.

20
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.670
High-stomached are theyboth and full of ire,

21
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.770
in rage deaf as the sea,hasty as fire.

22
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.900
Many years of happy daysbefall my gracious sovereign,

23
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.300
my most loving liege.

24
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.400
Each day still betterother's happiness

25
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.470
until the heavens, envyingearth's good hap,

26
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.570
add an immortal title toyour crown.

27
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.400
We thank you both.

28
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.830
Yet one but flatters us,as well appeareth by thecause you come,

29
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.570
namely to appeal eachother of high treason.

30
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.300
Cousin of Hereford, whatdost thou object

31
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.400
against the duke ofNorfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

32
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.200
First, heaven be therecord to my speech.

33
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.770
In the devotion of asubject's love,

34
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.200
tendering the precioussafety of my prince

35
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.470
and free from othermisbegotten hate,

36
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.230
come I appellant to thisprincely presence.

37
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.630
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do Iturn to thee,

38
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.170
and mark my greeting well,

39
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.070
for what I speak my body shallmake good upon this earth

40
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.730
or my divine soul answerit in heaven.

41
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.830
Thou art a traitor and amiscreant,

42
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.130
too good to be so and toobad to live,

43
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.470
since the more fair andcrystal is the sky,

44
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.030
the uglier seem the cloudsthat in it fly.

45
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.170
Once more, the more toaggravate the note,

46
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.170
with a foul traitor's namestuff I thy throat

47
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.970
and wish, so please mysovereign, ere I move,

48
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.370
what my tongue speaks myright drawn sword may prove.

49
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.730
Let not my cold words hereaccuse my zeal.

50
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.530
'Tis not the trial of awoman's war.

51
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.130
The bitter clamor of twoeager tongues

52
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.430
can arbitrate this causebetwixt us twain.

53
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.230
The blood is hot that mustbe cooled for this,

54
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.070
yet can I not of such tamepatience boast

55
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.000
as to be hushed and naughtat all to say.

56
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.670
First, the fair reverenceof Your Highness curbs me

57
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.070
from giving reins andspurs to my free speech,

58
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.970
which else would postuntil it had returned

59
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.430
these terms of treasondoubled down his throat.

60
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.430
Setting aside his highblood's royalty

61
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.970
and let him be no kinsmanto my liege,

62
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.130
I do defy him, and I spitat him,

63
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.730
call him a slanderouscoward and a villain,

64
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.470
which to maintain I wouldallow him odds and meet him

65
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.200
were I tied to run afooteven to the frozen ridgesof the Alps

66
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.970
or any other groundinhabitable,

67
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.830
wherever Englishman durstset his foot.

68
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.730
Meantime let this defendmy loyalty.

69
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.770
By all my hopes, mostfalsely doth he lie.

70
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.770
Pale, trembling coward,

71
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.130
there I throw my gage,

72
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.000
disclaiming here thekindred of the king,

73
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.600
and lay aside my highblood's royalty,

74
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.570
which fear, not reverence,makes thee to except.

75
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.730
If guilty dread have leftthee so much strength

76
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.530
as to take up minehonor's pawn,

77
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.170
then stoop.

78
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.870
By that and all the ritesof knighthood else

79
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.400
will I make good againstthee,

80
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.230
arm to arm, what I havespoke,

81
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.470
or thou canst worsedevise.

82
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.100
I take it up, and by thatsword

83
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.500
I swear which gently laid myknighthood on my shoulder,

84
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.600
I'll answer thee in anyfair degree

85
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.230
or chivalrous design ofknightly trial.

86
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.570
And when I mount, alivemay I not light

87
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.230
if I be traitor orunjustly fight.

88
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.930
What doth our cousin layto Mowbray's charge?

89
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.700
It must be great that caninherit us so much

90
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.330
as of a thought of ill inhim.

91
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
Look what I speak.

92
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.830
My life shall prove ittrue

93
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.870
that Mowbray hath received8,000 nobles

94
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.870
in name of lendings forYour Highness' soldiers,

95
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.670
the which he hath detainedfor lewd employments

96
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.100
like a false traitor andinjurious villain.

97
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.230
Besides I say and will inbattle prove or here orelsewhere

98
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.970
to the furthest verge thatever was surveyed byEnglish eye,

99
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.000
that all the treasons forthese 18 years

100
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.300
complotted and contrivedin this land

101
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.600
fetch from false Mowbraytheir first head and spring.

102
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.930
Further I say and furtherwill maintain

103
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.070
upon his bad life to makeall this good,

104
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.530
that he did plot the dukeof Gloucester's death,

105
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
suggest his soon-believingadversaries,

106
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.800
and consequently, like atraitor coward,

107
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.170
sluiced out his innocentsoul with streams of blood,

108
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.330
which blood, likesacrificing Abel's,

109
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.100
cries even from the tonguelesscaverns of the earth

110
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.900
to me for justice andrough chastisement.

111
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.400
And, by the glorious worthof my descent,

112
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.670
this arm shall do it orthis life be spent.

113
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.470
How high a pitch hisresolution soars.

114
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.330
Thomas of Norfolk, whatsay'st thou to this?

115
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.000
Oh, let my sovereign turnaway his face

116
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.970
and let his ears a littlewhile be deaf

117
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.170
till I have told thisslander of his blood

118
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.970
how God and good men hateso foul a liar.

119
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.000
Mowbray, impartial are oureyes and ears

120
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.430
were he my brother-- nay,my kingdom's heir.

121
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.630
As he is but my father'sbrother's son,

122
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.030
now, by my scepter's awe,I make a vow.

123
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.570
Such neighbor nearness toour sacred blood

124
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.070
should nothing privilegehim

125
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.100
nor partialize theunstooping firmness of myupright soul.

126
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.570
He is our subject,Mowbray.

127
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.070
So art thou.

128
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.070
Free speech and fearless Ito thee allow.

129
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.130
Then, Bolingbroke, as lowas to thy heart,

130
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.300
through the false passageof thy throat, thou liest.

131
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.770
Three parts of thatreceipt I had for Calais

132
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.570
disbursed I duly to HisHighness' soldiers.

133
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.500
The other part reserved Iby consent,

134
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.830
for that my sovereignliege

135
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.170
was in my debt uponremainder of a dear account,

136
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.800
since last I went toFrance to fetch his queen.

137
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.700
Now swallow down that lie.

138
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.270
For Gloucester's death, Islew him not,

139
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.800
but to my own disgraceneglected my sworn duty inthat case.

140
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.800
For you, my noble lord ofLancaster,

141
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.300
the honorable father to myfoe,

142
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.070
once did I lay an ambushfor your life,

143
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.230
a trespass that doth vexmy grieved soul.

144
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.030
But ere I last receivedthe sacrament, I didconfess it

145
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.770
and exactly begged YourGrace's pardon,

146
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.570
and I hope I had it.

147
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.370
This is my fault.

148
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.700
As for the rest appealed,

149
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.830
it issues from the rancorof a villain,

150
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.270
a recreant and mostdegenerate traitor,

151
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.070
which in myself I boldlywill defend

152
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.930
and interchangeably hurldown my gage

153
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.870
upon this overweeningtraitor's foot

154
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.770
to prove myself a loyalgentleman

155
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.870
even in the best bloodchambered in his bosom.

156
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.330
In haste whereof,

157
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.900
most heartily I pray YourHighness

158
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.500
to assign our trial day.

159
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.470
Wrath-kindled gentlemen,be ruled by me.

160
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.870
Let's purge this cholerwithout letting blood.

161
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.070
This we prescribe, thoughno physician.

162
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.170
Deep malice makes too deepincision.

163
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.870
Forget, forgive, conclude,and be agreed.

164
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.530
Our doctors say this is nomonth to bleed.

165
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.300
Good Uncle, let this endwhere it begun.

166
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.400
We'll calm the duke ofNorfolk, you your son.

167
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.070
To be a make-peace shallbecome my age.

168
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.430
Throw down, my son, theduke of Norfolk's gage.

169
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.730
And, Norfolk, throwdown his.

170
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.470
When, Harry, when?

171
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.400
Obedience bids I shouldnot bid again.

172
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.830
Norfolk, throw down, webid.

173
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.370
There is no boot.

174
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.300
Myself I throw, dreadsovereign, at thy foot.

175
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.200
My life thou shaltcommand, but not my shame.

176
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.570
The one my duty owes,

177
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.630
but my fair name,

178
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.730
despite of death thatlives upon my grave,

179
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.600
to dark dishonor's usethou shalt not have.

180
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.070
I am disgraced, impeached,and baffled here,

181
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.570
pierced to the soul withslander's venomed spear,

182
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.070
the which no balm can cure

183
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.730
but his heart blood whichbreathed this poison.

184
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.070
Rage must be withstood.

185
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.270
Give me his gage.

186
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.170
Lions make leopards tame.

187
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.200
Yea, but not change hisspots.

188
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.470
Take but my shame and Iresign my gage.

189
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.870
My dear, dear lord,

190
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.530
the purest treasure mortaltimes afford is spotlessreputation.

191
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:51.030
That away, men are butgilded loam or painted clay.

192
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.630
A jewel in a ten-timesbarred up chest

193
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.470
is a bold spirit in aloyal breast.

194
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.730
Mine honor is my life.

195
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.900
Both grow in one.

196
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.500
Take honor from me, and mylife is done.

197
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.870
Then, dear my liege, minehonor let me try.

198
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.170
In that I live, and forthat will I die.

199
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.770
Cousin, throw up yourgage.

200
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.430
Do you begin.

201
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.730
Oh, God, defend my soulfrom such deep sin.

202
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.200
Shall I seem crestfallenin my father's sight?

203
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.400
Or with pale beggar fearimpeach my height

204
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.000
before this outdareddastard?

205
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.800
Ere my tongue shall wound myhonor with such feeble wrong

206
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.030
or sound so base a parle,

207
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.930
my teeth shall tear theslavish motive ofrecanting fear

208
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.400
and spit it bleeding inhis high disgrace,

209
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.270
where shame doth harbor,even in Mowbray's face.

210
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.470
We were not born to suebut to command.

211
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.400
Since which we cannot doto make you friends,

212
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.000
be ready, as your livesshall answer it,

213
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.770
at Coventry upon SaintLambert's day.

214
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.030
There shall your swordsand lances arbitrate

215
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.470
the swelling difference ofyour settled hate.

216
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.600
Since we can not atoneyou,

217
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.130
we shall see justice designthe victor's chivalry.

218
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.400
Lord marshal, command ourofficers at arms.

219
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.430
Be ready to direct thesehome alarms.

220
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.170
Alas, the part I had inGloucester's blood

221
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.200
doth more solicit me thanyour exclaims

222
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.670
to stir against thebutchers of his life.

223
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.300
But since correction lieth

224
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.970
in those hands which madethe fault which we cannotcorrect,

225
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.470
put we our quarrel to thewill of heaven,

226
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.900
who, when they see thehours ripe on earth,

227
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.900
will rain hot vengeance onoffenders' heads.

228
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.930
Finds brotherhood in theeno sharper spur?

229
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.730
Hath love in thy old bloodno living fire?

230
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.300
Edward's seven sons,whereof thyself art one,

231
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.030
were as seven vials of hissacred blood

232
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.000
or seven fair branchesspringing from one root.

233
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.600
Some of those seven aredried by nature's course,

234
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.170
some of those branches bythe destinies cut.

235
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.800
But Thomas, my dear lord,my life, my Gloucester,

236
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.570
one vial full of Edward'ssacred blood,

237
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.270
one flourishing branch ofhis most royal root,

238
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.800
is cracked,

239
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.030
and all the precious liquorspilt is hacked down

240
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.000
and his summer leaves allfaded

241
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.530
by envy's hand andmurder's bloody axe.

242
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.900
Ah, Gaunt,

243
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.800
his blood was thine.

244
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.100
That bed, that womb, thatmetal, that self-mold

245
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.270
that fashioned thee madehim a man.

246
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.530
And though thou livest andbreathest,

247
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.100
yet art thou slain in him.

248
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.670
Thou dost consent in somelarge measure to thyfather's death

249
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.170
in that thou seest thywretched brother die,

250
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.270
who was the model of thyfather's life.

251
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.230
Call it not patience,Gaunt.

252
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.270
It is despair.

253
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.470
In suffering thus thybrother to be slaughtered,

254
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.970
thou showest the nakedpathway to thy life,

255
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.570
teaching stern murder howto butcher thee.

256
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.800
That which in mean men weentitle patience

257
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.670
is pale cold cowardice innoble breasts.

258
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.470
What shall I say?

259
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.630
To safeguard thine ownlife,

260
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.500
the best way is to vengemy Gloucester's death.

261
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.130
God's is the quarrel,

262
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.830
for God's substitute, hisdeputy anointed in Hissight,

263
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.200
hath caused his death,

264
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.270
the which if wrongfully,let heaven revenge,

265
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.270
for I may never lift anangry arm against Hisminister.

266
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.630
Where then, alas, may Icomplain myself?

267
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.370
To God, the widow'schampion and defense.

268
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.600
Why, then, I will.

269
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.030
Farewell, old Gaunt.

270
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.370
Thou goest to Coventry,

271
00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.070
there to behold ourcousin Hereford and fellMowbray fight.

272
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.500
Oh, sit my husband'swrongs on Hereford's spear

273
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.030
that they may enterbutcher Mowbray's breast.

274
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.070
Or, if misfortune miss thefirst career,

275
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.230
be Mowbray's sins so heavyin his bosom

276
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.800
that they may break hisfoaming courser's back

277
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.600
and throw the riderheadlong in the lists,

278
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.300
a caitiff recreant to mycousin Hereford.

279
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.670
Farewell, old Gaunt.

280
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.470
Thy sometimes brother'swife

281
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.530
with her companion griefmust end her life.

282
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.870
Sister, farewell.

283
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.800
I must to Coventry.

284
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.830
As much good stay withthee as go with me.

285
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.530
Yet one word more.

286
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.200
Grief boundeth where itfalls

287
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.430
not with the emptyhollowness but weight.

288
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.270
I take my leave before Ihave begun,

289
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.500
for sorrow ends not whenit seemeth done.

290
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.370
Commend me to thy brother,Edmund York.

291
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.530
Lo, this is all.

292
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.730
Nay, yet depart not so.

293
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.770
Though this be all, do notso quickly go.

294
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.870
I shall remember more.

295
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.970
Bid him--

296
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.700
ah, what?

297
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.470
With all good speed atPlashy visit me.

298
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.000
Alack, and what shall goodold York there see

299
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.630
but empty lodgings andunfurnished walls,

300
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.670
unpeopled offices,untrodden stones?

301
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.730
And what hear there forwelcome but my groans?

302
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.900
Therefore commend me.

303
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.970
Let him not come there

304
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.830
to seek out sorrow thatdwells everywhere.

305
00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:01.100
Desolate, desolate, will Ihence and die.

306
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.330
The last leave of theetakes my weeping eye.

307
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.600
My Lord Aumerle, is HarryHereford armed?

308
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.670
Yea, at all points andlongs to enter in.

309
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.830
The duke of Norfolk,sprightfully and bold,

310
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.530
stays but the summons ofthe appellant's trumpet.

311
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.700
Why, then, the championsare prepared

312
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.970

313

for Mowbray and myself

358
00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.830
are like two men that vowa long and wearypilgrimage.

359
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.630
Then let us take aceremonious leave

360

Farewell, my blood, whichif today thou shed,

367
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.670
lament we may, but notrevenge thee dead.

368
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.000
Oh, let no noble eyeprofane a tear for me

369
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.700
if I be gored withMowbray's spear.

370
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.630
As confident as is thefalcon's flight against a bird

371
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.100
do I with Mowbray fight.

372
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.470
My loving lord, I take myleave of you;

373
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.400
of you, my noble cousin,Lord Aumerle.

374
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.470
Not sick, although I haveto do with death,

375
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.570
but lusty, young, andcheerly drawing breath.

376
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.230
Lo, as at English feasts,

377
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:15.670
so I regreet the daintiestlast to make the end mostsweet.

378
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.500
Oh, thou, the earthlyauthor of my blood,

381
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.930
to reach at victory abovemy head.

382
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.530
Add proof unto mine armorwith thy prayers,

383
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.770
and with thy blessingssteel my lance's point

384
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.230
that it may enterMowbray's waxen coat

385
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.000
and furbish new the nameof John a Gaunt,

386
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.230
even in the lusty haviorof his son.

387
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.200
God in thy good cause makethee prosperous.

388
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.270
Be swift like lightning inthe execution

389
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.500
and let thy blows, doublyredoubled,

390
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.330
fall like amazing thunder

391
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.470
on the casque of thyadverse pernicious enemy.

392
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.530
Rouse up thy youthfulblood.

393
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.800

395
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.700
However God or fortune castmy lot, there lives or dies,

396
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.300
true to King Richard'sthrone,

397
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.670
a loyal, just, and uprightgentleman.

398
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.770
Never did captive with afreer heart

399
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.270
cast off his chains ofbondage

400
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.630
and embrace his goldenuncontrolled enfranchisement

401
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.470
more than my dancing souldoth celebrate

402
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.300
this feast of battle withmine adversary.

403
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.570
Most mighty liege and mycompanion peers,

404
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.130
take from my mouth thewish of happy years.

405
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.970
As gentle and as jocund asto jest go I to fight.

406
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.470
Truth hath a quiet breast.

407
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.230
Farewell, my lord.

408
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.930
Securely I espy virtuewith valor couched inthine eye.

409
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.600
Order the trial, marshal,and begin.

410
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.900

Go bear this lance toThomas, duke of Norfolk.

414

stands here for God, hissovereign, and himself,

416
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.030
on pain to be found falseand recreant,

417
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.330
to prove the duke ofNorfolk, Thomas Mowbray

418
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.870
a traitor to his God, hisking, and him,

419
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.870
and dares him to setforward to the fight.

420
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.470
Here standeth ThomasMowbray, duke of Norfolk,

421
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.000
on pain to be found falseand recreant,

422
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.270
both to defend himself

423
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.930
and to approve Henry ofHereford, Lancaster, and Derby

424
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.370
to God, his sovereign, andto him disloyal,

425
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.400
courageously and with afree desire,

426
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.730
attending but the signalto begin.

427
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.630
Sound trumpets and setforward, combatants.

428
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.670
Stay!

429
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.600
The king hath thrown hiswarder down.

430
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.370
Let them lay by theirhelmets and their spears

431
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.400
and both return back totheir chairs again.

432
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.470
Withdraw with us.

433
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.900
And let the trumpets sound

434
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.070
while we return thesedukes what we decree.

435
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.470
Draw near

436
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.300
and list what with ourcouncil we have done.

437
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.530
For that our kingdom'searth should not be soiled

438
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.000
with that dear blood whichit hath fostered,

439
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.970
and for our eyes do hatethe dire aspect

440
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.200
of civil wounds ploughedup with neighbors' sword,

441
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.300
and for we think the eaglewinged pride

442
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.130
of sky aspiring andambitious thoughts,

443
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.300
with rival hating envy, seton you to wake our peace--

444
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.630
which in our country'scradle

445
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.270
draws the sweet infantbreath of gentle sleep--

446
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.000
which so roused up withboisterous, untuned drums,

447
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.730
with harsh resoundingtrumpets' dreadful bray

448
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.370
and grating shock ofwrathful iron arms,

449
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.870
might from our quietconfines fright fair peace

450
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.770
and make us wade even inour kindred's blood.

451
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.000
Therefore, we banish youour territories.

452
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.430
You, cousin Hereford, uponpain of life,

453
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.970
till twice five summershave enriched our fields

454
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.930
shall not regreet our fairdominions

455
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.300
but tread the strangerpaths of banishment.

456
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.130
Thy will be done.

457
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.330
This must my comfort be:

458
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.400
that sun that warms youhere shall shine on me,

459
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.530
and those his golden beamsto you here lent

460
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.430
shall point on me and gildmy banishment.

461
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.770
Norfolk, for thee remainsa heavier doom,

462
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.500
which I with someunwillingness pronounce.

463
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.730
The sly, slow hours shallnot determinate

464
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.430
the dateless limit of thydear exile.

465
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.370
The hopeless word of"never to return"

466
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.730
breathe I against thee,upon pain of life.

467
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.300
A heavy sentence, my mostsovereign liege,

468
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.230
and all unlooked for fromYour Highness' mouth.

469
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.570
A dearer merit,

470
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.570
not so deep a maim as tobe cast forth in thecommon air,

471
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.800
have I deserved at YourHighness' hands.

472
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.970
The language I havelearned these 40 years,

473
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.730
my native English, now Imust forego.

474
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.800
And now my tongue's use

475
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.370
is to me no more than anunstringed viol or a harp

476
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.400
or like a cunninginstrument cased up or,being open,

477
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.730
put into his hands thatknows no touch to tune theharmony.

478
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.530
Within my mouth you haveenjailed my tongue,

479
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.730
doubly portcullised withmy teeth and lips,

480
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.870
and dull, unfeeling,barren ignorance

481
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.900
is made my jailer toattend on me.

482
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.200
I am too old to fawn upona nurse,

483
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.070
too far in years to be apupil now.

484
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.230
What is thy sentence thenbut speechless death,

485
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.970
which robs my tongue frombreathing native breath?

486
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.270
It boots thee not to becompassionate.

487
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.500
After our sentence,plaining comes too late.

488
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.570
Then thus I turn me frommy country's light

489
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.500
to dwell in solemn shadesof endless night.

490
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.300
Return again,

491
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.800
and take an oath withthee.

492
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.700
Lay on our royal swordyour banished hands.

493
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.830
Swear by the duty that youowe to God--

494
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.000
our part therein we banishwith yourselves--

495
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.270
to keep the oath that weadminister.

496
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.830
You never shall, so helpyou truth and God,

497
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.130
embrace each other's lovein banishment;

498
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.600
nor never look upon eachother's face;

499
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.030
nor never write, regreet,nor reconcile

500
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.300
this louring tempest ofyour homebred hate;

501
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.830
nor never by advisedpurpose meet

502
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.170
to plot, contrive, orcomplot any ill

503
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.770
against us, our state, oursubjects, or our land.

504
00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.970
I swear.

505
00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.830
And I, to keep all this.

506
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.730
Norfolk, so far as to mineenemy,

507
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.570
by this time, had the kingpermitted us,

508
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.100
one of our souls hadwandered in the air,

509
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.830
banished this frailsepulcher of our flesh,

510
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.230
as now our flesh isbanished from this land.

511
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.530
Confess thy treasons erethou fly the realm.

512
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.330
Since thou hast far to go,

513
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.500
bear not along theclogging burthen of aguilty soul.

514
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.530
No, Bolingbroke.

515
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.630
If ever I were traitor,

516
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.470
my name be blotted fromthe book of life,

517
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.270
and I from heaven banishedas from hence.

518
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:39.430
But what thou art, God,thou, and I do know.

519
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.300
And all too soon, I fear,the king shall rue.

520
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.130
Farewell, my liege.

521
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.930
Now no way can I stray.

522
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.830
Save back to England, allthe world's my way.

523
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.930
Uncle, even in the glassesof thine eyes

524
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.070
I see thy grieved heart.

525
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.300
Thy sad aspect hath from thenumber of his banished years

526
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.830
plucked four away.

527
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.230
Six frozen winter spent,

528
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.800
return with welcome homefrom banishment.

529
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.200
How long a time lies inone little word.

530
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.570
Four lagging winters and fourwanton springs end in a word.

531
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.900
Such is the breath ofkings.

532
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.730
I thank my liege that, inregard of me,

533
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.500
he shortens four years ofmy son's exile.

534
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.230
But little vantage will Igain thereby,

535
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.930
for, ere the six yearsthat he has to spend

536
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.330
shall change their moons andbring their times about,

537
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.130
my oil dried lamp and timebewasted light

538
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.500
shall be extinct with ageand endless nights.

539
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.130
My inch of taper will beburnt and done,

540
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.830
and blindfold death notlet me see my son.

541
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.570
Why, Uncle, thou hast manyyears to live.

542
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.370
But not a minute, King,that thou canst give.

543
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:05.170
Shorten my days thou canstwith sullen sorrow

544
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.070
and pluck nights from me,

545
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.400
but not lend a morrow.

546
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.030
Thou canst help time tofurrow me with age,

547
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.200
but stop no wrinkle of hispilgrimage.

548
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.730
Thy word is current withhim for my deaths.

549
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.530
But dead, thy kingdomcannot buy my breath.

550
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.630
Thy son is banished upongood advice,

551
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.370
whereto thy tongue a partyverdict gave.

552
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.870
Why at our justice seem'stthou then to lour?

553
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:33.330
Things sweet to tasteprove in digestion sour.

554
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.870
You urged me as a judge,

555
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.530
but I had rather that you hadbid me argue like a father.

556
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:43.000
Oh, had it been astranger, not my child,

557
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.570
to smooth his fault Iwould have been more mild.

558
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.570
Alas, I looked when someof you should say,

559
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.170
I was too strict to makemine own away.

560
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.930
But you gave leave to myunwilling tongue

561
00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:00.200
against my will to domyself this wrong.

562
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.400
Cousin, farewell.

563
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.300
And, Uncle, bid him so.

564
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.430
Six years we banish him,and he shall go.

565
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.030
Cousin, farewell.

566
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.800
What presence must notknow,

567
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.600
from where you do remainlet paper show.

568
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.100
My lord, no leave take I,

569
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.030
for I will ride, as far as landwill let me, by your side.

570
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.970
Oh, to what purpose dostthou hoard thy words

571
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.800
that thou return'st nogreeting to thy friends?

572
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.530
I have too few to take myleave of you,

573
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.330
when the tongue's officeshould be prodigal

574
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.200
to breathe the abundantdolor of the heart.

575
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.570
Thy grief is but thyabsence for a time.

576
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.930
Joy absent.

577
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.570
Grief is present for thattime.

578
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.730
What are six winters?

579
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.030
They are quickly gone.

580
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.430
To men in joy.

581
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.470
But grief makes one hourten.

582
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.800
Call it a travel that thoutakest for pleasure.

583
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.430
My heart will sigh when Imiscall it so,

584
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.800
which finds it an enforcedpilgrimage.

585
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.770
The sullen passage of thyweary steps esteem as foil

586
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.500
wherein thou art to set

587
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500
the precious jewel of thyhome return.

588
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.770
Nay.

589
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.300
Rather, every tediousstride I make will butremember me

590
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.900
what a deal of world Iwander from the jewelsthat I love.

591
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.330
Must I not serve

592
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.170
a long apprenticehood toforeign passages,

593
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.430
and in the end, having myfreedom,

594
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:26.400
boast of nothing else but thatI was a journeyman to grief?

595
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.300
All places that the eye ofheaven visits

596
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.500
are to a wise man portsand happy havens.

597
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.200
Teach thy necessity toreason thus.

598
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.530
There is no virtue likenecessity.

599
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.170
Think not the king did banishthee, but thou the king.

600
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.500
Woe doth the heavier sit

601
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.730
when it perceives it isbut faintly borne.

602
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.300
Go, say I sent thee forthto purchase honor

603
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.670
and not that the kingexiled thee.

604
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.900
Or suppose devouringpestilence hangs in our air,

605
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.870
and thou art flying to afresher clime.

606
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.670
Look what thy soul holdsdear.

607
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:07.200
Imagine it to lie that waythou go'st, not whencethou comest.

608
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.170
Suppose the singing birdsmusicians,

609
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.530
the grass whereon thoutread'st the presence strewn,

610
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.770
the flowers fair ladies,

611
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:20.970
and thy steps no more than adelightful measure or a dance.

612
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.430
For gnarling sorrow hathless power

613
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:27.900
to bite the man that mocksat it and sets it light.

614
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.730
Oh, who can hold a fire inhis hand

615
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.800
by thinking on the frostyCaucasus?

616
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.830
Or cloy the hungry edge ofappetite

617
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.530
by bare imagination of afeast?

618
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.000
Or wallow naked inDecember snow

619
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.230
by thinking on fantasticsummer's heat?

620
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.800
Oh, no.

621
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.630
The apprehension of thegood

622
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.800
gives but the greaterfeeling to the worse.

623
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.630
Fell sorrow's tooth dothnever rankle more

624
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.430
than when he bites butlanceth not the sore.

625
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.930
Come, come, my son.

626
00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.730
I'll bring thee on thyway.

627
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.670
Had I thy youth and cause,I would not stay.

628
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.630
Then, England's ground,farewell.

629
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.300
Sweet soil, adieu,

630
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.830
my mother and my nursethat bears me yet.

631
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.870
Where'er I wander, boastof this I can:

632
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.970
though banished, yet atrueborn Englishman.

633
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.700
We did observe.

634
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.830
Cousin Aumerle, how farbrought you high Herefordon his way?

635
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.130
I brought high Hereford,if you call him so,

636
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.800
but to the next highway,

637
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.870
and there I left him.

638
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.830
And say, what store ofparting tears were shed?

639
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.670
Faith, none for me,

640
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.030
except the northeast wind,

641
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.570
which then blew bitterlyagainst our faces,

642
00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.800
awaked the sleeping rheum,

643
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.230
and so by chance did grace ourhollow parting with a tear.

644
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.630
What said our cousin whenyou parted from him?

645
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.600
"Farewell."

646
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.830
And, for my heartdisdained

647
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.800
that my tongue should soprofane the word,

648
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.370
that taught me craft

649
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.800
to counterfeit oppressionof such grief

650
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.630
that words seemed buriedin my sorrow's grave.

651
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.030
Marry, would the word"farewell"

652
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.000
have lengthened hours andadded years to his shortbanishment,

653
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.830
he should have had avolume of farewells.

654
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:29.470
But since it would not, hehad none of me.

655
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.400
He is our cousin, cousin.

656
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.300
But 'tis doubt, when timeshall call him home frombanishment,

657
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.000
whether our kinsman cometo see his friends.

658
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.570
Ourself and Bushy, Bagothere and Green

659
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.170
observed his courtship tothe common people,

660
00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.470
how he did seem to diveinto their hearts

661
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.000
with humble and familiarcourtesy.

662
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.670
What reverence he didthrow away on slaves,

663
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.730
wooing poor craftsmen withthe craft of smiles

664
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.170
and patient underbearingof his fortune,

665
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.530
as 'twere to banish theiraffects with him.

666
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.970
Off goes his bonnet to anoyster wench.

667
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.930
A brace of draymen bid Godspeed him well

668
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.030
and had the tribute of hissupple knee,

669
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.230
with "Thanks, my countrymen,my loving friends,"

670
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.300
as were our England inreversion his,

671
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.730
and he our subjects' nextdegree in hope.

672
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.600
Well, he's gone, and withhim go these thoughts.

673
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.270
Now, for the rebels whichstand out in Ireland,

674
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.530
expedient manage must bemade, my liege,

675
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.500
ere further leisure yieldthem further means

676
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.970
for their advantage andYour Highness' loss.

677
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:41.030
We will ourself in personto this war.

678
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.600
And, for our coffers,

679
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.730
with too great a court andliberal largess,

680
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.330
are grown somewhat light.

681
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.200
We are enforced to farmour royal realm.

682
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.400
The revenue whereof shallfurnish us

683
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.530
for our affairs in hand.

684
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.200
If that come short,

685
00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.600
our substitutes at homeshall have blank charters.

686
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.430
Whereto, when they shallknow what men are rich,

687
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.800
they shall subscribe themfor large sums of gold

688
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.330
and send them after tosupply our wants,

689
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.370
for we will make forIreland presently.

690
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.900
Bushy, what news?

691
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.800
Old John of Gaunt isgrievous sick, my lord,suddenly taken,

692
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.470
and hath sent post haste

693
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.400
to entreat Your Majesty tovisit him.

694
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400
Where lies he?

695
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.730
At Ely House.

696
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.530
Now put it, God, in thephysician's mind

697
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.270
to help him to his graveimmediately.

698
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.800
The lining of his coffersshall make coats

699
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.830
to deck our soldiers forthese Irish wars.

700
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.070
Come, gentlemen, let's allgo visit him.

701
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.900
Pray God, we may makehaste

702
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.730
and come too late.

703
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.570
Amen.

704
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.800
Will the king come

705
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.600
that I may breathe my lastin wholesome counsel

706
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.470
to his unstaid youth?

707
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.500
Vex not yourself

708
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.300
nor strive not with yourbreath,

709
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.000
for all in vain comescounsel to his ear.

710
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.070
Oh, but they say thetongues of dying men

711
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.370
enforce attention likedeep harmony.

712
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.130
When words are scarce, theyare seldom spent in vain,

713
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:15.230
for they breathe truththat breathe their wordsin pain.

714
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.870
He that no more must sayis listened more

715
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.470
than they whom youth andease have taught to glose.

716
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:27.630
More are men's ends markedthan their lives before.

717
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.270
The setting sun and musicat the close,

718
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:35.870
as the last taste ofsweets, is sweetest last,

719
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:40.770
writ in remembrance morethan things long past.

720
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.830
Though Richard my life'scounsel would not hear,

721
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.930
my death's sad tale mayyet undeaf his ear.

722
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.500
No, for it is stopped withother flattering sounds,

723
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.330
as praises of whose tastethe wise are fond;

724
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.530
lascivious meters, towhose venom sound

725
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.830
the open ear of youth dothalways listen.

726
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.200
Reports of fashions inproud Italy,

727
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.070
whose manners still our tardy,apish nation limps after

728
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.330
in base imitation.

729
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.970
Where doth the worldthrust forth a vanity--

730
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.930
so it be new, there's norespect how vile--

731
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.200
that is not quickly buzzedinto his ears?

732
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.430
Then all too late comescounsel to be heard,

733
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.570
where will doth mutinywith wit's regard.

734
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:20.000
Direct not him whose wayhimself will choose.

735
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.970
'Tis breath thou lack'st, andthat breath wilt thou lose.

736
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.400
Methinks I am a prophetnew inspired

737
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.030
and thus expiring doforetell of him.

738
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.970
His rash fierce blaze ofriot cannot last,

739
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.600
for violent fires soonburn out themselves.

740
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.030
Small showers last long, butsudden storms are short.

741
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.270
He tires betimes thatspurs too fast betimes.

742
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:48.000
With eager feeding fooddoth choke the feeder.

743
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.300
Light vanity, insatiatecormorant, consuming means

744
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.100
soon preys upon itself.

745
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.700
This royal throne ofkings;

746
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.130
this sceptered isle;

747
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.370
this earth of majesty;

748
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.570
this seat of Mars;

749
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.570
this other Eden;demi-paradise;

750
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.630
this fortress built bynature for herself

751
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.130
against infection and thehand of war;

752
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.370
this happy breed of men;

753
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.300
this little world;

754
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.270
this precious stone set inthe silver sea,

755
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.070
which serves it in theoffice of a wall

756
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.170
or as a moat defensive toone house

757
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.930
against the envy of lesshappier lands;

758
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.200
this blessed plot; thisearth;

759
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.430
this realm; this England;

760
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.430
this nurse;

761
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.730
this teeming womb of royalkings,

762
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.670
feared by their breed andfamous by their birth,

763
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.970
renowned for their deedsas far from home

764
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.600
for Christian service andtrue chivalry

765
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.630
as is the sepulcher instubborn Jewry

766
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.530
of the world's ransom;

767
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.000
blessed Mary's Son;

768
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.530
this land of such dearsouls;

769
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.630
this dear, dear land--

770
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.400
dear for her reputationthrough the world--

771
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.470
is now leased out--

772
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.300
I die pronouncing it--

773
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.400
like to a tenement orpelting farm.

774
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.500
England, bound in with thetriumphant sea

775
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.400
whose rocky shore beatsback the envious siege ofwatery Neptune,

776
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.300
is now bound in withshame,

777
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.670
with inky blots and rottenparchment bonds.

778
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.270
That England that was wontto conquer others

779
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.730
hath made a shamefulconquest of itself.

780
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:45.200
Ah, would the scandalvanish with my life,

781
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:51.700
how happy then were myensuing death.

782
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.570
The king is come.

783
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.170
Deal mildly with hisyouth,

784
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.070
for young, hot colts beingraged do rage the more.

785
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.300
How fares our noble UncleLancaster?

786
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.700
What comfort, man?

787
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.700
How is't with aged Gaunt?

788
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.430
Oh, how that name befitsmy composition.

789
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.400
Old Gaunt indeed, andgaunt in being old.

790
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.900
Within me grief has kept atedious fast.

791
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.830
And who abstains from meatthat is not gaunt?

792
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.730
For sleeping England longtime have I watched.

793
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.600
Watching breeds leanness.

794
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.030
Leanness is all gaunt.

795
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.730
The pleasure that somefathers feed upon is mystrict fast.

796
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.800
I mean my children'slooks.

797
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.030
And therein fasting hastthou made me gaunt.

798
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.130
Gaunt am I for the grave,gaunt as a grave,

799
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.830
whose hollow womb inheritsnaught but bones.

800
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.600
Can sick men play sonicely with their names?

801
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.200
No, misery makes sport tomock itself.

802
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.570
Since thou dost seek tokill my name in me,

803
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.670
I mock my name, greatKing, to flatter thee.

804
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.730
Should dying men flatterwith those that live?

805
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.430
No, men living flatterthose that die.

806
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.530
Thou, now a-dying, say'stthou flatterest me.

807
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.870
Oh, no, thou diest, thoughI the sicker be.

808
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.430
I am in health.

809
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.700
I breathe and see thee ill.

810
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.900
Now He that made me knowsI see thee ill,

811
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.200
ill in myself to see andin thee seeing ill.

812
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.370
Thy deathbed is no lesserthan thy land

813
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.270
wherein thou liest inreputation sick.

814
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.430
And thou, too carelesspatient as thou art,

815
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.370
commit'st thy anointedbody

816
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.870
to the cure of thosephysicians that firstwounded thee.

817
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.270
A thousand flatterers sitwithin thy crown,

818
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.300
whose compass is no biggerthan thy head.

819
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.170
And yet, encaged in sosmall a verge,

820
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.170
the waste is no whitlesser than thy land.

821
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:49.400
Oh, had thy grandsire witha prophet's eye

822
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.530
seen how his son's sonshould destroy his sons,

823
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.070
from forth thy reach hewould have laid thy shame,

824
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.800
deposing thee before thouwert possessed,

825
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.500
which art possessed now todepose thyself.

826
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.600
Why, cousin, wert thouregent of the world,

827
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.030
it were a shame to letthis land by lease.

828
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.930
And for thy world enjoyingbut this land,

829
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.200
is it not more than shameto shame it so?

830
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.300
Landlord of England artthou now,

831
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.770
not king.

832
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.870
Thy state of law isbondslave to the law.

833
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:23.870
And thou--

834
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.530
A lunatic, lean-wittedfool,

835
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.970
presuming on an ague'sprivilege,

836
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.570
darest with thy frozenadmonition make pale ourcheek,

837
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:34.500
chasing the royal bloodwith fury

838
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.870
from his native residence.

839
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.330
Now, by my seat's rightroyal majesty,

840
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.230
wert thou not brother togreat Edward's son,

841
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.870
this tongue that runs soroundly in thy head

842
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.200
should run thy head fromthy unreverent shoulders.

843
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.200
Oh, spare me not, mybrother Edward's son.

844
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.730
For that I was his fatherEdward's son.

845
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.230
That blood already, likethe pelican,

846
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.670
hast thou tapped out anddrunkenly caroused.

847
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.470
My brother Gloucester,plain well-meaning soul,

848
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.630
whom fair befall in heavenamongst happy souls,

849
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.800
may be a precedent andwitness good

850
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.630
that thou respect'st notspilling Edward's blood.

851
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.370
Joined with the presentsickness that I have,

852
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.770
and thy unkindness be likecrooked age

853
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.030
to crop at once a too longwithered flower.

854
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.770
Live in thy shame,

855
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.370
but die not shamewith thee.

856
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.600
These words hereafter thytormentors be.

857
00:45:53.630 --> 00:46:00.100
Convey me to my bed, thento my grave.

858
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:10.130
Love they to live thatlove and honor have.

859
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.670
And let them die that ageand sullens have,

860
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.830
for both hast thou, andboth become the grave.

861
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.170
I do beseech Your Majesty.

862
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.270
Impute his words to waywardsickliness and age in him.

863
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.270
He loves you, on my life,

864
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.330
and holds you dear asHarry, duke of Hereford,

865
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:33.330
were he here.

866
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.430
Right, you say true.

867
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.600
As Hereford's love, sohis.

868
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.130
As theirs, so mine.

869
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.630
And all be as it is.

870
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:44.530
My liege, old Gauntcommends him to YourMajesty.

871
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.630
What says he?

872
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.700
Nay, nothing.

873
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.830
All is said.

874
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.400
His tongue is now astringless instrument.

875
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:58.000
Words, life, and all, oldLancaster hath spent.

876
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.600
Be York the next that mustbe bankrupt so.

877
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.700
Though death be poor, itends a mortal woe.

878
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.870
The ripest fruit firstfalls,

879
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.970
and so doth he.

880
00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.770
His time is spent.

881
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.830
Our pilgrimage must be.

882
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.270
So much for that.

883
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.000
Now for our Irish wars.

884
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.500
We must supplant thoserough, rugheaded kerns,

885
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.000
which live like venom

886
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.730
where no venom else but onlythey have privilege to live.

887
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.770
And for these great affairsdo ask some charge.

888
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:37.000
Towards our assistance wedo seize to us

889
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.900
the plate, coin, revenues,and moveables

890
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.970
whereof our Uncle Gauntdid stand possessed.

891
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.000
How long must I bepatient?

892
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.100
Ah, how long shall tenderduty make me suffer wrong?

893
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.870
Not Gloucester's death,

894
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.270
nor Hereford's banishment,not Gaunt's rebukes,

895
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.830
nor England's privatewrongs,

896
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.100
nor the prevention of poorBolingbroke about hismarriage,

897
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.100
nor my own disgrace,

898
00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.100
have ever made me sour mypatient cheek

899
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.670
or bend one wrinkle on mysovereign's face.

900
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.870
I am the last of nobleEdward's sons,

901
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:07.730
of whom thy father, princeof Wales, was first.

902
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.430
In war was never lionraged more fierce,

903
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:12.630
in peace was never gentlelamb more mild,

904
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:17.030
than was that young andprincely gentleman.

905
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.500
His face thou hast,

906
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.500
for even so looked he,

907
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.130
accomplished with thenumber of thy hours.

908
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:23.300
But when he frowned,

909
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.330
it was against the Frenchand not against his friends.

910
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.770
His noble hand did winwhat he did spend

911
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:28.800
and spent not that

912
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800
which his triumphantfather's hand had won.

913
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.000
His hands were guilty ofno kindred blood,

914
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.300
but bloody with theenemies of his kin.

915
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.830
Oh, Richard.

916
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:40.730
York is too far gone withgrief,

917
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.400
or else he never wouldcompare between.

918
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.470
Why, Uncle, what's thematter?

919
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:46.700
Oh, my liege.

920
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.930
Pardon me, if you please.

921
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.370
If not, I, pleased not tobe pardoned,

922
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.930
am content withal.

923
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.230
Seek you to seize andgripe into your hands

924
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.730
the royalties and rightsof banished Hereford?

925
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.970
Is not Gaunt dead,

926
00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:00.530
and doth not Herefordlive?

927
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.600
Was not Gaunt just, and isnot Harry true?

928
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.870
Did not the one deserve tohave an heir?

929
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.170
Is not his heir awell-deserving son?

930
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.030
Take Hereford's rightsaway

931
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:14.400
and take from time his chartersand his customary rights,

932
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.200
let not tomorrow thenensue today,

933
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.630
be not thyself.

934
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:21.670
For how art thou a kingbut by fair sequence andsuccession?

935
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.030
Now, afore God-- Godforbid I say true--

936
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.070
if you do wrongfully seizeHereford's rights,

937
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.670
call in the letters patentthat he hath

938
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.270
by his attorneys generalto sue his livery,

939
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.770
and deny his offeredhomage,

940
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.200
you pluck a thousanddangers on your head.

941
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.900
You lose a thousandwell-disposed hearts

942
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.930
and prick my tenderpatience

943
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.600
to such thoughts as honorand allegiance cannot think.

944
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.600
Think what you will.

945
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.030
We seize into our hands

946
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.470
his plate, his goods, hismoney, and his lands.

947
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.970
I'll not be by the while.

948
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.200
My liege, farewell.

949
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.330
What will ensue hereof,there's none can tell.

950
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.470
But by bad courses may beunderstood

951
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.030
that their events cannever fall out good.

952
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.800
Go, Bushy, to the earl ofWiltshire straight.

953
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.830
Bid him repair to us to ElyHouse to see this business.

954
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.900
Tomorrow next we will forIreland,

955
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.200
and 'tis time, I trow.

956
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.300
And we create, in absenceof ourself,

957
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.170
our Uncle York lordgovernor of England,

958
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:29.530
for he is just and alwaysloved us well.

959
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.700
Come on, our queen.

960
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.100
Tomorrow must we part.

961
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.270
Be merry,

962
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.900
for our time of stay isshort.

963
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:57.170
Well, lords, the duke ofLancaster is dead.

964
00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.170
And living, too, for nowhis son is duke.

965
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.830
Barely in title, not inrevenues.

966
00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.100
Richly in both, if justicehad her right.

967
00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:08.900
My heart is great, but itmust break with silence,

968
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.130
ere't be disburdened witha liberal tongue.

969
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:12.770
Nay, speak thy mind,

970
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:15.070
and let him ne'er speakmore

971
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.800
that speaks thy wordsagain to do thee harm.

972
00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.300
Tends that thou wouldstspeak to the duke ofHereford?

973
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:22.370
If it be so, out with itboldly, man.

974
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.370
Quick is mine ear to hearof good towards him.

975
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.230
No good at all that I cando for him,

976
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:27.970
unless you call it good topity him,

977
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:30.100
bereft and gelded of hispatrimony.

978
00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.600
Now, afore God,

979
00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:35.070
'tis shame such wrongs areborne in him,

980
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.770
a royal prince,

981
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:42.630
and many moe of nobleblood in this decliningland.

982
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:52.830
The king is not himself,but basely led byflatterers.

983
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.270
And what they will inform,

984
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:56.430
merely in hate against anyof us all,

985
00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:59.370
that will the king severelyprosecute 'gainst us,

986
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:01.830
our lives, our children,and our heirs.

987
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.630
The commons hath he pilledwith grievous taxes

988
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:05.170
and quite lost theirhearts.

989
00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:07.730
The nobles hath he finedfor ancient quarrels

990
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:08.830
and quite lost theirhearts.

991
00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:11.130
And daily new exactionsare devised

992
00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:14.170
as blanks, benevolences,and I wot not what.

993
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:16.670
But what, o' God's name,doth become of this?

994
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:20.730
Wars have not wasted it,for warred he hath not,

995
00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.230
but basely yielded uponcompromise

996
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:26.100
that which his noble ancestorsachieved with blows.

997
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:30.370
More hath he spent inpeace than they in wars.

998
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.600
The earl of Wiltshire haththe realm in farm.

999
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:35.130
The king's grown bankrupt,like a broken man.

1000
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.970
Reproach and dissolutionhangeth over him.

1001
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:39.930
He hath not money forthese Irish wars,

1002
00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.400
his burdenous taxationsnotwithstanding,

1003
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.670
but by the robbing of thebanished duke--

1004
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.730
His noble kinsman.

1005
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.900
Oh, most degenerate king.

1006
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.630
But, lords, we hear thisfearful tempest sing,

1007
00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:01.700
yet seek no shelter toavoid the storm.

1008
00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.100
We see the wind sit soreupon our sails,

1009
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.570
and yet we strike not, butsecurely perish.

1010
00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:09.470
We see the very wreck thatwe must suffer,

1011
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.470
and unavoided is thedanger now

1012
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:13.730
for suffering so thecauses of our wreck.

1013
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:15.830
Not so.

1014
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:22.700
Even through the hollow eyesof death I spy life peering,

1015
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.670
but I dare not say hownear the tidings of ourcomfort is.

1016
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:27.170
Nay, let us share thythoughts,

1017
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.170
as thou dost ours.

1018
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:29.830
Be confident to speak,Northumberland.

1019
00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:31.170
We three are but thyself.

1020
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.170
And, speaking so,

1021
00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.270
thy words are but asthoughts.

1022
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.570
Therefore, be bold.

1023
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:39.830
Then thus.

1024
00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.530
I have from Le Port Blanc,a bay in Brittany,

1025
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:44.930
received intelligence thatHarry, duke of Hereford;

1026
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.400
Rainold Lord Cobham,

1027
00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:47.700
that late broke from theduke of Exeter;

1028
00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.800
his brother, archbishoplate of Canterbury;

1029
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.730
Sir Thomas Erpingham; SirJohn Ramston;

1030
00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:54.430
Sir John Norbery; SirRobert Waterton; andFrancis Quoint--

1031
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:57.100
all these well furnishedby the duke of Britain

1032
00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:58.400
with eight tall ships,

1033
00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.570
3,000 men of war--

1034
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.400
are making hither with alldue expedience

1035
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.130
and shortly mean to touchour northern shore.

1036
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:05.430
Perhaps they had ere this,

1037
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.470
but that they stay

1038
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:08.670
the first departing of theking for Ireland.

1039
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:14.230
If then we shall shake offour slavish yoke,

1040
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:18.330
imp out our droopingcountry's broken wing,

1041
00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:22.270
redeem from broking pawnthe blemished crown,

1042
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:25.370
wipe off the dust thathides our scepter's gilt,

1043
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:29.800
and make high majesty looklike itself,

1044
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.330
away with me in post toRavenspurgh.

1045
00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:35.900
But if you faint, asfearing to do so,

1046
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:39.300
stay and be secret, andmyself will go.

1047
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.570
To horse; to horse.

1048
00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.470
Urge doubts to them thatfear.

1049
00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:45.470
Hold out my horse, and Iwill first be there.

1050
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.300
I know not what to do.

1051
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.770
I would to God, so myuntruth had not provokedhim to it,

1052
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:52.370
the king had cut off myhead with my brother's.

1053
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.370
Uncle--

1054
00:54:53.370 --> 00:54:55.700
What, are there no postsdispatched for Ireland?

1055
00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:59.170
How shall we do for moneyfor these wars?

1056
00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:00.600
Come, Sister--

1057
00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.630
Cousin, I would say--

1058
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:02.770
pray, pardon me.

1059
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.270
Go, fellow.

1060
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.500
Get thee home.

1061
00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:08.470
Provide some carts and bringaway the armor that is there.

1062
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:11.300
Gentlemen, will you gomuster men?

1063
00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:14.700
If I know how or which wayto order these affairs

1064
00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.870
thus disorderly thrustinto my hands,

1065
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.500
never believe me.

1066
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.030
Both are my kinsmen.

1067
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:21.530
The one is my sovereign,

1068
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.230
whom both my oath and dutybids defend.

1069
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:26.670
The other again is mykinsman, whom the kinghath wronged,

1070
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.130
whom conscience and mykindred bids to right.

1071
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.500
Well, somewhat we must do.

1072
00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.430
Come, cousin; I'll disposeof you.

1073
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.830
Gentlemen, will you gomuster up your men

1074
00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:40.570
and meet me presently atBerkeley?

1075
00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:44.670
The wind sits fair fornews to go to Ireland,

1076
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:46.130
but none returns.

1077
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:48.430
For us to levy powerproportionable to the enemy

1078
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:50.600
is all unpossible.

1079
00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.270
Besides, our nearness tothe king in love

1080
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:54.030
is near the hate of thoselove not the king.

1081
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:56.400
And that is the waveringcommons,

1082
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.230
for their love lies intheir purses,

1083
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:00.200
and whoso empties them byso much

1084
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.770
fills their hearts withdeadly hate.

1085
00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:03.800
Wherein the king standsgenerally condemned.

1086
00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.030
If judgment lie in them,then so do we,

1087
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.700
because we ever have beennear the king.

1088
00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.270
Well, I will for refugestraight to Bristol Castle.

1089
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:14.100
The earl of Wiltshire isalready there.

1090
00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.700
Thither will I with you,

1091
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:18.130
for little office will thehateful commons perform for us,

1092
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.000
except like curs to tearus all to pieces.

1093
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.330
Will you go along with us?

1094
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.800
No.

1095
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:25.470
I will to Ireland to HisMajesty.

1096
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:28.130
Farewell.

1097
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.500
If heart's presages be notvain,

1098
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.500
we three here part thatne'er shall meet again.

1099
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.470
That's as York thrives tobeat back Bolingbroke.

1100
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.800
Alas, poor duke.

1101
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.930
The task he undertakes

1102
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:42.830
is numbering sands anddrinking oceans dry.

1103
00:56:42.830 --> 00:56:47.470
Where one on his sidefights, thousands will fly.

1104
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.900
Farewell at once, foronce, for all, forever.

1105
00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:52.570
Well, we may meet again.

1106
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:55.570
I fear me, never.

1107
00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:02.970
How far is it, my lord, toBerkeley now?

1108
00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:04.400
Believe me, noble lord,

1109
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.130
I am a stranger here inGloucestershire.

1110
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.930
These high, wild hills andrough, uneven ways

1111
00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:12.500
draws out our miles andmakes them wearisome.

1112
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.300
And yet your fair discoursehath been as sugar,

1113
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.930
making the hard way sweetand delectable.

1114
00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:21.270
But I bethink me what aweary way

1115
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:23.270
from Ravenspurgh toCotswold will be found

1116
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:26.030
in Ross and Willoughby,wanting your company,

1117
00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.200
which, I protest, hathvery much beguiled

1118
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:32.230
the tediousness andprocess of my travel.

1119
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.930
But theirs is sweetened bythe hope to have

1120
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:36.470
the present benefit whichI possess.

1121
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.500
And hope to joy

1122
00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:40.330
is little less in joy thanhope enjoyed.

1123
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:43.130
By this the weary lords shallmake their way seem short,

1124
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:45.470
as mine hath done by sightof what I have,

1125
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:47.830
your noble company.

1126
00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:51.200
Of much less value is mycompany than your good words.

1127
00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.570
But who comes here?

1128
00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.330
It is my son, young HarryPercy,

1129
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.830
sent from my brother,Worcester, whencesoever.

1130
00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:57.830
Harry.

1131
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:03.030
How fares your uncle?

1132
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:06.800
I had thought, my lord, to havelearned his health of you.

1133
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.670
Why, is he not with thequeen?

1134
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:10.430
No, my good lord.

1135
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:13.400
He hath forsook the court,broken his staff of office,

1136
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.230
and dispersed thehousehold of the king.

1137
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:16.400
What was his reason?

1138
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.330
He was not so resolvedwhen last we spaketogether.

1139
00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:22.970
Because your lordship wasproclaimed traitor.

1140
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:25.130
But he, my lord, is goneto Ravenspurgh

1141
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:27.330
to offer service to theduke of Hereford,

1142
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:28.900
and sent me over byBerkeley

1143
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.700
to discover what power theduke of York had levied there,

1144
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.000
then with directions torepair to Ravenspurgh.

1145
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.300
Have you forgot the dukeof Hereford, boy?

1146
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:40.570
No, my good lord, for thatis not forgot

1147
00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:42.400
which ne'er I didremember.

1148
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:43.400
To my knowledge,

1149
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:45.230
I never in my life didlook on him.

1150
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.500
Then learn to know himnow.

1151
00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.300
This is the duke.

1152
00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:53.270
My gracious lord,

1153
00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.170
I tender you my service,

1154
00:58:57.170 --> 00:59:01.770
such as it is, beingtender, raw, and young,

1155
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.230
which elder days shallripen and confirm

1156
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:07.270
to more approved serviceand desert.

1157
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:09.900
I thank thee, gentlePercy,

1158
00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.830
and be sure I count myselfin nothing else so happy

1159
00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:16.200
as in a soul rememberingmy good friends.

1160
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.970
And, as my fortune ripenswith thy love,

1161
00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.500
it shall be still thy truelove's recompense.

1162
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.100
My heart this covenantmakes.

1163
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.930
My hand thus seals it.

1164
00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:29.300
How far is it to Berkeley,

1165
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:33.330
and what stir keeps goodold York there with hismen of war?

1166
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:37.700
There stands the castle byyon tuft of trees,

1167
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.530
manned with 300 men, as Ihave heard.

1168
00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:43.700
And in it are the lords ofYork, Berkeley, and Seymour.

1169
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:46.170
None else of name andnoble estimate.

1170
00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:48.030
Here come the lords ofRoss and Willoughby,

1171
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:51.330
bloody with spurring andfiery red with haste.

1172
00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:53.730
Welcome, my lords.

1173
00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:57.270
I wot your love pursues abanished traitor.

1174
00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.200
All my treasury is yet butunfelt thanks,

1175
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.500
which more enriched

1176
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.930
shall be your love andlabor's recompense.

1177
01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:06.300
Your presence makes usrich, most noble lord--

1178
01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.770
And far surmounts ourlabor to attain it.

1179
01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:12.070
Evermore thanks, theexchequer of the poor,

1180
01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:15.530
which, till my infantfortune comes to years,

1181
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.870
stands for my bounty.

1182
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.530
But who comes here?

1183
01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:21.870
It is my lord of Berkeley,as I guess.

1184
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.930
My lord of Hereford, mymessage is to you.

1185
01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:29.470
My lord, my answer is toLancaster,

1186
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:31.700
and I am come to seek thatname in England.

1187
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.670
And I must find that titlein your tongue

1188
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.800
before I make reply toaught you say.

1189
01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.600
Mistake me not, my lord.

1190
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.630
'Tis not my meaning to razeone title of your honor out.

1191
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:45.730
To you, my lord, I come,what lord you will,

1192
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:47.670
from the most graciousregent of this land,

1193
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.130
the duke of York, to knowwhat pricks you on

1194
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:52.200
to take advantage of theabsent time

1195
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.270
and fright our nativepeace with self-born arms.

1196
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:58.270
I shall not need transportmy words by you.

1197
01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:00.100
Here comes His Grace inperson.

1198
01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:04.400
My noble uncle.

1199
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.600
Show me thy humble heartand not thy knee,

1200
01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.070
whose duty is deceivableand false.

1201
01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:12.070
My gracious uncle--

1202
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:13.070
Tut, tut.

1203
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.270
Grace me no grace, noruncle me no uncle.

1204
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.730
I am no traitor's uncle,

1205
01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:22.330
and that word "grace" inan ungracious mouth is butprofane.

1206
01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.770
Why have those banishedand forbidden legs

1207
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:27.130
dared once to touch a dustof England's ground?

1208
01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:28.470
But then more "why."

1209
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.130
Why have they dared tomarch

1210
01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.230
so many miles upon herpeaceful bosom,

1211
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.730
frighting her pale facedvillages with war

1212
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.000
and ostentation ofdespised arms?

1213
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.630
Comest thou because theanointed king is hence?

1214
01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.600
Why, foolish boy, the kingis left behind,

1215
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.170
and in my loyal bosom lieshis power.

1216
01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.130
Were I but now the lord ofsuch hot youth

1217
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:54.530
as when brave Gaunt, thyfather, and myself

1218
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.500
rescued the Black Prince,that young Mars of men,

1219
01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.730
from forth the ranks ofmany thousand French.

1220
01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:03.070
Oh, then how quickly wouldthis arm of mine,

1221
01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:05.270
now prisoner to the palsy,chastise thee

1222
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.900
and minister correction tothy fault.

1223
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.870
My gracious uncle, let meknow my fault.

1224
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:13.370
On what condition standsit and wherein?

1225
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.970
Even in condition of theworst degree,

1226
01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:20.670
in gross rebellion anddetested treason.

1227
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.370
Thou art a banished man

1228
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:25.270
and here art come beforethe expiration of thy time

1229
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:28.730
in braving arms againstthy sovereign.

1230
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:31.070
As I was banished, I wasbanished Hereford.

1231
01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:33.900
But as I come, I come forLancaster.

1232
01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:37.970
And, noble Uncle, Ibeseech Your Grace.

1233
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:41.670
Look on my wrongs with anindifferent eye.

1234
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.670
You are my father,

1235
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:47.730
for methinks in you I seeold Gaunt alive.

1236
01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:49.770
Oh, then, my father, willyou permit

1237
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:53.670
that I shall standcondemned a wanderingvagabond,

1238
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:56.430
my rights and royaltiesplucked from my armsperforce

1239
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:59.270
and given away to upstartunthrifts?

1240
01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:01.970
Wherefore was I born?

1241
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:04.770
If that my cousin king beking in England,

1242
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:08.100
it must be granted I amduke of Lancaster.

1243
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.430
You have a son, Aumerle,my noble cousin.

1244
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:15.330
Had you first died, and hebeen thus trod down,

1245
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:17.870
he should have found hisuncle Gaunt a father

1246
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:22.030
to rouse his wrongs andchase them to the bay.

1247
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:24.470
I am denied to sue mylivery here,

1248
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:27.230
and yet my letters patentsgive me leave.

1249
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:29.870
My father's goods are alldistrained and sold,

1250
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:33.070
and these and all are allamiss employed.

1251
01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.730
What would you have me do?

1252
01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.130
I am a subject, and Ichallenge law.

1253
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.930
Attorneys are denied me,

1254
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:45.400
and therefore, personallyI lay my claim

1255
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.500
to my inheritance of freedescent.

1256
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.870
The noble duke hath beentoo much abused.

1257
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:54.900
It stands Your Grace uponto do him right.

1258
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.170
Base men by his endowmentsare made great.

1259
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.470
My lords of England, letme tell you this.

1260
01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:01.930
I have had feeling of mycousin's wrongs

1261
01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:03.400
and labored all I could todo him right.

1262
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.370
But in this kind to come,in braving arms,

1263
01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.330
be his own carver and cutout his way

1264
01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.630
to find out right withwrong, it may not be.

1265
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.300
And you who do abet him inthis kind

1266
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.070
cherish rebellion and arerebels all.

1267
01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:20.070
The noble duke hath sworn hiscoming is but for his own.

1268
01:04:20.070 --> 01:04:21.270
And for the right of that,

1269
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:24.400
we all have strongly swornto give him aid

1270
01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.970
and let him never see joythat breaks that oath.

1271
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.270
Well, well.

1272
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:35.170
I see the issue of thesearms.

1273
01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:37.070
I cannot mend it, I mustneeds confess,

1274
01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:39.830
because my power is weakand all ill left.

1275
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:40.870
But if I could,

1276
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:42.500
by Him that gave me life,

1277
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.500
I would attach you all andmake you stoop

1278
01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.000
unto the sovereign mercyof the king.

1279
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:53.670
But since I cannot, be itknown to you I do remainas neuter.

1280
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.030
And so farewell...

1281
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.400
unless you please to enterin the castle

1282
01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.930
and there repose you forthis night.

1283
01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:14.970
An offer, Uncle, that wewill accept.

1284
01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:18.800
But we must win Your Grace togo with us to Bristol Castle,

1285
01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.370
which they say is heldby Bushy, Bagot, andtheir complices,

1286
01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:23.930
the caterpillars of thecommonwealth,

1287
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:26.670
which I have sworn to weedand pluck away.

1288
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:27.930
It may be that I will gowith you.

1289
01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:29.800
No, but yet I'll pause,

1290
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.800
for I am loath to breakour country's laws.

1291
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:36.700
Nor friends nor foes, tome welcome you are.

1292
01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:39.930
Things past redress arenow with me past care.

1293
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.100
My lord of Salisbury, wehave stayed ten days

1294
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:45.930
and hardly kept ourcountrymen together,

1295
01:05:45.930 --> 01:05:48.430
and yet we hear no tidingsfrom the king.

1296
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:50.070
Therefore we will disperseourselves.

1297
01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:51.070
Farewell.

1298
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:52.930
Stay yet another day, thoutrusty Welshman.

1299
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:56.030
The king reposeth all hisconfidence in thee.

1300
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:01.900
'Tis thought the king isdead.

1301
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.500
We will not stay.

1302
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.100
The bay trees in ourcountry are all withered

1303
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.130
and meteors fright thefixed stars of heaven.

1304
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.170
The pale faced moon looksbloody on the earth,

1305
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:14.930
and lean looked prophetswhisper fearful change.

1306
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:18.430
Rich men look sad andruffians dance and leap,

1307
01:06:18.430 --> 01:06:20.970
the one in fear to losewhat they enjoy,

1308
01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:23.800
the other to enjoy by rageand war.

1309
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:28.530
These signs forerun thedeath or fall of kings.

1310
01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:29.670
Farewell.

1311
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:31.870
Our countrymen have goneand fled,

1312
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:34.700
as well assured Richard,their king, is dead.

1313
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:44.370
Bushy and Green, I willnot vex your souls--

1314
01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:47.170
since presently your soulsmust part your bodies--

1315
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:50.230
with too much urging yourpernicious lives,

1316
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:52.300
for it were no charity.

1317
01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.470
Yet to wash your bloodfrom off my hands,

1318
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:55.930
here in the view of men

1319
01:06:55.930 --> 01:06:58.800
I will unfold some causesof your deaths.

1320
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.800
You have misled a prince,a royal king,

1321
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.530
a happy gentleman in bloodand lineaments,

1322
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:11.630
by you unhappied anddisfigured clean.

1323
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:14.430
You have in manner withyour sinful hours

1324
01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.130
made a divorce betwixt hisqueen and him,

1325
01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:19.130
broke the possession of aroyal bed,

1326
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:22.330
and stained the beauty ofa fair queen's cheeks

1327
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:28.300
with tears drawn from hereyes by your foul wrongs.

1328
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.730
Myself, a prince byfortune of my birth,

1329
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.470
near to the king inblood--

1330
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:37.270
and near in love till you didmake him misinterpret me--

1331
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.330
have stooped my neck underyour injuries

1332
01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:44.000
and sighed my Englishbreath in foreign clouds,

1333
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.270
eating the bitter bread ofbanishment,

1334
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:51.130
whilst you have fed uponmy signories,

1335
01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:54.930
disparked my parks andfelled my forest woods,

1336
01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:58.070
from my own windows tornmy household coat,

1337
01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:01.530
razed out my imprese,leaving me no sign,

1338
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:04.700
save men's opinions and myliving blood,

1339
01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.330
to show the world I am agentleman.

1340
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:13.400
This and much more, muchmore than twice all this,

1341
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.200
condemns you to the death.

1342
01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.900
See them delivered over toexecution and the hand ofdeath.

1343
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.970
More welcome is the strokeof death to me

1344
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:22.700
than Bolingbroke toEngland.

1345
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.270
Lords, farewell.

1346
01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.400
My comfort is that heavenwill take our souls

1347
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.200
and plague injustice withthe pains of hell.

1348
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.700
My Lord Northumberland,see them dispatched.

1349
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Uncle,

1350
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:42.770
you say the queen is atyour house.

1351
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.830
For God's sake, fairly lether be entreated.

1352
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:49.930
Tell her I send to her mykind commends.

1353
01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:52.130
Take special care mygreetings be delivered.

1354
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:55.970
A gentleman of mine I havedispatched

1355
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.370
with letters of your loveto her at large.

1356
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.800
Thanks, gentle Uncle.

1357
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.830
Come, lords; away.

1358
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:11.670
To fight with Glendowerand his complices:

1359
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:14.830
awhile to work, and after,holiday.

1360
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.470
Barkloughly Castle callthey this at hand?

1361
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:22.470
Yea, my lord.

1362
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.570
How brooks Your Grace theair

1363
01:09:24.570 --> 01:09:26.200
after your late tossing onthe breaking seas?

1364
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.700
Needs must I like it well.

1365
01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:34.030
I weep for joy to standupon my kingdom once again.

1366
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:35.930
Dear earth,

1367
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.270
I do salute thee with myhands,

1368
01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:41.630
though rebels wound theewith their horses' hoofs.

1369
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.070
As a long-parted motherwith her child

1370
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:47.570
plays fondly with her tearsand smiles in meeting,

1371
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:52.670
so weeping, smiling, greetI thee, my earth,

1372
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:55.830
and do thee favors with myroyal hands.

1373
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.230
Feed not thy sovereign'sfoe, my gentle earth,

1374
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:06.370
nor with thy sweets comforthis ravenous sense,

1375
01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:09.900
but let thy spiders thatsuck up thy venom

1376
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.570
and heavy-gaited toads liein their way,

1377
01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:15.870
doing annoyance to thetreacherous feet

1378
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:20.200
which with usurping stepsdo trample thee.

1379
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.730
Yield stinging nettles tomine enemies.

1380
01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:27.070
And when they from thybosom pluck a flower,

1381
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:31.100
guard it, I pray thee,with a lurking adder

1382
01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.900
whose double-tongue maywith a mortal touch

1383
01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.730
throw death upon thysovereign's enemies.

1384
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:42.670
Mock not my senselessconjuration, lords.

1385
01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:45.300
This earth shall have afeeling

1386
01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:48.200
and these stones provearmed soldiers

1387
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:53.330
ere her native king shallfalter under foulrebellion's arms.

1388
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.430
Fear not, my lord.

1389
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:55.600
That power that made youking

1390
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.100
hath power to keep youking in spite of all.

1391
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.870
The means that heavenyields must be embraced

1392
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:02.370
and not neglected,

1393
01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:06.070
else, if heaven would, andwe will not,

1394
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:07.570
heaven's offer we refuse,

1395
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:09.530
the proffered means ofsuccor and redress.

1396
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:12.200
He means, my lord, that weare too remiss

1397
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.770
whilst Bolingbroke,through our security,

1398
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.170
grows strong and great insubstance and in power.

1399
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.100
Discomfortable cousin.

1400
01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.330
Know'st thou not that whenthe searching eye of heaven

1401
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:23.500
is hid behind the globe andlights the lower world,

1402
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.100
then thieves and robbersrange abroad unseen

1403
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:29.170
in murders and in outrage,boldly here.

1404
01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:31.870
But when from under thisterrestrial ball

1405
01:11:31.870 --> 01:11:35.100
he fires the proud tops ofthe eastern pines

1406
01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.900
and darts his lightthrough every guilty hole,

1407
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:40.830
then murders, treasons,and detested sins,

1408
01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.630
the cloak of night beingplucked from off their backs,

1409
01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:47.830
stand bare and naked,trembling at themselves?

1410
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:51.500
So when this thief, thistraitor, Bolingbroke,

1411
01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:54.670
who all this while hathreveled in the night

1412
01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:57.770
whilst we were wanderingwith the antipodes,

1413
01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:01.900
shall see us rising in ourthrone, the east.

1414
01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.370
His treasons will sitblushing on his face,

1415
01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:07.730
not able to endure thesight of day,

1416
01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:12.070
but self-affrightedtremble at his sin.

1417
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:16.200
Not all the water in therough, rude sea

1418
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.170
can wash the balm off froman anointed king.

1419
01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:23.800
The breath of worldly mencannot depose

1420
01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.500
the deputy elected by theLord.

1421
01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.870
For every man thatBolingbroke hath pressed

1422
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:31.970
to lift shrewd steelagainst our golden crown,

1423
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:37.670
God for his Richard hathin heavenly pay a gloriousangel.

1424
01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:40.230
Then, if angels fight,

1425
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.830
weak men must fall,

1426
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:46.600
for heaven still guardsthe right.

1427
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.770
Welcome, my lord.

1428
01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:49.770
How far off lies yourpower?

1429
01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:52.100
Nor near nor farther off,my gracious lord,

1430
01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.130
than this weak arm.

1431
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:55.700
Discomfort guides mytongue

1432
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.400
and bids me speak ofnothing but despair.

1433
01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.530
One day too late, I fearme, gracious Lord,

1434
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:03.800
hath clouded all thy happydays on earth.

1435
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.470
Oh, call back yesterday.

1436
01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:06.700
Bid time return,

1437
01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.400
and thou shalt have 12,000fighting men.

1438
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.930
Today, today-- unhappyday, too late--

1439
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:18.470
o'erthrows thy joys, friends,fortune, and thy state.

1440
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:21.730
For all the Welshmen,hearing thou wert dead,

1441
01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.130
are gone to Bolingbroke,dispersed and fled.

1442
01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.270
Comfort, my liege.

1443
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:31.570
Why looks Your Grace sopale?

1444
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:34.770
But now the blood of 20,000men did triumph in my face,

1445
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:38.030
and they are fled.

1446
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:41.070
And till so much bloodthither come again,

1447
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:44.870
Have I not reason to lookpale and dead?

1448
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:49.770
All souls that will besafe fly from my side,

1449
01:13:49.770 --> 01:13:53.000
for time hath set a blotupon my pride.

1450
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.030
Comfort, my liege.

1451
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.100
Remember who you are.

1452
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.900
I had forgot myself.

1453
01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.270
Am I not king?

1454
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.130
Awake, thou cowardmajesty.

1455
01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:06.430
Thou sleepest.

1456
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:10.170
Is not the king's name20,000 names?

1457
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:12.300
Arm, arm, my name.

1458
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:16.200
A puny subject strikes atthy great glory.

1459
01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.770
Look not to the ground, yefavorites of a king.

1460
01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:21.200
Are we not high?

1461
01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.830
High be our thoughts.

1462
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:26.570
I know my uncle York hathpower enough to serve ourturn.

1463
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:27.770
But who comes here?

1464
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:33.170
More health and happinessbetide my liege

1465
01:14:33.170 --> 01:14:35.630
than can my care-tunedtongue deliver him.

1466
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:40.530
Mine ear is open and myheart prepared.

1467
01:14:40.530 --> 01:14:44.700
The worst is worldly lossthou canst unfold.

1468
01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:47.700
Say, is my kingdom lost?

1469
01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.100
Why, 'twas my care.

1470
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.430
And what loss is it to berid of care?

1471
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:55.870
Strives Bolingbroke to beas great as we?

1472
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:57.870
Greater he shall not be.

1473
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:59.170
If he serve God,

1474
01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:02.500
we'll serve Him, too, andbe His fellow so.

1475
01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.670
Revolt our subjects?

1476
01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:06.800
That we cannot mend.

1477
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.900
They break their faith toGod as well as us.

1478
01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:15.830
Cry woe, destruction,ruin, and decay.

1479
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:20.730
The worst is death, anddeath will have his day.

1480
01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:22.270
Glad am I that YourHighness

1481
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:25.130
is so armed to bear thetidings of calamity.

1482
01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.370
Like an unseasonablestormy day

1483
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:33.500
which makes the silverrivers drown their shores,

1484
01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:36.700
as if the world were alldissolved to tears,

1485
01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.730
so high above his limitsswells the rage ofBolingbroke,

1486
01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:42.370
covering your fearful land

1487
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.400
with hard, bright steel andhearts harder than steel.

1488
01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:50.770
Whitebeards have armed theirthin and hairless scalps

1489
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:52.300
against thy majesty.

1490
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:56.030
Boys with women's voicesstrive to speak big

1491
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:57.470
and clap their femalejoints

1492
01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.700
in stiff, unwieldy armsagainst thy crown.

1493
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.630
Thy very beadsmen learn tobend their bows

1494
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:05.000
of double-fatal yewagainst thy state.

1495
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.900
Yea, distaff women managerusty bills against thy seat.

1496
01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:12.530
Both young and old rebel,

1497
01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:15.370
and all goes worse than Ihave power to tell.

1498
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:22.800
Too well, too well thoutell'st a tale so ill.

1499
01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:31.070
Where is the earl ofWiltshire?

1500
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.130
Where is Bagot?

1501
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:35.330
What is become of Bushy?

1502
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:37.200
Where is Green,

1503
01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.500
that they have let thedangerous enemy

1504
01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:42.370
measure our confines withsuch peaceful steps?

1505
01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:45.570
If we prevail, their headsshall pay for it.

1506
01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:48.000
I warrant they have madepeace with Bolingbroke.

1507
01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.170
Peace have they made withhim indeed, my lord.

1508
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:52.400
Oh, villains!

1509
01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.530
Vipers damned withoutredemption!

1510
01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:00.230
Dogs easily won to fawn onany man.

1511
01:17:00.230 --> 01:17:05.200
Snakes, in my heart bloodwarmed, that sting my heart.

1512
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.770
Three Judases, each onethrice worse than Judas.

1513
01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:10.700
Would they make peace?

1514
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.900
Terrible hell make war

1515
01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:15.070
upon their spotted soulsfor this offence.

1516
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:17.330
Sweet love, I see changinghis property

1517
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.830
turns to the sourest andmost deadly hate.

1518
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:24.000
Again uncurse their souls.

1519
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.870
Their peace is made withheads and not with hands.

1520
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:28.970
Those whom you curse

1521
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:31.800
have felt the worst ofdeath's destroying wound

1522
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:36.830
and lie full low, gravedin the hollow ground.

1523
01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.830
Is Bushy, Green, and theearl of Wiltshire dead?

1524
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:52.330
Aye, all of them atBristol lost their heads.

1525
01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:56.270
Where is the duke, myfather, with his power?

1526
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.630
No matter where.

1527
01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.870
Of comfort no man speak.

1528
01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:11.130
Let's talk of graves, ofworms, and epitaphs.

1529
01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:14.000
Make dust our paper,

1530
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.300
and with rainy eyes writesorrow on the bosom ofthe earth.

1531
01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:27.630
Let's choose executors andtalk of wills.

1532
01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:28.700
And yet not so,

1533
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.400
for what can we bequeath,

1534
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:35.300
save our deposed bodies tothe ground?

1535
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:41.530
Our lands, our lives, andall are Bolingbroke's,

1536
01:18:41.530 --> 01:18:45.500
and nothing can we callour own but death

1537
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.900
and that small model ofthe barren earth

1538
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.530
which serves as paste andcover to our bones.

1539
01:18:54.030 --> 01:19:00.200
For God's sake, let us situpon the ground

1540
01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:06.130
and tell sad stories ofthe death of kings:

1541
01:19:06.130 --> 01:19:08.830
how some have beendeposed,

1542
01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:11.870
some slain in war,

1543
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:16.630
some haunted by the ghoststhey have deposed,

1544
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:19.870
some poisoned by theirwives,

1545
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:24.030
some sleeping killed.

1546
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:27.670
All murdered.

1547
01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:30.100
For within the hollowcrown

1548
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.400
that rounds the mortaltemples of a king

1549
01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.900
keeps death his court.

1550
01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:40.600
And there the antic sits,

1551
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:46.030
scoffing his state andgrinning at his pomp,

1552
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:47.800
allowing him a breath,

1553
01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:55.730
a little scene tomonarchize, be feared, andkill with looks,

1554
01:19:55.730 --> 01:20:01.100
infusing him with self andvain conceit,

1555
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:08.000
as if this flesh whichwalls about our life

1556
01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.300
were brass impregnable,

1557
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:19.430
and humored thus, comes atthe last,

1558
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:28.000
and with a little pinbores through his castlewall,

1559
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:33.030
and farewell king.

1560
01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:40.030
Cover your heads

1561
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:44.270
and mock not flesh and bloodwith solemn reverence.

1562
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:52.800
Throw away respect,tradition, form, andceremonious duty,

1563
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:57.830
for you have but mistookme all this while.

1564
01:20:57.830 --> 01:21:02.970
I live with bread likeyou,

1565
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.030
feel want,

1566
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.870
taste grief,

1567
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:14.430
need friends.

1568
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:19.230
Subjected thus,

1569
01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:25.830
how can you say to me, Iam a king?

1570
01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:31.230
My lord, wise men ne'ersit and wail their woes,

1571
01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:34.670
but presently prevent theways to wail.

1572
01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:38.000
To fear the foe, sincefear oppresseth strength,

1573
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.230
gives in your weaknessstrength unto your foe,

1574
01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:42.770
and so your follies fightagainst yourself.

1575
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:44.370
Fear and be slain.

1576
01:21:44.370 --> 01:21:46.830
No worse can come tofight.

1577
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:50.130
And fight and die is deathdestroying death,

1578
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:54.570
where fearing dying paysdeath servile breath.

1579
01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:55.830
My father hath a power.

1580
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:58.830
Inquire of him and learnto make a body of a limb.

1581
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:01.630
Thou chidest me well.

1582
01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:03.970
Proud Bolingbroke,

1583
01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:08.970
I come to change blows withthee for our day of doom.

1584
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:11.830
This ague fit of fear isoverblown.

1585
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:14.930
An easy task it is to winour own.

1586
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.700
Say, Scroop, where liesour uncle with his power?

1587
01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.100
Speak sweetly, man,

1588
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.670
although thy looks besour.

1589
01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:25.030
Men judge by thecomplexion of the sky

1590
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:27.470
the state and inclinationof the day,

1591
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:30.100
and so may you by my dulland heavy eye.

1592
01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:33.970
My tongue hath but aheavier tale to say.

1593
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:35.170
I play the torturer,

1594
01:22:35.170 --> 01:22:36.200
by small and small

1595
01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.870
to lengthen out the worstthat must be spoken.

1596
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:43.330
Your uncle York is joinedwith Bolingbroke--

1597
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.830
and all your northerncastles yielded up,

1598
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:54.400
and all your southerngentlemen in arms upon hisparty.

1599
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.230
Thou hast said enough.

1600
01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:02.300
Beshrew thee, cousin,which didst lead me forth

1601
01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:05.570
of that sweet way I was into despair.

1602
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:09.970
What say you now?

1603
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:14.600
What comfort have we now?

1604
01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.330
By heaven, I'll hate himeverlastingly

1605
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:21.300
that bids me be of comfortanymore.

1606
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.930
Go to Flint Castle.

1607
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:25.900
There I'll pine away.

1608
01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:31.430
A king, woe's slave, shallkingly woe obey.

1609
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:37.630
That power I have,discharge,

1610
01:23:37.630 --> 01:23:41.200
and let them go to ear theland that hath some hopeto grow,

1611
01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.000
for I have none.

1612
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.670
Let no man speak again toalter this,

1613
01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:45.830
for counsel is but vain.

1614
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:46.830
My liege, one word--

1615
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:48.130
He does me double wrong

1616
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:51.070
that wounds me with theflatteries of his tongue.

1617
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:55.470
Discharge my followers!

1618
01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:58.930
Let them hence away

1619
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:05.130
from Richard's night toBolingbroke's fair day.

1620
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:14.100
intelligence

1621
01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:17.270
we learn the Welshmen aredispersed

1622
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:20.070
and Salisbury is gone tomeet the king,

1623
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:24.000
who lately landed withsome few private friendsupon this coast.

1624
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:29.030
The news is very fair andgood, my lord.

1625
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.170
Richard not far from hencehath hid his head.

1626
01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:33.900
It would beseem the lordNorthumberland

1627
01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.770
to say "King Richard."

1628
01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:38.070
Alack the heavy day

1629
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:41.130
when such a sacred kingshould hide his head.

1630
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:42.370
Your Grace mistakes.

1631
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:45.030
Only to be brief left Ihis title out.

1632
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:46.270
The time hath been,

1633
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:48.500
would you have been sobrief with him,

1634
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.830
he would have been so briefwith you, to shorten you,

1635
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:55.500
for taking so the head,your whole head's length.

1636
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:58.200
Mistake not, Uncle,further than you should--

1637
01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:01.570
Take not, good cousin,further than you should,

1638
01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:04.730
lest you mistake theheavens are o'er ourheads.

1639
01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:08.470
I know it, Uncle, andoppose not myself againsttheir will.

1640
01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:11.170
But who comes here?

1641
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:12.730
Welcome, Harry.

1642
01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:14.700
What, will not this castleyield?

1643
01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:18.200
The castle royally ismanned, my lord, againstthy entrance.

1644
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:21.370
Royally?

1645
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:23.000
Why, it contains no king?

1646
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.230
Yes, my good lord, it dothcontain a king.

1647
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:29.970
King Richard lies within thelimits of yon lime and stone,

1648
01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.770
and with him are the lordAumerle,

1649
01:25:31.770 --> 01:25:34.100
Lord Salisbury, SirStephen Scroop,

1650
01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:35.930
besides a clergyman ofholy reverence--

1651
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:36.970
who, I cannot learn.

1652
01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:39.130
Oh, belike it is thebishop of Carlisle.

1653
01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:47.670
Noble lord, go to the ruderibs of that ancient castle.

1654
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:50.330
Through brazen trumpetsend the breath of parle

1655
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:52.870
into his ruined ears, andthus deliver:

1656
01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.500
Henry Bolingbroke, on bothhis knees,

1657
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.470
doth kiss King Richard'shand

1658
01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:02.200
and sends allegiance andtrue faith of heart

1659
01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:05.170
to his most royal person,

1660
01:26:05.170 --> 01:26:09.670
hither come even at his feetto lay my arms and power,

1661
01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:13.070
provided that mybanishment repealed

1662
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:16.300
and lands restored againbe freely granted.

1663
01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.900
If not, I'll use theadvantage of my power

1664
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.600
and lay the summer's dustwith showers of blood

1665
01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:27.370
rained from the wounds ofslaughtered Englishmen.

1666
01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:32.070
The which, how far offfrom the mind ofBolingbroke it is,

1667
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:34.570
such crimson tempestshould bedrench

1668
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:38.230
the fresh green lap offair King Richard's land,

1669
01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:40.900
my stooping duty tenderlyshall show.

1670
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Go.

1671
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.600
Signify as much,

1672
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.100
while here we march upon thegrassy carpet of this plain.

1673
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.630
Let's march without thenoise of threatening drum,

1674
01:26:56.630 --> 01:26:59.100
that from this castle'stattered battlements

1675
01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.270
our fair appointments maybe well perused.

1676
01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.770
Methinks King Richard andmyself should meet

1677
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:08.730
with no less terror

1678
01:27:08.730 --> 01:27:11.230
than the elements of fireand water,

1679
01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:13.400
when their thunderingshock at meeting

1680
01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.500
tears the cloudy cheeks ofheaven.

1681
01:27:16.500 --> 01:27:18.270
Be he the fire.

1682
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:21.230
I'll be the yieldingwater.

1683
01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:23.070
The rage be his,

1684
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:27.500
whilst on the earth I rainmy waters--

1685
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.870
on the earth, and not onhim.

1686
01:27:34.770 --> 01:27:37.000
March on,

1687
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.830
and mark King Richard howhe looks.

1688
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.530
See; see.

1689
01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.330
King Richard doth himselfappear,

1690
01:27:52.330 --> 01:27:54.970
as doth the blushing,discontented sun

1691
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:56.970
from out the fiery portalof the east,

1692
01:27:56.970 --> 01:28:00.170
when he perceives theenvious clouds are bent

1693
01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:03.270
to dim his glory and tostain the track

1694
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:05.270
of his bright passage tothe occident.

1695
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:07.600
Yet looks he like a king.

1696
01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:11.370
Behold his eye, as brightas is the eagle's,

1697
01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:15.300
lightens forth controllingmajesty.

1698
01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.470
Alack, alack, for woe,

1699
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:20.600
that any harm should stainso fair a show.

1700
01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.300
We are amazed

1701
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:26.830
and thus long have westood

1702
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:30.530
to watch the fearfulbending of thy knee,

1703
01:28:30.530 --> 01:28:34.700
because we thought ourselfthy lawful king.

1704
01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:36.800
And if we be,

1705
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.800
how dare thy joints forget

1706
01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.630
to pay their awful duty toour presence?

1707
01:28:42.630 --> 01:28:46.370
If we be not, show us thehand of God

1708
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:49.570
that hath dismissed usfrom our stewardship,

1709
01:28:49.570 --> 01:28:53.630
for well we know, no handof blood and bone

1710
01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:56.400
can gripe the sacredhandle of our scepter

1711
01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.200
unless he do profane,steal, or usurp.

1712
01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.670
And though you think thatall, as you have done,

1713
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:09.000
have torn their souls byturning them from us,

1714
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.230
and we are barren andbereft of friends,

1715
01:29:12.230 --> 01:29:16.470
yet know, my master, Godomnipotent,

1716
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:19.500
is mustering in hisclouds, on our behalf,

1717
01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:22.170
armies of pestilence,

1718
01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:27.970
and they shall strike yourchildren yet unborn andunbegot

1719
01:29:27.970 --> 01:29:31.030
that lift your vassalhands against my head

1720
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:35.670
and threat the glory of myprecious crown.

1721
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:42.530
Tell Bolingbroke-- foryond methinks he stands--

1722
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:49.300
that every stride he makesupon my land is dangeroustreason.

1723
01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:53.400
He is come to open thepurple testament ofbleeding war.

1724
01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:57.330
But ere the crown he looksfor live in peace,

1725
01:29:57.330 --> 01:30:00.830
10,000 bloody crowns ofmothers' sons

1726
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:04.330
shall ill become theflower of England's face,

1727
01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:06.800
change the complexion ofher maid-pale peace

1728
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.970
to scarlet indignation

1729
01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:13.900
and bedew her pastures'grass with faithfulEnglish blood.

1730
01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.770
The king of heaven forbidour lord the king

1731
01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:23.400
should so with civil anduncivil arms be rushed upon.

1732
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:31.200
Thy thrice noble cousin,Harry Bolingbroke,

1733
01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.300
doth humbly kiss thy hand.

1734
01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:37.130
And by the honorable tombhe swears,

1735
01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:41.370
that stands upon yourroyal grandsire's bones,

1736
01:30:41.370 --> 01:30:44.500
and by the royalties ofboth your bloods,

1737
01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.330
currents that spring fromone most gracious head,

1738
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:53.470
and by the buried hand ofwarlike Gaunt,

1739
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:56.470
and by the worth and honorof himself,

1740
01:30:56.470 --> 01:31:00.600
comprising all that may besworn or said,

1741
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:04.000
his coming hither hath nofurther scope

1742
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.300
than for his linealroyalties

1743
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:13.530
and to beg enfranchisementimmediate on his knees,

1744
01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:17.970
which on thy royal partygranted once,

1745
01:31:17.970 --> 01:31:20.830
his glittering arms hewill commend to rust,

1746
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:22.930
his barbed steeds tostables,

1747
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:26.970
and his heart to faithfulservice of Your Majesty.

1748
01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:36.370
This swears he, as he is aprince, is just.

1749
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:42.330
And, as I am a gentleman,I credit him.

1750
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:49.270
Northumberland, say thusthe king returns:

1751
01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:56.330
his noble cousin is rightwelcome hither

1752
01:31:56.330 --> 01:32:00.430
and all the number of hisfair demands

1753
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:04.670
shall be accomplishedwithout contradiction.

1754
01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:09.630
With all the graciousutterance that thou hast,

1755
01:32:09.630 --> 01:32:13.930
speak to his gentlehearing kind commends.

1756
01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:20.600
We do debase ourselves,cousin, do we not,

1757
01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:24.470
to look so poorly and tospeak so fair?

1758
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:25.770
Shall we call backNorthumberland

1759
01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:28.430
and send defiance to thetraitor, and so die?

1760
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:30.570
No, good my lord.

1761
01:32:30.570 --> 01:32:32.030
Let's fight with gentlewords

1762
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:34.500
till time lend friends andfriends their helpful swords.

1763
01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:36.700
Oh, God.

1764
01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:39.230
Oh, God, that e'er thistongue of mine

1765
01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:42.900
that laid the sentence ofdread banishment on yonproud man

1766
01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:47.000
should take it off againwith words of sooth.

1767
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.230
Oh, that I were as greatas is my grief

1768
01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:54.070
or lesser than my name,

1769
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:57.130
or that I could forgetwhat I have been

1770
01:32:57.130 --> 01:32:59.900
or not remember what Imust be now.

1771
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.870
Swell'st thou, proudheart?

1772
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:06.070
I'll give thee scope tobeat,

1773
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:10.630
since foes have scope tobeat both thee and me.

1774
01:33:10.630 --> 01:33:12.670
Northumberland comes backfrom Bolingbroke.

1775
01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:16.500
What must the king do now?

1776
01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.900
Must he submit?

1777
01:33:18.900 --> 01:33:21.330
The king shall do it.

1778
01:33:21.330 --> 01:33:22.570
Must he be deposed?

1779
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.030
The king shall becontented.

1780
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:29.770
Must he lose the name ofking?

1781
01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:34.670
O' God's name, let it go.

1782
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:43.330
I'll give my jewels for aset of beads,

1783
01:33:43.330 --> 01:33:46.570
my gorgeous palace for ahermitage,

1784
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:50.600
my gay apparel for analmsman's gown,

1785
01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.000
my figured goblets for adish of wood,

1786
01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.430
my scepter for a palmer'swalking staff,

1787
01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:02.700
my subjects for a pair ofcarved saints,

1788
01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:07.230
and my large kingdom for alittle grave--

1789
01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:10.230
a little, little grave.

1790
01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:14.930
An obscure grave.

1791
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:17.930
Or I'll be buried in theking's highway,

1792
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:19.900
some way of common trade,

1793
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.200
where subjects' feet

1794
01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:25.330
may hourly trample ontheir sovereign's head;

1795
01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:29.600
for on my heart they treadnow whilst I live,

1796
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.530
and buried once, why notupon my head?

1797
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:40.830
Aumerle, thou weep'st.

1798
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:42.030
My tenderhearted cousin,

1799
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:45.700
we'll make foul weatherwith despised tears.

1800
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:48.470
Our sighs and they shalllodge the summer corn

1801
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:51.770
and make a dearth in thisrevolting land.

1802
01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.830
Or shall we play thewantons with our woes

1803
01:34:57.830 --> 01:35:01.970
and make some pretty matchwith shedding tears,

1804
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:06.930
as thus to drop them stillupon one place

1805
01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:11.030
till they have fretted usa pair of graves withinthe earth

1806
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:13.770
and, therein laid--

1807
01:35:13.770 --> 01:35:16.970
there lies two kinsmen.

1808
01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:19.430
Dig their graves withweeping eyes.

1809
01:35:21.670 --> 01:35:24.370
Would not this ill dowell?

1810
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.930
Well,

1811
01:35:28.930 --> 01:35:33.370
well, I see I talk butidly, and you laugh at me.

1812
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:44.600
Most mighty prince, mylord Northumberland,

1813
01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.770
what says KingBolingbroke?

1814
01:35:47.770 --> 01:35:52.300
Will His Majesty giveRichard leave to live tillRichard die?

1815
01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:58.400
You make a leg, andBolingbroke says aye.

1816
01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:01.530
My lord, he doth attend inthe base court to speakwith you.

1817
01:36:01.530 --> 01:36:04.070
May it please you tocome down.

1818
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:08.600
Down.

1819
01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:11.100
Down I come,

1820
01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.770
like glistering Phaethon

1821
01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:18.830
wanting the manage ofunruly jades.

1822
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:23.570
In the base court?

1823
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:25.770
Base court, where kingsgrow base,

1824
01:36:25.770 --> 01:36:28.800
to come at traitors' callsand do them grace.

1825
01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:30.400
In the base court?

1826
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.670
Come down?

1827
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:33.270
Down, court;

1828
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:34.900
down, king;

1829
01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:39.670
for night owls shriekwhere mounting larksshould sing.

1830
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:42.430
What says His Majesty?

1831
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:45.230
Sorrow and grief of heartmake him speak fondly,

1832
01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:47.100
like a frantic man yet heis come.

1833
01:36:48.330 --> 01:36:51.800
Stand all apart and showfair duty to His Majesty.

1834
01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:03.770
My gracious lord.

1835
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:06.530
Fair cousin, you debaseyour princely knee

1836
01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:09.270
to make the base earthproud with kissing it.

1837
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:11.870
Me rather had my heartmight feel your love

1838
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:15.570
than my unpleased eye seeyour courtesy.

1839
01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:19.070
Up, cousin, up.

1840
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:22.970
Your heart is up, I know,thus high at least,

1841
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:26.270
although your knee be low.

1842
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:29.330
My gracious lord, I comebut for mine own.

1843
01:37:29.330 --> 01:37:34.600
Your own is yours, and Iam yours, and all.

1844
01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.770
So far be mine, my mostredoubted lord,

1845
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:41.170
as my true service shalldeserve your love.

1846
01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:43.970
Well you deserve.

1847
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:45.470
They well deserve to have

1848
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:48.430
that know the strongestand surest way to get.

1849
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:56.130
Uncle, give me your hands.

1850
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:59.000
Nay, dry your eyes.

1851
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.870
Tears show their loves,but want their remedies.

1852
01:38:03.370 --> 01:38:06.830
Cousin, I am too young tobe your father,

1853
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:10.030
though you are old enoughto be my heir.

1854
01:38:10.030 --> 01:38:13.430
What you will have, I'llgive, and willing too,

1855
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:17.830
for do we must what forcewill have us do.

1856
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:21.570
Set on towards London,cousin, is it so?

1857
01:38:21.570 --> 01:38:24.330
Yea, my good lord.

1858
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:26.600
Then I must not say no.

1859
01:38:38.670 --> 01:38:41.730
What sport shall we devisehere in this garden,

1860
01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:44.370
to drive away the heavythought of care?

1861
01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:46.930
Madam, we'll play atbowls.

1862
01:38:46.930 --> 01:38:49.670
'Twill make me think theworld is full of rubs,

1863
01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:52.570
and that my fortune runsagainst the bias.

1864
01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:55.030
Madam, we'll dance.

1865
01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:57.630
My legs can keep nomeasure in delight

1866
01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:01.330
when my poor heart nomeasure keeps in grief.

1867
01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:03.870
Therefore, no dancing,girl.

1868
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:06.170
Some other sport.

1869
01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:09.100
Madam, we'll tell tales.

1870
01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:11.530
Of sorrow or of joy?

1871
01:39:11.530 --> 01:39:12.970
Of either, madam.

1872
01:39:12.970 --> 01:39:14.930
Of neither, girl.

1873
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:17.930
For if of joy, beingaltogether wanting,

1874
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:20.500
it doth remember me themore of sorrow;

1875
01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:23.800
or if of grief, beingaltogether had,

1876
01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.270
it adds more sorrow to mywant of joy.

1877
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:30.930
For what I have I need notto repeat,

1878
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:33.400
and what I want it bootsnot to complain.

1879
01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.370
Madam, I'll sing.

1880
01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:39.970
'Tis well that thouhast cause,

1881
01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:43.700
but thou shouldst please mebetter wouldst thou weep.

1882
01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:48.300
I could weep, madam, wouldit do you good.

1883
01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:52.170
And I could sing, wouldweeping do me good,

1884
01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:54.400
and never borrow any tearof thee.

1885
01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:58.800
Here come the gardeners.

1886
01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:01.430
Let's step into the shadowof these trees.

1887
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:03.770
My wretchedness unto a rowof pins

1888
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:04.800
they'll talk of state,

1889
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.000
for everyone doth soagainst a change.

1890
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:10.300
Woe is forerun with woe.

1891
01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:15.000
Go, bind thou up yondangling apricocks,

1892
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.830
which, like unruly children,

1893
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:19.770
make their sire stoop withoppression

1894
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:21.130
of their prodigal weight.

1895
01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:26.500
Give some supportance tothe bending twigs.

1896
01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:30.130
Go thou and, like anexecutioner,

1897
01:40:30.130 --> 01:40:33.130
cut off the heads of toofast growing sprays

1898
01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:36.100
that look too lofty in ourcommonwealth.

1899
01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:39.030
All must be even in ourgovernment.

1900
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:40.100
You thus employed,

1901
01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:42.900
I will go root away thenoisome weeds,

1902
01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:45.670
which without profit suckthe soil's fertility

1903
01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:48.400
from the wholesomeflowers.

1904
01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.570
Why should we, in thecompass of a pale,

1905
01:40:51.570 --> 01:40:54.970
keep law and form and dueproportion,

1906
01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:57.830
showing, as in a model,our firm estate,

1907
01:40:57.830 --> 01:41:00.370
when our sea-walledgarden, the whole land,

1908
01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:02.130
is full of weeds,

1909
01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:04.200
her fairest flowers chokedup,

1910
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.400
her fruit trees allunpruned,

1911
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.030
her hedges ruined, herknots disordered,

1912
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:11.570
and her wholesome herbsswarming withcaterpillars?

1913
01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:13.070
Hold thy peace.

1914
01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:16.830
He who that hath sufferedthis disordered spring

1915
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:19.870
hath now himself met withthe fall of leaf.

1916
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:23.670
The weeds which his broad,spreading leaves did shelter,

1917
01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:26.200
that seemed in eating himto hold him up,

1918
01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:29.630
are plucked up root andall by Bolingbroke--

1919
01:41:29.630 --> 01:41:33.970
I mean the earl ofWiltshire, Bushy, Green.

1920
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:35.700
What, are they dead?

1921
01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:38.900
They are, and Bolingbroke hathseized the wasteful king.

1922
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:43.930
Oh, I am pressed to deaththrough want of speaking.

1923
01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:46.200
Thou, old Adam's likeness,

1924
01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.170
set to dress this garden,

1925
01:41:48.170 --> 01:41:52.100
how dares thy harsh rudetongue sound thisunpleasing news?

1926
01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:54.930
What Eve, what serpent,hath suggested thee

1927
01:41:54.930 --> 01:41:57.370
to make a second fall ofcursed man?

1928
01:41:57.370 --> 01:42:00.170
Why dost thou say KingRichard is deposed?

1929
01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:01.200
Darest thou,

1930
01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.600
thou little better thingthan earth,

1931
01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:05.800
divine his downfall?

1932
01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.130
Say, where, when, andhow camest thou by thisill tidings?

1933
01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:11.070
Speak, thou wretch.

1934
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:12.070
Pardon me, madam.

1935
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:13.800
Little joy have I tobreathe this news.

1936
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.270
Yet what I say is true.

1937
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:20.200
King Richard, he is in themighty hold of Bolingbroke.

1938
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:26.000
Their fortunes both areweighed.

1939
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.530
In your lord's scale isnothing but himself

1940
01:42:28.530 --> 01:42:31.330
and some few vanities thatmake him light.

1941
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:33.070
But in the balance ofgreat Bolingbroke,

1942
01:42:33.070 --> 01:42:35.830
besides himself, are allthe English peers.

1943
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:39.430
And with that odds heweighs King Richard down.

1944
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:41.030
Post you to London, andyou will find it so.

1945
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:43.770
I speak no more thaneveryone doth know.

1946
01:42:48.970 --> 01:42:55.070
Nimble mischance, that artso light of foot,

1947
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:58.130
does not thy embassagebelong to me,

1948
01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:01.730
and am I the last thatknows it?

1949
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:05.570
Oh, thou think'st to serveme last

1950
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:09.870
that I may longest keepthy sorrow in my breast.

1951
01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.200
Come, ladies, go,

1952
01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.070
to meet at London London'sking in woe.

1953
01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:27.230
What, was I born to this,

1954
01:43:28.130 --> 01:43:29.470
that my sad look

1955
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:33.030
should grace the triumphof great Bolingbroke?

1956
01:43:35.230 --> 01:43:39.300
Gardener, for telling methis news of woe,

1957
01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:43.200
pray God the plants thougraft'st may never grow.

1958
01:44:04.330 --> 01:44:07.130
Great duke of Lancaster,

1959
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:10.330
I come to thee from plumeplucked Richard,

1960
01:44:10.330 --> 01:44:13.270
who with willing souladopts thee heir,

1961
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:14.900
and his high scepteryields

1962
01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:17.030
to the possession of thyroyal hand.

1963
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:22.430
Ascend his throne,descending now from him,

1964
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:26.800
and long live Henry,fourth of that name.

1965
01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:30.830
Long live Henry, fourth ofthat name.

1966
01:44:33.730 --> 01:44:37.300
In God's name, I'll ascendthe regal throne.

1967
01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.370
Marry.

1968
01:44:38.370 --> 01:44:40.000
God forbid.

1969
01:44:41.730 --> 01:44:45.170
Worst in this royalpresence may I speak,

1970
01:44:45.170 --> 01:44:48.300
yet best beseeming me tospeak the truth.

1971
01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:50.570
Would God that any in thisnoble presence

1972
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:53.800
were enough noble to beupright judge of nobleRichard,

1973
01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.000
then true noblesse would

1974
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:59.130
learn him forbearance fromso foul a wrong.

1975
01:44:59.130 --> 01:45:02.530
What subject can givesentence on his king?

1976
01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:06.070
And who stands here thatis not Richard's subject?

1977
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:08.700
Thieves are not judged butthey are by to hear,

1978
01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.430
although apparent guilt beseen in them.

1979
01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:14.430
And shall the figure ofGod's majesty,

1980
01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:17.170
his captain, steward,deputy elect,

1981
01:45:17.170 --> 01:45:21.300
anointed, crowned, plantedmany years,

1982
01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:24.570
be judged by subject andinferior breath,

1983
01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:26.600
and he himself notpresent?

1984
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.830
Oh, forfend it, God,

1985
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:30.600
that in a Christianclimate

1986
01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:36.570
souls refined should showso heinous, black, obscenea deed.

1987
01:45:36.570 --> 01:45:37.570
Traitor!

1988
01:45:37.570 --> 01:45:41.070
I speak to subjects, and asubject speaks,

1989
01:45:41.070 --> 01:45:44.500
stirred up by God, thusboldly for his king.

1990
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:48.930
My lord of Hereford here,whom you call king,

1991
01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:52.130
is a foul traitor to proudHereford's king.

1992
01:45:52.130 --> 01:45:58.170
And if you crown him, letme prophesy.

1993
01:45:58.170 --> 01:46:02.900
The blood of English shallmanure the ground

1994
01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:07.200
and future ages groan forthis foul act.

1995
01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.130
Peace shall go sleep withTurks and infidels.

1996
01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:11.500
And in this seat of peace,

1997
01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.700
tumultuous wars shall kinwith kin and kind withkind confound.

1998
01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:19.170
Disorder, horror, fear, andmutiny shall here inhabit,

1999
01:46:19.170 --> 01:46:20.570
and this land be called

2000
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:25.030
the field of Golgotha anddead men's skulls.

2001
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:28.900
Oh, if you raise thishouse against this house,

2002
01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.900
it will the woefullestdivision prove

2003
01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:34.270
that ever fell upon thiscursed earth.

2004
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:39.400
Prevent it, resist it, letit not be so,

2005
01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:45.500
lest child, child's children,cry against you woe.

2006
01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:48.470
Well have you argued, sir,

2007
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:53.830
and, for your pains, ofcapital treason we arrestyou here.

2008
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:55.100
My lord of Westminster,

2009
01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:57.830
be it your charge to keep himsafely till his day of trial.

2010
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:05.630
May it please you, lords,to grant the commons' suit.

2011
01:47:05.630 --> 01:47:06.830
Aye!

2012
01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:13.030
Fetch hither Richard, thatin common view he maysurrender,

2013
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:15.400
so we shall proceedwithout suspicion.

2014
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:17.930
I will be his conduct.

2015
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:47.870
Alack, why am I sent forto a king

2016
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:50.470
before I have shook offthe regal thoughts

2017
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:52.230
wherewith I reigned?

2018
01:47:53.530 --> 01:47:55.130
I hardly yet have learned

2019
01:47:55.130 --> 01:47:59.600
to insinuate, flatter,bow, and bend my knee.

2020
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:04.570
Give sorrow leave awhileto tutor me to thissubmission.

2021
01:48:07.530 --> 01:48:10.670
Yet I well remember thefavors of these men.

2022
01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:14.270
Were they not mine?

2023
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:18.030
Did they not sometime cry,"all hail" to me?

2024
01:48:21.670 --> 01:48:25.700
So Judas did to Christ.

2025
01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:30.070
But he, in 12, found truthin all but 1.

2026
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.830
I, in 12,000, none.

2027
01:48:35.770 --> 01:48:37.800
God save the king!

2028
01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:45.130
Will no man say amen?

2029
01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:47.170
Am I both priest andclerk?

2030
01:48:47.170 --> 01:48:48.900
Well, then, amen.

2031
01:48:48.900 --> 01:48:51.900
God save the king.

2032
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.630
Although I be not he,

2033
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:59.970
and yet, amen, if heavendo think him me.

2034
01:49:02.130 --> 01:49:04.330
To do what service am Isent for hither?

2035
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:09.730
To do that office of thineown goodwill

2036
01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:12.270
which tired majesty didmake thee offer:

2037
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:16.730
the resignation of thystate and crown to HenryBolingbroke.

2038
01:49:16.730 --> 01:49:18.200
Give me the crown.

2039
01:49:31.670 --> 01:49:36.430
Here, cousin, seize thecrown.

2040
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:39.230
Here, cousin.

2041
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:44.800
On this side my hand, andon that side yours.

2042
01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.300
Now is this golden crownlike a deep well

2043
01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.970
that owes two buckets,filling one another,

2044
01:49:49.970 --> 01:49:53.030
the emptier ever dancingin the air,

2045
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:56.270
the other down, unseen,and full of water.

2046
01:49:56.270 --> 01:50:00.870
That bucket down and fullof tears am I,

2047
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:05.230
drinking my griefs whilstyou mount up on high.

2048
01:50:05.230 --> 01:50:08.100
I thought you had beenwilling to resign.

2049
01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:14.270
My crown I am, but stillmy griefs are mine.

2050
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:17.830
You may my glories and mystate depose,

2051
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:20.470
but not my griefs.

2052
01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:23.000
Still am I king of those.

2053
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:27.500
Part of your cares yougive me with your crown.

2054
01:50:27.500 --> 01:50:31.700
Your cares set up do notpluck my cares down.

2055
01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:36.170
My care is loss of care,by old care done.

2056
01:50:36.170 --> 01:50:41.000
Your care is gain of care,by new care won.

2057
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:46.630
The cares I give I have,though given away.

2058
01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:52.100
They tend the crown, yetstill with me they stay.

2059
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.070
Are you contented toresign the crown?

2060
01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:02.370
Aye.

2061
01:51:07.170 --> 01:51:08.670
No!

2062
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:14.670
No.

2063
01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:22.430
Aye, for I must nothingbe.

2064
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:28.800
Therefore no, no, for Iresign to thee.

2065
01:51:30.670 --> 01:51:35.600
Now, mark me, how I willundo myself.

2066
01:51:42.230 --> 01:51:45.930
I give this heavy weightfrom off my head

2067
01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:53.730
and this unwieldy scepterfrom my hand,

2068
01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:58.230
the pride of kingly swayfrom out my heart.

2069
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:03.700
With mine own tears I washaway my balm.

2070
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:10.970
With mine own hands I giveaway my crown.

2071
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:16.330
With mine own tongue denymy sacred state.

2072
01:52:16.330 --> 01:52:21.670
With mine own breathrelease all duty's oaths.

2073
01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:25.970
All pomp and majesty I doforswear.

2074
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:28.830
My manors, rents, revenuesI forego.

2075
01:52:30.170 --> 01:52:33.800
My acts, decrees, andstatutes I deny.

2076
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:39.370
God pardon all oaths thatare broke to me.

2077
01:52:40.830 --> 01:52:46.770
God keep all vows unbrokeare made to thee.

2078
01:52:48.430 --> 01:52:54.570
Make me that nothing havewith nothing grieved,

2079
01:52:54.570 --> 01:53:01.030
and thou with all pleasedthat hast all achieved.

2080
01:53:01.030 --> 01:53:05.600
Long mayst thou live inRichard's seat to sit,

2081
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.400
and soon lie Richard in anearthly pit.

2082
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:21.330
God save King Henry,unkinged Richard says,

2083
01:53:21.330 --> 01:53:26.470
and send him many years ofsunshine days.

2084
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.370
What more remains?

2085
01:53:32.370 --> 01:53:33.730
No more, but that you read

2086
01:53:33.730 --> 01:53:36.100
these accusations andthese grievous crimes

2087
01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:37.800
committed by your personand your followers

2088
01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:39.970
against the state andprofit of this land,

2089
01:53:39.970 --> 01:53:41.900
that, by confessing them,

2090
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:44.570
the souls of men may deemthat you are worthilydeposed.

2091
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:46.670
Must I do so?

2092
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:50.370
And must I ravel out myweaved-up follies?

2093
01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:54.170
Gentle Northumberland, if thyoffences were upon record,

2094
01:53:54.170 --> 01:53:56.500
would it not shame thee inso fair a troop

2095
01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:58.400
to read a lecture of them?

2096
01:53:58.400 --> 01:53:59.570
If thou wouldst,

2097
01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:01.830
there shouldst thou findone heinous article,

2098
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:03.600
containing the deposing ofa king

2099
01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.200
and cracking the strongwarrant of an oath,

2100
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:11.030
marked with a blot, damnedin the book of heaven.

2101
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:16.130
Nay, all of you that standand look upon me

2102
01:54:16.130 --> 01:54:19.300
whilst that my wretchednessdoth bait myself,

2103
01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:21.830
though some of you withPilate wash your hands,

2104
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:24.000
showing an outward pity.

2105
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:32.130
Yet you Pilates have heredelivered me to my sour cross,

2106
01:54:32.130 --> 01:54:35.630
and water cannot wash awayyour sin.

2107
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:36.630
My lord, dispatch.

2108
01:54:36.630 --> 01:54:38.800
Read o'er these articles.

2109
01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:42.400
Mine eyes are full oftears.

2110
01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.670
I cannot see.

2111
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:50.300
And yet salt water blindsthem not so much

2112
01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:53.200
but they can see a sort oftraitors here.

2113
01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:56.100
Nay, if I turn mine eyesupon myself,

2114
01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:57.830
I find myself a traitorwith the rest,

2115
01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:00.600
for I have given here mysoul's consent

2116
01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.230
to undeck the pompous bodyof a king,

2117
01:55:03.230 --> 01:55:06.200
made glory base andsovereignty a slave,

2118
01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:10.070
proud majesty a subject,state a peasant.

2119
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:11.070
My lord--

2120
01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:19.270
No lord of thine, thouhaught, insulting man,

2121
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:21.430
nor no man's lord.

2122
01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:27.100
I have no name, no title.

2123
01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:28.770
No, not that name wasgiven me at the font,

2124
01:55:28.770 --> 01:55:30.500
but 'tis usurped.

2125
01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:31.630
Alack the heavy day

2126
01:55:31.630 --> 01:55:33.830
that I have worn so manywinters out

2127
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:37.570
and know not now what nameto call myself.

2128
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:45.270
Oh, that I were a mockeryking of snow,

2129
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:50.430
standing before the sun ofBolingbroke,

2130
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:53.830
to melt myself away inwaterdrops.

2131
01:56:00.630 --> 01:56:10.000
Good king, great king, andyet not greatly good,

2132
01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.630
and if my word be sterlingyet in England,

2133
01:56:13.630 --> 01:56:17.200
let it command a mirrorhither straight,

2134
01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:23.030
that it may show me what aface I have

2135
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:26.000
since it is bankrupt ofHis Majesty.

2136
01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:30.130
Go some of you and fetch alooking glass.

2137
01:56:30.130 --> 01:56:32.100
Read o'er this paper whilethe glass doth come.

2138
01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:34.830
Fiend, thou torment'st meere I come to hell.

2139
01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:36.700
Urge it no more, my lordNorthumberland.

2140
01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.100
The commons then will notbe satisfied.

2141
01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:39.470
They shall be satisfied.

2142
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:42.300
I'll read enough when I dosee the very book indeed

2143
01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:45.630
where all my sins arewrit, and that's myself.

2144
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:49.170
Give me the glass,

2145
01:56:51.530 --> 01:56:53.630
and therein will I read.

2146
01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:05.170
No deeper wrinkles yet?

2147
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:10.530
Hath sorrow struck so manyblows upon this face of mine,

2148
01:57:11.530 --> 01:57:14.500
and made no deeper wounds?

2149
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:19.230
Oh, flattering glass,

2150
01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:21.570
like to my followers inprosperity,

2151
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:23.400
thou dost beguile me.

2152
01:57:26.130 --> 01:57:29.830
Was this face the face

2153
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:33.000
that every day under hishousehold roof

2154
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.500
did keep 10,000 men?

2155
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:45.670
Was this the face that,like the sun, did makebeholders wink?

2156
01:57:47.970 --> 01:57:53.200
Is this the face whichfaced so many follies

2157
01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:57.600
that was at last outfacedby Bolingbroke?

2158
01:58:01.230 --> 01:58:03.730
A brittle glory shineth inthis face,

2159
01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:10.470
as brittle as the glory isthe face.

2160
01:58:14.130 --> 01:58:19.630
For there it lies, crackedin a hundred shivers.

2161
01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:28.700
Mark, silent king, themoral of this sport.

2162
01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:34.270
How soon my sorrow hathdestroyed my face.

2163
01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:39.070
The shadow of your sorrowhath destroyed

2164
01:58:39.070 --> 01:58:41.330
the shadow of your face.

2165
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:42.670
Say that again.

2166
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.670
The shadow of my sorrow.

2167
01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:48.230
Ha!

2168
01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:53.530
Let's see.

2169
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:56.000
'Tis very true.

2170
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.500
My grief lies all within.

2171
01:58:59.500 --> 01:59:02.730
And these external mannersof lament

2172
01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:07.200
are merely shadows to theunseen grief

2173
01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:12.970
that swells with silencein the tortured soul.

2174
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:17.030
There lies the substance,

2175
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:23.770
and I thank thee, king,for thy great bounty

2176
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:27.200
that not only givest mecause to wail

2177
01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:31.230
but teachest me the wayhow to lament the cause.

2178
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:39.200
I'll beg one boon, andthen be gone and troubleyou no more.

2179
01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:40.200
Shall I obtain it?

2180
01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.300
Name it, fair cousin.

2181
01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:44.100
Fair cousin?

2182
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:47.800
I am greater than a king,

2183
01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.670
for when I was a king,

2184
01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:53.430
my flatterers were thenbut subjects.

2185
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:58.170
Being now a subject, I havea king here to myflatterer.

2186
01:59:58.170 --> 02:00:02.370
Being so great, I have noneed to beg.

2187
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:05.900
Yet ask.

2188
02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:07.500
And shall I have?

2189
02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.870
You shall.

2190
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:10.830
Then give me leave to go.

2191
02:00:12.230 --> 02:00:13.230
Whither?

2192
02:00:13.230 --> 02:00:21.370
Whither you will, so Iwere from your sights.

2193
02:00:21.370 --> 02:00:24.700
Go, some of you convey himto the tower.

2194
02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:29.830
Oh, good.

2195
02:00:29.830 --> 02:00:33.100
Convey?

2196
02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:37.070
Conveyers are you all

2197
02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:43.600
that rise thus nimbly by atrue king's fall.

2198
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:55.070
On Wednesday next, wesolemnly set down ourcoronation.

2199
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:56.800
Lords, prepare yourselves.

2200
02:00:57.730 --> 02:01:01.130
God save the king!

2201
02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:03.630
God save the king!

2202
02:01:07.070 --> 02:01:09.930
A woeful pageant have wehere beheld.

2203
02:01:09.930 --> 02:01:12.470
The woe's to come.

2204
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:15.030
The children yet unborn

2205
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:17.970
shall feel this day assharp to them as thorn.

2206
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:28.430
You holy clergymen, isthere no plot

2207
02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:31.730
to rid the realm of thispernicious blot?

2208
02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.470
This way the king willcome.

2209
02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:47.700
This is the way to JuliusCaesar's ill-erected tower,

2210
02:01:47.700 --> 02:01:50.400
to whose flint bosom mycondemned lord

2211
02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.370
is doomed a prisoner byproud Bolingbroke.

2212
02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:59.330
Here let us rest, if thisrebellious earth

2213
02:01:59.330 --> 02:02:02.230
have any resting for hertrue king's queen.

2214
02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:10.670
But soft, but see, orrather do not see,

2215
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:14.230
my fair rose wither.

2216
02:02:14.230 --> 02:02:17.070
Yet look up, behold,

2217
02:02:17.070 --> 02:02:19.670
that you in pity maydissolve to dew

2218
02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:23.330
and wash him fresh againwith true love tears.

2219
02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:27.470
Ah, thou, the model whereold Troy did stand,

2220
02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:33.300
thou map of honor, thouKing Richard's tomb,

2221
02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:36.400
and not King Richard.

2222
02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.570
Thou most beauteous inn,

2223
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:40.700
why should hard-favoredgrief be lodged in thee,

2224
02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:43.100
when triumph is become analehouse guest?

2225
02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.670
Join not with grief, fairwoman.

2226
02:02:45.670 --> 02:02:49.130
Do not so, to make my endtoo sudden.

2227
02:02:49.130 --> 02:02:51.300
Learn, good soul,

2228
02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:55.400
to think our former statea happy dream,

2229
02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.670
from which awaked,

2230
02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:01.830
the truth of what we areshows us but this.

2231
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:05.500
I am sworn brother, sweet,to grim necessity,

2232
02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:08.300
and he and I will keep aleague till death.

2233
02:03:09.570 --> 02:03:13.900
Hie thee to France andcloister thee in somereligious house.

2234
02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:17.870
Our holy lives must win anew world's crown,

2235
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:24.200
which our profane hourshere have stricken down.

2236
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:27.800
What, is my Richard bothin shape and mind

2237
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.630
transformed and weakened?

2238
02:03:30.630 --> 02:03:34.030
Hath Bolingbroke deposedthine intellect?

2239
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:36.500
Hath he been in thy heart?

2240
02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.400
The lion dying thrustethforth his paw

2241
02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.430
and wounds the earth, ifnothing else,

2242
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:44.100
with rage to beo'erpower'd.

2243
02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:46.600
And wilt thou, pupil-like,

2244
02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:50.170
take the correctionmildly, kiss the rod,

2245
02:03:50.170 --> 02:03:53.070
and fawn on rage with basehumility,

2246
02:03:53.070 --> 02:03:56.800
which art a lion and theking of beasts?

2247
02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:00.600
King of beasts indeed.

2248
02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:05.170
If aught but beasts, Ihad still been a happyking of men.

2249
02:04:06.630 --> 02:04:11.930
Good sometimes queen, preparethee hence for France.

2250
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:16.530
Think I am dead and thateven here thou takest,

2251
02:04:16.530 --> 02:04:19.330
as from my deathbed, thylast living leave.

2252
02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:23.670
In winter's tediousnights,

2253
02:04:23.670 --> 02:04:26.100
sit by the fire with goodold folks

2254
02:04:26.100 --> 02:04:30.230
and let them tell theetales of woeful ages longago betid.

2255
02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:35.270
And ere thou bid good night,to quit their griefs,

2256
02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:39.030
tell thou the lamentabletale of me

2257
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:42.730
and send the hearersweeping to their beds.

2258
02:04:42.730 --> 02:04:45.300
For why, the senselessbrands will sympathize

2259
02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:47.900
the heavy accent of thymoving tongue

2260
02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:52.230
and in compassion weep thefire out.

2261
02:04:52.230 --> 02:04:56.770
And some will mourn inashes, some coal black,

2262
02:04:56.770 --> 02:05:00.970
for the deposing of arightful king.

2263
02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:05.170
My lord, the mind ofBolingbroke is changed.

2264
02:05:05.170 --> 02:05:07.600
You must to Pomfret, notunto the tower.

2265
02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.070
And, madam, there is orderta'en for you.

2266
02:05:09.070 --> 02:05:12.270
With all swift speed youmust away to France.

2267
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:15.630
Northumberland, thouladder wherewithal

2268
02:05:15.630 --> 02:05:18.030
the mounting Bolingbrokeascends my throne,

2269
02:05:18.030 --> 02:05:20.670
the time shall not be manyhours of age

2270
02:05:20.670 --> 02:05:23.630
more than it is ere foulsin gathering head

2271
02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:26.000
shall break intocorruption.

2272
02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.200
Thou shalt think,

2273
02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:30.330
though he divide the realmand give thee half,

2274
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:34.070
it is too little, helpinghim to all.

2275
02:05:34.070 --> 02:05:35.970
And he shall think thatthou

2276
02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:38.330
which know'st the way toplant unrightful kings

2277
02:05:38.330 --> 02:05:41.630
wilt know again, beingne'er so little urged,

2278
02:05:41.630 --> 02:05:44.400
another way to pluck himheadlong

2279
02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:46.770
from the usurped throne.

2280
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:50.470
The love of wicked menconverts to fear,

2281
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:52.230
that fear to hate,

2282
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:53.930
and hate turns one or both

2283
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:57.470
to worthy danger anddeserved death.

2284
02:05:57.470 --> 02:06:03.270
My guilt be on my head,and there an end.

2285
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:05.830
Take leave and part, foryou must part forthwith.

2286
02:06:05.830 --> 02:06:07.070
Doubly divorced.

2287
02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:10.430
Bad men, you violate atwofold marriage,

2288
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:12.200
'twixt my crown and me,

2289
02:06:12.200 --> 02:06:15.670
and then betwixt me and mymarried wife.

2290
02:06:15.670 --> 02:06:18.830
Let me unkiss the oath'twixt thee and me.

2291
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:28.300
And yet not so, for with akiss 'twas made.

2292
02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:30.870
Part us, Northumberland--

2293
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:32.200
I toward the north,

2294
02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:35.730
where shivering cold andsickness pines the clime.

2295
02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:37.030
My wife to France,

2296
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:40.570
from whence, set forth inpomp,

2297
02:06:40.570 --> 02:06:44.570
she came adorned hitherlike sweet May,

2298
02:06:44.570 --> 02:06:47.830
sent back like Hallowmasor short'st of day.

2299
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:48.830
And must we be divided?

2300
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:49.930
Must we part?

2301
02:06:49.930 --> 02:06:57.930
Aye, hand from hand, mylove, and heart from heart.

2302
02:06:57.930 --> 02:07:00.670
Banish us both and sendthe king with me.

2303
02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:03.130
That were some love butlittle policy.

2304
02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:05.400
Then whither he goes,thither let me go.

2305
02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:09.230
So two, together weeping,make one woe.

2306
02:07:09.230 --> 02:07:12.800
Weep thou for me inFrance, I for thee here.

2307
02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:16.600
Better far off than near,be ne'er the near.

2308
02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:19.530
Go, count thy way withsighs.

2309
02:07:19.530 --> 02:07:21.670
I mine with groans.

2310
02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:27.430
So longest way shall havethe longest moans.

2311
02:07:27.430 --> 02:07:31.830
Twice for one step I'llgroan, the way being short,

2312
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:34.830
and piece the way out witha heavy heart.

2313
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:37.870
Come, come, in wooingsorrow let's be brief,

2314
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:40.400
since, wedding it, thereis such length in grief.

2315
02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:44.530
One kiss shall stop ourmouths, and dumbly part.

2316
02:07:49.170 --> 02:07:51.900
Thus give I mine, and thustake I thy heart.

2317
02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:53.770
Give me mine own again.

2318
02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:58.130
'Twere no good part totake on me to keep andkill thy heart.

2319
02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.670
Now I have mine own again.

2320
02:08:08.670 --> 02:08:13.470
Be gone that I may striveto kill it with a groan.

2321
02:08:18.230 --> 02:08:22.470
We make woe wanton withthis fond delay.

2322
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:25.200
Once more, adieu.

2323
02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.130
The rest let sorrow say.

2324
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:34.470
My lord,

2325
02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:39.070
you told me you would tellthe rest,

2326
02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:41.670
when weeping made youbreak the story off,

2327
02:08:41.670 --> 02:08:44.730
of our two cousins cominginto London.

2328
02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:45.730
Where did I leave?

2329
02:08:45.730 --> 02:08:49.070
At that sad stop, my lord,

2330
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:52.430
where rude, misgovernedhands from windows' tops

2331
02:08:52.430 --> 02:08:57.570
threw dust and rubbish onKing Richard's head.

2332
02:08:57.570 --> 02:09:00.930
Then, as I said, the duke,great Bolingbroke,

2333
02:09:00.930 --> 02:09:03.570
mounted upon a hot andfiery steed,

2334
02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:06.330
which his aspiring riderseemed to know,

2335
02:09:06.330 --> 02:09:09.100
with slow but stately pacekept on his course,

2336
02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:13.130
whilst all tongues cried "Godsave thee, Bolingbroke."

2337
02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:16.570
You would have thought thevery windows spake,

2338
02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:19.170
so many greedy looks ofyoung and old

2339
02:09:19.170 --> 02:09:21.400
through casements dartedtheir desiring eyes

2340
02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:22.730
upon his visage,

2341
02:09:22.730 --> 02:09:24.970
and that all the wallswith painted imagery

2342
02:09:24.970 --> 02:09:26.970
had said at once "Jesupreserve thee.

2343
02:09:26.970 --> 02:09:29.870
Welcome, Bolingbroke."

2344
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:33.130
Whilst he, from the oneside to the other turning,

2345
02:09:33.130 --> 02:09:34.630
bareheaded,

2346
02:09:34.630 --> 02:09:37.230
lower than his proudsteed's neck,

2347
02:09:37.230 --> 02:09:39.070
bespake them thus:

2348
02:09:39.070 --> 02:09:41.030
"I thank thee,countrymen."

2349
02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:44.570
And thus still doing, thushe passed along.

2350
02:09:44.570 --> 02:09:48.570
Alack, poor Richard.

2351
02:09:48.570 --> 02:09:50.570
Where rode he the whilst?

2352
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:54.170
As in a theatre, the eyesof men,

2353
02:09:54.170 --> 02:09:56.900
after a well-graced actorleaves the stage,

2354
02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:59.170
are idly bent on him thatenters next,

2355
02:09:59.170 --> 02:10:01.870
thinking his prattle to betedious.

2356
02:10:01.870 --> 02:10:05.230
Even so, but with muchmore contempt,

2357
02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:08.170
did men's eyes scowl ongentle Richard.

2358
02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:09.970
No man cried, "God savehim."

2359
02:10:09.970 --> 02:10:12.900
No joyful tongue gave himhis welcome home.

2360
02:10:15.970 --> 02:10:21.370
But dust was thrown uponhis sacred head,

2361
02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:27.970
which with such gentlesorrow he shook off,

2362
02:10:27.970 --> 02:10:32.300
his face still combatingwith tears and smiles,

2363
02:10:32.300 --> 02:10:36.570
the badges of his griefand patience,

2364
02:10:36.570 --> 02:10:38.770
that had not God, for somestrong purpose,

2365
02:10:38.770 --> 02:10:41.030
steeled the hearts of men,they must perforce havemelted,

2366
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:44.500
and barbarism itself havepitied him.

2367
02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.300
But heaven hath a hand inthese events,

2368
02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:49.570
to whose high will webound our calm contents.

2369
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:55.130
To Bolingbroke we aresworn subjects now,

2370
02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:57.270
whose state and honor Ifor aye allow.

2371
02:10:59.670 --> 02:11:01.670
Here comes my son Aumerle.

2372
02:11:01.670 --> 02:11:02.900
Aumerle that was.

2373
02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:04.630
But that is lost for beingRichard's friend.

2374
02:11:04.630 --> 02:11:07.470
And, madam, you must callhim Rutland now.

2375
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:10.130
I am in parliament pledgefor his truth

2376
02:11:10.130 --> 02:11:13.100
and lasting fealty to thenew made king.

2377
02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.570
Welcome, my son.

2378
02:11:16.770 --> 02:11:19.300
Who are the violets now

2379
02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:23.330
that strew the green lapof the new come spring?

2380
02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:26.670
Madam, I know not, nor Igreatly care not.

2381
02:11:26.670 --> 02:11:28.230
God knows I had as lief benone as one.

2382
02:11:28.230 --> 02:11:30.770
Well, bear you well inthis new spring of time,

2383
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:33.400
lest you be cropped beforeyou come to prime.

2384
02:11:36.300 --> 02:11:38.100
What news from Oxford?

2385
02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:40.200
Those jousts and triumphshold?

2386
02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.670
For aught I know, my lord,they do.

2387
02:11:41.670 --> 02:11:43.970
You will be there, I know.

2388
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:45.530
If God prevent not, Ipurpose so.

2389
02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.800
What seal is that, thathangs without thy bosom?

2390
02:11:49.470 --> 02:11:52.630
Yea, look'st thou pale?

2391
02:11:52.630 --> 02:11:54.030
Let me see the writing.

2392
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:55.930
My lord, 'tis nothing.

2393
02:11:55.930 --> 02:11:58.770
No matter, then, who seeit.

2394
02:11:58.770 --> 02:12:00.330
I will be satisfied.

2395
02:12:00.330 --> 02:12:01.930
Let me see the writing.

2396
02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:05.400
I do beseech Your Grace topardon me.

2397
02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.930
It is a matter of smallconsequence,

2398
02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:09.800
which for some reasons Iwould not have seen.

2399
02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:14.770
Which for some reasons,sir, I mean to see.

2400
02:12:14.770 --> 02:12:17.800
I fear--I fear--

2401
02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:19.400
What should you fear?

2402
02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.330
'Tis nothing but some bond

2403
02:12:22.330 --> 02:12:25.530
that he is entered intofor gay apparel againstthe triumph day.

2404
02:12:25.530 --> 02:12:26.600
Bound to himself.

2405
02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:28.970
What doth he with a bondthat he is bound to?

2406
02:12:28.970 --> 02:12:29.970
Wife, thou art a fool.

2407
02:12:29.970 --> 02:12:33.570
Boy, boy, let me see thewriting.

2408
02:12:33.570 --> 02:12:35.070
I do beseech you, pardonme.

2409
02:12:35.070 --> 02:12:36.100
I may not show it.

2410
02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:37.370
I will be satisfied.

2411
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:38.400
Let me see it, I say.

2412
02:12:47.370 --> 02:12:49.730
Treason.

2413
02:12:49.730 --> 02:12:51.070
Foul treason.

2414
02:12:53.100 --> 02:12:54.900
Villain.

2415
02:12:54.900 --> 02:12:56.230
Traitor.

2416
02:12:56.230 --> 02:12:57.370
Slave.

2417
02:12:57.370 --> 02:12:58.370
My lord, what is thematter?

2418
02:12:58.370 --> 02:12:59.370
Ho.

2419
02:12:59.370 --> 02:13:00.670
Who is within there?

2420
02:13:00.670 --> 02:13:02.100
Saddle my horse.

2421
02:13:02.100 --> 02:13:04.330
God for his mercy, whattreachery is here.

2422
02:13:04.330 --> 02:13:05.400
Why, what is it, my lord?

2423
02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:07.530
Bring me my boots, I say.

2424
02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:09.270
Saddle my horse.

2425
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:12.670
Now, upon mine honor, bymy life, my troth,

2426
02:13:12.670 --> 02:13:14.300
I will appeach thevillain.

2427
02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:15.300
What is the matter?

2428
02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:16.300
Peace, foolish woman.

2429
02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:17.970
I will not peace.

2430
02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:19.070
What is the matter,Aumerle?

2431
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:20.370
Good Mother, be content.

2432
02:13:20.370 --> 02:13:22.970
It is no more than my poorlife must answer.

2433
02:13:22.970 --> 02:13:24.400
Thy life answer.

2434
02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:26.800
Bring me my boots.

2435
02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:28.470
I will unto the king.

2436
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:29.470
Strike him, Aumerle.

2437
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:31.500
Poor boy, thou art amazed.

2438
02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:33.430
Hence, villain.

2439
02:13:33.430 --> 02:13:35.170
Never more come in mysight.

2440
02:13:35.170 --> 02:13:36.170
Give me my boots, I say.

2441
02:13:36.170 --> 02:13:38.000
Why, York, what wilt thoudo?

2442
02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Wilt thou not hide thetrespass of thine own?

2443
02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.970
Have we more sons or arewe like to have?

2444
02:13:44.970 --> 02:13:48.330
Is not my teeming datedrunk up with time?

2445
02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:50.930
And wilt thou pluck myfair son from mine age

2446
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:53.870
and rob me of a happymother's name?

2447
02:13:53.870 --> 02:13:55.170
Is he not like thee?

2448
02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:56.700
Is he not thine own?

2449
02:13:56.700 --> 02:13:58.200
Thou fond, mad woman,

2450
02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.300
wilt thou conceal thisdark conspiracy?

2451
02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.870
A dozen of them here haveta'en the sacrament

2452
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:05.830
and interchangeably setdown their hands

2453
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:08.000
to kill the king atOxford.

2454
02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:12.070
He shall be none.

2455
02:14:12.070 --> 02:14:13.070
We will keep him here.

2456
02:14:13.070 --> 02:14:14.770
Then what is that to him?

2457
02:14:14.770 --> 02:14:16.230
Away, fond woman.

2458
02:14:16.230 --> 02:14:20.070
Were he 20 times my son, Iwould appeach him.

2459
02:14:20.070 --> 02:14:23.230
Hadst thou groaned for himas I have done,

2460
02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:25.530
thou wouldst be morepitiful.

2461
02:14:25.530 --> 02:14:28.200
But now I know thy mind.

2462
02:14:28.200 --> 02:14:31.100
Thou dost suspect that I havebeen disloyal to thy bed

2463
02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:34.370
and that he is a bastard,not thy son.

2464
02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:37.770
Sweet York, sweet husband,be not of that mind.

2465
02:14:37.770 --> 02:14:39.070
He is as like thee as aman may be,

2466
02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:42.600
not like to me, or any ofmy kin, and yet I love him.

2467
02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:44.430
Make way, unruly woman.

2468
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:46.170
After, Aumerle.

2469
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:48.030
Mount thee upon his horse.

2470
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:50.970
Spur post and get beforehim to the king.

2471
02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:52.700
I'll not be long behind.

2472
02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:56.530
Though I be old, I doubt notbut to ride as fast as York.

2473
02:14:56.530 --> 02:15:00.430
And never will I rise upfrom the ground

2474
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:03.100
till Bolingbroke havepardoned thee.

2475
02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:04.130
Away.

2476
02:15:04.130 --> 02:15:05.170
Be gone.

2477
02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:14.200
What means our cousin that hestares and looks so wildly?

2478
02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:16.800
God save Your Grace.

2479
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.300
I do beseech Your Majesty

2480
02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:20.270
to have some conferencewith Your Grace alone.

2481
02:15:22.430 --> 02:15:24.270
Withdraw yourselves andleave us here alone.

2482
02:15:24.270 --> 02:15:25.330
My lord!

2483
02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:38.400
What is the matter withour cousin now?

2484
02:15:40.630 --> 02:15:43.230
Forever may my knees growto the earth,

2485
02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:45.200
my tongue cleave to myroof within my mouth

2486
02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:48.000
unless a pardon ere I riseor speak.

2487
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:51.100
Intended or committed wasthis fault?

2488
02:15:51.100 --> 02:15:53.400
If on the first, howheinous e'er it be

2489
02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:55.900
to win thy after love Ipardon thee.

2490
02:15:58.770 --> 02:16:00.270
Then give me leave that Imay turn the key

2491
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:03.270
that no man enter till mytale be done.

2492
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:04.270
Have thy desire.

2493
02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.630
My liege, look to thyself.

2494
02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:11.670
Beware.

2495
02:16:11.670 --> 02:16:14.530
Thou hast a traitor in thypresence there.

2496
02:16:14.530 --> 02:16:17.900
Villain, I'll make theesafe.

2497
02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.670
Stay thy revengeful hand.

2498
02:16:19.670 --> 02:16:21.370
Thou hast not cause tofear.

2499
02:16:21.370 --> 02:16:23.370
Open the door, or I willbreak it open.

2500
02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.470
What is the matter?

2501
02:16:29.470 --> 02:16:30.500
Uncle, speak.

2502
02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:31.870
Recover breath.

2503
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:35.330
Tell us how near is dangerthat we may arm us toencounter it.

2504
02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:36.630
Peruse this writing

2505
02:16:36.630 --> 02:16:40.330
and thou shalt know thetreason that my hasteforbids me show.

2506
02:16:40.330 --> 02:16:42.370
Remember as thou read'stthy promise passed.

2507
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:45.500
I do repent me.

2508
02:16:45.500 --> 02:16:46.630
Read not my name there.

2509
02:16:46.630 --> 02:16:49.970
My heart is notconfederate with my hand.

2510
02:16:49.970 --> 02:16:53.500
It was, villain, ere thyhand did set it down.

2511
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:55.970
I tore it from thetraitor's bosom, king.

2512
02:16:55.970 --> 02:16:59.700
Fear, and not love, begetshis penitence.

2513
02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:02.000
Forget to pity him, lestthy pity prove

2514
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.600
a serpent that will stingthee to the heart.

2515
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:10.500
Oh, heinous, strong, andbold conspiracy.

2516
02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:14.070
Oh, loyal father of atreacherous son,

2517
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:17.200
thou sheer, immaculate,and silver fountain

2518
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:20.230
from whence this streamthrough muddy passages

2519
02:17:20.230 --> 02:17:22.570
hath held his current anddefiled himself,

2520
02:17:22.570 --> 02:17:26.630
thy overflow of goodconverts to bad,

2521
02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:29.530
and thy abundant goodnessshall excuse

2522
02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:32.270
this deadly blot in thydigressing son.

2523
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:35.900
So shall my virtue be hisvice's bawd.

2524
02:17:35.900 --> 02:17:38.000
And he shall spend minehonor with his shame

2525
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.170
as thriftless sons theirscraping fathers' gold.

2526
02:17:41.170 --> 02:17:44.330
Mine honor lives when hisdishonor dies,

2527
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:47.270
or my shamed life in hisdishonor lies.

2528
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:50.930
Thou kill'st me in hislife, giving him breath.

2529
02:17:50.930 --> 02:17:51.930
The traitor lives.

2530
02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:54.130
The true man's put todeath.

2531
02:17:54.130 --> 02:17:56.830
What ho, my liege.

2532
02:17:56.830 --> 02:18:00.100
For God's sake, let me in.

2533
02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:03.200
What shrill-voiced suppliantmakes this eager cry?

2534
02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:06.630
A woman, and thy aunt,great king.

2535
02:18:06.630 --> 02:18:07.930
'Tis I.

2536
02:18:07.930 --> 02:18:10.070
Speak with me.

2537
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:11.200
Pity me.

2538
02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:13.070
Open the door.

2539
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:17.530
A beggar begs that neverbegged before.

2540
02:18:17.530 --> 02:18:19.630
Our scene is altered froma serious thing

2541
02:18:19.630 --> 02:18:21.900
and now changed to "TheBeggar and the King."

2542
02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.830
My dangerous cousin, letyour mother in.

2543
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:29.530
I know she's come to prayfor your foul sin.

2544
02:18:29.530 --> 02:18:31.970
If thou do pardonwhosoever pray,

2545
02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:34.900
more sins for thisforgiveness prosper may.

2546
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:38.900
This festered joint cutoff, the rest rest sound.

2547
02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:42.300
This let alone will allthe rest confound.

2548
02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:46.970
Oh, king, believe not thishardhearted man.

2549
02:18:46.970 --> 02:18:49.330
Love loving not itselfnone other can.

2550
02:18:49.330 --> 02:18:51.970
Thou frantic woman, whatdost thou make here?

2551
02:18:51.970 --> 02:18:54.630
Shall thy old dugs oncemore a traitor rear?

2552
02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:57.270
Sweet York, be patient.

2553
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:59.400
Hear me, gentle liege.

2554
02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:02.100
Rise up, good Aunt.

2555
02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.830
Not yet, I thee beseech.

2556
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:07.970
Forever will I walk uponmy knees

2557
02:19:07.970 --> 02:19:11.000
and never see day that thehappy sees

2558
02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.730
till thou give joy,

2559
02:19:12.730 --> 02:19:15.900
until thou bid me joy,

2560
02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:19.800
by pardoning Rutland, mytransgressing boy.

2561
02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.500
Unto my mother's prayers Ibend my knee.

2562
02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:24.870
Against them both my truejoints bended be.

2563
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:28.070
Ill mayst thou thrive, ifthou grant any grace.

2564
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:29.400
Pleads he in earnest?

2565
02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:30.600
Look upon his face.

2566
02:19:30.600 --> 02:19:32.000
His eyes do drop no tears.

2567
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.870
His prayers are in jest.

2568
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:36.930
His words come from hismouth, ours from our breast.

2569
02:19:36.930 --> 02:19:40.770
He prays but faintly andwould be denied.

2570
02:19:40.770 --> 02:19:44.000
We pray with heart andsoul and all besides.

2571
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.770
His weary joints wouldgladly rise, I know.

2572
02:19:47.770 --> 02:19:52.230
Our knees shall kneel tillto the ground they grow.

2573
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:55.100
His prayers are full offalse hypocrisy,

2574
02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:58.400
ours of true zeal and deepintegrity.

2575
02:19:58.400 --> 02:20:01.330
Our prayers do outprayhis.

2576
02:20:01.330 --> 02:20:05.730
Then let them have thatmercy that true prayerought to have.

2577
02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.330
Good Aunt, stand up.

2578
02:20:07.330 --> 02:20:10.600
Nay, do not say, "standup."

2579
02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:15.170
Say, "pardon" first, andafterwards "stand up."

2580
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:18.430
And if I were thy nurse,thy tongue to teach,

2581
02:20:18.430 --> 02:20:20.670
"pardon" would be thefirst word of thy speech.

2582
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:22.970
I never longed to hear theword till now.

2583
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:25.070
Say "pardon," King.

2584
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:27.070
Let pity teach thee how.

2585
02:20:27.070 --> 02:20:29.500
The word is short, but notso short as sweet.

2586
02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:32.400
No word like "pardon" forkings' mouths so meet.

2587
02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:33.670
Speak it in French, king.

2588
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:35.100
Say, "Pardonne moi."

2589
02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:38.630
Dost thou teach pardonpardon to destroy?

2590
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:43.730
Oh, my sour husband, myhardhearted lord,

2591
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:45.770
that sets the word itselfagainst the word.

2592
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:48.130
Speak "pardon" as 'tiscurrent in our land.

2593
02:20:48.130 --> 02:20:51.500
The chopping French we donot understand.

2594
02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:54.430
Thine eye begins to speak.

2595
02:20:54.430 --> 02:20:56.130
Set thy tongue there.

2596
02:20:56.130 --> 02:20:59.400
Or in thy piteous heartplant thou thine ear

2597
02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:02.700
that hearing how our plaintsand prayers do pierce,

2598
02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:05.530
pity may move thee"pardon" to rehearse.

2599
02:21:05.530 --> 02:21:07.870
Good Aunt, stand up.

2600
02:21:07.870 --> 02:21:11.030
I do not sue to stand.

2601
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:13.800
Pardon is all the suit Ihave in hand.

2602
02:21:15.500 --> 02:21:17.230
I pardon him,

2603
02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:18.730
as God shall pardon me.

2604
02:21:18.730 --> 02:21:22.500
Oh, happy vantage of akneeling knee.

2605
02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:25.900
Yet am I sick for fear.

2606
02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:27.500
Speak it again.

2607
02:21:27.500 --> 02:21:31.300
Twice saying "pardon" dothnot pardon twain,

2608
02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:33.270
but makes one pardonstrong.

2609
02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:40.600
With all my heart, Ipardon him.

2610
02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:43.730
A god on earth thou art.

2611
02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:51.630
But for our trustybrother-in-law and the abbot,

2612
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:53.770
with all the rest of thatconsorted crew,

2613
02:21:53.770 --> 02:21:56.670
destruction straight shalldog them at the heels.

2614
02:21:56.670 --> 02:22:00.300
Good Uncle, help to orderseveral powers to Oxford

2615
02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:02.600
or where'er these traitorsare.

2616
02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:04.730
They shall not live withinthis world, I swear,

2617
02:22:04.730 --> 02:22:08.330
but I will have them, if Ionce know where.

2618
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:10.830
Uncle, farewell.

2619
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:12.430
And, cousin, adieu.

2620
02:22:13.930 --> 02:22:18.830
Your mother well hathprayed and prove you true.

2621
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:20.530
Come, my old son.

2622
02:22:20.530 --> 02:22:23.030
I pray God make thee new.

2623
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:34.800
Did thou not mark theking, what words he spake?

2624
02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:38.030
"Have I no friend will ridme of this living fear?"

2625
02:22:39.130 --> 02:22:40.470
Was it not so?

2626
02:22:40.470 --> 02:22:42.600
These were his very words.

2627
02:22:42.600 --> 02:22:45.030
"Have I no friend?" quothhe.

2628
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:49.100
He spake it twice andurged it twice together,did he not?

2629
02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:50.100
He did.

2630
02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:53.800
And speaking it, he wistlylooked on me

2631
02:22:53.800 --> 02:22:57.300
as who should say, "Iwould thou wert the man

2632
02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:00.370
that would divorce thisterror from my heart,"

2633
02:23:00.370 --> 02:23:02.270
meaning the king atPomfret.

2634
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:06.300
Come, let's go.

2635
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:09.500
I am the king's friend andwill rid his foe.

2636
02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:26.530
I have been studying how Imay compare

2637
02:23:26.530 --> 02:23:30.900
this prison where I liveunto the world.

2638
02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:34.700
And for because the worldis populous

2639
02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:41.330
and here is not a creaturebut myself, I cannot do it.

2640
02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:46.530
Yet I'll hammer it out.

2641
02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:54.300
My brain I'll prove thefemale to my soul,

2642
02:23:54.300 --> 02:23:57.070
my soul the father,

2643
02:23:57.070 --> 02:24:03.370
and these two beget ageneration of stillbreeding thoughts,

2644
02:24:03.370 --> 02:24:09.130
and these same thoughtspeople this little world

2645
02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:11.870
in humors like the peopleof this world,

2646
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:14.300
for no thought iscontented.

2647
02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:22.870
The better sort, asthoughts of things divineare intermixed

2648
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:27.070
with scruples and do setthe word itself againstthe word.

2649
02:24:28.270 --> 02:24:32.570
As thus, "Come, littleones."

2650
02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:37.570
And then again, "It is ashard to come as for a camel

2651
02:24:37.570 --> 02:24:41.700
to thread the postern of asmall needle's eye."

2652
02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:50.170
Thoughts tending toambition, they do plotunlikely wonders--

2653
02:24:50.170 --> 02:24:52.400
how these vain weak nails

2654
02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:55.630
may tear a passage throughthe flinty ribs

2655
02:24:55.630 --> 02:25:00.630
of this hard world, myragged prison walls.

2656
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:05.730
And, for they cannot, diein their own pride.

2657
02:25:13.170 --> 02:25:17.970
Thoughts tending tocontent flatter themselves

2658
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:21.000
that they are not thefirst of fortune's slaves,

2659
02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:24.100
nor shall not be the last.

2660
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:28.070
Like silly beggars who,sitting in the stocks,

2661
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:29.430
refuge their shame,

2662
02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:32.830
that many have and othersmust sit there.

2663
02:25:34.330 --> 02:25:38.270
And in this thought theyfind a kind of ease,

2664
02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:40.900
bearing their ownmisfortunes on the back

2665
02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:43.870
of such as have beforeendured the like.

2666
02:25:46.870 --> 02:25:52.270
Thus play I in one personmany people,

2667
02:25:52.270 --> 02:25:55.330
and none contented.

2668
02:25:55.330 --> 02:26:00.170
Sometimes am I king.

2669
02:26:00.170 --> 02:26:04.100
Then treasons make me wishmyself a beggar,

2670
02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:06.430
and so I am.

2671
02:26:06.430 --> 02:26:11.900
Then crushing penurypersuades me I was betterwhen a king.

2672
02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:15.170
Then am I kinged again,

2673
02:26:15.170 --> 02:26:19.670
and by and by think that Iam unkinged by Bolingbroke

2674
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:21.970
and straight am nothing.

2675
02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:28.100
But whate'er I be,

2676
02:26:28.100 --> 02:26:32.930
nor I nor any man that butman is,

2677
02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:36.100
with nothing shall bepleased

2678
02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:39.330
till he be eased withbeing nothing.

2679
02:26:44.370 --> 02:26:46.100
Music do I hear?

2680
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:54.430
Oh, keep time.

2681
02:26:56.230 --> 02:26:57.930
How sour sweet music is

2682
02:26:57.930 --> 02:27:01.130
when time is broke and noproportion kept.

2683
02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:05.670
So is it in the music ofmen's lives.

2684
02:27:07.470 --> 02:27:11.070
And here have I thedaintiness of ear

2685
02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:14.170
to cheque time broke in adisordered string,

2686
02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.870
but for the concord of mystate and time

2687
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:23.570
had not an ear to hear mytrue time broke.

2688
02:27:23.570 --> 02:27:29.330
I wasted time, and nowdoth time waste me.

2689
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:32.630
For now hath time made mehis numbering clock.

2690
02:27:32.630 --> 02:27:34.570
My thoughts are minutes.

2691
02:27:34.570 --> 02:27:37.530
And with sighs they jartheir watches on untomine eyes,

2692
02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:38.700
the outward watch,

2693
02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:41.000
whereto my finger, like adial's point,

2694
02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.900
is pointing still, incleansing them from tears.

2695
02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:46.600
Now, sir, the sound thattells what hour it is

2696
02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:49.630
are clamorous groans thatbeat upon my heart,

2697
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:51.370
which is the bell.

2698
02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:58.270
So sighs and tears andgroans show minutes,times, and hours.

2699
02:28:01.870 --> 02:28:07.600
But my time runs posting onin Bolingbroke's proud joy,

2700
02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:10.700
while I stand fooling here,his Jack o' the clock.

2701
02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.070
This music mads me!

2702
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:16.600
Let it sound no more!

2703
02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:18.970
For though it have holpmadmen to their wits,

2704
02:28:18.970 --> 02:28:23.430
in me it seems it willmake wise men mad.

2705
02:28:33.430 --> 02:28:35.930
Yet blessing on his heartthat gives it me,

2706
02:28:38.530 --> 02:28:40.370
for 'tis a sign of love.

2707
02:28:42.270 --> 02:28:49.000
And love to Richard is astrange brooch in this allhating world.

2708
02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:55.230
Hail, royal prince.

2709
02:28:55.230 --> 02:28:58.030
Thanks, noble peer.

2710
02:28:58.030 --> 02:29:01.830
The cheapest of us is tengroats too dear.

2711
02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:08.930
What art thou?

2712
02:29:08.930 --> 02:29:10.000
And how comest thou hither

2713
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.500
where no man never comesbut that sad dog

2714
02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:14.670
that brings me food tomake misfortune live?

2715
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:18.570
I was a poor groom of thystable, king,

2716
02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:20.370
when thou wert king,

2717
02:29:20.370 --> 02:29:21.670
who, traveling towardsYork,

2718
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:23.970
with much ado at lengthhave gotten leave

2719
02:29:23.970 --> 02:29:26.470
to look upon my sometimesroyal master's face.

2720
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:29.630
Oh, how it yearned myheart

2721
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:32.770
when I beheld in Londonstreets that coronation day

2722
02:29:32.770 --> 02:29:35.570
when Bolingbroke rode onroan Barbary,

2723
02:29:35.570 --> 02:29:38.130
that horse that thou sooften hast bestrid,

2724
02:29:38.130 --> 02:29:40.200
that horse that I socarefully have dressed.

2725
02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:43.200
Rode he on Barbary?

2726
02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:45.930
Tell me, gentle friend,how went he under him?

2727
02:29:45.930 --> 02:29:49.030
So proudly as if hedisdained the ground.

2728
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:53.630
So proud that Bolingbrokewas on his back.

2729
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:57.900
That jade hath eat breadfrom my royal hand.

2730
02:29:57.900 --> 02:30:01.270
This hand hath made himproud with clapping him.

2731
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:03.230
Would he not stumble?

2732
02:30:03.230 --> 02:30:06.330
Would he not falldown, since pride musthave a fall,

2733
02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:09.500
and break the neck of thatproud man that did usurphis back?

2734
02:30:12.430 --> 02:30:13.430
Forgiveness, horse.

2735
02:30:13.430 --> 02:30:15.670
Why do I rail on thee,

2736
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:20.070
since thou, created to be awedby man, wast born to bear?

2737
02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:26.200
I was not made a horse,

2738
02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:29.470
and yet I bear the burdenlike an ass,

2739
02:30:29.470 --> 02:30:34.030
spurred, galled, and tiredby jouncing Bolingbroke.

2740
02:30:36.270 --> 02:30:37.770
Fellow, give place.

2741
02:30:37.770 --> 02:30:39.100
Here is no longer stay.

2742
02:30:39.100 --> 02:30:41.030
If thou love me, 'tis timethou wert away.

2743
02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:46.170
What my tongue dares not,that my heart shall say.

2744
02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:05.900
My lord, will it pleaseyou to fall to?

2745
02:31:15.470 --> 02:31:20.500
Taste of it first, as thouart wont to do.

2746
02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:23.130
My lord, I dare not.

2747
02:31:23.130 --> 02:31:26.730
Sir Pierce of Exton, wholately came from the king,

2748
02:31:26.730 --> 02:31:28.130
commands the contrary.

2749
02:31:29.630 --> 02:31:33.200
The devil take Henry ofLancaster and thee.

2750
02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:36.100
Patience is stale, and Iam weary of it.

2751
02:31:36.100 --> 02:31:37.100
Help!

2752
02:31:37.100 --> 02:31:38.130
Help!

2753
02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:39.370
Help!

2754
02:31:39.370 --> 02:31:41.130
How now.

2755
02:31:41.130 --> 02:31:45.100
What means death in thisrude assault?

2756
02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:47.100
Villain!

2757
02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:49.800
Thy own hand yields thydeath's instrument.

2758
02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:55.430
Go thou, and fill anotherroom in hell.

2759
02:32:26.770 --> 02:32:29.870
That hand shall burn innever quenching fire

2760
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:32.400
that staggers thus myperson.

2761
02:32:35.370 --> 02:32:38.300
Exton, thy fierce hand

2762
02:32:38.300 --> 02:32:43.130
hath with the king's bloodstained the king's own land.

2763
02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:46.670
Mount; mount, my soul.

2764
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:48.900
Thy seat is up on high,

2765
02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:55.700
whilst my gross flesh sinksdownward, here to die.

2766
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:12.630
Kind Uncle York, thelatest news we hear

2767
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:14.570
is that the rebels haveconsumed with fire

2768
02:33:14.570 --> 02:33:16.870
our town of Cicester inGloucestershire.

2769
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:20.470
Whether they be ta'en orslain we hear not.

2770
02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:25.630
The grand conspirator,abbot of Westminster,

2771
02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:28.400
with clog of conscienceand sour melancholy,

2772
02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:31.100
hath yielded up his bodyto the grave.

2773
02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:33.070
But here is Carlisleliving

2774
02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:36.230
to abide thy kingly doomand sentence of his pride.

2775
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:40.800
Carlisle, this is your doom.

2776
02:33:42.670 --> 02:33:46.700
Choose out some secretplace, some reverend room,

2777
02:33:46.700 --> 02:33:50.200
more than thou hast, andwith it joy thy life.

2778
02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:53.630
So as thou livest in peace,die free from strife.

2779
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:56.600
For though mine enemy thouhast ever been,

2780
02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:59.970
high sparks of honor inthee have I seen.

2781
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:21.200
Great king,

2782
02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:23.800
within this coffin Ipresent thy buried fear.

2783
02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:26.300
Herein all breathless lies

2784
02:34:26.300 --> 02:34:28.370
the mightiest of thygreatest enemies,

2785
02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:33.870
Richard of Bordeaux,

2786
02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:35.370
by me hither brought.

2787
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:55.800
Exton, I thank thee not,

2788
02:34:57.870 --> 02:35:02.130
for thou hast wrought a deedof slander with thy fatal hand

2789
02:35:02.130 --> 02:35:05.900
upon my head and all thisfamous land.

2790
02:35:05.900 --> 02:35:09.030
From your own mouth, mylord, did I this deed.

2791
02:35:09.030 --> 02:35:12.030
They love not poison thatdo poison need,

2792
02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:13.630
nor do I thee.

2793
02:35:15.630 --> 02:35:18.770
Though I did wish himdead,

2794
02:35:18.770 --> 02:35:20.330
I hate the murderer,

2795
02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:24.270
love him murdered.

2796
02:35:27.330 --> 02:35:30.570
The guilt of consciencetake thou for thy labor,

2797
02:35:30.570 --> 02:35:35.530
but neither my good wordnor princely favor.

2798
02:35:35.530 --> 02:35:38.400
With Cain go wanderthrough shades of night,

2799
02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:42.200
and never show thy head byday nor light.

2800
02:35:48.870 --> 02:35:54.330
Lords, I protest my soulis full of woe

2801
02:35:54.330 --> 02:35:57.500
that blood should sprinkleme to make me grow.

2802
02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:06.570
Come, mourn with me forwhat I do lament,

2803
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:11.500
and put on sullen, blackincontinent.

2804
02:36:14.130 --> 02:36:16.100
I'll make a voyage to theHoly Land

2805
02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:19.100
