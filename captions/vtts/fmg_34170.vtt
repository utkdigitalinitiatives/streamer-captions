00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
NARRATOR: THE GLOBALIZATION
 OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
HAS BROUGHT WITH IT
 THE LARGEST MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
IN THE HISTORY
 OF MODERN TIMES.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
EVERYWHERE,
 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
ARE ON THEIR WAY
 TO SOMEWHERE NEW.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
NO WALL OR BARRIER IS STRONG
 ENOUGH TO STOP MIGRANTS

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
AS THEY CROSS INTERNATIONAL
 BORDERS ON A JOURNEY

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
TO WHERE THE ACTION IS:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
THE GLOBAL CITIES.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
IN NEW YORK, YOU FEEL
 THAT NOTHING IS UNWELCOME,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
AND NOTHING
 ALL TOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
NEW YORK IS
 A CITY OF IMMIGRANTS.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
THAT IS ITS HISTORY.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
ALMOST EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK
AT ANY GIVEN TIME

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL CENTURIES

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
CAN TRACE THEIR ROOTS
BACK TO SOMEBODY

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
WHO'D STARTED OUT IN SOME
 OTHER PART OF THE WORLD.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
NARRATOR: IMMIGRANTS
 CAME TO NEW YORK

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
FROM THE FOUR CORNERS
 OF THE WORLD,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
AND ONCE HERE,
 THEY WERE SO INTEGRATED

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
THEY ALMOST COMPLETELY
 LOST THEIR ETHNIC IDENTITY

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
IN THE "GREAT AMERICAN
 MELTING POT."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
OUT OF MANY, ONE.
 ONE PEOPLE.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
BUT THE LATEST WAVE
 OF IMMIGRANTS,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
MUCH SPICIER IMMIGRANTS,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
MOSTLY FROM DEVELOPING
 COUNTRIES,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
ARE PROVING SLOW TO MELT
 INTO THE AMERICAN POT,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
AND ARE INSTEAD TURNING
 THE MELTING POT

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
INTO A SALAD BOWL.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
MARGIE McHUGH:
 MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
THAT THEY ARE NOT STRIVING
TO ACHIEVE A MELTING POT

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
BECAUSE THE MELTING POT

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
FORCED PEOPLE TO GIVE UP
VERY VALUABLE ASPECTS

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
OF THEIR CULTURE
AND THAT THE DOMINANT CULTURE

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
DIDN'T RECEIVE A LOT
OF THE WISDOM AND THE VALUES

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
THAT WERE THERE
 IN SOME OF THE CULTURES

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
WHO WERE COMING IN.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
NARRATOR: IN QUEENS,
 A NEW YORK CITY NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
120 NATIONALITIES ARE
 ATTEMPTING TO PRESERVE

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
THEIR ETHNIC HERITAGE
 AND STILL DO WELL

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
WITHIN AMERICAN SOCIETY.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
MALA DESAI:
 WHILE I HAVE MANAGED

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
TO MAINTAIN MY OWN IDENTITY

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
AND PERPETUATE
OUR TRADITIONAL CULTURE,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
AND RELIGION
AND SOCIAL FORMS OF STYLE,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY
TO MIX WITH THE OTHERS,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
LEARN ABOUT OTHERS,
COME TOGETHER,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
HAVE JOINT PROJECTS.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
NARRATOR: SOMETIMES
 DELIBERATELY,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
MOSTLY UNCONSCIOUSLY,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
THE IMMIGRANTS IN QUEENS
 ARE STAKING OUT

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
A NEW CULTURAL MIDDLE GROUND

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN
 AND GRANDCHILDREN.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
AND HERE TO PROVIDE A LINK
 WITH MAINSTREAM NEW YORK

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
IS THE NUMBER SEVEN
 SUBWAY LINE,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
BUILT TO CARRY THEM FROM THEIR
 HOMES IN THE ETHNIC ENCLAVES

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
TO JOBS IN MANHATTAN.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
MICHAEL TEITELBAUM:
 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE WAS

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
A SUDDEN... SUDDEN REDUCTION

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE
 WORKING AT MINIMUM WAGE

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
OR BELOW IN NEW YORK CITY
 RESTAURANTS?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
WELL, I THINK WE KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
THE RESTAURANTS
THAT ARE JUST BREAKING EVEN

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
WOULD GO UNDER
IF THEY HAD TO PAY HIGHER WAGES.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
NARRATOR: WITH GLOBALIZATION
 IN THE UNITED STATES,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
EMPLOYMENT MARKETS
 HAVE BEEN FREED

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
OF MANY GOVERNMENT RULES
 AND RESTRICTIONS

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
SO THAT IN MOST INSTANCES,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
WAGES ARE ENTIRELY
 DETERMINED BY THE EMPLOYERS.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
IN NEW YORK, IMMIGRANTS
 PROVIDE THE WORKFORCE

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
FOR THESE
 NEW EMPLOYMENT MARKETS.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
THIS WORKFORCE
 IS MOSTLY LATINO,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
THE FASTEST GROWING
 COMMUNITY IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
MIGUEL MARTINEZ: JUST BECAUSE
 YOU'RE BECOMING A MAJORITY

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
IS NOT ENOUGH.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
WE HAVE TO ENSURE
THAT THEY MAKE

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
THE OPPORTUNITIES
AVAILABLE TO US

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
THAT OTHER IMMIGRANTS GROUPS HAD
WHEN THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
IN THIS CASE,
 EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
THAT CAME TO THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
TEITELBAUM: I THINK
 IT IS HARDER AND SLOWER

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
TO INTEGRATE
THAN HAVE IMMIGRANTS

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
IN SOME PREVIOUS PERIODS
OF U.S. EXPERIENCE,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
PARTLY BECAUSE
IT'S MUCH LARGER

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
JUST IN NUMBERS TERMS,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS HEAVILY
 A LOW-SKILLED POPULATION.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
NARRATOR: NOT ALL IMMIGRANTS
 TO NEW YORK CITY

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
ARE LOW-SKILLED.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
IN FACT,
 ONE OF THE KEY PREMISES

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
OF THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF 1990

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
WAS THAT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY
 HAD IMPORTANT LABOR SHORTAGES,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
ESPECIALLY AMONG
 HIGHLY-SKILLED WORKERS

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
SUCH AS COMPUTER ENGINEERS
 AND PROGRAMMERS,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
AND THAT INCREASED ADMISSIONS
 IN SUCH CATEGORIES

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
WERE REQUIRED.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
BRUCE BERNSTEIN:
 THEY INCREASED IT IN '96,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I THINK THEY INCREASED IT
 AGAIN IN '98 AND 2000.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I THINK THAT
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE IMMIGRATION

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
BUT WE HAVE TO TRAIN AMERICANS
IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
WE HAVE PLENTY OF AMERICANS
 WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
OR WHO ARE NOT TAKING PART
 IN THE HIGH-TECH ECONOMY.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
NARRATOR: IMMIGRANTS ARE
 NOT ONLY COMING TO NEW YORK

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
IN SEARCH OF JOBS
 IN THE HIGH-TECH ECONOMY.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
IN FACT, MANY IMMIGRANTS
 ARE SETTING UP COMPANIES

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
TO HELP NEW YORK BECOME
 A LEADING "E-CITY,"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
ARE ARE GIVING JOBS TO AMERICAN
 HIGH-TECH SPECIALISTS.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
YES, I THINK
THEY HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
OF BACKGROUND AND UNDERSTANDING
HOW SOFTWARE IS BEING MADE.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
BUT CERTAINLY I THINK THE PEOPLE
THAT PROGRAM THE SOFTWARE

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
CERTAINLY CAN BE FROM ANY PLACE,
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
THE KEY IS TO FIND
 THE BEST PEOPLE TO BUILD IT.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
SO, IT DOESN'T MATTER
 WHERE YOU COME FROM,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I THINK WHAT MATTERS
IS WHAT YOU CAN DO.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
PEOPLE MIGHT COME HERE
FOR A FEW YEARS

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
AND THEN GO BACK
TO THEIR COUNTRIES

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
OR COME HERE
FOR A FEW YEARS AND STAY,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
SO WE HAVE EVERY CONCEIVABLE
 NATIONALITY IN THE INDUSTRY.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
McHUGH: PRECISELY BECAUSE
 OF THE IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN
 A VERY RICH, VIBRANT LIFE

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
AND HAVE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
SET OF POSSIBILITIES

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
FOR THE FUTURE, PRECISELY
BECAUSE THE CITY

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
HAS BECOME AGAIN A POPULAR
DESTINATION FOR IMMIGRANTS.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
NARRATOR:
 IMMIGRATION TO NEW YORK CITY

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
IS AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL
 IN A HUNDRED YEARS.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
TWO-THIRDS OF ITS
 EIGHT MILLION INHABITANTS

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
ARE IMMIGRANTS
 AND THEIR CHILDREN.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
IN A CITY BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
THERE IS NOW A POWERFUL
 ANTI-IMMIGRATION MOVEMENT

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
WHICH CLAIMS NEW YORK CANNOT
 TAKE ANY MORE IMMIGRANTS.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN
ON THE PART OF MANY PEOPLE

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
THAT WE HAVE OVER-STEPPED
OUR CAPACITY

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
TO ABSORB MORE PEOPLE.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AND THIS HAS BEEN
 A STRAIN ON THE ECONOMY

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AND THE CAPACITY
OF NEW YORK CITY

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
TO MEET THOSE NEEDS.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
VOICES IN AMERICAN HISTORY

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
THAT CAME FROM PEOPLE
WHO THEY THEMSELVES ARRIVED

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
AND THEN SAID, "NOBODY ELSE,"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
AND THOSE VOICES
HAVE NEVER PREVAILED.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
NARRATOR: AND NOWHERE
 IN NEW YORK CITY

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
ARE THE ANTI-IMMIGRATION
 VOICES SO UNHEARD

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
AS HERE IN QUEENS,
 WHERE OVER 80%

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
OF ITS TWO MILLION INHABITANTS
 ARE IMMIGRANTS.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
INSTEAD, A RESHAPING OF
 NEW YORK'S DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
IS GOING ON BENEATH
 THE ELEVATED WHEELS

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
OF THE QUEENS #7 SUBWAY LINE.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
THE TRAIN STOPS
 WITH MADDENING FREQUENCY

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
EVERY FEW BLOCKS,
 YET EACH STATION

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
BRINGS A NEW
 AND DISTINCT ETHNIC EXPERIENCE.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
AT THE JACKSON HEIGHTS STOP,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
EVERYTHING FROM SIGHTS
 TO SOUNDS TO SMELLS

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
IS SOUTH ASIAN.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[LAUGHING]

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
MANJIT SINGH: THIS BLOCK
 WASN'T THAT POPULAR,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
IT WASN'T
A BUSINESS-DRAWING AREA.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
PEOPLE WERE NOT COMING.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
SO, EVENTUALLY,
WHEN THE INDIAN COMMUNITY

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
STARTED MOVING ALONG
AND SAW THE DEMAND

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
FOR THIS ACTUAL STORE
HAS GONE UP SO MUCH MORE

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
PEOPLE ARE WILLING
 TO PAY A LOT MORE

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
BECAUSE THERE WAS
 A CUSTOMER HERE.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
INITIALLY, MY HUSBAND
CAME WITH HIS DREAM.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
HE CAME AS A STUDENT
 AND HE IS A DOCTOR.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
WE DECIDED THAT HE'D EXPERIENCE
THAT FOR A YEAR AND COME BACK.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I DIDN'T LAST EVEN SIX MONTHS
 ALONE IN INDIA.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I THINK IT WAS THREE OR FOUR
 MONTHS AFTER HE HAD LEFT

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I SAID, "WHERE'S MY REZA?
 I CAN'T BE HERE."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
SO I WAS HERE WITHIN
 SIX MONTHS OF HIS COMING.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I THINK IT WAS AROUND THREE OR
FOUR YEARS AFTER WE WERE HERE

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
WE REALIZED THAT THERE
WAS NO GOING BACK.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000

UMA HYSOREKAR: WHEN WE CAME
 HERE, WE DIDN'T REALIZE

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
HOW MUCH WE MISSED OUR
CULTURE AND OUR RELIGION.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
SO WE WENT OUT OF OUR WAY

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
TO ESTABLISH OUR RELIGIOUS
FAITH AND OUR RITUALS.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
IF YOU GO BACK
 TO THE HISTORY OF HINDUISM,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
HINDUISM IS ONE OF THE OLDEST,
 IN FACT THE OLDEST RELIGION

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
THAT'S KNOWN TO MANKIND.

WHO SAYS, "SO-AND-SO
 SAID THIS, SO YOU FOLLOW IT,"

LIKE IN CHRISTIANITY.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
HINDUS HAVE THEIR OWN WAY
 OF WORSHIPPING.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
BUT ULTIMATELY, YOUR GOD
 AND MY GOD IS THE SAME

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
BECAUSE WE USE
 THE SAME CENTER.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
WHAT IT TEACHES, HINDUISM, IS:

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
YOU OUGHT TO BE
A GOOD HUMAN BEING,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
YOU SHOULD SERVE YOUR FAMILY
WELL, YOUR COMMUNITY WELL.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
DO YOUR SERVICE,
 THAT IS, COMMUNITY SERVICE.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
THEN YOU ARE A GOOD HINDU.
 THAT'S IT.

 TWISTED COTTON THREAD.

BUT THEIR CLIENTS
 ARE MOSTLY LATINO,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000

 A CULTURAL MIDDLE GROUND

WE CAN CHANGE THINGS

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
AND MAKE POLITICIANS
ESPECIALLY UNDERSTAND

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THAT IF THEY DON'T HELP THIS

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
IT'S HUMAN NATURE.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
WE DON'T LIKE CHANGE.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
AND WHEN IT'S SIGNIFICANT
CHANGE, WE LIKE IT EVEN LESS.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
NARRATOR: TO AN AMERICAN
 OR AN INTEGRATED IMMIGRANT,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
FLUSHING ADMINISTERS THE RUDEST
 DOSE OF CULTURAL SHOCK.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
AMONG THE THRONG OF HUMANITY
 ON THE CROWDED SIDEWALKS,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
NOT THE LEAST SOUND
 OF ENGLISH CAN BE HEARD,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
AND FEW WESTERN CHARACTERS MAKE
 IT INTO THE JUMBLE OF SIGNS

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
CAREFULLY SEGREGATED
 BETWEEN CHINESE AND KOREAN.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
THE REVITALIZATION OF FLUSHING
OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY ATTRIBUTABLE
TO THE ASIAN NEWCOMERS

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
AND IN SOME RESPECTS
THE LATINO NEWCOMERS.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE
 WHO WOULD LOOK AT THE PROBLEMS

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
THAT WE HAVE HERE NOW
 AND BLAME THE NEWCOMERS

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
FOR THOSE PROBLEMS, TOO.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
REMEMBER, THE CHINESE
HAD BEGUN ARRIVING IN NEW YORK

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
IN THE 1880s

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AND NEW YORK'S CHINATOWN

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
HAD GROWN FROM
THAT SETTLEMENT OF CHINESE

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
THAT HAD MOVED
FROM THE WEST COAST

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
WHERE THEY'D HELPED BUILD
THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
NARRATOR:
 UNTIL THE EARLY 1960s,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
IMMIGRANT VISAS WERE ALLOCATED
 ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL ORIGINS

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
QUOTA SYSTEM INTENDED
 TO PREVENT IMMIGRANTS

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
FROM CHANGING THE NATIONAL
 AND ETHNIC COMPOSITION

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
THIS RACIST QUOTA SYSTEM

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
EXCLUDED NEARLY
 ALL ASIAN IMMIGRANTS

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
AND GAVE PREFERENCE
 TO EUROPEANS.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
IN THE LATE 1960s,
 A NEW IMMIGRATION BILL

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
ELIMINATED RACE
 AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
BUT IN ACTUAL OPERATION,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
IMMIGRATION WAS STILL
 CONTROLLED BY RACIAL ORIGIN.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
WHAT FINALLY
 BROUGHT TO NEW YORK

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
 OF ASIAN IMMIGRANTS

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
WAS THE IMMIGRATION ACT OF
 1990, THAT PERMITTED EMPLOYERS

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
TO RECRUIT TEMPORARY FOREIGN
 WORKERS OF CERTAIN PROFESSIONS.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
BUT THE ASIANS ADMITTED
 AS TEMPORARY WORKERS

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
APPLIED FOR ADMISSION
 OF THEIR SPOUSES AND CHILDREN.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
TODAY, MORE THAN ONE
 OUT OF EVERY TEN NEW YORKERS

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
IS FROM ASIA.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
AND ACCORDING
 TO A RECENT SURVEY

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
UNDERTAKEN BY
 THE "COMMITTEE OF 100,"

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION
 COMPOSED OF LEADING AMERICAN

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
CITIZENS OF CHINESE DESCENT,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
PREJUDICE AGAINST ASIANS
 IS STILL PREVALENT.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
THERE WAS A 25%
HIGH DISLIKING FACTOR.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
AND ALSO, MORE OMINOUSLY,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
WAS THAT 46% FELT THAT ASIANS
COULD BE A PROBLEM

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
WHEN IT CAME TO POTENTIALLY
TURNING OVER

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS
 TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WHAT HAVE WE DONE
TO DESERVE THIS?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
WHAT ACT OF TREASON
CAN BE DOCUMENTED OUT THERE?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
WHAT ACT OF ESPIONAGE?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
ASIAN-AMERICANS HAVE BEEN
IN THE UNITED STATES

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
AND IN NEW YORK
FOR OVER 150 YEARS,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
AND TO SOME EXTENT,
WE'RE STILL BEING PERCEIVED

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
AS FOREIGNERS OF SOME SORT,
EVEN THOUGH MANY OF US

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
WERE BORN HERE
 OR MANY OF US HAVE LIVED HERE

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
MOST OF OUR LIVES,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
AND WE COULD EVEN BE SECOND,
 THIRD, FOURTH

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
OR FIFTH GENERATION.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
PEOPLE LOOK AT US,
DON'T UNDERSTAND US,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
OR THEY THINK
THAT WE ARE THE UNCULTURED

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
THAT MIX WITH THEIR CULTURE.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
THE CHINESE-AMERICAN, THEY
 THINK WE ARE NOT CIVILIZED.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
I WANT TO CHANGE
ALL THIS STEREOTYPE.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
THIS IS MY DREAM.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
NARRATOR: SUSAN RATHBORNE,
 FORMERLY A BEIJING NATIVE

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
CALLED SOON WU,
 HAS BEEN PURSUING HER DREAM

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
FOR OVER 50 YEARS.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
SHE ARRIVED IN THE QUEENS
 DISTRICT OF FLUSHING IN 1946

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
AFTER MARRYING
 AN AMERICAN SOLDIER IN CHINA.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
SOON AFTER HER ARRIVAL,
 SHE ESTABLISHED

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
THE FIRST
 IMMIGRANT SERVICES CENTER

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
FOR ASIAN NEWCOMERS.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
AND IN 1985, SHE FOUNDED
 THE QUEENS CHINESE ASSOCIATION.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
TODAY, AT THE AGE OF 82,
 SUSAN RATHBORNE,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
KNOWN BY EVERYONE IN QUEENS
 AS "AUNTIE WU," IS RETIRING.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
AT A TESTIMONIAL DINNER,
 SHE IS HONORED

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
BY LEADERS OF MOST IMMIGRANT
 COMMUNITIES IN QUEENS.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
PRESENT ARE ALSO
 THE LEADING CITIZENS

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
OF FLUSHING'S ASIAN COMMUNITY.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
WHEN I COME IN HERE,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I JUST WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
SPANISH MEN...
I CAN'T FIND ONE ASIAN FACE,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
YELLOW SKIN.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
WE CAME BY A HOUSE,
 THEY WOULD TELL ME,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
"SUSAN, THIS IS HAS
BEEN SOLD TO CHINESE.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
"THIS HAS BEEN
 SOLD TO CHINESE."

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
SO WE GET IN TOGETHER
 WITH JEWISH PEOPLE.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
I'M THE ONLY ONE
IN THIS BUILDING,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
CHINESE, FOR 45 YEARS.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
NARRATOR: THE SUBSTANTIAL
 INCREASE OF ASIAN IMMIGRANTS

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
TO NEW YORK CITY
 DURING THE 1990s

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
HAS INTENSIFIED
 INTERRACIAL TENSION.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
A RECENT SURVEY
 ON AMERICAN ATTITUDES

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
TOWARDS ASIAN-AMERICANS
 FOUND THAT A LACK OF EDUCATION

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
WAS THE MOST PREVALENT
 EXPLANATION

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
FOR PREJUDICIAL VIEWS
 AGAINST ASIANS.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
BUT THE SURVEY ALSO REVEALED

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
VERY SHARPLY DEFINED
 POSITIVE JUDGMENTS

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
ABOUT ASIAN-AMERICANS.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
THE SURVEY FOUND
THAT ASIANS WERE HIGHLY ADMIRED

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
FOR THEIR WORK ETHIC,
FOR THEIR FAMILY VALUES,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
FOR THEIR EXCELLENCE
IN EDUCATION,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
FOR THEIR DEDICATION
TOWARDS SUCCESS

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
IN THEIR LIVES AND CAREERS.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
FIRST, I HAVE TO CHALLENGE
THE NOTION

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
THAT ASIAN-AMERICANS
ARE MORE HIGHLY EDUCATED

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
OR GENERALLY BETTER WELL-OFF.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
ON THE SURFACE,
 YOU WOULD THINK

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
THAT THOSE ARE GOOD
 CHARACTERIZATIONS TO HAVE,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
BUT I THINK THAT'S
 ACTUALLY BEEN A PROBLEM

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
THAT ASIAN-AMERICANS
HAVE HAD IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
THAT'S GENERALLY CALLED
THE "MODEL MINORITY MYTH."

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
SO I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH
 THIS "MODEL MINORITY MYTH,"

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
OR CHARACTERIZATION
 OF ASIAN-AMERICANS IN THIS CITY

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY, THERE
ARE MANY ASIAN-AMERICAN KIDS

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
WHO DON'T DO WELL IN SCHOOLS.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
MANY ASIAN-AMERICANS WHO ARE--
 FAR MORE ASIAN-AMERICANS

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
ARE TOILING AWAY
 16 HOURS A DAY IN SWEATSHOPS

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
AND RESTAURANTS THAN YOU SEE
 WELL-OFF ASIAN-AMERICANS.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
I LOOK AT IT AS PEOPLE WHO COME
WHO HAVE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES,
DIFFERENT RACES--

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
THEY ADD THEIR VOICE
TO THE DEFINITION

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE AN AMERICAN,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
AND THAT AMERICA IS CONSTANTLY
 BECOMING SOMETHING NEW

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
BY THE DYNAMISM
 AND INTERACTION AND CREATIVITY

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
OF ITS PEOPLE.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
NARRATOR:
 ONLY TIME WILL TELL

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
WHETHER THIS WAVE OF SPICIER
 IMMIGRANTS WILL SETTLE

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
LIKE PREVIOUS IMMIGRANT WAVES

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
INTO THE SAME OLD AMERICAN
 MELTING POT.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
OUT OF MANY, ONE,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
ONE PEOPLE,
 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
THE #7 TRAIN CONTINUES
 TO LINK THE DISPARATE BITS

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
OF NEW YORK'S SALAD BOWL.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
NEW YORK?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
IT'S SOMETHING.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I'M A NEW YORKER.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I THINK A NEW YORKER IS A PERSON

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
WHO THINKS HE'S A NEW YORKER

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
OR SHE'S A NEW YORKER.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
A NEW YORKER IS ONE

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
WHO ALWAYS HAS A PLACE TO GO.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
SOMEONE WITH ATTITUDE.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
A NEW YORKER IS
A CITIZEN OF THE WORLD.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
THAT'S THE DEFINITION
OF A NEW YORKER.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.000
