00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.700
male narrator:
There's so much information

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.130
about health and medicine today,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.700
it can be hard to figure out
what's good for you.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.000
Like the sun.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.730
A walk in the sun feels great,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.870
but we know too much sun
can cause skin cancer.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.470
And what about all the chemicals
in our environment,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.700
preservatives in our foods,
or pollution in our air?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.930
Can they give us cancer
or other disease?

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.000
In this video, we're gonna take
a look inside the human body

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.130
to find out how the DNA
in your cells can be affected

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.870
by chemicals, radiation,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.630
and other things we encounter
in the world each day.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.030
Some of these are mutagens.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.770
That means they cause mutations
in the DNA of your cells.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.470
We'll find out what mutations
and mutagens are

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.170
and how mutagens work.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
We'll also look at carcinogens
and cancer

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.100
as well as methods
of detecting mutagens.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.800
The body isn't powerless
against the outside world,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.970
so we'll find out about
some of its defenses too.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630
Your DNA functions
as the instructions

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.230
for all the proteins
in your body,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.830
and to understand mutations,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.300
we're going to have to take
a closer look at the cell's DNA.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.070
A mutation is a change
in the DNA sequence of a gene.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.930
When the genetic code
has changed,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.870
we say it has mutated.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.300
Sometimes,
mutations happen by chance.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.000
We call these
spontaneous natural mutations.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It's normal for these to happen
from time to time,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.370
and often,
they don't really matter.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.370
The other kinds of mutations
are called induced mutations.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.970
They're caused by something
outside the DNA.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.900
But we'll take a look at the
causes of mutations a bit later.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.600
Remember, most DNA in a human
cell doesn't code for anything,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.170
so a small change in
that section of the DNA

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.430
won't have any effect
on the cell.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.030
We call these neutral mutations,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.700
because they don't have
any effect on the organism.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.400
But if the mutation occurs
in a gene,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.870
then the function of the protein
produced by that gene

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.530
may be altered.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.070
A change in the genetic code

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.900
means we could end up
with a different protein.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.600
The DNA instructions
have been changed.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.700
Mutations can be harmful,
but not always.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.370
Take a fly, for example.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.930
A mutation in the gene
that codes for wing size

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.830
might leave it with no wings,
normal wings,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830
or extra large wings.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.430
It could be that having
larger wings is an advantage,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.330
though, of course, a fly without
wings isn't gonna do so well.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.530
So most mutations are neutral,
and some are helpful.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.570
Today we're going to look
at harmful mutations,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.000
the ones that cause
an undesired effect to the gene.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.300
Changes in the genetic
instructions for humans

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.500
can cause genetic diseases
like hemophilia

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.200
or cystic fibrosis.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.630
These are inheritable.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.600
They're passed on
from parent to child.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.670
Inheritable mutations
are changes that take place

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.970
in a cell that produces gametes
by meiosis.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.970
There are also
somatic mutations.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.300
These are changes
that take place

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.970
in the body cells
of an organism

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.070
which divide by mitosis.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.600
That cell and its daughter cells
will have the mutation,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.470
but it won't be inherited
by the next generation.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.900
There's a few different ways

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.430
that these changes can affect
the genetic code.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.000
Remember how your DNA consists
of a double helix,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.700
and along each strand,
we have a sequence of bases.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.070
A codon is a sequence
of three bases.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.330
The DNA is read
in sets of threes.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.130
Imagine that this is
our set of bases.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.900
Here we're using the alphabet

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.600
to demonstrate the instructions
coded into our DNA.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.300
Imagine that each letter
is a base

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.970
and each word is a codon.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.770
Remember, each word
has a specific meaning,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.800
just as each codon codes
for a specific amino acid.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.030
Together, the amino acids
create a protein.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.230
"The man saw the dog
eat his pie."

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.000
So this sentence is like
a piece of DNA.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.170
It has one specific meaning,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.500
just like a gene codes
for one specific protein.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.470
Now, let's imagine that
one of our bases has changed,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.130
or mutated.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.570
"The man saw the dog
eat his tie."

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.170
By changing just one letter,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.800
we've changed the meaning
of the entire sentence.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.930
In the case of a gene,
by changing just one base,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.970
it could code for a completely
different amino acid.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.030
We call this substitution.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.970
We might end up
with a functional protein,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.230
but it won't be the one
the DNA originally coded for.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.100
There are other types
of mutations.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.400
You could have a deletion.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.530
See how deleting just one base
changes every codon? 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.200
Now let's try an insertion.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.530
If we insert an extra base,

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.670
we get what's known
as frameshift mutation.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.930
Every codon after
the inserted base has changed.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.800
So if you think of DNA
as a set of instructions

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.400
for the body's proteins,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.970
these mutations have completely
changed the instructions.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.900
So there are a few different
types of mutations

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.100
that can affect a cell's DNA.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.570
So what causes these kinds
of changes to happen?

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.370
A mutation is a change
to the DNA sequence of a gene.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.600
A mutation can change
the function of a gene.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.530
This is because it changes
the protein it codes for.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.330
Mutations can be inheritable
or somatic.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.000
Some common types of mutation
include the addition,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.030
deletion,
or substitution of a base.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.030
Anything that can cause
a mutation is called a mutagen.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.530
Mutagens are agents
that cause mutations

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.230
in the cells of plants
and animals.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.930
But what kind of things
cause mutations?

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.370
The most obvious one
is radiation.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:09.630
It's important to remember

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.770
that there are two
main categories of radiation.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.770
Non-ionizing radiation
isn't dangerous.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.100
That includes things like
radio waves or microwaves.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.170
Ionizing radiation carries
a lot more energy,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.700
and that's why
it's a strong mutagen.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.430
Ionizing radiation includes
ultraviolet radiation,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.730
or UV light.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.330
That's what we get from the sun
or tanning lamps,

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.370
and it can cause mutations
that lead to cancer.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.570
X-rays are mutagens too,

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.430
but careful use
of safety equipment

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.270
makes X-ray machines
safe to use.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.670
Gamma rays and nuclear radiation
are the most dangerous

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.900
and are very strong mutagens.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.470
Some chemicals can also
be mutagens,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:56.900
both natural chemicals

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.270
as well as man-made,
or synthetic, compounds.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.300
One example of a group
of chemicals

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.670
that can cause mutations

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.930
is polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.530
We find these chemicals
in deposits of coal or oil,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.500
and they're produced
when we burn fuel and refuse.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.000
They can also be found
in asphalt, pesticides,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.830
and some plastics.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.530
Because they don't dissolve
very well in water,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.400
these chemicals can sink
to the bottom of waterways

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.100
or stay in the air
for a long time.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.100
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
are also one of many mutagens

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.930
found in cigarette smoke.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.570
Alkylating agents
are another group of chemicals

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.930
that are known
to cause mutations.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.930
A well-known alkylating agent is
a chemical called mustard gas.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.170
It was used in World War I
for chemical warfare.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:52.500
These chemicals also occur
in industrial waste

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.200
that makes its way
into our environment.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.130
A similar kind of mutagen
is a group of chemicals

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.730
called intercalating agents.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.970
One example of this group
is a toxin

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.430
produced
by the aspergillus fungus

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.530
which contaminates grain.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.070
Another group of chemical
mutagens are the base analogs.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:16.100
Base analogs, alkylating agents,
and intercalating agents

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.430
are so good at causing mutations

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.500
that they're actually used
to treat cancer.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.670
They work by damaging the DNA
of cancer cells

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.570
and stopping their growth.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.730
Unfortunately, these agents
can cause other cancers

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.500
to develop as a side effect.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.170
Although we find
chemical mutagens in industry,

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.670
environmental pollution,

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.130
and cancer treatments,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.400
they can also occur
a lot closer to home.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.770
Cigarette smoke carries
a number of mutagens.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.770
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
are the best known,

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.830
but there are about 19 other
chemicals in cigarette smoke

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.100
which act on DNA
or make mutations more likely.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.630
Scientists have also shown that
as the body processes alcohol,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.230
it sometimes produces a chemical
which can cause mutations.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.800
A diet high in fatty foods
and meat

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.700
is also known to increase
the risk of bowel cancer

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.500
because of exposure
to mutagens in the bowel.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.170
Sometimes mutations
can also be caused by viruses.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:24.100
An example is Hepatitis B,
which can cause liver cancer.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.970
So a whole range of things
can act as mutagens,

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.730
but how do they actually
cause mutations?

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.600
Mutagens are agents
that cause changes

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.900
in the DNA of animals or plants.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.100
Common mutagens include
ionizing radiation

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.070
including X-rays, UV light,
gamma rays,

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.630
or nuclear radiation;

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.730
natural or synthetic chemicals,

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.970
like those found
in cigarette smoke.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.970
Viruses can be mutagens too.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.830
There are a number of ways
that mutagens can act on DNA

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.530
to cause a mutation.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.070
We've already seen how
a gene can be affected

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:20.570
by even one change
in the base of a codon.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.930
Now let's take a closer look
at how mutagens cause mutations

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.570
in the cell's DNA.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.430
We'll begin with UV light
and its effect on human DNA.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:35.370
UV light causes two types
of damage to the DNA.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.170
The first is the direct effect,
or direct damage.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.100
Now, most of the light
that hits our skin

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.970
has little to no effect,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:48.230
but it only takes a small amount
of UV light to cause sunburn.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.530
Inside the cells,

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.170
the DNA is being changed
by the UV light.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.600
If we return to our example
of a gene,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.200
we can see the very specific
change UV-B light causes.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.470
When two thiamine base pairs are
next to one another in a gene,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.200
UV-B light can cause them
to bond to one another

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
instead of their usual pair.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.470
UV light also causes
indirect damage to DNA.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.800
UV light can create
free radicals.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.600
These are reactive molecules

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.130
which can damage DNA
throughout the body.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.400
The body can often repair
the effect of DNA,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.500
but if the damage is passed on
through cell division,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.370
then the result is a mutation,
which could lead to cancer.

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.200
We talked earlier about how
chemicals can cause mutations,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.770
but let's find out
how some of these work.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.530
First we'll look
at intercalating agents.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:48.000
Intercalating agents affect
the structure of the DNA

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.100
by sitting in between the bases.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.570
This means that DNA synthesis
can't go ahead as normal

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.630
and we end up with mutations.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.800
Alkylating agents
also act on DNA

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.100
to change how the bases pair.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.530
These chemicals add small carbon
compounds called alkyl groups

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.170
to the DNA bases.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:23.630
These extra compounds
can stop DNA synthesis.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.030
In some cases,
alkylating agents

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.400
can even cause
the wrong bases to pair.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.700
As you can imagine,

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.900
this causes serious
and often permanent mutations.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.600
There are also some chemicals
that act to change the DNA

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.800
by replacing one of the bases.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.330
We call the base analogues

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.300
because they take the place
of the normal bases,

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.600
and these cause mutations too.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.670
When viruses infect
a human cell,

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.900
they can cause mutations
in a different way.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.270
Some viruses can integrate

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.800
directly into
the human chromosome.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.500
This can alter genes
and trigger cancers.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.670
Other viruses turn up
the effects of genes

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.400
that control
normal cell division.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.500
We'll look more closely at this
when we talk about cancer.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.170
Mutagens change DNA
by altering the structure

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.500
or order of the base pairs.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.270
UV light damages DNA
in two ways:

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.430
direct damage to the DNA,
which causes cross linking;

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:28.230
indirect damage
from free radicals.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.970
Intercalating agents
cause mutations

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.800
by wedging between bases.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.400
Alkylating agents
change the way DNA bonds.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.330
Base analogues
take the place of bases.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.500
Viruses can integrate
into a cell's DNA,

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.130
causing mutations.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.900
Some of the mutagens
we've talked about today

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.700
are called carcinogens.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.530
That means they make the cells
more likely to become cancerous.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.570
Most cancers result from
some kind of DNA mutation.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.470
This could be the result
of any of the things

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:15.870
we've talked about today:

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.830
pollution, radiation, smoking,

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.630
or even just an error
in DNA replication.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.400
The important thing
is that these mutations

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.430
are passed on to daughter cells.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.630
For a normal cell
to become a cancer cell,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:33.930
the genes which regulate cell
growth would have to be changed.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.630
So instead of producing
a protein that limits

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.000
or switches off cell division,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.430
The mutated gene might produce
a different protein

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.730
or no protein at all.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.330
This kind of mutation allows
cell growth to continue

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.300
without any limit.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.400
Genes that make the cell
multiply are called oncogenes.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.370
So we could say that cancer
is uncontrolled cell growth

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:02.100
caused by changing important
genes in the cell's DNA.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.700
One way cells stop this
from happening

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.070
is with tumor suppressor genes.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.500
These have the job
of stopping cell division

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.600
from getting out of control.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.270
But what happens if the tumor
suppressor genes are mutated?

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:19.130
When these genes are changed
and not repaired by the body,

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.630
cells keep on
reproducing forever.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:26.270
So there are two types of genes
that are important in cancer:

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.970
the genes
that make cells divide,

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.330
or oncogenes,

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:31.870
and the genes
that stop cells dividing,

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.770
or the tumor suppressor genes.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.900
It's not easy for a cell
to become a cancer cell, though.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.030
These mutations
don't happen often,

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.700
and the body still has
a few ways of keeping control.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:48.000
DNA repair genes make sure
that other genes get repaired.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.970
Their role is to make sure

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.930
that errors aren't passed on
to daughter cells.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:57.400
But, of course, DNA repair genes
can sometimes be damaged too.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.130
If the DNA repair genes
are damaged,

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.200
then the changes caused
by mutagens aren't repaired,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.870
and so carcinogens
that affect cell division

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:08.730
have a much greater chance
of causing cancer.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.830
Scientists have discovered links
between mutagens

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.400
and certain cancers.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:19.030
For example, cigarette smoke
is known to cause lung cancer.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.870
Cigarette smoke contains dozens
of carcinogenic chemicals.

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.070
Asbestos also causes
lung cancer,

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.800
which is why it's no longer
used in construction.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.930
Of course, the mutations that
cause cancer aren't very common,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.000
and it takes a long time
for the tumors to grow

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.330
to a size that we can see
or feel.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.230
Today scientists are quickly
discovering new ways

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.270
to find, detect,
and treat cancers

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.830
before they become dangerous.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.670
Cancer is uncontrolled
cell growth.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.570
It's caused by mutations
to genes

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.700
that affect cell division.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.330
These are called oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:08.130
Chemicals that cause
this kind of mutation

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.370
are called carcinogens.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.230
Scientists have linked certain
mutagens to types of cancer.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.030
So we know what mutagens are
and the trouble they can cause.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.830
But you're probably wondering
what can be done

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.670
to find the causes of mutations

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.970
and take them
out of our environment.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.400
Scientists have developed
a very important test,

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.700
the Ames test.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.400
It uses bacteria
with a mutated gene

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.300
to discover whether a substance
is carcinogenic.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.030
In this way, chemicals we use
in industry

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.170
or medicine can be tested.

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.370
Of course,
this isn't a perfect test

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:05.830
as to whether a chemical might
cause a mutation in humans.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.100
The Ames test uses a bacteria

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.600
which has been
genetically altered

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.830
so that it won't grow
on a certain type of surface.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.570
If our chemicals are mutagens,

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.830
they'll cause mutations
in the bacteria,

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:27.000
which will allow it
to grow on the test surface.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.670
So to put it simply,
the more mutagenic the chemical,

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.300
the more bacteria will grow
on the test surface.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.470
Sometimes we might need
to test a certain place

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.700
or type of environment
for the presence of mutagens.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.500
This can be done by taking soil
or water samples

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.830
back to the laboratory

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.930
and using tests
like the Ames test

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.200
to check whether
they produce mutations.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.230
Because we already know
a lot about mutagens,

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.570
scientists can also test
directly for their presence.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:10.430
For example, lead is a mutagen.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.370
So by testing the soil
and water samples for lead,

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.330
we can quickly get an idea
as to whether

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.430
there are any mutagens
in the area.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.700
This kind of testing
isn't necessary in most areas,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.830
but if you have a chemical spill
or an accident of some kind,

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.400
it's important to know
and check the effects

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.530
on the surrounding environment.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.900
In most countries,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.870
governments have laws
about what's allowed

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.070
to go into the air, the water,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.630
and the food
that people are exposed to.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.730
Scientists can test
for the presence of mutagens

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:51.300
in our environment, food,
or in chemicals we use.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.370
The Ames test can be used
to find out

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.100
whether a chemical is mutagenic.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.530
Scientists can also test
for the presence

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.500
of specific mutagens like lead.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.900
DNA is a complex molecule.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.730
It's vital to the structure
and health

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.930
of every cell in our body.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.000
Mutagens are things
that can change DNA,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.430
and when the bases of our DNA
are changed,

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:23.800
they can no longer code
for the same protein,

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.200
and this can have a drastic
effect on the cell's function.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.700
Luckily, our DNA
usually repairs itself,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.230
and a lot of changes
don't have any effect.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.070
In some of the worst cases,

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:41.470
mutations can lead
to genetic diseases or cancer.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.500
Today scientists have developed
a range of tests

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.430
to find out more about mutagens

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.430
and to test the chemicals
that we come into contact with.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.930
In the future, we'll know
even more about mutations

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.400
and we'll find even better ways
to repair damaged DNA

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.700
to stop diseases like cancer.
