00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670


2
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.030
The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.900
Is crept into the bosom of the sea;

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.430
And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.430
That drag the tragic melancholy night;

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.500
Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.270
Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:35.270
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.

9
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.830
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.430
For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,

11
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.170
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.030
Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.

13
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.830
Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.070
And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;

15
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.330
The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.

16
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.630
What is my ransom, master? Let me know.

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.670
A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.

18
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.200
(Master's-Mate)And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.

19
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.930
What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,

20
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.000
And bear the name and port of gentlemen?

21
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.030
Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:

22
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.770
The lives of those which we have lost in fight

23
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.700
Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!

24
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.600
I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.

25
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.300
And so will I and write home for it straight.

26
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.170
I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,

27
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.070
And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;

28
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.800
And so should these, if I might have my will.

29
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.870
Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.

30
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.830
Look on my George; I am a gentleman:

31
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.530
Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.

32
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.270
And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.

33
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.330
How now! why start'st thou? what, doth death affright?

34
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.530
Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.

35
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.600
A cunning man did calculate my birth

36
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.100
And told me that by water I should die:

37
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.970
Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;

38
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.630
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,

39
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.770
But with our sword we wiped away the blot;

40
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.000
Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,

41
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.730
Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,

42
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.400
And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!

43
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.300
Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,

44
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.900
The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.

45
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.430
The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!

46
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.400
Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:

47
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.270
Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?

48
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:29.130
But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.

49
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.000
Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,

50
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.630
The honourable blood of Lancaster,

51
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.070
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.

52
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.670
Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?

53
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.870
Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule

54
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.270
And thought thee happy when I shook my head?

55
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.100
How often hast thou waited at my cup,

56
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.870
Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.

57
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.500
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?

58
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.570
Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,

59
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.170
Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;

60
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.700
Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?

61
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:26.530
First let my words stab him, as he hath me.

62
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.370
Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.

63
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.200
Convey him hence and on our longboat's side

64
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.800
Strike off his head.

65
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.070
Thou darest not, for thy own.

66
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.500
Pole!

67
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.470
Pole!

68
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:55.200
Ay, kennel, puddle, sink;

69
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.230
whose filth Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.

70
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.370
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth

71
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.630
For swallowing the treasure of the realm:

72
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.430
Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;

73
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.770
And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,

74
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.130
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,

75
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.070
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:

76
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.900
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,

77
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.130
For daring to affy a mighty lord

78
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.970
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,

79
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:43.330
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,

80
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.000
The false revolting Normans thorough thee

81
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.800
Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy

82
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.430
Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,

83
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.430
And sent the ragged wounded soldiers home.

84
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.870
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,

85
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.100
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,

86
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.130
As hating thee, are rising up in arms:

87
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.570
And now the house of York, thrust from the crown

88
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.830
By shameful murder of a guiltless king

89
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.730
Burns with revenging fire;

90
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.430
The commons here in Kent are up in arms:

91
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.700
And, to conclude, reproach and beggary

92
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.870
Is crept into the palace of our king.

93
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.570
And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.

94
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:39.500
O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder

95
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:46.570
Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!

96
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.230
It is impossible that I should die

97
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.930
By such a lowly vassal as thyself.

98
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.800
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:

99
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.400
Ay but thy deeds shall stay thy fury soon

100
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.130
I go of message from the queen to France;

101
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.870
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.

102
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:17.070
Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.

103
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.800
'tis thee I fear.

104
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:25.500
Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.

105
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.630
What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?

106
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.230
My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.

107
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.570
Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,

108
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.830
Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.

109
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.430
Far be it we should honour such as these

110
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.000
With humble suit: no, rather let my head

111
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.930
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any

112
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.100
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;

113
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.400
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole

114
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.600
Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.

115
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.600
True nobility is exempt from fear:

116
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.330
More can I bear than you dare execute.

117
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.330
Hale him away, and let him talk no more.

118
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:23.530
Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,

119
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.870
That this my death may never be forgot!

120
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.530
Great men oft die by vile bezonians:

121
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.700
A Roman sworder and banditto slave

122
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.430
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand

123
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.330
Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders

124
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:47.330
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk...(sound of beheading)

125
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:51.900
...dies by pirates.

126
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.700
And as for those whose ransom we have set,

127
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.100
It is our pleasure one of them depart;

128
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.630
So come you with us and let him go.

129
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.470
There let his head and lifeless body lie,

130
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:21.570
Until the queen his mistress bury it.

131
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:31.130
O barbarous and bloody spectacle!

132
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.400
His body will I bear unto the king:

133
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:42.500
If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;

134
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.800
So will the queen, that living held him dear.

135
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.400
Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;

136
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.430
they have been up these two days.

137
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.430
They have the more need to sleep now, then.

138
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.570
I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress

139
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.600
the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.

140
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.200
So he had need, for 'tis threadbare.

141
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.530
Well, I say it was never merry world in England

142
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.270
since gentlemen came up.

143
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.700
O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.

144
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.630
The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.

145
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.500
Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.

146
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.370
True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;

147
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.970
which is as much to say as,

148
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.570
let the magistrates be labouring men;

149
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:33.700
and therefore should we be magistrates.

150
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.200
Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a

151
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.230
brave mind than a hard hand.

152
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.330
I see them! I see them!

153
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.000
There's Best's son, tanner of Wingham,--

154
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.400
He shall have the skin of our enemies,

155
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.400
to make dog's-leather of.

156
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.630
And Dick the Butcher,--

157
00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.630
Then is sin struck down like an ox,

158
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.030
and iniquity's throat cut like a calf.

159
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.130
And Smith the weaver,--

160
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.900
Argo, their thread of life is spun.

161
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.100
Come, come, let's fall in with them.

162
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:10.070
(men chanting) John Cade!!

163
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.870
We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--

164
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.330
Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.

165
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:41.000
For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with

166
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.270
the spirit of putting down kings and princes,

167
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.770
--Command silence.

168
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.770
Silence!

169
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.370
My father was a Mortimer,--

170
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.070
He was an honest man, and a good bricklayer.

171
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.830
My mother a Plantagenet,--

172
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.470
I knew her well; she was a midwife.

173
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.570
My wife descended of the Lacies,--

174
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.430
She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter,

175
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.870
and sold many laces.

176
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.230
Therefore am I of an honourable house.

177
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.770
Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;

178
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.200
and there was he borne, under hedge,

179
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.100
Valiant I am.

180
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.170
A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.

181
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.730
I am able to endure much.

182
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.770
O no doubt of that; for I have seen him

183
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.200
whipped three market-days together.

184
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.600
Be valiant, then; for your captain is valiant,

185
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.930
and vows reformation.

186
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.900
There shall be in England

187
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.600
seven, eight me loaves sold for a penny:

188
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.830
the three-hooped pot shall have ten hoops

189
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:50.870
and I will make it felony to drink small beer:

190
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.900
all the realm shall be in common;

191
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.630
and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass:

192
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.900
and when I am king, as king I will be,--

193
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.530
(crowd chants) God save your majesty!

194
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:11.070
I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;

195
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:15.400
all shall eat and drink on my score;

196
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.570
and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree

197
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.400
like brothers and worship me their lord.

198
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.970
The first thing we do is, kill all the lawyers.

199
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:27.900
(crowd) Ay.

200
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.300
Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing,

201
00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.570
that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment?

202
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.500
that parchment, being scribbled o'er,

203
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.800
should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:

204
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.670
I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but once

205
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.800
seal to a thing, and I was never mine own man since.

206
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.670
How now! who's there?

207
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.030
The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read

208
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.770
and cast accompt.

209
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:01.930
O monstrous!

210
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.030
We took him setting of boys' copies.

211
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:10.100
I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine honour;

212
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.870
unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.

213
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.600
Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee:

214
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.600
what is thy name?

215
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.900
Emmanuel.

216
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.870
Thus thow use to write thy name,

217
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.900
Alas thou a mark to thyself like an honest plain dealing man

218
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.630
Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up

219
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.130
that I can write my name.

220
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.270
(crowd) He hath confessed:

221
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:52.630
Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen

222
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.100
and ink-horn about his neck.

223
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.730
Where's our general?

224
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.070
Here I am, thou particular fellow.

225
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.500
Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.600
He shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.430
No.

232
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:29.000
To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.

233
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.300
Rise up Sir John Mortimer.

234
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.000
Now have at him!

Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,

Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;

238
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.770
Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.000
The king is merciful, if you repent.

240
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.970
But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,

If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.070
As for these silken-coated slaves, I care not:

243
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.630
It is to you, good people, that I speak,

244
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.470
Over whom, in time to come, I hope to rule;

245
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.870
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.

246
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.770
Villain, thy father was a plasterer;

247
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.770
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?

248
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.100

And what of that?

250
00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.470
Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.

251
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.730
Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?

252
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.770
Ay, sir.

253
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.100
By her he had two children at one birth.

254
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.370
That's false.

255
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:14.200
Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:

256
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.500
The elder of them, being put to nurse,

257
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.400
Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;

258
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.570
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,

259
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.400
Became a bricklayer when he came to age:

260
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.100
His son am I; deny it, if you can.

261
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.470
Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.

262
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.430
Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house,

263
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.100
and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;

264
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:38.270
therefore deny it not.

265
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.270
And will you credit this base drudge's words,

266
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.430
That speaks he knows not what?

267
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.870
(crowd) Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.

268
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.100
Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.

269
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.430
He lies, for I invented it myself.

270
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.470
Go to then, tell the king from me, that, for his

271
00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.170
father's sake, Henry the Fifth,

272
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.670
I am content he shall reign;

273
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.500
but I'll be protector over him.

274
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.330
And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head

275
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:09.370
for selling the dukedom of Maine.

276
00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.500
And good reason; for thereby is England mained,

277
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.030
and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up.

278
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.670
Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say

279
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.600
hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:

280
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.600
and more than that, he can speak French;

281
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.430
and therefore he is a traitor.

282
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.830
O gross and miserable ignorance!

283
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.500
Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our

284
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.130
enemies; go to, then, I ask but this:

285
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:42.430
can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy

286
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:46.070
be a good counsellor, or no?

287
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.900
(crowd) No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.

288
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.570
Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,

289
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.870
Assail them with the army of the king.

290
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.600
Herald, away; and throughout every town

291
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.400
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;

292
00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.130
That those which fly before the battle ends

293
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.430
May, even in their wives' and children's sight,

294
00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.400
Be hang'd up for example at their doors:

295
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.000
And you that be the king's friends, follow me.

296
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.100
And you that love the commons, follow me.

297
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.570
Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.

298
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.030
We will not spare one lord, one gentleman:

299
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.670
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;

300
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.170
For they are thrifty honest men,

301
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.070
and such as would, but that they dare not, take our parts.

302
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.170
They are all in order and march toward us.

303
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:58.900
But then are we in order when we are most out of order.

304
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.900
Come, march forward.

305
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.000
(crowd chants a battle cry) Cade! Cade! Cade!

306
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.230
Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?

307
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:06.000
Here, sir.

308
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.500
They fell before thee like sheep and oxen,

309
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.000
and thou behavedst thyself

310
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.370
as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter-house:

311
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.100
therefore thus will I reward thee,

312
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.700
the Lent shall be as long again as it is;

313
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.270
Eh?

314
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:25.530
thou shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking one.

315
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.730
I desire no more.

316
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:34.670
And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less.

317
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.830
This monument of the victory will I bear;

318
00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.100
and the bodies will be dragged at my heels

319
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.030
till I do come to London, where we will have the

320
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.730
mayor's sword borne before us.

321
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.430
If we mean to thrive and do good,

322
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.730
break open the gaols and let out the prisoners.

323
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.170
Fear not that, I warrant thee.

324
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:23.930
Come, let's march towards London.

325
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:33.430
(crowd chants) John Cade! John Cade!

326
00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.630
Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,

327
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:48.300
And makes it fearful and degenerate;

328
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:57.730
Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.

329
00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:05.470
But who can cease to weep and look on this?

330
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:13.330
Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:

331
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.800
But where's the body that I should embrace?

332
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.200
What answer makes your grace to the rebels' supplication?

333
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.330
I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;

334
00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.070
For God forbid so many simple souls

335
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.400
Should perish by the sword! And I myself,

336
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.200
Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,

337
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.370
Will parley with Jack Cade their general:

338
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.230
But stay, I'll read it over once again.

339
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.430
Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face

340
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:41.670
Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,

341
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.930
And could it not enforce them to relent,

342
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.800
That were unworthy to behold the same?

343
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.770
Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.

344
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.730
Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.

345
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:55.200
How, madam!

346
00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.200
Still lamenting Suffolk's death?

347
00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.970
I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,

348
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:03.330
Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.

349
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.570
No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

350
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.870
How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?

351
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.600
The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!

352
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.030
Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,

353
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.170
Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,

354
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:21.730
And calls your grace usurper openly

355
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:26.200
And vows to crown himself in Westminster.

356
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.470
His army is a ragged multitude

357
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.930
Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:

358
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.530
Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death

359
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:34.530
Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:

360
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.130
All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,

361
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.230
They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.

362
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.230
O graceless men! they know not what they do.

363
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.100
My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,

364
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.570
Until a power be raised to put them down.

365
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.500
Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,

366
00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.930
These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!

367
00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.230
Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;

368
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.170
Therefore away with us to Killingworth.

369
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.900
So might your grace's person be in danger.

370
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.230
The sight of me is odious in their eyes;

371
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.400
And therefore in this city will I stay

372
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.700
And live alone as secret as I may.

373
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.600
Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:

374
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.930
The citizens fly and forsake their houses:

375
00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:10.970
The rascal people, thirsting after prey,

376
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.330
Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear

377
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.000
To spoil the city and your royal court.

378
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.430
Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.

379
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:21.000
Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.

380
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.600
My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased.

381
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:28.500
Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels.

382
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500
Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd.

383
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.430
The trust I have is in mine innocence,

384
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.070
And therefore am I bold and resolute.

385
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:15.600
Jack Cade!

386
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:36.700
Now is Mortimer lord of London.

387
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:42.000
I charge and command that, at the city's cost,

388
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.400
the pissing-conduit run nothing but

389
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.930
claret wine this first year of our reign.

390
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.700
And henceforward it shall be treason

391
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.670
for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer.

392
00:26:58.670 --> 00:26:59.900
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!

393
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.530
Knock him down there.

394
00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:11.800
If this fellow be wise, he'll never call ye Jack Cade more:

395
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.400
I think he hath a very fair warning. My lord,

396
00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.500
there's an army gathered together in Smithfield.

397
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:27.470
Come, then, let's go fight with them; but first, go

398
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.430
and set London bridge on fire; and, if you can,

399
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:36.500
burn down the Tower too. Come, let's away.

400
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:07.200
So, sirs: now go some and pull down the Savoy;

401
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.430
others to the inns of court; down with them all.

402
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.230
I have a suit unto your lordship.

403
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.770
Be it a lordship, thou shalt have it for that word.

404
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:47.000
Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth.

405
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.870
Mass, 'twill be sore law, then;

406
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.670
for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear,

407
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.470
and 'tis not whole yet.

408
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:53.900
Nay, John, it will be stinking law

409
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.130
for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese.

410
00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:02.430
I have thought upon it, it shall be so.

411
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:07.600
Away, burn all the records of the realm:

412
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:13.370
my mouth shall be the parliament of England.

413
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.500
Then we are like to have biting statutes,

414
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.730
unless his teeth be pulled out.

415
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:28.270
And henceforward all things shall be in common.

416
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.330
My lord, a prize, a prize! here's the Lord Say,

417
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.270
which sold the towns in France; he that made us pay

418
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.430
one and twenty fifteens, and one shilling to the pound,

419
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.900
the last subsidy.

420
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:44.300
Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times.

421
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:15.400
thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord!

422
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:25.400
now art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction regal.

423
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.630
What canst thou answer to my majesty

424
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.030
for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur kiss my backside,

425
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.100
the dauphin of France?

426
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.800
Be it known unto thee by these presence,

427
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.500
even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I am the besom

428
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.830
that must sweep the court clean

429
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:49.470
of such filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously

430
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:54.630
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school;

431
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.600
and whereas, before, our forefathers

432
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.370
had no other books but the score and the tally,

433
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.670
thou hast caused printing to be used,

434
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.730
and contrary to the king, his crown and dignity,

435
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.170
thou hast built a paper-mill.

436
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.300
It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee

437
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.900
that usually speak of a noun and a verb,

438
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.230
and such abominable words

439
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:21.730
as no Christian ear can endure to hear.

440
00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:24.470
Thou hast appointed justices of peace,

441
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.470
to call poor men before them

442
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.800
about matters they were not able to answer.

443
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.330
Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because

444
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:39.500
they could not read, thou hast hanged them;

445
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.000
when, indeed, only for that cause

446
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.700
they have been most worthy to live.

447
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:52.800
Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?

448
00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.000
What of that?

449
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.930
Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a cloak,

450
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.270
when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets.

451
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.400
And work in their shirt; as myself, for example,

452
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.170
that am a butcher.

453
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.270
You men of Kent,--

454
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.870
What say you of Kent?

455
00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:20.370
Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'

456
00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:24.370
Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.

457
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:31.500
Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.

458
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:55.100
Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,

459
00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:02.700
Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle:

460
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:06.130
Sweet is the country, because full of riches;

461
00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:13.570
The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;

462
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:20.130
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.

463
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:25.630
I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,

464
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:30.300
Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.

465
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:35.530
Justice with favour have I always done;

466
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:42.530
Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.

467
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.930
When have I aught exacted at your hands,

468
00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:53.000
But to maintain the king, the realm and you?

469
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,

470
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.630
Because my book preferr'd me to the king,

471
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.030
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,

472
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.470
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,

473
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:09.630
Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,

474
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:15.500
You cannot but forbear to murder me:

475
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.600
This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings

476
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.170
For your behoof,--

477
00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:22.670
Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?

478
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.870
Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck

479
00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.000
Those that I never saw and struck them dead.

480
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.670
O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?

481
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:41.100
These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.

482
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:46.330
Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.

483
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:51.300
Long sitting to determine poor men's causes

484
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.970
Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.

485
00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.400
Why dost thou quiver, man?

486
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:03.070
The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.

487
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:12.270
Nay, he nods at us, as who should say,

488
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:17.500
I'll be even with them:

489
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.030
I'll see if his head will stand steadier

490
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:25.730
on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.

491
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:35.900
Tell me wherein have I offended most?

492
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:42.170
Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.

493
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:46.930
Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?

494
00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:52.470
Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?

495
00:37:52.470 --> 00:38:00.870
Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?

496
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.670
These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,

497
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:10.070
This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.

498
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:21.070
O, let me live!

499
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:26.130
I feel remorse in myself with his words;

500
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.770
but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be

501
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:37.930
but for pleading so well for his life. Away with him!

502
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.530
he has a familiar under his tongue;

503
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.230
he speaks not o' God's name.

504
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:46.400
Go, take him away, I say, and strike

505
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.270
off his head presently; and then break into his

506
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:55.070
son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer,

507
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.370
and strike off his head,

508
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:01.600
and bring them both upon two poles hither.

509
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.800
It shall be done.

510
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:11.200
Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,

511
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.870
God should be so obdurate as yourselves,

512
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:21.570
How would it fare with your departed souls?

513
00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:25.870
And therefore yet relent, and save my life.

514
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.330
Away with him! and do as I command ye.

515
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.530
The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear

516
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:39.100
a head on his shoulders, unless he pay me tribute;

517
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.130
there shall not a maid be married,

518
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.200
but she shall pay to me

519
00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:46.730
her maidenhead ere they have it: men shall hold of

520
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:53.470
me in capite; and we charge and command that their

521
00:39:53.470 --> 00:40:04.830
wives shall be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell.

522
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:12.700
My lord, when shall we go to Cheapside

523
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:17.200
to take up commodities upon our bills?

524
00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.100
Marry, presently.

525
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.170
O, brave!

526
00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:35.230
But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,

527
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:40.370
But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,

528
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:43.900
for they loved well when they were alive.

529
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.770
Now part them again, lest they consult about the giving up of

530
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:54.230
some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the spoil

531
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:58.600
of the city until night: for with these borne before us,

532
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:01.900
instead of maces, will we ride through

533
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:13.870
the streets, and at every corner have them kiss. Away!

534
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.570
Up Fish Street! down Saint Magnus' Corner! Kill

535
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.430
and knock down! throw them into Thames!

536
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.000
(trumpets)

537
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.200
What noise is this I hear? Dare any be so bold

538
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.930
to sound retreat or parley, when I command them kill?

539
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:39.230
Ay, here they be that dare and will disturb thee:

540
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.700
Know, Cade, we come ambassadors from the king

541
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.870
Unto the commons whom thou hast misled;

542
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.200
And here pronounce free pardon to them all

543
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.800
That will forsake thee and go home in peace.

544
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.200
What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,

545
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.230
And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;

546
00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:01.770
Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?

547
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.130
Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,

548
00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.930
Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'

549
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:13.930
Who hateth him and honours not his father,

550
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:18.170
Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,

551
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.970
Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.

552
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:28.270
God save the king! God save the king!

553
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.630
What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave?

554
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:34.970
And you, base peasants, do ye believe him?

555
00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.030
will you needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?

556
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.630
Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,

557
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.470
that you should leave me at the White Hart in

558
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:47.070
Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out

559
00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:49.070
these arms till you had recovered your ancient

560
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:54.500
freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,

561
00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.830
and delight to live in slavery to the nobility.

562
00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:04.600
Let them break your backs with burthens, take your

563
00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.230
houses over your heads, ravish your wives

564
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:12.370
and daughters before your faces: as for me,

565
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.130
I will make shift for one;

566
00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.330
and so, God's curse light upon you all!

567
00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.930
We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!

568
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.030
Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,

569
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:26.830
That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?

570
00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:29.530
Will he conduct you through the heart of France,

571
00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.500
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?

572
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.600
Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,

573
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:42.370
The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,

574
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.930
Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?

575
00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:49.270
Methinks already in this civil broil

576
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.200
I see them lording it in London streets,

577
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.530
Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.

578
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.500
Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry

579
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.230
Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.

580
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:12.400
To France, to France, and get what you have lost;

581
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.700
Spare England, for it is your native coast;

582
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:23.370
Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;

583
00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:28.370
God on our side, doubt not of victory.

584
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:34.770
A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.

585
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:43.130
Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro

586
00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:48.670
as this multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them

587
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:57.600
to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me desolate.

588
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:03.000
I see them lay their heads together to surprise me.

589
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.670
My sword make way for me, for here is no staying.

590
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.830
In despite of the devils and hell,

591
00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.300
have through the very middest of you?

592
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.730
What, is he fled? Go some, and follow him;

593
00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:17.130
And he that brings his head unto the king

594
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.800
Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.

595
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.170
Follow me, soldiers: we'll devise a mean

596
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.770
To reconcile you all unto the king.

597
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:25.930
Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,

598
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:30.170
And could command no more content than I?

599
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:32.970
No sooner was I crept out of my cradle

600
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.500
But I was made a king, at nine months old.

601
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:38.970
Was never subject long'd to be a king

602
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:43.000
As I do long and wish to be a subject.

603
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Health and glad tidings to your majesty!

604
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.070
Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?

605
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:49.600
Or is he but retired to make him strong?

606
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:53.300
He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield;

607
00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.200
And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,

608
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.930
Expect your highness' doom of life or death.

609
00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:01.370
Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,

610
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:04.530
To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!

611
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.170
Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,

612
00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.000
And show'd how well you love your prince and country:

613
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Continue still in this so good a mind,

614
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.900
And Henry, though he be infortunate,

615
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.430
Assure yourselves, will never be unkind:

616
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.900
And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,

617
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.470
I do dismiss you to your several countries.

618
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:33.630
God save the king! God save the king!

619
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.270
Please it your grace to be advertised

620
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:37.630
The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,

621
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.100
And with a puissant and a mighty force

622
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.800
Of gallowglasses and stout kerns

623
00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.370
Is marching hitherward in proud array,

624
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.170
And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,

625
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:46.930
His arms are only to remove from thee

626
00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:51.230
The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.

627
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:55.470
Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.

628
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.100
Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,

629
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.630
Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:

630
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.900
But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;

631
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.430
And now is York in arms to second him.

632
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.170
I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,

633
00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:10.270
And ask him what's the reason of these arms.

634
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.770
Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;

635
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:14.400
And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,

636
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.400
Until his army be dismiss'd from him.

637
00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.700
I will yield my lord to prison willingly,

638
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.600
Or unto death, to do my country good.

639
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.370
In any case, be not too rough in terms;

640
00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.700
For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.

641
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.870
I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal

642
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:35.130
As all things shall redound unto your good.

643
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.000
Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;

644
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.870
For yet may England curse my wretched reign.

645
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:26.470
Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,

646
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:33.700
and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me

647
00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.270
in these woods and durst not peep out,

648
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:43.500
for all the country is laid for me; but now

649
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.130
am I so hungry that if I might have a lease of my life

650
00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:50.900
for a thousand years I could stay no longer.

651
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.200
Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden,

652
00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:59.430
to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while,

653
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:03.870
which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach

654
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:09.800
this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'

655
00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.570
was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a

656
00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.530
sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill;

657
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:24.200
and many a time, when I have been dry and

658
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.470
bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a

659
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:39.130
quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'

660
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:41.670
must serve me to feed on.

661
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:58.770
Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,

662
00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:04.200
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?

663
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.930
This small inheritance my father left me

664
00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:23.270
Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.

665
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:27.070
I seek not to wax great by others' waning,

666
00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:31.330
Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:

667
00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:35.770
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state

668
00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:39.530
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.

669
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.730
Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray,

670
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:53.000
for entering his fee-simple without leave.

671
00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.330
Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand

672
00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:05.870
crowns of the king carrying my head to him:

673
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:09.130
but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow

674
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:13.270
my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.

675
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:17.700
Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,

676
00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.070
I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?

677
00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:24.470
Is't not enough to break into my garden,

678
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.270
And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,

679
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.230
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,

680
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.470
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?

681
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.970
Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was broached,

682
00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:48.070
and beard thee too. Look on me well:

683
00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:52.800
I have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou

684
00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.200
and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all

685
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:03.170
as dead as a doornails, I pray God I may never eat grass more.

686
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:09.000
Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,

687
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.170
That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,

688
00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.930
Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.

689
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.670
Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,

690
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:28.730
See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:

691
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:33.870
Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;

692
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:37.600
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,

693
00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.670
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;

694
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:47.870
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;

695
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:51.870
And if mine arm be heaved in the air,

696
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:59.170
Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.

697
00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:06.870
As for words, whose greatness answers words,

698
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:13.470
Let this my sword report what speech forbears.

699
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:18.100
By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I

700
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:26.130
heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out

701
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:30.100
this burly-boned clown in chines of beef

702
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.470
ere thou sleep in thy sheath,

703
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:36.200
I beseech God on my knees thou

704
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.570
mayst be turned to hobnails.

705
00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.800
O, I am slain!

706
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.400
famine and no other hath slain me:

707
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:24.700
let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me

708
00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:30.570
but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them all.

709
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:43.030
Wither, garden; and be henceforth

710
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:48.270
a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,

711
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:54.700
because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.

712
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.830
Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?

713
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:11.300
Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell

714
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:17.070
Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort

715
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:23.670
all the world to be cowards; for I, that never feared any,

716
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:31.770
am vanquished by famine, not by valour.

717
00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:37.300
How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.

718
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:46.370
Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;

719
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:50.570
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,

720
00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:56.130
So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.

721
00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:02.270
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels

722
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:07.070
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,

723
00:57:07.070 --> 00:57:12.400
And there cut off thy most ungracious head;

724
00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.800
Which I will bear in triumph to the king,

725
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:26.400
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

726
00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:33.570
