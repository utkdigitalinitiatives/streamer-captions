WEBVTT

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Moyers: AND I'M BILL MOYERS.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.000
WELCOME.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
EVERY WEEK AT THIS TIME WE'LL BE

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
HOLDING A KALEIDOSCOPE UP TO THE

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.000
LIGHT AND TURNING IT TO SEE

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
IDEAS AND EVENTS THROUGH

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.000
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'VE BEEN A JOURNALIST SINCE I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
WAS 16 YEARS OLD, WITH A DETOUR

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
HERE AND THERE, AND IT'S JUST AS

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
EXCITING AS EVER TO CATCH A GUST

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
OF NEWS AND RIDE IT TO SOME

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.000
FRESH INSIGHT AND UNDERSTANDING.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
BUT EVENTS COME FASTER THAN EVER

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
AND THE NEWS FROM MANY MORE

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
PLACES-- YOUTUBE, THE WEB,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
SATELLITE RADIO, iPODS--  SO A

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
WEEKLY JOURNAL WILL REFLECT A

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
VARIETY OF SOURCES.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
FOR EXAMPLE, I START MY DAY WITH

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
JOSH MARSHALL AND END IT WITH

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
JON STEWART. ONE'S A JOURNALIST;

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
THE OTHER SAYS HE IS JUST A

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
COMIC, BUT I THINK HE'S REALLY

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000
KIDDING.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.000
WITH PORK.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
THIS BILL GIVES PILES OF

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
MONEY TO SHRIMPERS, AND PEANUT

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.000
STORAGE.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
PEANUT STORAGE.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
IN FACT THE DEMOCRATIC BILL

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
HAS $74 MILLION FOR PEANUT

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
STORAGE IN THE IRAQ

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.000
APPROPRIATIONS BILL.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
NEGOTIATION WENT: YES, YES, WE

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
BOTH HAVE OUR PROBLEMS.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
YOU HAVE AN UNWINABLE WAR

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
SINKING AMERICA INTO A

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.000
PERMANENT MORAS, AND I HAVE MY

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
OWN PROBLEM.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
ING UP ON "THE JOURNAL" JON

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
STEWART OF "THE DALEY SHOW"

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
AND JOSH MARSHALL OF "TALKING

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000
POINTS MEMO.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Moyers: WITH ME NOW IS JON

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
STEWART.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.000
WELCOME TO "BILL MOYERS

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
JOURNAL."

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME, JON

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
STEWART.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
MY ABSOLUTE PLEASURE.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.000
WELCOME BACK.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
VERY EXCITED TO SEE YOU BACK ON

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THE TELEVISION.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Moyers: I'M GLAD TO BE HERE,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
BUT, YOU KNOW, I... I'M HERE

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
ONLY BECAUSE I APPLIED FOR A JOB

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
AS A CORRESPONDENT ON THE "DAILY

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.000
SHOW" AND YOU TURNED ME DOWN.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
WE HAVE STANDARDS.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
ANYBODY WITH THE KIND OF

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.000
JOURNALISM EXPERIENCE AND

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
PROFESSIONALISM THAT YOU HAVE

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
DISPLAYED OVER THESE YEARS CAN

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
NOT WORK FOR MY PROGRAM.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Moyers: YOU'VE SAID MANY

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.000
TIMES, "I DON'T WANT TO BE A

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
JOURNAL... I'M NOT A

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
JOURNALIST."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
AND WE'RE NOT.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Moyers: BUT YOU'RE ACTING

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
LIKE ONE.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
YOU'VE... YOU'VE ASSUMED THAT

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
ROLE.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WORK WITH

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
ME NOW THINK THEY GET BETTER

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.000
JOURNALISM FROM YOU THAN THEY DO

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
FROM THE SUNDAY MORNING TALK

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
SHOWS.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I CAN ASSURE THEM THEY'RE NOT

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
GETTING ANY JOURNALISM FROM US.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
WE ARE... IF ANYTHING I DO

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
BELIEVE WE FUNCTION AS A SORT OF

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
EDITORIAL CARTOON, THAT WE ARE A

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
DIGESTIVE PROCESS, LIKE SO MANY

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
OTHER DIGESTIVE PROCESSES THAT

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
GO ON.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THE THING ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
GET THIS AND, YOU KNOW, YOUNG

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
PEOPLE GET THAT FROM ME.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
PEOPLE ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
CONSUMERS OF INFORMATION, AND

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
THEY'RE PULLING ALL DIFFERENT

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
THINGS.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
IT'S... IT'S... IT'S THE SAME

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
ARGUMENT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.000
BLOGS: THE BLOGS ARE

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
RESPONSIBLE.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
THE BLOGS ARE LIKE ANYTHING

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
ELSE.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
YOU JUDGE EACH ONE BASED ON ITS

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
OWN VERACITY AND INTELLIGENCE

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
AND ALL OF THAT.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AND IF YOU LIKE, YOU COULD

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
CHERRY-PICK ONLY THE THINGS THAT

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.000
YOU AGREE WITH FROM VARIOUS

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
THINGS.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
OR IF YOU WANT YOU CAN TRY AND

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
GET A BROADER PERSPECTIVE, OR

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THEIR MINDS OR

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
FIND PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
INTERESTING AND URGENT

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
JOURNALISM.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
AND THE SAME GOES FOR OUR SHOW.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
IT'S A PRISM INTO PEOPLE'S OWN

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
IDEOLOGIES WHEN THEY WATCH OUR

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
PROGRAM.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
THIS IS JUST OUR TAKE.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Moyers: BUT IT ISN'T JUST

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
YOU.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
SOMETIMES YOU'LL START A RIFF,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
YOU'LL START DOWN THE PATH OF A

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
JOKE, AND IT'S ABOUT BUSH OR

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
ABOUT CHENEY, AND THE AUDIENCE

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.000
WILL GET IT; YOUR LIVE AUDIENCE

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
WILL GET IT.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
THEY'LL START APPLAUDING EVEN

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
BEFORE THEY KNOW THE PUNCH LINE,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
AND I'M THINKING, "OKAY, THEY

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
GET IT.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.000
THAT'S HALF THE COUNTRY."

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER HALF OF THE

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
COUNTRY?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
ARE THEY PAYING ATTENTION?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
THEY DON'T CARE, THEY DON'T...

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.000
THEY WOULD... THEY WOULDN'T

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
LISTEN TO THE JOKE.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
IF THEY DID, THEY WOULDN'T GET

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
IT?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
WELL, I DO THINK THAT SENSE

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.000
OF HUMOR GOES AS FAR AS OUR

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
IDEOLOGY.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
--AS YOUR IDEOLOGY.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY WE HAVE

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
WE HAVE VERY INTERESTING

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
REACTIONS ON OUR SHOW.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY SAYING, "I

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
LOVE YOUR... YOUR SHOW IS SO

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
FUNNY, UNTIL YOU MADE A JOKE

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, WHICH IS A

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.000
SERIOUS ISSUE, AND I CAN'T

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
BELIEVE YOU DID THAT.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
AND I AM NEVER WATCHING YOUR

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
SHOW AGAIN."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE NOT

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
WARRIORS IN THEIR CAUSE.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
WE'RE A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
REALLY FEEL THAT THEY WANT TO

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
WRITE JOKES ABOUT THE ABSURDITY

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
THAT WE SEE IN GOVERNMENT AND

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
THE WORLD AND ALL THAT, AND

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
THAT'S IT.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
BUSH HAD COME MAINLY TO DISCUSS

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
THE WAR SPENDING BILL, RECENTLY

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
PASSED BY THE DEMOCRATIC

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
CONGRESS, WHICH GIVES THE

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
PRESIDENT ALL THE FUNDING HE

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
DESIRES FOR THE TROOP SURGE, BUT

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
TIES THE FUNDING TO A DEFINITE

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
DATE FOR WITHDRAWAL OF THE

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
TROOPS.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT THE

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
PRESIDENT THINKS OF THAT IDEA.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
PUSHING LEGISLATION THAT

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
WOULD UNDERCUT OUR TROOPS JUST

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
AS WE'RE BEGINNING TO MAKE

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
PROGRESS IN BAGHDAD...

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
OOH.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
WE'RE JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE IT.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
OH, THEY JUST PULLED THE RUG

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
TO... D'OH, IT'S JUST HAPPENED

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
NOW!

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
YOU KNOW, I SEEM TO REMEMBER,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
WE'VE BEEN MAKING PROGRESS FOR

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
QUITE SOME TIME NOW.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
THAT'S PROGRESS.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
AND IT'S IMPORTANT PROGRESS, AND

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
STRATEGY TO WIN IN IRAQ.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.000
IRAQ HAS MADE INCREDIBLE

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
POLITICAL PROGRESS.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THE IRAQIS ARE MAKING INSPIRING

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
PROGRESS.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.000
IRAQ IS MAKING INCREDIBLE

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
POLITICAL PROGRESS.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I BELIEVE WE'RE MAKING REALLY

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.000
GOOD PROGRESS IN IRAQ.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
WE'RE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
IT'S SLOWLY BUT SURELY MAKING

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
PROGRESS.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
IN THE BATTLE OF IRAQ, THE

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
UNITED STATES AND OUR ALLIES

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
HAVE PREVAILED.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
WAIT A MINUTE!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
WAIT A MINUTE!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I FIGURED THIS OUT.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH WHAT

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
WE'VE DONE IN IRAQ.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING TIME AS IT

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
GOES FORWARD.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
WHAT A CLASSIC MISTAKE.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:52.000
LINEAR TIME IS SO 9/11.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
--PRE-9/11.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
IT'S... IT'S... IT'S KIND OF

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.000
ASTONISHING.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
THERE IS... I USED TO HAVE A

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
REAL DISCONNECT, I THINK, WITH

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
GOING ON.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
IT'S SUDDENLY BECOME CLEAR TO

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
ME.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
THEY WOULD RATHER US BELIEVE

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.000
THEM TO BE WILDLY INCOMPETENT

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
AND INARTICULATE THAN TO LET US

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THEY

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
OPERATE.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AND SO THEY DO CONSTITUTIONALLY

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
MANDATED THINGS MOST OF THE

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
TIME, BUT THEY DON'T... THEY

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
FULFILL THE LETTER OF THEIR

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
OBLIGATION TO CHECKS AND

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
BALANCES, BUT NOT THE INTENT.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
FOR INSTANCE, ALBERTO GONZALES--

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
AND YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING THE

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
HEARINGS-- HE IS EITHER A

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
PERJURER OR A LOW-FUNCTIONING

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
PINHEAD.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
AND HE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
PORTRAYED IN THOSE HEARINGS AS A

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
LOW-FUNCTIONING PINHEAD RATHER

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
THAN GIVE THE CONGRESSIONAL

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
COMMITTEE CHARGED WITH OVERSIGHT

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
ANY INFORMATION AS TO HIS

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS AT THE

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
AND I USED TO THINK, "THEY'RE

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
DOING THIS BASED ON A CERTAIN

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
ARROGANCE."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
AND NOW I REALIZE THAT IT'S

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THERE IS

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
ONE ACCOUNTABILITY MOMENT FOR A

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
PRESIDENT, AND THAT IS THE FOUR-

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
YEAR ELECTION, AND ONCE YOU GET

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
THAT ELECTION, YOU'RE DONE.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Moyers: THEY'RE RIGHT, ARE

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000
THEY NOT?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THEY'RE COMPLETELY NOT RIGHT.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
THE ELECTION MOMENT IS MERELY

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SAYING,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
"WE'D RATHER YOU BE PRESIDENT

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THAN THAT GUY."

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
THAT'S IT.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS, THOUGH, YOU

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
STILL HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
OVERSIGHT PROCESS THAT IS THERE

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF BIZARRE

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
SORT OF CULT-LIKE ATMOSPHERE

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
THAT FALLS ALONG...

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I MEAN, I ACCEPT THAT KIND OF

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
VEIL OF SECRECY AROUND TOM

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
CRUISE AND KATIE HOLMES, BUT I

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
DON'T ACCEPT THAT AROUND OUR

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000
GOVERNMENT.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Moyers: TENS OF THOUSANDS,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORDS

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
WERE WRITTEN ABOUT GONZALES'

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
TESTIMONY LAST WEEK IN CONGRESS.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AND I STILL DON'T THINK A LOT OF

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
PEOPLE GET IT.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE ON

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
THE "DAILY SHOW" THAT EVENING,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
YOU DISTILLED THE ESSENCE OF IT.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000
SO THERE IT WAS TODAY, THE

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
BIG FIGHT, GONZALEZ V SENATE.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
ARE YOU READY TO BUMBLE?!

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.000
SENATOR, I DON'T RECALL

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
SPECIFICALLY.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I DON'T RECALL THE-THE CONTENTS.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
SENATOR, I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I... I DON'T HAVE ANY

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.000
RECOLLECTION.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I HAVE SEARCHED MY MEMORY.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I DON'T RECALL REMEMBERING.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I CAN ONLY TESTIFY AS TO WHAT I

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.000
RECALL.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
SENATOR, I DON'T RECALL.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I DON'T RECALL.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT NOTHING

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
IMPROPER OCCURRED.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
AFTER WEEKS OF MOCK

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
TESTIMONY, THERE YOU HAVE IT:

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
ALBERTO GONZALES DOES NOT KNOW

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
WHAT HAPPENED, BUT HE ASSURES

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
YOU WHAT HE DOESN'T REMEMBER WAS

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
HANDLED PROPERLY.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
AND BY THE WAY, THAT WAS ALL

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
JUST... THAT WAS A GAME, AND HE

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.000
KNEW IT, AND THE GUYS ON THE

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
COMMITTEE KNEW IT.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
AND FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
OUT AFTER THAT AND SAY,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
"EVERYTHING I SAW THERE GAVE ME

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
MORE CONFIDENCE IN HIM," THAT

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.000
SOLIDIFIED MY NOTION THAT, "OH,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
IT'S BECAUSE WHAT HE EXPECTED OF

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
GONZALEZ WAS... IT'S SORT OF

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
LIKE, DO YOU REMEMBER IN

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
"GOODFELLAS" WHEN HENRY HILL GOT

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
ARRESTED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
ROBERT DENIRO MET HIM AT THE

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
COURTHOUSE AND HENRY HILL WAS

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
REALLY UPSET BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
ROBERT DENIRO WOULD BE REALLY

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
MAD AT HIM.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
AND DENIRO COMES UP TO HIM AND

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
HE GIVES HIM A $100 AND HE GOES,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
"YOU GOT PINCHED.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
WE ALL GET PINCHED, BUT YOU DID

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.000
IT RIGHT.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
YOU DIDN'T SAY NOTHING."

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Moyers: GONZALES SAID

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
NOTHING.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
RIGHT.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.000
AND HE WENT UP THERE AND SAID

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
NOTHING.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
YOU GAVE THEM NO LEGAL RECOURSE

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
AGAINST YOU, AND YOU MADE

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
YOURSELF, A SMART MAN, A SELF-

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
MADE MAN, LOOK LIKE AN UTTER

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
PINHEAD ON NATIONAL TELEVISION,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
AND YOU DID IT FOR ME.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Moyers: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
THAT THE WASHINGTON PRESS CORPS,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
BY AND LARGE, PARTICULARLY THE

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
SUNDAY SHOWS, JOIN THE GAME WITH

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
THEM?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I MEAN, YOU WATCH THOSE SHOWS...

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
THEY DON'T ALL, I MEAN...

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Moyers: NO, NOT ALL OF THEM

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.000
DO, BUT THERE'S A KIND OF WINK-

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
WINK QUESTIONING GOING ON THERE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
YOU KNOW, I'LL ASK THE DEVIL'S

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
ADVOCATE.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.000
IT'S THE HARLEM "GLOBE"

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
TROTTERS PLAYING THE

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
WASHINGTON GENERALS.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
THEY'RE THE ONLY TEAM PLAYING

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
AND THEY HAVE TO PLAY EACH

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.000
OTHER EVERY WEEK.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
AND THEY ALL SORT OF ASSUMED

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.000
THEIR ROLE.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
AT THIS POINT, THE GOVERNMENT

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
IS JUST, YOU KNOW, BLOWING THE

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
DOORS OFF THE MEDIA, AND NOT

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.000
EVERYWHERE.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE, YOU

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
KNOW, A LOT OF THOSE BLOG

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
REPORTERS AND ALL THOSE THINGS

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
ARE BRINGING A LOT OF URGENCY

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
AND A LOT MOMENTUM TO STORIES

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
THAT WOULDN'T NORMALLY CARRY

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
ANY MOMENTUM.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Moyers: YOU KNOW, WE

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
WATCHED THE McCAIN INTERVIEW

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
YOU DID THIS WEEK.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
UH-HUH.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Moyers: SOMETHING WAS GOING

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
ON IN THAT INTERVIEW THAT I

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
HAVE NOT SEEN IN ANY OTHER

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
INTERVIEW YOU'VE DONE WITH A

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
POLITICAL FIGURE.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
WHAT WAS GOING ON IN YOUR

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.000
HEAD?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
IN MY HEAD?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Moyers: YEAH.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
UH, ARE HIS ARMS LONG

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
ENOUGH TO CONNECT WITH ME IF

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
HE COMES ACROSS THE TABLE.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, OR AT LEAST

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE SUBWAY

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
WITH... THEY KNOW THERE'S A REAL

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.000
THREAT OUT THERE.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
THEY FELT LIKE IRAQ LESSENED OUR

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
ABILITY TO FIGHT THAT THREAT.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
SO WHEN THEY SAY THAT... THAT'S

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.000
WHEN I... WHEN THEY SAY THE

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
TALKING POINT IS "THEY'LL FOLLOW

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
US HOME," THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
FOLLOW US HOME ANYWAY, WHETHER

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.000
WE'RE IN IRAQ OR NOT.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I KNOW THAT.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
LOOK, BILL RUSSELL, A FAMOUS

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
PHILOSOPHER OF THE BOSTON

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.000
CELTICS, ONCE "WHEN THINGS GO

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
BAD, THINGS GO BAD."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THE WAR WAS TERRIBLY MISMANAGED.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
IT WAS TERRIBLY MISMANAGED.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
BUT THEN WHY NOT BE HONEST

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
ABOUT THAT?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
WHY ATTACK THE PEOPLE WHO...?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.000
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
WE ARE WHERE WE ARE NOW.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
THEN THE QUESTION IS: CAN WE

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
GIVE THIS STRATEGY A CHANCE?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
AND I'M EMPHASIZING A CHANCE TO

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.000
SUCCEED WITH A GREAT GENERAL,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
AND I THINK...

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.000
WHY SHOULD WE?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
WHY?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
BECAUSE THE...

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
IF THE ARCHITECTS THAT BUILT

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY DOORS OR

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
WINDOWS DON'T ADMIT THAT THAT'S

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
THE HOUSE THEY BUILT AND

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
CONTINUE TO SAY "NO, IT'S YOUR

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
FAULT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
INTO IT," THEN I DON'T

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
MOVE FORWARD.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I DON'T PARTICULARLY ENJOY

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
THOSE TYPES OF INTERVIEWS,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
BECAUSE I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
FOR SENATOR McCAIN, AND I HATE

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
THE IDEA THAT OUR CONVERSATION

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
BECAME JUST TWO PEOPLE SORT OF

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
TALKING OVER EACH OTHER AT ONE

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
POINT.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
BUT I ALSO IN MY HEAD THOUGHT,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"I WOULD LOVE TO DO AN INTERVIEW

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000
WHERE IT'S JUST SORT OF

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
DECONSTRUCTED THE TALKING POINTS

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
OF IRAQ, THE IDEA OF IS THIS

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
REALLY THE CONVERSATION WE'RE

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
HAVING ABOUT THIS WAR, THAT IF

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
WE DON'T DEFEAT AL QAEDA IN

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
IRAQ, THEY'LL FOLLOW US HOME?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
THAT TO SUPPORT THE TROOPS MEANS

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
NOT TO QUESTION THAT THE SURGE

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
COULD WORK?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING IN

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
IRAQ IS NOT A TERRIBLE WAR, BUT,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:34.000
IN FACT, JUST THE MEDIA'S

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
PORTRAYAL OF IT?"

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
SO I WANTED TO JUST GO THROUGH

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
LIKE, IS THIS REALLY THE

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.000
BE HAVING ABOUT SOMETHING AS

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
SIGNIFICANT AS THIS WAR?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
THEY SAY THAT IF WE PUT A

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
TIMETABLE OR CRITICIZING THE

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
PRESIDENT IS NOT SUPPORTING THE

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.000
TROOPS.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT IS

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
SUPPORTING THE TROOPS LESS THAN

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
EXTENDING THEIR TOURS OF DUTY

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
FROM 12 MONTHS TO 15 MONTHS,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
PUTTING THEM AT STOP-LOSS, AND

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
NOT HAVING WALTER REED BE UP TO

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
SNUFF.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
HOW IS IT... HOW CAN THE

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.000
PRESIDENT JUSTIFY THAT?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
HOW CAN HE HAVE THE BALLS TO

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
JUSTIFY THAT?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IF YOU

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.000
TALK TO THESE YOUNG MEN AND

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING, THEY'LL

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.000
TELL YOU THEY THINK IT'S A

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
WORTHWHILE CAUSE, AND THEY'RE

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM, AND

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.000
THEY...

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
WELL, THEY ALL... I'M SAYING THE

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.000
DO.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I HEAR FROM THEM ALL THE TIME.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
THE MAJORITY OF THE GUYS THAT

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I TALK TO SAY, "THE POLITICAL

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
SCENE IS NOT MY SCENE; I'M A

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.000
SOLDIER."

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I TALK TO THEM ALL THE TIME,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
MY FRIEND, AND I HEAR FROM THEM

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
ALL THE TIME.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
THEY KNOW.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I KNOW WHAT WAR'S LIKE.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I KNOW WHAT THE SCENE'S LIKE.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
AND I'M TELLING YOU THAT THEY

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S FREEDOM.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM BELIEVE

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
THAT.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
NOW, YOU'RE ENTITLED TO YOUR

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
VIEWS.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
BUT THE VIEW OF THE MAJORITY OF

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
THEM IS THAT FEEL THEY'RE DOING

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
THE RIGHT THING, AND THEIR

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
PARENTS, WHO HAVE ALSO MADE

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
SACRIFICES, GENERALLY SPEAKING,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
AND THEY'RE PROUD OF THE

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.000
SERVICE OF THEIR SONS AND

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
DAUGHTERS.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.000
NO ONE'S SAYING THAT THEY

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
SHOULDN'T BE PROUD OF THEIR

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.000
SERVICE.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
AND I'M PROUD OF THEM TOO.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
THIS IS A VERY UNFAIR WAY TO

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IT CERTAINLY IS.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
IT CERTAINLY IS.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
WHAT'S LESS SUPPORTIVE OF

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
THEM IS... SETTLE DOWN FOR A

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.000
SECOND.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
NO, YOU SETTLE DOWN.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
THAT THEY'RE FIGHTING IN A WAR

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.000
THAT THEY LOST.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THEM.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000
WHAT I BELIEVE IS LESS

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
SUPPORTIVE TO THE GOOD PEOPLE

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
WHO BELIEVE THEY'RE FIGHTING A

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
GREAT CAUSE IS TO NOT GIVE THEM

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
A STRATEGY THAT MAKES THEIR

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000
SUCCESS POSSIBLE...

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
WE NOW HAVE A STRATEGY.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:16.000
AND TO NOT... ADDING 10,000

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
PEOPLE TO BAGHDAD?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.000
ADD 350,000.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
THEN WE MIGHT HAVE A SHOT.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
STRATEGY WILL SUCCEED, BUT WE DO

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
HAVE A NEW STRATEGY.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
THAT'S A FACT.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
ALL I'M SAYING IS YOU CANNOT

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
LOOK A SOLDIER IN THE EYE AND

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
SAY, "QUESTIONING THE PRESIDENT

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
IS LESS SUPPORTIVE TO YOU THAN

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
EXTENDING YOUR TOUR THREE

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
MONTHS.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.000
YOU SHOULD BE COMING HOME TO

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
YOUR FAMILY."

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Moyers: I SAW McCAIN SHRIVEL.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I MEAN, HE'S BEEN ON YOUR SHOW

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
LIKE HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.  I

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
THINK ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN A

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
P.O.W. CAMP FOR FIVE YEARS CAN

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
TAKE EIGHT MINUTES ON THE "DAILY

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
SHOW."

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Moyers: BUT SOMETHING

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.000
HAPPENED.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
YOU SAW IT HAPPEN TO HIM.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
WHAT YOU SAW WAS EVASIVE

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.000
ACTION.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
IT WASN'T SHRIVELING, IT WAS

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
MERELY...

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Moyers: BUT HE DROPPED HIS

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
HEAD, AND YOU COULD... YOU

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
COULD ACTUALLY SEE...

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
HE STOPPED CONNECTING AND

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:05.000
JUST LOOKED AT MY CHEST AND

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
DECIDED, "I'M JUST GOING TO

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT HONOR AND

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
DUTY AND THE FAMILIES SHOULD BE

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
PROUD," AND ALL THE THINGS THAT

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
ARE CUDGELS EMOTIONALLY TO KEEP

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
US FROM THE CONVERSATION, BUT

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
THINGS THAT WEREN'T RELEVANT TO

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Moyers: SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
TO WANT JUST WHAT YOU DID,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
SOMEBODY TO CUT THROUGH THE

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
TALKING POINTS AND GET OUR

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
POLITICIANS TO TALK CANDIDLY AND

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
FRANKLY.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
AND I KNOW YOU...

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
SOME PEOPLE WANT IT.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.000
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE DOWNLOAD IT

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
FROM iTUNES.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Moyers: BUT IT WAS THIS TIME,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
THIS MOMENT THIS WEEK THAT YOU

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
DECIDED THAT, WHAT IT...

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Moyers: COMING BACK TO HIM.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
WELL, IT'S ALSO AT THE FORE

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.000
NOW BECAUSE THE SENATE AND THE

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
HOUSE ARE WORKING ON

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
TIMETABLES-- WHICH, BY THE WAY,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.000
WHO KNOWS IF THAT'S AN ISSUE

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
EITHER?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
IT'S... BUT IT'S, AGAIN, THE

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.000
CONVERSATION THAT THE SENATE AND

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
THE HOUSE ARE HAVING WITH THE

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
PRESIDENT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
THE CONVERSATION THAT McCAIN AND

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I WERE HAVING, WHICH WAS TWO

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
PEOPLE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
AND NOBODY REALLY ADDRESSING THE

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
UNDERLYING ISSUES OF WHAT KIND

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
OF COUNTRY DO WE WANT TO BE

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
MOVING FORWARD IN THIS?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
PACIFIST OR SUGGESTING THAT YOU

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
CAN NEVER HAVE A MILITARY

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
SOLUTION TO THINGS; IT'S JUST

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
THAT IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS NOT

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
THE SMART WAY TO FIGHT THIS

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.000
THREAT.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Moyers: YOUR PERSISTENCE AND

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
HIS INABILITY TO ANSWER WITHOUT

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
THE TALKING POINTS DID GET TO

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
THE TRUTH: THAT THERE'S A

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
CONTRADICTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
IN VIETNAM... THERE'S A

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
CONTRADICTION...

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:33.000
YEAH, EXACTLY, THERE'S A

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
CONTRADICTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
IN THAT WAR THAT THEY CAN'T TALK

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.000
ABOUT.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
THERE IS AN ENORMOUS

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
CONTRADICTION, AND IT IS READILY

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
APPARENT IF YOU JUST WALK

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
THROUGH SIMPLE SORT OF LOGIC AND

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
SIMPLE RATIONAL POINTS.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
BUT THE THING THAT THEY DON'T

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
REALIZE IS THAT EVERYONE WANTS

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
THEM TO COME FROM BEYOND THAT

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
CONTRADICTION SO THAT WE CAN ALL

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
FIX IT.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
NOBODY IS SAYING, "WE DON'T HAVE

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
A PROBLEM."

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
NOBODY IS SAYING THAT "9/11

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
DIDN'T HAPPEN."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, "WE'RE

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
NOT A FRAGILE COUNTRY.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
TRUST US TO HAVE THIS

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
CONVERSATION SO THAT WE CAN DO

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY, IN A MORE

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
EFFECTIVE WAY."

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Moyers: WHY AREN'T WE HAVING

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
THAT CONVERSATION?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.000
WELL, THAT'S A VERY GOOD

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
POINT.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
WHY IS THE COUNTRY NOT HAVING

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000
THIS CONVERSATION, THE KIND OF

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
CONVERSATION THAT REQUIRES THE

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
POLITICIANS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
FOR THE WAR TO BE SPECIFIC TO

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
THE CONCERNS OF THE AMERICAN

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
PEOPLE?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I MEAN, THEY DO COME OUT AND A

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:37.000
KIND OF GAUZE GOES UP.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.000
BECAUSE I DON'T... I DON'T

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
THINK POLITICS IS ANY LONGER

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
ABOUT A CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.000
COUNTRY.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
IT'S ABOUT FIGURING OUT HOW TO

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
GET TO DO WHAT YOU WANT, THE

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.000
BEST WAY TO SELL THE PRODUCT

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
THAT YOU WANT TO PUT OUT THERE,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:51.000
BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOR THE

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
PRODUCTS ON... YOU KNOW, IT'S

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
SORT OF LIKE WHEN A DISHWASHING

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
SOAP, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.000
MAKE A BIG SPLASH, SO THEY

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
DECIDE TO HAVE MORE LEMON, AS

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000
THOUGH PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
LIKE, "THAT HAS BEEN THE PROBLEM

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.000
WITH MY DISHES!

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:04.000
NOT ENOUGH LEMON SCENT!"

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Moyers: WELL, WHAT'S YOUR

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.000
THINKING ABOUT WHY IT IS AS THE

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
WAR ENTERS ITS FIFTH YEAR, AND

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
THE PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED AN

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
EXTENSION OF TOURS TO 15 MONTHS,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
AND THEY'RE GOING TO CALL UP THE

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
NATIONAL GUARD, AND APRIL WAS

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.000
THE BLOODIEST MONTH SO FAR SINCE

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
THE WAR STARTED, AND THERE WAS

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
ONE DAY IN APRIL THAT WAS THE

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
BLOODIEST DAY, THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
SEEN THEY HAVE NO WAY TO GET THE

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
GUYS IN WASHINGTON AND

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
CONDOLEEZZA RICE TO LISTEN TO

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
THEM, THAT THERE SEEMS A

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
DETACHMENT EMOTIONALLY AND

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
POLITICALLY IN THIS COUNTRY FROM

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:37.000
WHAT IS HAPPENING.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
IT'S VERY HARD TO FEEL THE

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
DIFFICULTIES THAT THE MILITARY

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.000
GOES THROUGH.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
IT'S VERY HARD TO FEEL THE

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.000
DIFFICULTIES OF MILITARY

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
FAMILIES UNLESS YOU'RE IN THAT

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
ENVIRONMENT.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FORCE

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.000
YOURSELF TO TRY AND PUT YOURSELF

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S SORT OF SHOES

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
AND ENVIRONMENT TO GET THE SENSE

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
OF THAT.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
I DO THINK GOVERNMENT COUNTS ON

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
IS THAT PEOPLE ARE BUSY.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
MOBILIZE A BUSY AND RELATIVELY

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
AFFLUENT COUNTRY, UNLESS IT'S

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:10.000
OVER REALLY CRUCIAL, YOU KNOW,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
FOUNDATIONAL ISSUES THAT WE COME

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
TO SORT OF A TIPPING POINT.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Moyers: WAR?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
BUT WAR THAT HASN'T AFFECTED

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
US HERE IN THE WAY THAT YOU

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
WOULD IMAGINE A FIVE-YEAR WAR

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
WOULD AFFECT A COUNTRY.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY'RE SO...

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
REALLY HERE'S THE DISCONNECT.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
IT'S SORT OF THIS ODD-- AND I'VE

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
ALWAYS HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THE

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
RATIONALITY OF IT-- THAT THE

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
PRESIDENT SAYS, "WE ARE IN THE

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
FIGHT FOR A WAY OF LIFE.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
THIS IS THE GREATEST BATTLE OF

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
OUR GENERATION AND OF THE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
GENERATIONS TO COME, AND, SO

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS, YOU

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
KNOW, IRAQ HAS TO BE WON OR OUR

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
WAY OF LIFE ENDS AND OUR

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.000
CHILDREN ALL SUFFER.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:49.000
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS SEND

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
10,000 MORE TROOPS TO BAGHDAD."

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
SO THERE'S A DISCONNECT THERE

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
BETWEEN YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
IS THE FIGHT OF OUR GENERATION,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
TROOP STRENGTH BY 10% AND THAT'S

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.000
GOING TO DO IT.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I'M SURE WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
DO IS SEND 400,000 MORE TROOPS

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.000
THERE, BUT HE CAN'T BECAUSE HE

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
DOESN'T HAVE THEM.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
AND THE WAY TO GET THAT WOULD BE

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.000
TO INSTITUTE A DRAFT, AND THE

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
MINUTE YOU DO THAT SUDDENLY THE

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
COUNTRY'S NOT SO DAMN BUSY

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
ANYMORE AND THEN THEY REALLY

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
FIGHT BACK, AND THEN THE WHOLE

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
THING FALLS APART.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
SO THEY HAVE A REALLY DELICATE

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
BALANCE TO WALK BETWEEN KEEPING

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
US RELATIVELY FEARFUL, BUT NOT

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
SO FEARFUL THAT WE STOP WHAT

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
WE'RE DOING AND REALLY EXAMINE

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:33.000
HOW IT IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
WAGING THIS.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Moyers: BUT I STILL NEED TO

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
KNOW WHY McCCAIN, THIS WEEK,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.000
WHY... YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
BUT WHY IS HE THE PERSON FROM

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
WHO...

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.000
OH, HE'S THE ONLY PERSON I

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
CAN GET A HOLD OF.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
YOU MEAN, IS THAT WHY DID I?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Moyers: YEAH, YEAH.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
OH, YEAH.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
NO ONE ELSE WILL TALK TO ME.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Moyers: BUT YOU WERE THINKING

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
OF THESE BEFORE YOU GOT McCAIN.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN...

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
SURE, YES, THIS HAPPENED WITH

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.000
McCAIN BECAUSE HE WAS

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WALK INTO

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
THE STUDIO, YOU KNOW.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
IT'S... THE FRUSTRATION OF OUR

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
SHOW IS VERY MUCH OUTSIDE ANY

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
PARAMETERS OF THE MEDIA OR THE

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
GOVERNMENT.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
PEOPLE.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.000
WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
WE DON'T GO TO DINNERS.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
WE DON'T HAVE COCKTAIL PARTIES.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
WE DON'T, YOU KNOW... YOU'VE

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ONE OF US

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
ENDS UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
CORRESPONDENTS' DINNER.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
IT DOESN'T END WELL, YOU KNOW.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
SO HE WAS THE UNLUCKY RECIPIENT

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
OF PENT-UP FRUSTRATION.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Moyers: YOU KNOW, THE MEDIA'S

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
BEEN PLAYING THIS BIG-- CNN,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
"U.S.A. TODAY."

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.000
WELL, THEY'VE GOT 24 HOURS TO

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
FILL.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:29.000
YOU KNOW, HOW MANY TIMES CAN

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
ANNA NICOLE SMITH'S BABY GET A

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
NEW FATHER?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Moyers: BUT WHAT DOES IT SAY

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
ABOUT THE PRESS THAT THAT

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
INTERVIEW YOU DID BECAME NEWS

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
AND, IN A WAY, REFLECTED ON THE

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
FAILURE OF THE "PROFESSIONAL"

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
JOURNALIST TO ASK THOSE KIND OF

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000
QUESTIONS?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, FOR

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000
SOME REASON, EVERYTHING THAT WE

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
DO OR STEPHEN DOES-- STEPHEN

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
COLBERT-- IS ALSO THEN TURNED

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
INTO NEWS.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT THE

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
MACHINE IS ABOUT REPORTING THE

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
NEWS AND THEN REPORTING THE NEWS

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
ABOUT THE NEWS AND THEN HAVING

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
THOSE MOMENTS WHERE THEY SIT

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.000
AROUND AND GO, "ARE WE REPORTING

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
THE NEWS CORRECTLY?"

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I THINK WE ARE, AND THEN THEY GO

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
BACK TO THE... AND THE CYCLE

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
JUST SORT OF CONTINUES.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
I DON'T KNOW THAT IF THERE WAS

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
ANYTHING PARTICULARLY

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
ASTONISHING ABOUT THE

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
CONVERSATION IN THAT REGARD.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
YOU KNOW, IT WAS DID YOU SEE THE

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
INTERVIEW THAT WOLF BLITZER DID

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000
WITH DICK CHENEY A WHILE BACK?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Moyers: YES, WE HAVE THAT.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:36.000
LET'S PLAY IT.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
KUMBAYAH, MY LORD...

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:49.000
KUMBAYAH...

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.000
KUMBAYAR ARE.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
PERHAPS THIS SIGNALS A NEW

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
ERA OF OPENNESS, GLASNOST, IF

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.000
YOU WILL, WITH THIS

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
IS BIN LADEN STILL ALIVE?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.000
WHAT IF THE SENATE PASSES A

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
RESOLUTION PASSES SAYING IT'S

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.000
NOT A GOOD IDEA?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
HAVE YOU CONTRIBUTED TO HIS

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
LEGAL DEFENSE FUND?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:02.000
DO YOU TRUST NOURI AL-MALIKI?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
DO YOU WANT HIM TO ARREST

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
MUQTADA AL-SADR?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000
OOOH.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
BLITZER!

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
FINALLY EARNING THAT WHITE

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
BEARD.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
SOLID QUESTIONS, WOLF.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
MR. VICE PRESIDENT?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS IT.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
YOU CAN ASK THAT QUESTION ALL

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.000
DAY LONG.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
YOU'VE GOT MY ANSWER.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT PRECISE.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
NOW, NO ADMINISTRATION IN THEIR

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO ANSWER

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
THE QUESTION YOU JUST ASKED.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
WE KNOW NO ADMINISTRATION IN

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.000
THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD ANSWER

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
IT.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
WE'RE ASKING YOU!

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Moyers: HAVE YOU LOST YOUR

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
INNOCENCE?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
WHAT?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
WELL, IT WAS IN 1981.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
IT WAS AT A FRAT PARTY.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
OH, I'M SORRY.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS IS GOING

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
TO SOUND INCREDIBLY PAT, BUT I

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
THINK YOU LOSE YOUR INNOCENCE

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
WHEN YOU HAVE KIDS, BECAUSE THE

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
WORLD SUDDENLY BECOMES A MUCH

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:56.000
MORE DANGEROUS PLACE.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
AND YOU BECOME MUCH MORE...

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
YOU... THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
HAPPEN.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
YOU RECOGNIZE HOW FRAGILE

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
INDIVIDUALS ARE, AND YOU

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000
RECOGNIZE THE STRENGTH OF THE

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
GENERAL OVERALL GROUP, BUT YOU

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
YOU'RE JUST FIGHTING FOR THE ONE

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
THING, SEE, AND THEN YOU ALSO

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.000
RECOGNIZE THAT EVERYBODY THEN IS

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
ALSO SOMEBODY'S CHILD.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
IT'S... I'M... YEAH, I MEAN,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
IT'S TUMULTUOUS.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Moyers: SO YOUR CHILDREN ARE

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
HOW OLD?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
TWO AND A HALF AND 14 MONTHS.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Moyers: SO HAS IT BEEN WITHIN

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
THAT PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
MADE THIS-- YOU WOULDN'T

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
RECOGNIZE IT, BUT WE RECOGNIZE

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
IT-- TRANSFORMATION FROM THE

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
STANDUP COMIC TO A SERIOUS

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL CRITIC?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
SERIOUS AND SOCIAL POLITICAL

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
CRITIC.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Moyers: BUT I DO.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
AND I'M YOUR AUDIENCE.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
YES, AND I END UP WITH ONE OF

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
YOUR TOTE BAGS.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.000
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I GUESS I DON'T SPEND ANY TIME

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
THINKING ABOUT WHAT I AM OR WHAT

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
WE DO MEANS.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
I SPEND MY TIME DOING IT.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
AND I THINK THAT'S... I'M NOT

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
TRYING TO BE MODEST OF SELF-

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
DEPRECATING OR IN ANY WAY TRYING

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
TO DO THAT.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU, I

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
FOCUS ON THE TASK AND TRY AND DO

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
IT AS BEST WE CAN.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
IT, BECAUSE IT'S MY WAY OF

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
THESE AMBIVALENT FEELINGS I

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
HAVE.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Moyers: I WATCHED THE

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
INTERVIEW YOU DID THE OTHER

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
NIGHT WITH THE FORMER IRAQI

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
OFFICIAL ALI ALLAWEH.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
AND I WAS STRUCK THAT YOU WERE

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
DOING THIS SOON AFTER THE

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
MASSACRE AT VIRGINIA TECH.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
IT WASN'T YOUR USUALLY "DAILY

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:36.000
SHOW" BANTER.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.000
ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE-- I

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:45.000
APPROPRIATE TO BROACH IT-- BUT

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.000
WE IN THIS COUNTRY WE JUST HAD A

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
VERY TRAGIC SITUATION OCCUR AT

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES, AND IT

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000
REALLY HAS TAKEN THE COUNTRY

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
ABACK, AND THERE'S A REAL

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
GRIEVING PROCESS THAT WE'RE

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
GOING THROUGH, AND GOING THROUGH

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.000
IT MOURNING BY LEARNING ABOUT

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
THE VICTIMS AND LEARNING ABOUT

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
IT AND SHOWING OUR SUPPORT, YOU

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
KNOW, I HESITATE TO SAY...

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
HOW DOES YOUR COUNTRY HANDLE

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
WHAT IS THAT TYPE OF CARNAGE ON

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
A DAILY BASIS?

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
IS THERE A WAY TO GRIEVE?

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
IS THERE A NUMBNESS THAT SETS

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
IN?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
HOW IS THAT?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
WELL, I THINK THE SCALE OF

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
VIOLENCE IN IRAQ IS REALLY

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
INCONCEIVABLE IN YOUR TERMS.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
RIGHT.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
WE HAVE, ON A DAILY BASIS,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
WHAT YOU HAD THE OTHER DAY IN

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
VIRGINIA TECH.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
I MEAN, MASSACRES OF THAT SCALE

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
PRACTICALLY ON A DAILY BASIS AND

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
IT'S VERY HARD TO GRIEVE.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
MOST OF THE... MOST OF THE WAY

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
THAT PEOPLE DO TREAT THIS IS

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
JUST TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
WE NOW HAVE A VERY LARGE

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
EXTERNAL REFUGEE PROBLEM.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000
NEARLY TWO MILLION IRAQIS HAVE

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
LEFT THE COUNTRY AND INTERNAL

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
REFUGEE PROBLEM ALSO, TOO MANY

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
PEOPLE DISPLACED.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
BUT THE SCALE OF VIOLENCE AND

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
ITS CONTINUITY IS SUCH THAT IT

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
REALLY NUMBS YOU.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
AND IN MY CASE, FOR EXAMPLE, I

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
HAD SIX PEOPLE WHOM I HAD

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
APPOINTED AT VARIOUS POSITIONS

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
IN THE GOVERNMENT KILLED,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
INCLUDING MY OFFICE MANAGER.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.000
WE HAD THIS SUICIDE BOMBER WALK

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
INTO MY CONTINGENT OF GOD.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
SO IT'S QUITE A... QUITE A

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
LEGACIES OF THIS TERRIBLE

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
CRISIS.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
YES, AND I... TRULY I CANNOT

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
FATHOM IT AND I JUST RECALL, YOU

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
KNOW, THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
INFORMATION, AND I WAS BECOMING

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
WRAPPED UP IN OUR GRIEF, AND

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
THEN I SAW THE HEADLINE TODAY OF

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000
LITERALLY 150,000 PEOPLE KILLED,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
--150 PEOPLE KILLED, AND IT JUST

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
SENDS AN AWFUL DAGGER TO YOUR

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
HEART, LIKE I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
THEY DEAL WITH IT.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Moyers: I MEAN, I SAID,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
"SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:38.000
STEWART THERE."

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
WHAT WAS IT?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
YOU KNOW, THE PROCESS THAT WE

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
PUT THE SHOW TOGETHER IS ALWAYS

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.000
GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY THE, YOU

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000
KNOW, THE CLIMATE THAT WE LIVE

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
IN.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.000
AND THERE WAS A PALL CAST OVER

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
THE COUNTRY.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
FIGHTING YOUR OWN SADNESS DURING

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
THE DAY HAVING NOTHING TO DO

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000
WITH THAT.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
WE FELT... WE FEEL NO OBLIGATION

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
TO FOLLOW THE NEWS CYCLE.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
IN OTHER WORDS, I FELT NO

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
OBLIGATION TO COVER THIS STORY

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.000
IN ANY WAY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT...

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
LIKE I SAID, WE'RE NOT

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.000
JOURNALIST.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
AND AT THAT POINT, THERE'S

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
NOTHING SORT OF FUNNY OR ABSURD

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
OR... TO SAY ABOUT IT.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
BUT THERE IS A SADNESS THAT YOU

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
CAN'T ESCAPE JUST WITHIN

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
YOURSELF.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
AND I'M ALSO INTERVIEWING A GUY

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
WHO'S JUST WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
HIS EXPERIENCE LIVING IN IRAQ

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
FACED WITH THE TYPE OF VIOLENCE

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON A,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
YOU KNOW, AS HE SAID, AN

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
UNIMAGINABLE SCALE.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
AND I THINK THAT THE COMBINATION

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
OF THAT IS VERY HARD TO SHAKE.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
AND I KNOW THAT MY JOB IS TO

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
SHAKE IT AND TO PERFORM.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
THAT'S WHY IT'S PERFORMING AND

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
NOT... YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T BE

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
A VERY INTERESTING SHOW IF I

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
JUST CAME OUT ONE DAY AND SAID,

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
"I'M GOING TO SIT HERE IN A BALL

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.000
AND ROCK BACK AND FORTH AND WILL

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
YOU JOIN ME FOR A HALF HOUR OF

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
SADNESS?"

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.000
YOU KNOW, THEY... I HAVE TO... I

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
HAVE TO...

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Moyers: PEOPLE MORE.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
PEOPLE COME TO EXPECT BY THAT

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
WASN'T PERFORMANCE, WHEN YOU

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
WERE WRESTLING WITH THE SADNESS

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
YOU WERE FEELING WITH HIM...

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
WITH HIM.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.000
WELL, IT... I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
RELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION I

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
WAS HAVING WITH HIM, WHICH WAS

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
THE REASON THAT IT SORT OF

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
OCCURRED TO ME WAS, YOU KNOW, I

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
WAS... I WAS OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWING

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
THE INTERNET HEADLINES ALL DAY.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
AND THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, THIS

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SPACE AND

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
COVERAGE TO VIRGINIA TECH, AS

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000
AND I HAPPENED TO CATCH SORT OF

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
A HEADLINE LOWER DOWN, WHICH WAS

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
200 PEOPLE KILLED IN FOUR BOMB

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
ATTACKS IN IRAQ.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
AND I THINK... MY FOCUS ON WHAT

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
WAS HAPPENING HERE VERSUS SORT

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
OF THIS PERIPHERAL VISION THING

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
THAT CAUGHT MY EYE ABOUT, "OH,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
RIGHT, THERE ARE LIVES..." I

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
THINK IT WAS A MOMENT OF... I

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
FELT GUILTY.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Moyers: GUILTY?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
FOR NOT HAVING THE EMPATHY

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
FOR THEIR SUFFERING ON A DAILY

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
BASIS THAT I FEEL SOMETHING THAT

00:30:47.000 --> 00:31:00.000
I SHOULD.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
--SOMETIMES THAT I SHOULD.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Moyers: DO YOU EVER THINK

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
THAT PERHAPS WHAT I DO IN

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
REPORTING DOCUMENTARIES ABOUT

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
REALITY AND WHAT YOU DO IN

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
POKING SOME FUN AND PUTTING SOME

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
HUMOR AROUND THE HORRORS OF THE

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
WORLD, FEED INTO THE SENSE OF

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
HELPLESSNESS THAT PEOPLE...?

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
NO.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
I MEAN, AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.000
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
FEEL.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
AND, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE BEAUTY

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
OF TV, IS THEY CAN SEE US, BUT

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
WE CAN'T SEE THEM.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I THINK THAT IF WE DO ANYTHING

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
IN A POSITIVE SENSE FOR THE

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
WORLD IS PROVIDE ONE LITTLE BIT

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
OF CONTEXT THAT'S VERY

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED, AND

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE CAN ADD TO

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
THEIR ENTIRE PUZZLE THAT GIVES

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.000
THEM A LARGER PICTURE OF WHAT IT

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
IS THAT THEY SEE.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
BUT I DON'T THINK IF ANYTHING, I

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
DON'T THINK IT'S A FEELING OF

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
HOPELESSNESS THAT PEOPLE FEEL.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I THINK IF THEY FEEL... IF

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
THEY'RE FEELING WHAT WE'RE

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
FEELING, IT'S THAT THIS IS HOW

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
WE FIGHT BACK.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I CAN ONLY FIGHT BACK IN A WAY

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
THAT I FEEL LIKE I'M TALENTED.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
AND I FEEL LIKE THE ONLY THING

00:31:59.000 --> 00:31:59.000
THAT I CAN DO-- AND I'VE BEEN

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000
FIRED FROM ENOUGH JOBS THAT I'M

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
PRETTY CONFIDENT IN SAYING

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
THIS-- THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
DO EVEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER THAN

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
MOST PEOPLE IS CREATE THAT SORT

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
OF... THAT CONTEXT WITH HUMOR.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
AND THAT'S MY WAY OF NOT BEING

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
HELPLESS AND NOT BEING HOPELESS.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Moyers: IS WASHINGTON A

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
BETTER SOURCE FOR JOKES NOW THAT

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN THE

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
MAJORITY?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
IT'S MORE FUN FOR US BECAUSE

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
WE'RE TIRED OF THE SAME

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
DECONSTRUCTED GAME.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Moyers: YEAH, I SAW THAT

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
PIECE YOU DID THE OTHER DAY ON

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
THE DEMOCRATS DEBATING HOW TO

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
LOSE THE WAR.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
RIGHT, EXACTLY.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
THIS HAS BEEN SIX YEARS, YOU

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.000
KNOW.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
WE'RE WORN DOWN.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A NEW GAME

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
TO PLAY AND SOMETHING NEW.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
I MEAN, THE ONLY JOY I'VE HAD IN

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
THAT TIME IS HAVING STEPHEN'S

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
SHOW COME ON THE AIR AND SORT OF

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
GIVE US A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
AND, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S MADE

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
OF KIND OF THE SAME GENETIC

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
MATERIAL AS OUR SHOW, IT FEELS

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
LIKE IT'S ALSO FRESHENED UP OUR

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
PERSPECTIVE AND KIND OF

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
COMPLETED OUR THOUGHT, BUT...

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Moyers: WELL, YOU COULD TAKE

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
ME ON AS A CORRESPONDENT.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
WE WOULD LOVE TO TAKE YOU ON

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
AS A CORRESPONDENT.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Moyers: WELL, WHO WOULD

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.000
YOU...

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
YOU KNOW, THE PAY IS PRETTY

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.000
BAD.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Moyers: YEAH, WELL, THIS IS

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
PBS.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
WELL, WHAT WOULD MY ASSIGNMENT

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000
BE?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.000
WHERE WOULD YOU WANT ME TO BE,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
YOUR SENIOR ELDERLY

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
CORRESPONDENT?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
OR YOUR SENIOR...

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.000
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO JUST SIT

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
IN MY OFFICE, AND WHEN I WALK

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
IN, JUST LOWER YOUR HEAD AND GO,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
"THAT WAS UGLY."

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Moyers: I DO THAT WHEN I'M

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
WATCHING.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
APPRECIATE IT.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Moyers: FOR SIX YEARS THE

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
SUFFERED FROM WHAT JON STEWART

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
MIGHT CALL SUBPOENA ENVY.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
AS THE MINORITY THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
THE POWER TO ORDER ANYONE TO

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
TESTIFY BEFORE THEIR HEARINGS.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
BUT THAT'S CHANGED.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
DEMOCRATS ARE NOW IN THE

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
MAJORITY, AND THEY'RE ISSUING

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
SUBPOENAS AS FAST AND FURIOUS AS

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
ZEUS HURLED THUNDERBOLTS FROM

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
MOUNT OLYMPUS.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
THAT'S A GOOD THING IF YOU THINK

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000
THE PARTIES SHOULD INVESTIGATE

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
AND HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
THIS WEEK CONGRESSIONAL

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
COMMITTEES VOTED TO SUBPOENA

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
SECRETARY OF STATE CONDOLEEZZA

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
RICE, KARL ROVE'S DEPUTY AT THE

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
WHITE HOUSE, THE REPUBLICAN

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
NATIONAL COMMITTEE, AND A FORMER

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
TOP ASSISTANT TO THE ATTORNEY

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.000
GENERAL, ALBERTO GONZALEZ.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
THE FLOODGATES ARE OPENING INTO

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
WHETHER THE FIRING OF CERTAIN

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
FEDERAL ATTORNEYS, PROSECUTORS,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
WAS MEANT TO INFLUENCE

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
INVESTIGATIONS INTO CORRUPTION.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
WE LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT THAT

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
STORY FROM AN ONLINE JOURNALIST

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
WHOSE REPORTERS INCLUDE PEOPLE

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
LIKE YOU.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
WE MAY BE LOOKING AT THE NEW

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
FACE OF JOURNALISM.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
STAND UP AND RAISE YOUR RIGHT

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000
HAND.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME OF MY

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
STATEMENTS GENERATED CONFUSION.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
AFTER REVIEWING ALL OF THE

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
FACTS, INVOLVED IN THE

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
DISMISSALS OF THE U.S.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
ATTORNEYS...

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
YOUR CHARACTERIZATION OF YOUR

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
PARTICIPATION IS JUST

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
SIGNIFICANTLY, IF NOT TOTALLY,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
AT VARIANCE WITH THE FACTS."

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT YOU

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.000
MADE THE DECISION?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
I RECALL MAKING THE DECISION.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
WHEN?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
SIR, I DON'T RECALL WHEN THE

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
DECISION WAS MADE.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Moyers: ONE WEEK AFTER THE

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
TESTIMONY OF THE ATTORNEY

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
GENERAL, CONGRESS IS STILL

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
LOOKING FOR CREDIBLE ANSWERS TO

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
THE  MYSTERY: WHY WERE EIGHT

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
FEDERAL PROSECUTORS FIRED BY THE

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
ALL POLITICAL APPOINTEES CAN

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
BE REMOVED BY THE PRESIDENT OF

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
THE UNITED STATES.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Moyers: AT FIRST, GONZALES

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
EXPLAINED "THEY SIMPLY LOST MY

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
CONFIDENCE."

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
HE CALLED THE WHOLE AFFAIR "AN

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
OVERBLOWN PERSONNEL MATTER."

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
BUT THE FIRED PROSECUTORS DIDN'T

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
LIKE THAT GONZALES HAD

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
DENIGRATED THEIR JOB

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
PERFORMANCE, AND THEY TOLD

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000
CONGRESS WHAT THEY THOUGHT.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
MS. LAM, DO YOU THINK THAT

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.000
YOU WERE INAPPROPRIATELY

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
REMOVED?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.000
WELL, SENATOR, I THINK THAT

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
IT WAS UNUSUAL, GIVEN THE

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
TRADITION AND THE HISTORY OF THE

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.000
UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS WITHIN

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Moyers: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
HAS INSISTED THERE WAS NOTHING

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
IMPROPER ABOUT THE FIRINGS, BUT

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
HIS STORIES ABOUT WHAT HE KNEW

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
AND HOW MUCH HE WAS INVOLVED

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
KEPT CHANGING.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:50.000
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN SEEING

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
ANY MEMOS, WAS NOT INVOLVED IN

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:52.000
ANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT WAS

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
GOING ON.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT I KNEW AS

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
THAT EXPLANATION JUST DOESN'T

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
HOLD WATER IF YOU BECOME REALLY

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Moyers: WHEN GONZALES TRIED

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
TO DOWNPLAY THE AFFAIR, JOSH

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
MARSHALL WASN'T BUYING.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
HE'S THE EDITOR AND PUBLISHER OF

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
POPULAR BLOGS THAT FEATURE

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING AND

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
ANALYSIS, TALKING POINTS MEMO

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:20.000
AND T.P.M. MUCKRAKER.COM.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000
HE'S BEEN COVERING THIS STORY

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
ALMOST FROM THE START.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.000
MARSHALL SAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
INTEGRITY OF JUSTICE.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.000
THE PRESIDENT APPOINTS THE

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
U.S. ATTORNEYS.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:29.000
THEY'RE POLITICAL IN A CERTAIN

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
RESPECT.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
THE POWER THAT THEY HOLD IS SO

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
GREAT, IT'S LIFE AND LIMB, YOU

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
KNOW: PUT YOU IN JAIL, MAKE YOU

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
RUN UP HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
DOLLARS OF LEGAL COSTS.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
EVEN THOUGH WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
POLITICAL APPOINTEES TAKE THESE

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
JOBS, WE DON'T ASSUME THAT THE

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
PARTY IN POWER IS GOING TO USE

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
THAT KIND OF POWER TO ADVANCE

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
ITS POLITICAL INTERESTS.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:57.000
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Moyers: MARSHALL AND HIS

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:58.000
REPORTERS BELONG TO A NEW BREED

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.000
OF JOURNALISTS.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
THEY USE THE SPEED AND BREADTH

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
OF THE INTERNET TO CONSTANTLY

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
UPDATE THE STORY, AS THEY DID

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
LAST WEEK DURING THE TESTIMONY

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
BY GONZALES.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Moyers: HOW DID YOU GET ON

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
THIS STORY BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
WHAT DREW YOU TO IT?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
I THINK THE KEY IS THAT WE

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
WERE ON THE DUKE CUNNINGHAM

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
STORY GOING BACK A YEAR AND A

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
HALF AGO.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Moyers: HE WAS THE MEMBER OF

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
CONGRESS...

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
MEMBER OF CONGRESS WHO HAD

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
THIS FLAGRANT BRIBERY AND NOW IS

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
SERVING ABOUT A DECADE IN

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
PRISON.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
AND BECAUSE WE WERE ON... WE

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
FOLLOWED THAT SO CLOSELY, WHEN

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
WE SAW THAT THE PROSECUTOR WHO

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000
HAD PUT HIM IN PRISON, CAROL

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.000
LAM, WHO'S THE FORMER U.S.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO, WHEN WE

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
SAW THAT SHE WAS FIRED, THAT SET

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
OFF ALL SORTS OF ALARM BELLS FOR

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
US.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Moyers: WHAT SHOCKED YOU

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
ABOUT IT?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
WELL, THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000
INVOLVED IN SO MANY ONGOING

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
CORRUPTION INVESTIGATIONS THAT

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
IN VARIOUS WAYS TOUCHED ON THE

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
ADMINISTRATION, THE BUSH

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
ADMINISTRATION, THAT SOMEONE

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
LIKE THAT WOULD GET FIRED DURING

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
THOSE INVESTIGATIONS, THAT

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
SCREAMED SOME SORT OF TAMPERING.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Moyers: SO, BASED UPON THE

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
JOURNALISM YOU'VE DONE, WHY DO

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
YOU THINK CAROL LAM WAS FIRED?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:03.000
SHE WAS NO LIBERAL DEMOCRAT.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.000
CERTAINLY NOT.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
CERTAINLY NOT.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.000
SHE WAS APPOINTED BY GEORGE

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
BUSH.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I THINK SHE WAS FIRED BECAUSE

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
SHE WAS TOO INDEPENDENT AND SHE

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
WAS CREATING... SHE WAS BRINGING

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
TOO MUCH HEAT ON REPUBLICAN

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND MEMBERS

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
SHE WAS DOING HER JOB TOO WELL.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
SHE WAS PUTTING TOO MANY CORRUPT

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN PRISON.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
THIS WAS A CRIME OF

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
UNPRECEDENTED MAGNITUDE AND

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
EXTRAORDINARY AUDACITY.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Moyers: LAM HAD SUCCESSFULLY

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
PROSECUTED RANDY "DUKE"

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
CUNNINGHAM, A TOP REPUBLICAN

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
HE PLED GUILTY TO ACCEPTING MORE

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
THAN $2 MILLION IN BRIBES FROM

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
TWO DIFFERENT DEFENSE

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
CONTRACTORS.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
IT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
CONGRESSMAN CUNNINGHAM LET GREED

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
TAKE PRIORITY OVER HIS DUTY TO

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
SERVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF HIS

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
CONSTITUENTS AND HIS COUNTRY.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Moyers: CUNNINGHAM WAS

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
SENTENCED TO AN EIGHT-YEAR TERM

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
IN PRISON.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
THE CHAIN OF CONNECTIONS LED TO

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
YET ANOTHER POWER IN CONGRESS,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
THE THEN-CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, JERRY

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
LEWIS, WHO IS STILL UNDER

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
INVESTIGATION.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
THEN THE GROUND IN WASHINGTON

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
REALLY SHOOK.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
TURNS OUT LAM WAS ALSO AFTER THE

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, THE

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
C.I.A.'S NUMBER-THREE MAN: KYLE

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
"DUSTY" FOGGO, SUSPECTED OF

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST INVOLVING

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
F.B.I. AGENTS WERE EVEN SENT TO

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.000
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS TO SEARCH

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
FOGGO'S OFFICE.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
THE DAY AFTER LAM TOLD HER

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
BOSSES AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
ABOUT THE SEARCH WARRANTS, THE

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CHIEF OF

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
STAFF, KYLE SAMPSON, SENT THIS

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
CONFIDENTIAL EMAIL TO THE WHITE

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
HOUSE COMPLAINING ABOUT LAM.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
HE WANTED TO DISCUSS THE

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
"PROBLEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.000
CAROL LAM THAT LEADS ME TO

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000
CONCLUDE WE SHOULD HAVE SOMEBODY

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
READY" TO REPLACE HER.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.000
AT THIS POINT CUNNINGHAM IS

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
ALREADY IN PRISON, BUT SHE IS

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
ONTO PEOPLE THAT CUNNINGHAM WAS

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:46.000
WORKING WITH.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
AND THIS HAD BROUGHT HER TO THE

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
C.I.A., PARTICULARLY A GUY NAMED

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
DUSTY FOGGO.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
JUST A DAY OR TWO BEFORE THIS

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
EMAIL WAS WRITTEN, SHE HAD

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000
NOTIFIED THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
JUSTICE THAT SHE PLANNED TO

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANTS ON

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
NOT LONG AFTER THIS HAPPENED,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.000
THE NUMBER THREE RESIGNED.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
THE DIRECTOR OF THE C.I.A.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
RESIGNED.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
IT'S STILL A LITTLE MURKY HOW

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
ALL THESE THINGS ARE RELATED.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Moyers: EARLIER THIS YEAR,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
"DUSTY" FOGGO WAS INDICTED FOR

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
CORRUPTION ALONG WITH A WELL-

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
CONNECTED DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
THE INDICTMENTS CAME TWO MONTHS

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
AFTER CAROL LAM HAD BEEN FIRED.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
WHEN LAM WAS FIRED, AND YOUR

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:21.000
ANTENNA WENT OFF, WHERE DID THE

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
TRAIL LEAD YOU?

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
THIS WAS A CASE WHERE OUR

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
REPORTERS WERE DEEPLY VERSED IN

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
THESE PUBLIC CORRUPTION

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
INVESTIGATIONS.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
WE HAD BEEN REPORTING ON THESE

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:39.000
CASES FOR OVER A YEAR.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
SO THAT GAVE US A CONTEXT TO

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
SO WE PUT OUT THE WORD THAT WE

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
THOUGHT THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
FIRINGS.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
AND WE STARTED GETTING TIPS FROM

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
READERS.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
AND ONE OF THE UNIQUE STRENGTHS

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
OF OUR JOURNALISM MODEL IS THAT

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
WE USE OUR READERS A LOT TO DO

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
BASICALLY SORT OF THE FRONTLINE

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
RESEARCH FOR US.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE JUST TAKE

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
THINGS PEOPLE SAY AND PRINT THEM

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
WILLY-NILLY.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
BUT THERE'S A WEALTH OF

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
INFORMATION OUT THERE IN SMALL

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
METROPOLITAN PAPERS AROUND THE

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
COUNTRY.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
SO THERE WERE REPORTS ABOUT THE

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
ARKANSAS U.S. ATTORNEY WHO HAD

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.000
BEEN FIRED THAT WAS JUST IN A

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
LOCAL ARKANSAS MEDIA.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER SIMILAR

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000
CASE WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEY IN

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.000
MICHIGAN.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Moyers: HOW MANY REPORTERS DO

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
YOU HAVE?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
DURING MOST OF THIS, WE HAD

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
TWO REPORTERS WORKING ON THE

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
STORY.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Moyers: WITH YOU AS EDITOR?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
CORRECT.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Moyers: SO WHEN DID YOU

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
REALIZE THAT THIS WAS MORE THAN

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
A PERSONNEL STORY AT THE

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
I THINK THE KEY MOMENT FOR ME

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
WAS BACK... IT MUST BE A COUPLE

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
MONTHS AGO NOW, WHEN WE FOUND

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
OUT THAT DAVID IGLESIAS, THE

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
FIRED U.S. ATTORNEY IN NEW

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
MEXICO, HAD SENT AN EMAIL TO A

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
COLLEAGUE, WHEN HE... AND HE

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
CALLED HIS FIRING A POLITICAL

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000
FRAGGING, THE WORD THAT YOU USE

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
WHEN SOLDIERS KILL EACH OTHER...

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
SOLDIERS ON ONE SIDE KILL EACH

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
OTHER.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Moyers: MARSHALL FIRST HEARD

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
ABOUT THIS FROM ANOTHER BLOGGER

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
IN NEW MEXICO.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
AS HE FOLLOWED UP, IT BECAME

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
APPARENT THAT IGLESIAS, A

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
REPUBLICAN, HAD BEEN FRAGGED BY

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
HIS OWN PARTY.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
TWO SENIOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
FROM NEW MEXICO, SENATOR PETE

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
DOMENICI AND REPRESENTATIVE

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
HEATHER WILSON, HAD TELEPHONED

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
IGLESIAS ASKING HIM FOR

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
INFORMATION ABOUT SEALED

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
INDICTMENTS IN A POLITICALLY

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
CHARGED INVESTIGATION CONCERNING

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:24.000
STATE DEMOCRATS.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
REPRESENTATIVE WILSON, WHO IS

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
SENATOR DOMENICI'S PROTÉGÉ, WAS

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
IN A VERY TIGHT RACE FOR

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
REELECTION THAT SHE EVENTUALLY

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.000
WON.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
BUT SHE... IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
VERY HELPFUL FOR HER IF A

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
DEMOCRAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
INDICTED RIGHT BEFORE THE

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
ELECTION.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED HIM.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000
THAT'S WHY THE SENATOR AND

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
REPRESENTATIVE CALLED HIM,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
LEANED ON HIM TO BRING THE

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
INDICTMENT.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
HE WOULDN'T.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
AND I THINK THAT WAS IT.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY HE GOT

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
FIRED.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Moyers: IGLESIAS TOLD

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
CONGRESS HE CONSIDERED THE CALL

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000
FROM DOMENICI HIGHLY IMPROPER.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
AND HE WANTED TO ASK ME ABOUT

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
THE CORRUPTION MATTERS OR THE

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.000
CORRUPTION CASES THAT HAD BEEN

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
WIDELY REPORTED IN THE LOCAL

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
MEDIA.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
I SAID, "ALL RIGHT."

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
AND HE SAID, "ARE THESE GOING TO

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
BE FILED BEFORE NOVEMBER?"

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
AND I SAID I DIDN'T THINK SO.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
AND TO WHICH HE REPLIED, "I'M

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT."

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.000
AND THEN THE LINE WENT DEAD.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000
SO IN OTHER WORDS, HE HUNG UP ON

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
YOU?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
THAT'S HOW I TOOK THAT.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
YES, SIR.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE OR

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
NO, SIR.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
NOW, DID YOU TAKE THAT AS A

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.000
SIGN OF HIS UNHAPPINESS WITH

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
YOUR DECISION?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I FELT SICK AFTERWARD.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
SO I FELT HE WAS UPSET THAT...

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
AT HEARING THE ANSWER THAT HE

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
RECEIVED.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
RIGHT.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
AND SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
YOU FELT PRESSURED TO HURRY

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
SUBSEQUENT CASES AND

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
PROSECUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
CALL?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
YES, SIR.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I DID.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I FELT LEANED ON.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I FELT PRESSURED TO GET THESE

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
MATTERS MOVING.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
AND, AS YOU SAY, IT WAS

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
UNUSUAL FOR YOU TO RECEIVE A

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
CALL FROM A SENATOR AT HOME

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
WHILE YOU WERE THE U.S.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
ATTORNEY.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
UNPRECEDENTED.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
IT HAD NEVER HAPPENED.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Moyers: SENATOR DOMENICI

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
WASN'T JUST CALLING THE

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
PROSECUTOR.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
HE REACHED OUT TO THE WHITE

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
HOUSE, WHERE KARL ROVE AND THE

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
PRESIDENT HAD ALREADY PASSED

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000
ONTO GONZALES COMPLAINTS THAT

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:05.000
IGLESIAS WAS NOT MOVING ON

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
ALLEGATIONS THAT DEMOCRATS WERE

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
VOTING IMPROPERLY IN LOCAL

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
ELECTIONS.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
THE FACT THAT HE WOULDN'T

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
BRING WHAT I THINK WOULD HAVE

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
CLEARLY BEEN BOGUS INDICTMENTS

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
PUT HIM ON THE OUTS WITH

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIALS IN

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
HIS STATE.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
AND THAT LED TO A STRING OF

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
COMPLAINTS FROM REPUBLICANS IN

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000
NEW MEXICO TO KARL ROVE, TO THE

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
PRESIDENT.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.000
SO HE WAS ALREADY ON THIN ICE.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Moyers: THE SCANDAL HAS GROWN

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
BEYOND THE ISSUE OF PROSECUTORS

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
BEING FIRED.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
BUT THERE'S A FLIP SIDE TO IT,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
AND THAT IS WHO IS BEING HIRED?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:40.000
WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.000
OVER THE COURSE OF LAST YEAR,

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
THEY WERE INSTALLING HIGHLY

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
POLITICAL U.S. ATTORNEYS IN KEY

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
SWING STATES.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
AND IN AT LEAST SOME OF THOSE

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
CASES, THEY CLEARLY BROUGHT

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
HIGHLY POLITICIZED PROSECUTIONS.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
SO THE EIGHT U.S. ATTORNEYS IS

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
SORT OF LIKE THE BIG RED FLAG.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
AND IT'S THE HEADLINE.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
BUT IF YOU LOOK BENEATH THERE,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
THERE'S A DEEPER POLITICIZATION

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
THAT I THINK WAS HAPPENING

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
THROUGHOUT THE US ATTORNEY

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
SYSTEM.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
CONSIDER THIS DOCUMENT NOW IN

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
THE HANDS OF CONGRESS.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
IT'S A LIST KEPT BY THE JUSTICE

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
DEPARTMENT OF ALL THE U.S.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.000
ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE SERVED UNDER

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000
PRESIDENT BUSH.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
ALONG WITH NAMES, IT INCLUDES

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
NOTES ABOUT PROSECUTION,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
JUDICIAL AND POLITICAL

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
EXPERIENCE.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
THEN, THERE'S THIS ADDITIONAL,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
AND SURPRISING, COLUMN

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
INDICATING WHETHER OR NOT THEY

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
ARE MEMBERS OF THE FEDERALIST

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
SOCIETY.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY IS

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
THIS CONSERVATIVE LEGAL

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:36.000
ORGANIZATION.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
AND I THINK, FOR THE BUSH

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
ADMINISTRATION, BEING A MEMBER

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
OF THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY MEANT

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
YOU WERE A RELIABLE,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
IDEOLOGICAL, PARTISAN

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
REPUBLICAN.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000
IT WASN'T ENOUGH JUST TO BE

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
REGISTERED AS A REPUBLICAN, OR

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
TO BE... HAVE A GENERALLY

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
CONSERVATIVE JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
OR PROSECUTORIAL PHILOSOPHY.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000
IT MEANT THAT, BASICALLY MEANT

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
THAT YOU WERE A REAL MOVEMENT

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
CONSERVATIVE, A PARTY REGULAR.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
THAT'S WHAT BEING A FEDERALIST

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
SOCIETY MEMBER MEANS.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Moyers: A NETWORK OF KINDRED

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
SPIRITS.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
YEAH.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
IT'S BEING ONE OF THE... IT'S

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
BEING A MEMBER OF THAT TEAM IN

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
THEIR EYES.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
THERE'S THAT LINE IN KYLE

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
SAMPSON'S EMAIL WHERE HE TALKS

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
ABOUT MOST OF THE U.S. ATTORNEYS

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
BEING LOYAL BUSHIES.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
TO: BEING POLITICAL, THAT KIND

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
OF POLITICAL LOYALTY.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Moyers: MARSHALL'S CASE IN

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000
POINT: TIMOTHY GRIFFIN.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES PICKED

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
HIM LAST YEAR TO REPLACE THE

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
FIRED PROSECUTOR IN LITTLE ROCK,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
ARKANSAS.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
GRIFFIN'S REPUTATION WAS AS A

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
HIGHLY PARTISAN OPERATIVE, FIRST

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000
DOING OPPOSITION RESEARCH FOR

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
COMMITTEE, AND THEN AS KARL

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
ROVE'S DEPUTY IN THE WHITE

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
HOUSE.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
ACCORDING TO AN INTERNAL JUSTICE

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
DEPARTMENT E-MAIL, GETTING

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
GRIFFIN APPOINTED AS U.S.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
ATTORNEY WAS IMPORTANT TO KARL.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
THIS, I THINK, IS AN EXAMPLE

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
OF, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, "WELL,

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
THEY'RE POLITICAL APPOINTEES."

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE, THOUGH,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
BETWEEN BEING A POLITICAL

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
APPOINTEE AND PUTTING A

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
POLITICAL OPERATIVE IN CHARGE OF

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
A U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I MEAN AN EXAMPLE IS: I THINK

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
JAMES CARVILLE IS AN ATTORNEY.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
BUT, NO, IT WOULDN'T PASS A

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
LAUGH TEST TO MAKE JAMES

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
CARVILLE A U.S. ATTORNEY IN

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
WASHINGTON D.C.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
HE WOULDN'T HAVE CREDIBILITY.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
HE'S TOO POLITICAL.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.000
Moyers: AND IS TIM GRIFFIN IN

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
THAT CATEGORY OF A POLITICAL

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
OPERATIVE?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Moyers: SUCH A PARTISAN

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
BACKGROUND FOR A SENSITIVE

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
PROSECUTOR'S POST MADE IT

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
UNLIKELY THAT GRIFFIN'S

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
NOMINATION WOULD PASS SENATE

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:29.000
CONFIRMATION.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.000
BUT THE WHITE HOUSE HAD A WAY

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
AROUND THAT OBSTACLE.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
EARLIER IN THE YEAR, THE JUSTICE

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
DEPARTMENT HAD SEEN TO IT THAT

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
AN OBSCURE PROVISION WAS SNEAKED

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
INTO THE PATRIOT ACT.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
BASICALLY, THEY SLIPPED A

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
PROVISION IN THAT ALLOWS THE

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MAKE INTERIM

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
APPOINTS THAT LAST THROUGHOUT

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
THAT PRESIDENT'S TERM.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:44.000
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:54.000
IT BASICALLY...

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Moyers: WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.000
WELL, WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
CHECKS AND BALANCES.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
THE SENATE IS SUPPOSED TO

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
SIGN... IT'S SUPPOSED TO APPROVE

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
NOMINEES FOR U.S. ATTORNEY

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
NOMINEES IN THE SAME WAY THAT

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T JUST

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
APPOINT THE SECRETARY OF STATE;

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
HE APPOINTS THE SECRETARY OF

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
STATE AND THEN THE CONGRESS

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
VOTES.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
AND IF THE CONGRESS APPROVES

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
THAT PERSON, THAT PERSON BECOMES

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
SECRETARY OF STATE.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
THEY WERE GETTING RID OF THE

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
ADVICE AND CONSENT DIMENSION TO

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
THE U.S. JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Moyers: SO WHAT DO YOU THINK

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
WAS GOING THROUGH THEIR MIND

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
THAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO THINK

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
"WE CAN GET AWAY WITH IT.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
NOBODY'S GOING TO NOTICE IT.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
EIGHT PROSECUTORS HAVE BEEN

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
FIRED, AND MAKE A NATIONAL STORY

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
OUT OF IT."

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I THINK IT'S REALLY TWO

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.000
ISSUES.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
ONE IS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
HAS HAD UNIFIED POLITICAL

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
CONTROL IN WASHINGTON FOR ALMOST

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
ALL OF THE SIX YEARS THEY'VE

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
BEEN IN OFFICE.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
AND THAT MEANS THEY WEREN'T USED

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
TO CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
THEY WEREN'T USED TO HAVING

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN WHO SEND OUT

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
SUBPOENAS AND FORCE PEOPLE UP TO

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
CAPITOL HILL TO ANSWER

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
QUESTIONS.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
THE OTHER PART OF THAT STORY IS

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
IT'S NOT JUST THE CONGRESS THAT

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
FELL DOWN ON THE JOB IN

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
OVERSIGHT.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
IT WAS THE PRESS.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
YOU SEE THIS IN THE BUILDUP TO

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
THE WAR IN THE IRAQ: HOW LITTLE

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
CRITICAL SCRUTINY THAT THE

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
EVIDENCE, THE SUPPOSED EVIDENCE

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
FOR WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:04.000
GOT.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:04.000
SO I THINK ON THE PRESS SIDE AND

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
ON THE CONGRESSIONAL SIDE, THE

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
WHITE HOUSE HAD GOTTEN USED TO

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
GETTING AWAY WITH A LOT OF

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000
STUFF.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Moyers: SPEAKING OF

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
CREDIBILITY, YOU ARE A LIBERAL.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
YOU DON'T HIDE THE FACT THAT

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
YOU'RE A LIBERAL.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T LIBERAL OUT

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000
THERE, HOW... CAN THEY TRUST

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
YOUR REPORTING?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
I THINK THEY CAN.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.000
I THINK THAT WE HAVE... I THINK

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
THAT OUR ORGANIZATION HAS A

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
TRACK RECORD.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
WE... LAST YEAR THERE WERE ALL

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
SORTS OF INVESTIGATIONS OF

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
CORRUPT REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000
THERE WERE ALSO INVESTIGATIONS

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
OF ALLEGEDLY CORRUPT DEMOCRATS.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
WE REPORTED ON WE WERE JUST AS

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
AGGRESSIVE REPORTING THOSE

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
STORIES AS WE WERE ONES WHO WERE

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
REPUBLICANS.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
HOW I SEE OUR... HOW I SEE OUR

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
MISSION IS WE ALWAYS WANT TO BE

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
TRANSPARENT WITH READERS ABOUT

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
WHAT WE THINK, ABOUT OUR

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
OPINIONS.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
BUT, FUNDAMENTALLY, WE ARE OUT

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
THERE TO COLLECT AND REPORT

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
FACTS.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
AND THAT'S ALWAYS OUR GUIDING

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
MISSION.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Moyers: IF GONZALES LEAVES,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
AS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING HE

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
MUST, INCLUDING REPUBLICANS...

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
RIGHT.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Moyers: ...WILL THE STORY BE

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
OVER?

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I DON'T THINK IT WILL BECAUSE

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000
THIS STORY IS ABOUT THE WHITE

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
HOUSE, THE POLITICAL BRAIN

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
CENTER OF THIS ADMINISTRATION

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:10.000
USING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:20.000
TO PURSUE ITS POLITICAL ENDS.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
THE REASON ALBERTO... WHAT

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
ALBERTO GONZALES HAD DONE WRONG

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
IS HE HAD ALLOWED THAT TO

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
HAPPEN.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
HE HAD ALLOWED THE PRESIDENT...

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
HE HAD ALLOWED KARL ROVE TO

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000
MISUSE, TO REALLY CORRUPT THE

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:37.000
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000
SO HE WAS A COG IN THE MACHINE.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
BUT THE REAL STORY HERE IS

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
REALLY RIGHT TO THE TOP.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
IT'S IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
IT'S THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
USING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
TO ADVANCE THE INTERESTS OF THE

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:56.000
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Moyers: TALKING TO JON

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
STEWART AND JOSH MARSHALL ABOUT

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
JOURNALISM, I FELT EVEN MORE

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
SADNESS OVER THE DEATH THIS WEEK

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
OF DAVID HALBERSTAM.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
40 YEARS AGO, HE COVERED THE WAR

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
IN VIETNAM WHILE I WAS PART OF

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
THE GOVERNMENT WAGING IT.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
HE GOT IT RIGHT; WE DIDN'T.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
ABOUT WHOM HE WROTE A DEFINING

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000
BOOK, WERE SURE OF THEIR

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
ARGUMENTS.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
HALBERSTAM WAS SURE OF HIS

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
SENSES.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
HE FELT, SAW, TOUCHED, AND

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
BREATHED THE WAR HE WAS

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
COVERING.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
WASHINGTON SPOKE OF FALLING

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
DOMINOS, CONTAINING COMMUNISM,

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
AND WINNING HEARTS AND MINDS.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
HE WROTE OF BROKEN BODIES,

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
FRIGHTENED AND LONESOME

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
SOLDIERS, OF FRUSTRATION AND

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
FUTILITY.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
FOR REPORTING WHAT HE SAW, HIS

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
PATRIOTISM WAS IMPUGNED.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
PRESIDENTS TRIED TO GET HIM

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.000
FIRED FROM HIS JOB-- A FOOLISH

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
NOTION, BECAUSE FOR DAVID

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
HALBERSTAM JOURNALISM WAS A

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
CALLING, NOT A JOB.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
YOU COULDN'T FIRE HIM AND HE

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
WOULDN'T QUIT.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER AFTER

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
I MOVED TO NEW YORK IN THE LATE

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
'60s.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
WE WERE BORN JUST TWO MONTHS

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
APART IN THE SAME YEAR AND WERE

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
SOUTHERNERS.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
SO WE TALKED ABOUT HOW OUR

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
COUNTRY HAD BEEN TORN APART

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
BECAUSE THE TRUTH OF SLAVERY HAD

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000
BEEN DRIVEN FROM THE CLASSROOM,

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
THE PULPIT, AND THE NEWSROOM.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
WE TALKED ABOUT HOW OFFICIALS

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
AND JOURNALISTS LIVE IN PARALLEL

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
BUT SEPARATE REALITIES; THEY SEE

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
AND TALK TO EACH OTHER, MAY HAVE

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
A MEAL AND GOSSIP TOGETHER, BUT

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
THEIR WORLDS NEVER TOUCH BECAUSE

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.000
OFFICIALS USE WORDS THAT DON'T

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
MEAN WHAT THEY SAY, WHILE FOR

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000
THOSE REPORTERS IN VIETNAM--

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
HALBERSTAM, PETER ARNETT, MORLEY

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
SAFER,  OTHERS--  WORDS WERE

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
VESSELS OF  REALITY.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000
MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, HE HELPED

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000
ME TO SEE THAT THE FURTHER YOU

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000
GET FROM POWER, THE CLOSER YOU

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
COME TO THE TRUTH.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000
SO THE SADNESS ONE FEELS IS

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
PERSONAL AT THE LOSS OF A FRIEND

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
AND MENTOR.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
BUT LET THE GRIEF BE PUBLIC

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
HIM, THE DEATH OF SO HONEST AND

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
COURAGEOUS A REPORTER LEAVES

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
AMERICA A LITTLE MORE

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
VULNERABLE.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
LET'S LISTEN NOW TO SOME VOICES

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
YOU'LL BE HEARING IN THE WEEKS

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:03.000
TO COME.
