WEBVTT

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.500
THEY ARE FOUR OF THE
MOST COMMON

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.830
PLANTS WE KNOW.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.460
WE'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT WE CONTROLLED THEM.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.530
BUT WHAT IF, IN FACT,
THEY HAVE BEEN SHAPING US?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.360
Man: WE DON'T GIVE NEARLY
ENOUGH CREDIT TO PLANTS.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.430
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON US,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.760
THEY'VE BEEN USING US,
FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.630
Narrator: FOUR PLANTS THAT HAVE
TRAVELED THE ROAD TO SUCCESS,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.130
BY SATISFYING HUMAN DESIRES.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.760
Man: THE TULIP,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.600
BY GRATIFYING OUR DESIRE FOR
A CERTAIN KIND OF BEAUTY,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.830
HAS GOTTEN US

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.100
TO TAKE IT FROM ITS
ORIGINS IN CENTRAL ASIA

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.360
AND DISPERSE IT
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.130
MARIJUANA, BY GRATIFYING OUR
DESIRE TO CHANGE CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.760
HAS GOTTEN PEOPLE
TO RISK THEIR LIVES,

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.300
THEIR FREEDOM, IN ORDER TO

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
GROW MORE OF IT AND
PLANT MORE OF IT.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.430
THE POTATO -- BY GRATIFYING
OUR DESIRE FOR CONTROL,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.160
CONTROL OVER NATURE, SO
THAT WE CAN FEED OURSELVES,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.960
HAS GOTTEN ITSELF
OUT OF SOUTH AMERICA

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.330
AND EXPANDED ITS RANGE

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.960
FAR BEYOND WHERE IT
WAS 500 YEARS AGO.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.530
AND THE APPLE,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.760
BY GRATIFYING OUR
DESIRE FOR SWEETNESS --

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.700
BEGINS IN THE
FORESTS OF KAZAKHSTAN

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.130
AND IS NOW THE UNIVERSAL FRUIT.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.800
THESE ARE GREAT WINNERS

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.060
IN THE DANCE OF DOMESTICATION.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760
Man: AND THIS RELATIONSHIP
OF THE PLANTS,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.960
LEARNING HOW TO
GRATIFY OUR DESIRES,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.830
AND OUR WORKING FOR THEM
IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:54.200
IS WHAT I CALL THE
BOTANY OF DESIRE.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.200
Man: IT WAS THAT VERY
SPECIAL WEEK IN MAY,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160
WHEN THE APPLE TREES ARE
IN SPECTACULAR BLOOM,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.760
AND THEY'RE JUST VIBRATING
WITH THE ATTENTION OF BEES.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.530
AND I WAS PLANTING POTATOES,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.360
MAKING MY LITTLE ROWS,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.430
AND PUTTING IN MY CHUNKS,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.760
AND THE BEES WERE
WORKING ABOVE ME.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.260
AND IT OCCURRED TO ME --

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.730
YOU KNOW, WHAT DID I HAVE
IN COMMON WITH THOSE BEES?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.700
AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.800
QUITE A BIT.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.130
THE BEE ASSUMES

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.330
IT'S GETTING THE
BEST OF THIS DEAL

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.730
WITH THE APPLE BLOSSOM.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.230
IT'S BREAKING IN,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.830
IT'S GETTING THE NECTAR.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.460
AND HAS NO IDEA THAT IT'S
PICKED UP THIS POLLEN

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.730
ON THETO ANOTHER TREEHIGHS
AND IS TRANSPORTING IT

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.600
IN THE GARDEN OR
DOWN THE STREET,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.700
OR ANYWHERE ELSE.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.600
SO FOR THE BEE TO THINK IT'S
IN CHARGE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.260
IS REALLY JUST A FAILURE
OF BEE IMAGINATION.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.700
AND I REALIZED I HAD THE
SAME FAILURE OF IMAGINATION.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.230
I WAS WORKING FOR THESE
POTATOES IN SOME SENSE.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.400
I WAS PLANTING THEM,
I WAS GIVING THEM

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.100
A LITTLE BIT MORE HABITAT
THAN THEY HAD BEFORE.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.460
AND YET I THOUGHT I WAS
KIND OF CALLING THE SHOTS.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.260
SO THAT'S WHEN I
HAD THIS THOUGHT

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.800
THAT, WOULDN'T
IT BE INTERESTING

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.130
TO LOOK AT OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO DOMESTICATED PLANTS

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.130
FROM THE PLANT'S POINT OF VIEW?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.730
OF COURSE, PLANTS DON'T HAVE
CONSCIOUSNESS OR INTENTION,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.560
BUT THE ACT OF USING
OUR CONSCIOUSNESS

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.160
TO PUT OURSELVES
IN THEIR ROOTS,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.800
OR SHOES, OR WHATEVER,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.130
HELPS US TO SEE THINGS
FROM THEIR VANTAGE POINT.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.300
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.400
NATURE SUDDENLY
LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.560
WE REALIZE WE'RE IN
THE WEB OF NATURE,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.600
NOT STANDING OUTSIDE IT.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.130
IN WHICH WE CAN SEE OURSELVES
IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.400
AND AS MUCH AS THIS IS
A STORY ABOUT PLANTS,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:05:00.660
IT'S A STORY ABOUT HUMAN DESIRE.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.400
GOOD MORNING, MY
NAME IS BRIAN,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.500
WELCOME TO POVERTY
LANE ORCHARDS.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.960
FIRSTINTO THE ORCHARD,A
DO IS WE'RE GONNA HEAD UP

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.560
I WANNA TELL YOU A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THE APPLES,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.630
AND THE TREES, AND
HOW TO PICK APPLES.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.900
McDormand: FOR CHILDREN
IN NEW ENGLAND,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.100
AN APPLE PICKING EXPEDITION
TO THE LOCAL ORCHARD.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.030
Brian: OKAY, WHEN YOU GUYS
ARE PICKING THE APPLES,

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.430
YOU WANT TO PICK OUT
NICE RIPE APPLES.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.260
AND THE WAY TO TELL THE
RIPE ONES IS THEY'RE RED.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.000
McDormand: BUT THESE
CHILDREN MIGHT NEVER HAVE

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.230
HAD A CHANCE TO TASTE APPLES

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.600
HAD THE APPLE NOT FOUND A WAY
TO GET US TO DO ITS BIDDING.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.630
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, THE
APPLE PUT US TO WORK --

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.760
TRANSPORTING ITS GENES

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.500
FROM ITS NATIVE
GROUND IN CENTRAL ASIA

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.030
TO THE FAR CORNERS OF THE EARTH.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.030
Pollan: FOR A
PLANT TO DO THAT,

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.030
IT HAS TO BE AWFULLY
ENTERPRISING, WILLING TO ADAPT

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.160
TO A GREAT MANY
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.860
WILLFORMS AND FLAVORS.WITH
A GREAT MANY DIFFERENT

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.800
IS THERE A REALLY GOOD RED ONE
UP THERE? WHAT DO YOU SEE?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.660
Pollan: TODAY,
IT'S A FRUIT ICONIC

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.300
AND BELOVED AND USED IN A
GREAT MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.630
McDormand: BUT THE APPLE HAS
NOT ALWAYS BEEN REGARDED AS

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.500
THE WHOLESOME FRUIT
WE THINK OF TODAY.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.360
Pollan: THE APPLE TREE
WAS THE GREAT EVIL PLANT,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.830
BECAUSE PEOPLE TOOK THESE
APPLES AND MADE HARD CIDER,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.100
WHICH WAS THE MAIN
SOURCE OF ALCOHOL

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.460
IN RURAL AMERICA FOR
MANY, MANY YEARS.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.960
THE STRATEGY -- THE
EVOLUTIONARY STRATEGY

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.560
THAT GOT IT FROM
THERE TO HERE --

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.800
INVOLVED PRODUCING
EVER MORE SWEETNESS.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.630
Woman: OKAY, HERE'S CUP FOUR.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.300
THERE YOU GO.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.830
IF YOU THINK IT
TASTES BAD OR YUCKY,

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.160
I WANT YOU TO GIVE IT
TO OSCAR THE GROUCH.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.130
OSCAR, OKAY.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.300
SO HERE'S CUP TWO.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.160
AND IF TASTES GOOD, I WANT
YOU TO GIVE IT TO BIG BIRD,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.630
BECAUSE HE LIKES
THINGS THAT TASTE GOOD.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.060
McDormand: THESE CHILDREN
ARE DOING TASTE TESTS --

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.260
PART OF RESEARCH BEING
DONE ON SWEETNESS

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.630
AT THE MONELL CHEMICAL SENSES
CENTER IN PHILADELPHIA.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.760
IT SPECIALIZES IN THE
STUDY OF TASTE AND SMELL.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.060
GOOD JOB! YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.260
ALL RIGHT, SO I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER ONE.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.000
Man: SOME OF THE FUNDAMENTAL
THINGS WE'VE DISCOVERED ARE,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.100
THE DESIRE FOR SWEETNESS IS
HARDWIRED IN HUMAN BEINGS.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.960
IT'S BUILT-IN, IT'S INNATE.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.230
IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE FEED BABIES

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.630
HIGH LEVELS OF SWEET
WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.560
IT'S PART OF THEIR BIOLOGY.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.160
PRESUMABLY, OUR RESPONSE
TO SWEET EVOLVED

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.500
WHEN SWEET THINGS WERE
RARE IN THE ENVIRONMENT,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.660
THEY WERE THERE
IN SMALL AMOUNTS,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.100
AND OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM
WAS TO MAKE SURE

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.900
WE GOT ENOUGH CALORIES AND
DIDN'T STARVE TO DEATH.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.160
IF A PLANT WAS SWEET,

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.260
THAT MEANT IT WASN'T
BITTER AND POISON,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.030
IT MEANT IT WAS REASONABLY
HIGH IN CALORIES,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.830
BECAUSE SUGARS
ARE CALORIE-RICH,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.660
AND SO SWEETNESS IS THE SIGNAL

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.630
FOR SOMETHING
THAT'S GOOD FOR US.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:08.360
Pollan: SWEETNESS IN NATURE
IS VERY RARE, VERY SPECIAL --

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.260
IT'S REALLY LIMITED
TO RIPE FRUIT,

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.530
AND HONEY, IF YOU'RE
WILLING TO RISK

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.760
GOING INTO A BEEHIVE.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.360
AND APPLES ARE A
PARTICULARLY BIG, PORTABLE,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:27.330
LONG-LASTING VESSEL
FOR SWEETNESS.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.330
McDormand: IT WAS HERE IN

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.400
THE ANCIENT FORESTS
OF CENTRAL ASIA

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.100
THAT OUR OWN
PURSUIT OF SWEETNESS

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.730
FIRST BROUGHT US INTO
CONTACT WITH THE APPLE.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.130
THIS, SCIENTISTS SAY,

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.930
IS THE APPLE'S GENETIC HOME --

00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.500
THE PLACE WHERE IT ORIGINATED.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.660
THESE HIGH FORESTS IN WHAT IS
NOW THE NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.630
GAVE RISE TO THOUSANDS
OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.300
MANY OF WHICH STILL
GROW HERE TODAY.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.400
Man: YOU LAND IN ALMATY,
THE CAPITAL OF KAZAKHSTAN,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.930
AND THERE ARE APPLE SEEDLINGS

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.930
PUSHING UP THROUGH
THE BROKEN PAVEMENT.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.100
YOU GO UP INTO THE HILLS,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.530
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPLES.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.900
GREAT BIG RED APPLES

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.430
THAT LOOK LIKE
LARGE MacINTOSH --

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.130
AND YOU'D FIND THESE SORT OF
KNOTTY LITTLE GREEN THINGS

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.360
THAT EVEN A RAT WOULDN'T EAT.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.530
Pollan: TO SEE THESE WILD
APPLES IN ALL THEIR DIVERSITY

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.830
IS TO REALIZE THAT, IN THESE
FORESTS, THIS IS, YOU KNOW,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.830
THESE ARE GOD'S FIRST DRAFTS
OF WHAT AN APPLE COULD BE.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.200
McDormand: ONE WAY THE APPLE
COULD SECURE ITS FUTURE

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.100
WAS BY EXPANDING ITS HABITAT --

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.600
BUT THAT'S A HARD THING
TO DO IF YOU'RE A PLANT.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.630
Pollan: YOU KNOW,
THE APPLE HAS THE SAME
EXISTENTIAL PREDICAMENT

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.330
OF ANY PLANT -- IT'S STUCK
IN PLACE, IT'S ROOTED DOWN.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.760
SO YOU HAD THE APPLE
BEGINNING ITS LIFE

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.430
IN THESE KAZAKH FORESTS
IN CENTRAL ASIA,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.600
BUT THEY WOULD BE STUCK THERE

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.530
IF NOT FOR MAMMALS, THAT
THEY EVOLVED TO APPEAL TO.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.260
IF YOU'RE A BEAR IN A
FOREST AND YOU'RE HUNGRY,

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260
YOU DON'T PICK THE LITTLE
BLUEBERRY SIZED APPLES,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.560
YOU PICK THE BIGGEST
ONES YOU CAN GET.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.830
IF YOU FIND A
PARTICULARLY SWEET ONE,

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.460
YOU'RE GOING TO EAT
MORE OF THAT ONE

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.130
THAN A SOUR ONE.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.260
THEY EAT THE WHOLE APPLE
AND EXCRETE THE SEEDS,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.930
AND THAT'S HOW APPLES
SPREAD THEIR GENES.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.400
AND SWEETNESS WAS THE
TICKET OUT OF THAT FOREST.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.360
McDormand: BUT TO MOVE FARTHER
THAN BEARS COULD TAKE IT,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.760
THE APPLE WOULD
NEED A NEW ALLY --

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:34.560
AND FOUND ONE...IN US.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.500
Pollan: PART OF
THE APPLE'S GENIUS

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.460
HAS BEEN TO INSINUATE
ITSELF INTO OUR CULTURE,

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.000
AND ART AND RELIGION, AS WELL.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.130
IT'S KIND OF A
BOTANICAL ZELIG --

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.060
I MEAN, IT JUST KIND
OF SHOWS UP EVERYWHERE.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.430
EVEN WHEN IT WASN'T
REALLY THERE.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.560
McDormand: ONE OF
THE BEST KNOWN IMAGES

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.100
OF PEOPLE AND APPLES TOGETHER

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.000
COMES FROM THE STORY
OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.230
Pollan: THOUGH THE
BIBLE DOESN'T SPECIFY
WHAT THE FRUIT IS,

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.200
WE HAVE ALWAYS IMAGINED
IT TO BE APPLES.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.460
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE
NORTHERN RENAISSANCE PAINTERS,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.630
WHEN THEY THOUGHT OF A FRUIT,

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.700
A DESIRABLE FRUIT THAT YOU
WOULD PUT IN A GARDEN,

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.330
THEY IMMEDIATELY
THOUGHT APPLE.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.600
BUT IT WASN'T AN APPLE.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.300
PROBABLY WAS A POMEGRANATE,

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.230
BECAUSE APPLES
DON'T DO VERY WELL

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.530
IN THE LANDS WHERE THE BIBLE IS
THOUGHT TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.060
McDormand: ONE PLACE
WHERE APPLES DID GROW

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:23.100
WAS ANCIENT CHINA.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:23.960
WAS ANCIENT CHINA.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.460
THEY'D BEEN BROUGHT
THERE FROM CENTRAL ASIA

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.160
ON THE TRADE ROUTE
CALLED THE SILK ROAD.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.530
THE APPLE ALSO TRAVELED WEST,

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:40.230
REACHING EUROPE AND
EVENTUALLY THE NEW WORLD.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.600
IN AMERICA, THE APPLE
FOUND A PARTNER,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.500
SOMEONE WHOSE LOVE FOR IT WOULD
BECOME THE STUFF OF LEGEND --

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.660
JOHNNY APPLESEED.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.600
[ MAN WHISTLING ]

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.000
THE LORD IS GOOD TO ME

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.930
AND SO I THANK THE LORD

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.160
Woman: BEHIND JOHNNY
APPLESEED THE MYTH,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.260
THERE IS A REAL PERSON
-- JOHN CHAPMAN.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.230
BUT THE MYTH IS SO POWERFUL,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.030
SO COMPELLING, SO FASCINATING,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:15.360
THAT IT HAS COMPLETELY OBSCURED
THE REAL PERSON WHO'S BEHIND IT.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:20.460
McDormand: JOHN CHAPMAN WAS
BORN IN 1774 IN MASSACHUSETTS.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.260
IN HIS EARLY 20s,
HE HEADED WEST.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.500
HE TRAVELED THROUGH
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY,

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.360
WHICH WAS THEN THE
AMERICAN FRONTIER,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.560
PLANTING AND
SELLING APPLE TREES.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.330
Pollan: HE IS SAID TO HAVE
LIKENED HIMSELF TO A BEE --

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.700
THAT HE HAD SOME SENSE
THAT HE, LIKE A BEE,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.530
WAS SPREADING THESE
PLANTS AROUND.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.700
Browning: JOHNNY
APPLESEED WAS --

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.160
NOT TO MAKE A TERRIBLE PUN --

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.930
A PRETTY SEEDY
FELLOW, YOU KNOW?

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.330
TRAVELLING AROUND,
OFTEN BAREFOOT,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.300
YOU KNOW, IN A BURLAP
SACK SOMETIMES,

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.500
SLEEPING IN BARNS.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.160
BUT TERRIBLY ENGAGING.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.960
PEOPLE TOOK HIM IN,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.600
AND HE PLANTED THE ORCHARDS,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.760
AND HE TOLD THEM HOW TO PRUNE.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.260
BUT HE WAS, UM...

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.500
HE WAS A BUM.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.660
THIS IS DOUBLY ODD,

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.860
BECAUSE HE WAS ACTUALLY
FAIRLY WELL OFF.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.230
McDormand: CHAPMAN COULD
EASILY HAVE AFFORDED

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.700
ALL THOSE APPLE TREES HE PLANTED
MADE HIM A PROSPEROUS MAN.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.760
Pollan: HE WASN'T JUST

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.600
SPRINKLING APPLE
SEEDS WHERE HE WENT --

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.960
HE WAS A NURSERY MAN.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.130
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT,

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.530
WHEREVER THE NEXT WAVE
OF SETTLERS WOULD LAND,

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.530
THEY WOULD WANT APPLE TREES.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.500
BY LAW, YOU WERE REQUIRED
TO PLANT SOME FRUIT,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.400
BECAUSE THAT WAS A SYMBOL
YOU WERE GOING TO STAY PUT.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.960
SO HE WOULD FIND
A PIECE OF LAND,

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.830
HE WOULD CLEAR IT,

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.900
AND HE WOULD PLANT
APPLES FROM SEEDS,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.500
AND START A NURSERY A FEW YEARS
BEFORE THE SETTLERS GOT THERE,

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.600
SO BY THE TIME THEY SHOWED UP,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.230
HE HAD SAPLINGS FOR SALE
FOR A FEW CENTS APIECE.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.530
IT WAS A VERY GOOD BUSINESS.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.560
BUT WHEN I STARTED LEARNING
ABOUT THE BOTANY OF APPLES,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.800
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A
PROBLEM WITH HIS STORY --

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:15.200
WHY WOULD HE BE
PLANTING THEM FROM SEED?

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.830
McDormand: THE MYSTERY
STEMS FROM A CURIOUS FACT

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.600
OF THE APPLE'S OWN BIOLOGY --

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.400
ITS TASTE AND EVEN
ITS APPEARANCE

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.130
ARE RARELY PASSED ON
THROUGH ITS SEEDS.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.960
Pollan: IN EVERY APPLE YOU
WILL FIND A FEW LITTLE SEEDS,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960
EACH IN THEIR OWN
LITTLE CHAMBER.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.900
WELL, EVERY ONE OF
THOSE SEEDS, IF PLANTED,

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.430
WILL PRODUCE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT APPLE,

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.800
LOOKING VERY LITTLE, IF
AT ALL, LIKE ITS PARENT.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.830
THEY TEND TO BE SOUR, BITTER,

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.600
ALL THESE OTHER
DIFFERENT FLAVORS.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.100
McDormand: THAT'S
BECAUSE EACH APPLE SEED

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.760
CARRIES GENES FOR A WIDE
VARIETY OF TRAITS --

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.400
AND THERE'S NO TELLING
WHICH OF THOSE GENES

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.330
WILL BE TURNED ON WHEN
THE SEED STARTS TO GROW.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:01.730
THERE IS, HOWEVER,
A VERY SIMPLE WAY

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.230
TO PERPETUATE THE
TRAITS OF AN APPLE,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.330
AN ANCIENT TECHNIQUE
CALLED GRAFTING.

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.600
YOU TATHAT YOU LIKEDA
TREE THAT PRODUCED FRUIT

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.130
AND INSERT IT INTO A
YOUNG, DEVELOPING TREE.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.400
THE RESULT?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.600
AN EXACT COPY --

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.460
OR CLONE -- OF THE
APPLE YOU STARTED WITH.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:27.830
MANY AMERICAN SETTLERS GREW
THEIR APPLES EXACTLY THAT WAY.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.800
BUT NOT JOHNNY APPLESEED.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.030
Chaplin: HE TENDED
TO GROW SEEDLINGS

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.030
AND THEN JUST LET
THEM GROW WILD.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.030
HE MIGHT HAVE DONE
THIS, WE THINK,

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.500
BECAUSE OF HIS
RELIGIOUS BELIEFS --

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.930
HE WAS A SWEDENBORGIAN.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:50.030
McDormand: THE 18th-CENTURY
CHRISTIAN THEOLOGIAN,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:56.960
PREACHED THAT THE NATURAL WORLD
IS IMBUED WITH GOD'S SPIRIT.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.060
Chaplin: SWEDENBORG
HAD TAUGHT THAT

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.730
EVERYTHING THAT
WAS HERE ON EARTH,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.660
THAT YOU COULD SEE,
FEEL, TASTE, TOUCH,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:12.430
HAD A COUNTERPART IN THE
SPIRITUAL WORLD BEYOND.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:15.600
FOR CHAPMAN, THIS
SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.660
HE SHOULD NOT TAMPER WITH
ALL OF THE NATURAL THINGS

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.960
THAT HE COULD SEE IN
THE WORLD AROUND HIM.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.530
AND THIS SEEMS TO
BE ONE REASON WHY

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.860
HE GROWS APPLES
FROM THEIR SEEDS,

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:35.400
McDormand: WHATEVER
HIS REASONS, CHAPMAN'S
BOTANICAL PRACTICES

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.730
GAVE THE APPLE A
GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.330
TO ADAPT TO A NEW ENVIRONMENT.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.700
Pollan: BY GOING BACK TO SEED,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.600
YOU ARE GOING BACK TO THE
BIODIVERSITY OF YOUR GENES.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.000
SO ALL OF THOSE APPLE SEEDS

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.960
PRODUCED HUNDREDS OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF APPLES

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.860
WITH VERY DIFFERENT QUALITIES.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.800
AND SO THE APPLE,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.960
JUST LIKE THE ENGLISHMEN
WHO CAME OVER,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:07.700
REMADE ITSELF AS AMERICANS.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.130
McDormand: MOST OF
THESE NEW VARIETIES,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.330
BECAUSE THEY WERE
GROWN FROM SEED,

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:20.300
TUUSE FOR THEM -- CIDER... BUT
THE SETTLERS HAD A VERY GOOD

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:24.760
HARD CIDER.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.600
Pollan: NOW, WHEN WE
USE THE WORD CIDER,

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.260
WE PICTURE SOMETHING VERY SWEET.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.060
BUT OF COURSE, IT
ONLY STAYS SWEET

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.930
WENT INTO BARRELS AND FERMENTED
SO ALL THE CIDER THEY MADE

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:40.600
AND BECAME WHAT WE CALL HARD
CIDER, ALCOHOLIC CIDER.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.060
SO JOHNNY APPLESEED,
WHO WE THINK OF AS

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.060
THE MOST BENIGN, WHOLESOME
KIND OF CHARACTER,

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.100
TURNS OUT WAS

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.660
BRINGING HARD DRINK
TO THE FRONTIER.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.460
Browning: THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE DRANK.

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.700
COLONIAL AMERICA WAS
TERRIFIED OF WATER!

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.760
YOU KNOW, THEY KNEW ABOUT

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.200
ALL THE DISEASES
OF WATER IN EUROPE,

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.660
Chaplin: CIDER, HOWEVER,
BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN FERMENTED,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.430
HAD KILLED, IN THE PROCESS,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.800
ANYTHING THAT
MIGHT MAKE YOU ILL.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.800
Pollan: THAT WAS THE BEER OF
ITS TIME, THE WINE OF ITS TIME,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.100
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY DRANK
-- AND I MEAN EVERYBODY.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.500
McDormand: EVERYONE FROM PAUPERS
TO PRESIDENTS CONSUMED CIDER.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.460
JOHN ADAMS LIKED TO
DRINK IT FOR BREAKFAST.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.960
BUT OVER TIME,
CIDER AND THE APPLE

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:30.700
BECAME VICTIMS OF
THEIR OWN SUCCESS.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.260
Chaplin: ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.730
STARTED TO RISE IN
ABOUT THE 1830s.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.330
AND THERE'S SOME PUBLIC
OUTRAGE OVER THAT,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:45.060
THAT PEOPLE SEEMED TO BE
TOO INTERESTED IN DRINKING,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.430
OR ARE DRUNK,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.730
SO ALL FORMS OF
ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:55.030
BEGIN TO BE CRITICIZED,
AND CIDER IS AMONG THEM.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.560
Pollan: PEOPLE WENT
AFTER APPLE TREES.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.330
WHICH HAD BEEN CELEBRATED FOR
MUCH OF AMERICAN HISTORY,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.830
IS VILIFIED AS THE EVIL FRUIT.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:09.030
IT'S BACK IN THE GARDEN
OF EDEN, IN A SENSE.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.100
THE HATCHET WIELDED BY
THE FAMOUS PROHIBITIONIST

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.430
CARRIE NATION,
WAS NOT JUST ABOUT

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.660
BREAKING DOWN SALOON DOORS,

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.800
IT WAS ALSO ABOUT CHOPPING
DOWN THIS EVIL TREE

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.300
THAT WAS GETTING
AMERICANS DRUNK.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.730
McDormand: BUT THE APPLE
WOULD BE RESCUED FROM INFAMY

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.160
BY THE SWEETER
SIDE OF ITS NATURE.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.060
Pollan: EVEN THOUGH CIDER WAS
WHAT HAPPENED TO MOST APPLES,

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:32.830
APPLES WERE ALSO
EATEN AS A FOOD.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.600
AND WHENEVER YOU WERE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO FIND A SWEET ONE,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.860
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID WITH IT.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.730
McDormand: SO WITH
CIDER IN DISREPUTE,

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:48.200
THE RACE TO FIND SWEET NEW
VARIETIES INTENSIFIED.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.330
Pollan: EVERYONE WHO HAD A
CIDER ORCHARD HAD HIS EYE OUT

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.200
FOR THAT ONE GOOD EDIBLE APPLE.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.100
IT WAS REALLY WELL UNDERSTOOD

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.230
THAT ONE OF THE TICKETS

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.260
TO GREAT SUCCESS AND
GREAT WEALTH IN AMERICA

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.400
WAS TO FIND A GOOD EDIBLE APPLE.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.960
AND ALL THE FAMOUS
APPLES THAT WE KNOW --

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.760
THE DELICIOUS, THE MacINTOSH,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.630
THE BALDWIN, THE
NORTHERN SPY --

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.000
THESE HAD ALL BEGUN
IN CIDER ORCHARDS.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.630
THEY WERE THE STARS.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.630
BEFORE 1900, THE FATE OF, LIKE,
99% OF APPLES WAS TO BE DRUNK.

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.930
AFTER 1900, IT BECOMES THE
FRUIT THAT WE NOW KNOW.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.330
McDormand: FOR
20th-CENTURY AMERICANS,

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.700
APPLES BECAME A SYMBOL
OF WHOLESOMENESS.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.900
Pollan: THE APPLE GROWERS
CAME UP WITH THIS CAMPAIGN --

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.900
AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS
THE DOCTOR AWAY --

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.360
AND ESSENTIALLY REBRANDED
THE APPLE AS A HEALTH FOOD.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.930
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.830
BUT WHEATING APPLES,
THAT, AS SOON AS YOU'RE

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.460
YOU FOCUS ON THOSE FEW VARIETIES

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.400
THAT ARE REALLY
TASTY AND POPULAR,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.830
AND THE INDUSTRY SHRANK
DOWN THE NUMBER OF APPLES

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.160
OVER THE COURSE OF
THE 20th CENTURY.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.660
SO THAT, BY THE TIME I WAS
A BOY IN THE EARLY '60s,

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.200
THERE WERE VERY FEW
APPLES IN COMMERCE.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.900
THERE WAS THE RED DELICIOUS,
THE GOLDEN DELICIOUS,

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.500
AND THE MacINTOSH.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.830
THAT WAS, YOU KNOW,

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.000
EASY FOR MARKETERS TO
GET THEIR HEAD AROUND,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.700
IT WAS ALL THE PUBLIC
SEEMED TO WANT.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.660
BUT FOR THE APPLE, IT
WASN'T VERY GOOD NEWS --

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:19.630
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU KIND
OF FREEZE ITS EVOLUTION,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:29.500
THE APPLE IS KIND OF A
SITTING DUCK FOR ITS PESTS.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.430
McDormand: APPLES WERE
INCREASINGLY BEING GROWN

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.860
IN WHAT SCIENTISTS
CALL MONOCULTURES,

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.230
WHICH CHURNED OUT
JUST A SINGLE VARIETY.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.530
Pollan: ONCE YOU RELY ON
THE GENETIC UNIFORMITY

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.800
THAT COMES WITH CLONING

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.000
RATHER THAN
PLANTING FROM SEED,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.930
YOU RESTRICT THE SPECIES'
NATURAL ABILITY TO EVOLVE.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:51.860
SO YOU HAVE YOUR PLANTS, WITH
THEIR GENETIC COMBINATION,

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:54.060
STAYING STILL,
WHILE THE PESTS --

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.760
I'M TALKING ABOUT
INSECTS OR DISEASES,

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.700
VIRUSES OR BACTERIA --

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.760
ARE ALWAYS TRYING
TO PICK THE LOCK.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.160
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET NOT
JUST ONE OF YOUR PLANTS,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.960
BUT ALL OF YOUR PLANTS,
'CAUSE THEY'RE THE SAME.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.430
McDormand: TO DEFEND THEM
FROM INSECTS AND DISEASES,

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.430
MOST APPLES ARE ROUTINELY
SPRAYED WITH CHEMICALS.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.230
Browning: THE BUGS ARE CLEARLY

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.500
WELL AHEAD OF THE
HUMAN CONTROLS.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.500
IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A LARGE GROWER,

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.730
WITH A COUPLE OF
HUNDRED ACRES,

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.230
A HALF-MILLION TO THREE-QUARTERS
OF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.530
IN CHEMICAL COSTS.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:35.560
Pollan: ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CONSUMERS OF PESTICIDE NOW

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.200
IS THE APPLE CROP.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.500
IT'S THE FATE OF MONOCULTURES.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.330
Man: WE'LL HAVE TO
CHECK THE RECORDS

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:47.730
TO SEE WHAT THE
RESISTANCES ARE IN THESE,

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.930
BECAUSE THESE COULD
BE REAL USEFUL

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.660
IN BREEDING RIGHT
NOW, I THINK.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.230
McDormand: IN GENEVA, NEW YORK,
SCIENTIST HERB ALDWINCKLE

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.330
AND PHIL FORSLINE
ARE LOOKING FOR

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:58.730
ANOTHER WAY TO HELP THE APPLE --

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.760
BY HARNESSING THE DEFENSES
THAT LIE HIDDEN IN ITS GENES.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.560
SO THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.860
IF IT WAS GRAFTED ON
A DWARFING ROOTSTOCK.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.760
PROBABLY DOUBLE THE SIZE
AND EVEN MORE COLOR.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.130
McDormand: ALDWINCKLE
AND FORSLINE

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.330
COLLABORATE AT THIS
APPLE RESEARCH CENTER,

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.230
WHICH IS RUN BY THE U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:22.000
IT'S A BOTANICAL
VERSION OF NOAH'S ARK.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.700
Pollan: TO WALK INTO
THIS ORCHARD IS TO --

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.260
AT FIRST, IT LOOKS LIKE
KIND OF A NORMAL ORCHARD...

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.200
AND THEN YOU REALIZE AS
YOU LOOK DOWN THE ROWS

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.660
THAT, MY GOD, EVERY ONE OF
THESE TREES IS DIFFERENT.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.130
THERE ARE YELLOW ONES
AND THERE ARE RED ONES,

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.900
AND THERE ARE GREEN ONES,
AND THERE ARE PURPLISH ONES,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.100
AND THERE ARE SMALL AND LARGE

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.360
AND EVERY SHAPE
OF TREE AND FRUIT.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.700
IT IS JUST THIS VAST LIBRARY.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.930
McDormand: HERE, THERE ARE MORE
THAN 5,000 DIFFERENT KINDS

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.460
OF APPLE TREES -- EACH WITH
ITS OWN DISTINCT SET OF GENES.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.500
Man: A MECHANIC HAS A
WIDE VARIETY OF TOOLS

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.160
WHICH HE HOPES
HE'LL BE ABLE TO USE

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.100
TO FIX PROBLEMS WITH
MACHINES HE'S WORKING ON --

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.230
IT'S A SIMILAR
SITUATION WITH APPLES.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.830
WE NEED TO HAVE A TOOL CHEST,

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.060
AND THE GENES ARE WHAT
PROVIDE THE TOOL CHEST.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.260
McDormand: IN 1989,
ALDWINCKLE AND FORSLINE

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:19.560
GOT AN UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY
TO ADD TO THEIR TOOL CHEST

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.130
SOME OF THE MOST VALUABLE
APPLE GENES IN THE WORLD --

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:31.700
THE GENES FROM KAZAKHSTAN.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.360
Aldwinckle: WE REGARD
THE KAZAKH APPLE FORESTS

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.460
AS THE GENE BANK OF
THE DOMESTIC APPLE.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.760
WILD FORESTS WERE
BEING CHOPPED DOWN,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.160
THE TREES WERE
BEING DESTROYED,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.400
THEY JUST WOULDN'T
BE THERE ANYMORE

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.560
UNLESS SOMEONE WENT
THERE AND COLLECTED THEM

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.960
AND GREW THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.260
WE HAD SOME JEEPS WE
TRAVELED AROUND IN,

00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:02.100
AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO
VISIT TRUE APPLE FORESTS.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:05.160
Forsline: IT WAS A
BIT OF A CULTURE SHOCK

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.330
TO BE IN CENTRAL ASIA
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:11.200
MY FIRST IMPRESSIONS
WERE, THIS WAS IN

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.660
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
-- WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.130
BUT, UH... TO JUST SEE

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.000
THE DIVERSITY IN THOSE APPLES

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.760
IS JUST AMAZING.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.960
Aldwinckle: ONCE AN APPLE
TREE IS CHOPPED DOWN,

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.930
BUT IF WE CAN TAKE THE
SEED FROM THAT TREE

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:36.730
WE CAN PRESERVE THE GENES THAT
WERE PRESENT IN THAT TREE,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:44.730
AND ESSENTIALLY WE CAN
PRESERVE THAT TREE FOREVER.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.560
McDormand: ALDWINCKLE
AND FORSLINE

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.830
MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO
THE KAZAKH FORESTS.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.530
THEY BROUGHT SEEDS
BACK AND PLANTED THEM.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.260
Forsline: WE'RE STANDING IN
THE MIDDLE OF WHAT I CALL

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.700
KAZAKHSTAN RE-CREATED
IN GENEVA, NEW YORK.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.460
BUT WE'RE NOT ONLY
JUST SAVING IT,

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.960
WE'RE DEVELOPING A
LIBRARY OF INFORMATION

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.030
ON EVERY ONE OF THESE TREES.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.900
Browning: THE NOTION OF
CONSERVATION OF SEED

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.560
IS TO CONSERVE IT --
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.360
WHAT YOU MIGHT NEED IT
FOR AT SOME FUTURE TIME --

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.930
MAYBE NOTHING.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.360
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD
IDEA TO CONSERVE THINGS --

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.600
THAT'S THE PRIMARY VALUE.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.900
THEN THERE'S A
SECONDARY VALUE,

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.130
AND THAT IS TO USE THEM
AS GENETIC BREEDING STOCK

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:25.200
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS --

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.000
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT
MIGHT ENABLE GROWERS

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.800
TO USE FEWER PESTICIDES.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.230
McDormand: IN HIS LAB,

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.160
ALDWINCKLE IS TRYING
TO DO JUST THAT,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.700
BY MOVING GENES THAT
PROVIDE DISEASE RESISTANCE

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.360
FROM A WILD KAZAKH APPLE
INTO A COMMERCIAL VARIETY.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:47.360
Aldwinckle: THESE ARE PIECES
OF LEAVES OF FUJI APPLE.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.300
AND WHAT WE'VE GOT
HERE IS AN EXPERIMENT

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.830
TO TRY AND TRANSFER SOME GENES

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.030
FOR RESISTANCE TO APPLE SCAB

00:26:56.030 --> 00:27:01.830
INTO FUJI, AND THEREFORE MAKE
FUJI RESISTANT TO APPLE SCAB.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.660
Pollan: IN THE 19th CENTURY,

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.430
THE REPOSITORY OF ALL
THE GENETIC DIVERSITY

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.900
OF THE APPLE IN AMERICA
WAS IN THE CIDER ORCHARD.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.230
TODAY IT'S IN THESE COLLECTIONS

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:16.430
THAT ARE MAINTAINED BY
SOME VISIONARY INDIVIDUALS

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:26.030
WHO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF
PRESERVING THIS BIODIVERSITY.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:27.430
THERE'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.560
THAT WE GET INTO, WHICH
IS, WE HAVE MONOCULTURES

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.360
IN THE FIELD, AND
MONOCULTURES ON THE PLATE.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.960
MONOCULTURES OF TASTE.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.830
FRUIT NOW HAS TO
COMPETE WITH SODA.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.760
SO IT HAS GOT TO
BE SUPER-SWEET,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.600
AND THE MODERN APPLES
ALL ARE VERY SWEET --

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.600
WE HAVE APPLES THAT, AS ONE
CRITIC SAID OF THE DELICIOUS,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.560
IT HAS SWEETNESS
WITHOUT DIMENSION.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.830
THE PROBLEM IS, IT'S BORING,

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.760
SWEETNESS -- IF
THAT'S ALL YOU GET.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.460
McDormand: IN LEBANON,
NEW HAMPSHIRE,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.700
ONE GROWER IS TRYING
TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.400
BY REACHING BACK INTO
THE APPLE'S PAST.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.630
STEPHEN WOOD IS THE OWNER
OF POVERTY LANE ORCHARDS.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.730
HE USED TO GROW MOSTLY
STANDARD VARIETIES,

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:12.960
LIKE MACTHE PRICESLANDS --
BUT FOUND HE COULDN'T MATCH

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.860
OF THE BIG COMMERCIAL GROWERS.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.060
Wood: WE REALIZED
IN THE LATE '80s

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.030
THAT WHAANY LONGER,YS
DONE WASN'T GOING TO WORK

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.760
AND THAT WE EITHER HAD TO
CHANGE QUITE DRAMATICALLY

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.460
WHAT WE WERE DOING, OR STOP
GROWING APPLES ALTOGETHER.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.730
McDormand: BUT FOR WOOD,

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:31.060
GIVING UP ON HIS ORCHARD
SEEMED INCONCEIVABLE.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:35.830
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
ADORE ANTIQUE CLOCKS,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:41.130
I ADORE APPLE TREES.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:44.960
HOW ARE WE DOING ON WATER CORE?

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.530
WE STARTED SOME GRAFTING TRIALS

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:50.160
OF WHAT I GUESS YOU COULD
CALL ANTIQUE VARIETIES --

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.830
VARIETIES THAT ARE NOT
COMMONLY GROWN ANYMORE,

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.360
BUT ONCE WERE.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360
THIS IS WICKSON.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.730
THIS APPLE ORIGINATED
IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.600
IN THE LATE 19th CENTURY.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.430
[ CRUNCH ]

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.130
IT'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL ACIDITY.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.360
THIS IS POMME GRISE.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.460
IT HAS VERY LOW
ACID, HIGH SUGAR,

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.060
AND A SORT OF... A
SORT OF NUTTY FLAVOR.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:22.900
THIS APPLE IS CALVILLE
BLANC D'HIVER.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.160
IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF
SWEETNESS BEHIND THE ACID.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.700
YOU LOOK AT 17th-CENTURY
FRENCH STILL-LIFES,

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:31.000
THIS IS THE APPLE YOU SEE

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.360
BESIDE THE DEAD PHEASANT
AND THE BOTTLE OF WINE.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.860
THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER
OF APPLE VARIETIES --

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.260
IT'S ALMOST INFINITE.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.460
McDormand: BUT IT'S
TOUGH TO MAKE A LIVING

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.400
SELLING ONLY ANTIQUE
EATING APPLES.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.960
SO WOOD TURNED HIS ATTENTION TO

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.330
ANOTHER LOST CHAPTER
IN APPLE HISTORY --

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.760
MOST OF HIS ORCHARD IS
NOW PRODUCING APPLES...

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.130
FOR HARD CIDER.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.930
Wood: IT IS A GAMBLE TO PLANT

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:01.830
ACRES AND ACRES OF
INEDIBLE APPLES...

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.930
MANY OF THE BEST CIDER
APPLES ARE DISGUSTING --

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:11.000
BITTHE DECISION TO PLANTS.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.260
BUT THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF THOSE TREES,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.960
COULD BE QUITE A GOOD JOKE IF
THE CIDER DOESN'T MAKE IT,

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.660
BECAUSE THESE APPLES
ARE NOT GOING TO WIND UP

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.800
THERE'S NO SECONDARY
MARKET FOR THIS STUFF.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:34.030
[ POP ]

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:40.530
WITH A FEW OTHER
COLLEAGUES, WE ARE TRYING,

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:46.830
BASICALLY TO CREATE A CATEGORY
IN THE U.S. WINE TRADE

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.230
OF FINE CIDERS.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.630
I THINK WE'RE DOING
QUITE WELL IN THAT,

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.900
BUT THE [ CRUNCH ]ILL OUT.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.130
Pollan: THERE ARE
A LOT OF FRUITS

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.500
THAT HAVE GOTTEN AHEAD IN LIFE

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.800
BY BEING SWEET AND
GRATIFYING THE SWEET TOOTH

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:03.860
OF MAMMALS LIKE US,

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.800
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THE APPLE,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.700
YIN WESTERN CIVILIZATION,C

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.130
AND SO ENDURING IN
ITS RELATIONSHIP,

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:15.630
AND ITS ABILITY, REALLY, TO
GRATIFY OUR CHANGING DESIRES --

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.030
FOR ALCOHOL, AND FOR A
WONDERFULLY SWEET FOOD --

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:46.900
THAT MY GUESS IS, IT WILL
SUCCEED FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.360
Pollan: THE MYSTERY IS,

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:55.000
WHY THINGS THAT BEES
REGARD AS BEAUTIFUL,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.900
I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT
WE WOULD HAVE THE SAME TASTE

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.900
AS THIS LITTLE BUG?

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.460
WHEN I SAY THE BEE HAS
A CONCEPT OF BEAUTY,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.760
I MEAN, I'M BEING
METAPHORICAL.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.100
BUT THE BEE AND OURSELVES
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.900
WE REALLY LIKE SYMMETRY,

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.330
WE LIKE CERTAIN PATTERNS

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:20.430
OF COLOR, AND CERTAIN SCENTS --
WE AGREE ABOUT SCENT, AS WELL.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.300
THE BEE LOVES THIS FLOWER
AND MOVES TOWARD IT,

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.930
AND THIS FLOWER HAS
EVOLVED TO ATTRACT IT.

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:33.200
WELL, THIS PLANT HAS ALSO
EVOLVED TO ATTRACT US.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.930
TO THE EXTENT THAT
A FLOWER CAN GRATIFY

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.230
OUR IDEAS OF A
BEAUTIFUL COLOR,

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.600
A BEAUTIFUL SHAPE,
A BEAUTIFUL SMELL,

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.860
IT WILL DOMINATE
THE LANDSCAPE,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.760
DOMINATE THE FLOWER INDUSTRY,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.660
GET MANY MORE COPIES
OF ITSELF MADE,

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:55.360
McDorOBSCURITY TO FAMEWERS
HAVE TRAVELED THE ROAD FROM

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:05.430
MORE SPECTACULARLY
THAN THE TULIP.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.030
Man: 59 YEARS AGO,

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.900
I SAW FIRST TULIP IN MY LIFE.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:16.400
AND THAT WAS IN THE
GARDEN OF MY FATHER.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.330
AND NOW MY WHOLE
LIFE IS WITH TULIPS.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.560
McDormand: NOBODY KNOWS TULIPS
BETTER THAN THE DUTCH --

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.730
AND FEW DUTCHMEN KNOW THEM
BETTER THAN JOOP ZONNEVELD,

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:33.300
BUT HE HAS A CURIOUS WAY OF
DESCRIBING THEIR EFFECT ON HIM.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.030
Zonneveld: YOU LOOK AFTER
EVERY TULIP, STEP BY STEP,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:44.660
YOU GET AND WORSE.FEVER --
IT BECOMES WORSE, WORSE,

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:50.660
FOR ME, IT WAS SOMETHING,
IT'S IN ME, IT NEVER STOPS.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:55.500
McDormand: ZONNEVELD'S BEEN
A TULIP BUYER, A SALESMAN,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.130
OF ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS
TULIP GARDENS IN THE WORLD --

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.930
HORTUS BULBORUM IN
THE NETHERLANDS,

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.960
A SHOWPLACE FOR THE
REMARKABLE DIVERSITY

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:19.260
OF THIS SOMETIMES
UNDERAPPRECIATED FLOWER.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:26.500
ZWE HAVE 2,300 VARIETIES.,

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.760
YOU HAVE DARK PURPLE COLORS,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.760
YOU HAVE ALMOST BLACK TULIPS,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.560
YOU HAVE LILY
FLOWERING TULIPS,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.800
THERE'S A TULIP THAT
HAS THE SHAPE LIKE THIS,

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.960
LIKE A LILY FLOWER.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:40.030
YOU HAVE YELLOW, RED,

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.130
PINK, ORANGE, BICOLORED,

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.430
SINGLE EARLIES, SINGLE
LATE, DOUBLE LATE --

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:52.100
SO THERE ARE SO MANY
THINGS IN THE TULIPS

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.530
THAT ONCE YOU START,

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:59.600
YOU DISCOVER EVERY DAY --
EVEN MYSELF, I DISCOVER

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.660
EVERY DAY NEW THINGS.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.400
McDormand: TODAY,
ZONNEVELD IS GIVING A TOUR

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.600
TO PHOTOGRAPHER RUTH DUNDAS
AND WRITER JUSTIN SPRING --

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.660
TWO AMERICANS WHO HAVE

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.000
COME TO HORTUS TO GATHER
MATERIAL FOR A NEW BOOK.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.030
THIS IS A LOVELY VIRIDIFLORA.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.560
TULIPS ARE ABOUT THE LAST
SUBJECT THEY THOUGHT

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.900
WOULD EVER CAPTURE
THEIR INTEREST.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.300
Dundas: I HAVE
TO SAY, HONESTLY,

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.960
THAT WHEN I FIRST
STARTED TO PHOTOGRAPH,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.130
THE LAST THING I WANTED
TO PHOTOGRAPH WAS TULIPS.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.230
IT'S PRETTY BORING,

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.600
IT'S A LOLLIPOP
ON TOP OF A STICK,

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.760
YOU KNOW, YOU GET DIFFERENT
COLORS, BUT THAT'S IT.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.530
IT'S ONLY ONCE YOU
COME TO GARDENS

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.700
SUCH AS THE HORTUS BULBORUM HERE

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.730
THAT YOU START TO UNDERSTAND

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.630
THAT THIS IS A
VERY VARIED FLOWER,

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:44.260
AND IT'S ADAPTED AND MUTATED

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:48.700
INTO MTO PHOTOGRAPH,FORMS.
IT'S A LOT OF FUN

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:52.260
THAT THERE'S A
CONSTANT CHALLENGE

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.900
TO LOOK INTO THIS FLOWER

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:58.060
AND BE ABLE TO SEE
NEW COLOR, NEW LIGHT.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.700
YOU CAN TAKE A BOUQUET OF TULIPS

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.230
AND PHOTOGRAPH IT
EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.000
AND IT'S SOMETHING QUITE
DIFFERENT EACH TIME.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.100
[ SHUTTER CLICKS ]

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.630
PERFECT, GORGEOUS.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.030
IT JUST SEEMS SO
AMAZING THAT YOU HAVE

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.700
THIS EXTRAORDINARY VARIETY
THAT'S BEEN CULTIVATED

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.230
OVER CENTURIES, AND
SOMEHOW YOU GREW UP

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.460
NOT KNOWING A THING ABOUT IT.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.960
McDormand: FLOWERS BEGAN
FLAUNTING THEIR BEAUTY

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.760
LONG BEFORE THERE WERE PEOPLE.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.160
IT WAS MORE THAN 100
MILLION YEARS AGO

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.260
WHEN THE CLASS OF PLANTS
THAT FLOWERS BELONG TO --

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:33.800
THE ANGIOSPERMS -- FIRST
APPEARED ON THE EARTH.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.160
Pollan: THE GREAT REVOLUTION
IN NATURAL HISTORY

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.460
IS THE RISE OF THE ANGIOSPERMS.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:44.260
THIS IS THE CLASS OF PLANTS
THAT MAKES CONSPICUOUS FLOWERS,

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.630
FORMS FRUIT AND SEED.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:51.960
THIS WAS A NEW WAY OF
DOING BUSINESS IN NATURE.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.360
McDormand: THE FLOWER
OF AN ANGIOSPERM

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.030
HAS A MALE PART, THE STAMEN,
WHICH PRODUCES POLLEN.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.530
WHETHER TRANSPORTED BY
WIND, BEES, OR HUMANS,

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:05.330
WHEN POLLEN LANDS ON THE
FLOWER'S FEMALE PART,

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.830
THE PISTIL, IT
GETS FERTILIZED,

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.430
AND GIVES RISE TO SEEDS.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.730
THE SEEDS CONTAIN A MIX OF GENES

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:14.230
FROM BOTH THE MOTHER
AND THE FATHER.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.100
BEFORE THAT, YOU HAD THIS
GREENER, SLEEPIER WORLD

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.300
WHERE THINGS REPRODUCE
USUALLY BY CLONING,

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:24.000
BY SPORES THAT WERE GENETICALLY
IDENTICAL TO THEIR PARENTS.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.430
EVOLUTION PROCEEDED IN
A KIND OF POKEY PACE,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:31.530
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
HAVE AS MUCH VARIATION.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.900
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS
INCREDIBLE EXPLOSION

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.730
OF DIVERSITY THAT HAPPENS
WITH THIS NEW STRATEGY.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.230
[ BEE BUZZING ]

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.700
IT WAS INCREDIBLY
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.260
IT ALLOWED YOU TO MOVE
YOUR GENES AROUND,

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.400
IT ALLOWED YOU TO
EVOLVE MUCH QUICKER,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.430
BECAUSE SEX CREATES VARIATION.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.030
AND THE MORE NEW
COMBINATIONS YOU TRY,

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:55.630
THE QUICKER YOU CAN ADAPT TO
WHATEVER THE ENVIRONMENT IS.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.430
AND ONE PARTICULAR GROUP
OF THESE ANGIOSPERMS

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:04.360
CAME UP WITH A REALLY,
REALLY CLEVER STRATEGY --

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.400
AND THAT WAS

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.830
TO APPEAL NOT TO, YOU KNOW,

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.830
BUGS OR BIRDS OR BEES,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:14.660
McDormand: THE FIRST WILD
TULIPS, SCIENTISTS THINK,

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:19.560
SPRANG UP IN THE SAME PLACE
WHERE THE APPLE ORIGINATED --

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.600
THE MOUNTAINS OF CENTRAL ASIA.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.000
Pollan: IT WAS TYPICALLY KIND
OF MORE OPEN THAN OUR TULIP,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.230
SO IT HAD A KIND OF
HOURGLASSY SHAPE.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.230
OFTEN HAD A SCENT,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:36.500
OFTEN HAD A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT COLOR INSIDE.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.830
[ HORSE NEIGHS ]

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:41.530
McDormand: DRAWN BY THE
BEAUTY OF THESE WILD FLOWERS,

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.530
PEOPLE LEARNED HOW
TO CULTIVATE THEM.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.600
Pollan: UNDER OUR ATTENTION,
THE FLOWER GOT BIGGER,

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.530
THE COLORS VERY
OFTEN GOT BRIGHTER,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:59.830
AND THEN WE STARTED
EXPERIMENTING WITH VARIATION.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.600
McDormand: FROM CENTRAL ASIA,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.860
THE TULIP MADE
ITS WAY TO TURKEY.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.200
IT WAS THERE THAT
THIS BEAUTIFUL FLOWER

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.830
BEWITCHED ONE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL MEN IN THE WORLD,

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.930
THE SULTAN OF THE
OTTOMAN EMPIRE.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:16.360
Pollan: THE TURKS AT
VARIOUS TIMES IN HISTORY

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.560
REVERED TULIPS.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.830
SULTAN AHMED III WAS FAMOUS

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.900
FOR HIS LOVE OF TULIPS,

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.500
AND WHEN THEY WERE
IN BLOOM EVERY YEAR,

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.660
THERE WAS A FESTIVAL.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.200
EVERY NIGHT THERE WOULD BE
SOME SORT OF PERFORMANCE

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.600
TO CELEBRATE TULIPS.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.760
IT WAS SO
EXTRAVAGANT, IN FACT,

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.860
THAT THIS HELPED
BRING DOWN THE SULTAN.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.530
McDormand: FOR HIS
SPENDING ON TULIPS

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:43.860
AND OTHER PERCEIVED FAILINGS,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.700
THE SULTAN WAS TOPPLED
FROM HIS THRONE.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:52.230
BUT IT BY THE TULIP.OYALTY
THAT GOT SEDUCED

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:58.600
IN TCOUNTRY TO GO MAD.URY,
THE FLOWER CAUSED A WHOLE

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.760
IT WAS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.030
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:05.560
ACCORDING TO ANY LOGICAL SCHEME

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:10.930
THAT THIS ENTIRE
SOCIETY WENT NUTS.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.200
McDormand: BETWEEN
1634 AND 1637,

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:17.000
TULIPS SWEPT THE DUTCH
INTO A COLLECTIVE FRENZY

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.300
THAT HAS BECOME KNOWN
AS TULIP MANIA.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:25.960
SPURRED ONE OF THE BIGGEST
INVESTMENT BUBBLES IN HISTORY,

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.130
MADE THE TULIP ONE OF THE
MOST VALUABLE COMMODITIES

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.330
IN THE WORLD.

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:33.730
Pollan: IT WAS A PURE FINANCIAL

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.800
AND IT WAS ABOUT A FLOWER! I
MEAN, HOW AMAZING IS THAT?

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.900
McDormand: IT WAS A TIME WHEN
THE DUTCH DOMINATED WORLD TRADE.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.130
AND A LOT OF THEM
WERE GETTING RICH.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:48.900
IT BECAME FASHIONABLE TO
GROW FLOWER GARDENS --

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.500
AND NOTHING SAID
SUCCESS LIKE A TULIP.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.360
Zonneveld: IN THE BEGINNING,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.300
THE RICH PEOPLE IN HOLLAND,

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.430
THEY HAVE BIG HOUSES,

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.400
AND THEY WANT TO
SHOW THEY'RE WEALTHY.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.260
AT THAT TIME, WERE TULIPS.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.700
Pollan: IT REALLY WAS
ABOUT THE DISPLAY OF

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.400
THE EXTRAORDINARY, THE GEM.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.800
AND YOU PICTURE, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF A GRAY, CLOUDY,

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.760
DUTCH SPRING AFTERNOON,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.700
AND THAT COLOR
AGAINST THAT STEEL SKY

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.160
McDormand: FOR THE TULIP,
THE DUTCH FLOWER GARDENS

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.830
OFFERED A CHANCE TO
STRUT ITS STUFF --

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.430
AND NO TULIPS DID
SO MORE DRAMATICALLY

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:33.400
THAN THE TYPE KNOWN
AS BROKEN TULIPS.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.260
THEY WERE EXTREMELY RARE,

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.260
BUT, BACK THEN,
NO ONE KNEW WHY.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.560
Pollan: A BREAK WAS WHEN

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.530
THE BACKGROUND COLOR,
THE SOLID, MATTE,

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.360
SATURATED COLOR OF A TULIP

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.730
GETS A KIND OF FLAME
OF A SECOND COLOR;

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:51.360
THIS WAS CONSIDERED, YOU KNOW,
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TULIP.

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.400
McDormand: THE MOST PRIZED
OF ALL THE BROKEN TULIPS

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:02.400
WAS ONE OF THE RAREST
-- THE SEMPER AUGUSTUS.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.430
Pollan: IT WAS A
BIG, WHITE TULIP

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.560
WITH A SPLASH OF
CARMINE RED ON IT,

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.130
WHICH WAS REALLY,
BY GENERAL ACCOUNT,

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:15.900
CONSIDERED THE GREATEST
TULIP EVER FOUND.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.130
THIS WAS THE EPITOME
OF TULIP BEAUTY

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.260
IN THE EYE OF THE DUTCH.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.100
McDormand: IF YOU
WANTED A SEMPER AUGUSTUS

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.430
YOU'D NEED TO GET YOUR HANDS
ON A SEMPER AUGUSTUS BULB.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:30.100
THAT'S THE PART OF THE TULIP
THAT LIVES BENEATH THE SOIL --

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:32.530
AND PLANTING A BULB
IS THE ONLY WAY

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.060
TO MAKE SURE A TULIP OFFSPRING

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.330
WILL LOOK THE SAME
AS ITS PARENT.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.260
BUT IN 17th-CENTURY HOLLAND,

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:43.760
SEMPER AUGUSTUS BULBS
WERE VERY SCARCE.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:47.600
Man: AT THAT TIME, ONLY
ONE MERCHANT IN AMSTERDAM

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.730
UPON HIM TO SELL A SINGLE BULB,
EVENTUALLY ONE MAN PREVAILED

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.100
WHICH WAS VALUED AT THE
TIME AT 10,000 FLORINS.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.760
THIS WAS AT A TIME WHEN
THE AVERAGE DUTCH WORKER

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.060
WOULD SURVIVE WITH HIS FAMILY
FOR A YEAR ON ABOUT 300.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.760
AND THE FACT THAT SUCH
SALES WERE BEING MADE

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.660
AND FOR SUCH COLOSSAL
SUMS OF MONEY

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.400
GRADUALLY BECAME
MORE WIDELY KNOWN,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.430
AND THIS REALLY WAS
THE FOUNDATION STONE

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:14.630
OF WHAT BECAME THE TULIP MANIA.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:18.630
Pollan: AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE TULIP MANIA,

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:23.760
ONE TULIP SOLD FOR AN AMOUNT
EQUIVALENT TO THE PRICE

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.660
OF ONE OF THE GRANDEST
CANAL HOUSES IN AMSTERDAM.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.630
NOW, JUST TO PUT IT IN
CONTEMPORARY TERMS,

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:35.660
THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO, SAY,
A TOWNHOUSE ON 5th AVENUE.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:46.100
$10 MILLION TO $15 MILLION
FOR A SINGLE TULIP BULB.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:51.300
McDormand: THE TULIP BULB MARKET
HIT ITS PEAK IN FEBRUARY 1637.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.430
THERE WERE 40 MILLION
GUILDERS' WORTH

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:56.130
OF TULIP DEALS OUTSTANDING,

00:43:56.130 --> 00:44:00.960
MORE THAN SIX TIMES THE
TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.730
Pollan: THERE WAS AN AUCTION
HELD IN THE WINTER OF 1637,

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.730
AND SOME GREAT TULIP WAS PUT ON
THE MARKET AT A CERTAIN PRICE.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:13.630
AND IT DIDN'T GET THAT PRICE.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:17.200
AND THE AUCTIONEER OFFERED
1,000 GUILDERS LESS,

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.200
1,000 GUILDERS BELOW THAT,

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:28.330
AND NOBODY BID.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.230
Woman: THE FLOWERS
WERE VERY OVERVALUED.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.630
PEOPLE WERE RISKING FORTUNES,

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:40.830
AND OF COURSE THE WHOLE THING
CAME CRASHING DOWN AT ONCE.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.830
Pollan: AND, SO VERY
SOON AFTER THAT,

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.130
ALL THESE TULIPS
WERE WORTHLESS,

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.430
AND ALL THESE
PEOPLE WERE RUINED.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:52.300
THEY HAD PUT THERE
FORTUNES IN THESE FLOWERS,

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.430
AND NOW THEY WERE WORTHLESS --

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.460
THEY WERE JUST BULBS OF PLANTS.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:01.930
AND THAT WAS THE END
OF THE TULIP MANIA.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:06.200
McDormand: SUDDENLY, THE FLOWER
THAT WAS LOVED FOR ITS BEAUTY

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.500
BECAME A SYMBOL OF HUMAN FOLLY.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.230
Pollan: THERE WAS A PERIOD OF

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.760
TULIP HATRED IN HOLLAND
AFTER THE COLLAPSE,

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.960
BECAUSE IT WAS BLAMED FOR
THIS ECONOMIC DISASTER.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.230
THERE WAS A FAMOUS
PROFESSOR IN LEIDEN

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.360
WHO'D RUN AROUND WITH
A STICK BEATING TULIPS

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.500
AND THERE WERE ALL THESE
PAMPHLETS AND BROADSIDES

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.730
ABOUT THE EVILS
OF THE TULIP MANIA

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.860
AND THE GREAT
WHORE GODDESS FLORA

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.260
WHO WAS BLAMED FOR
BRINGING THE DUTCH DOWN,

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.830
AS IF, YOU KNOW, IT WAS THE
FLOWER THAT DID IT TO THEM.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.230
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
HISTORICAL EPISODE,

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.860
AND WE LOOK BACK AND WE
LOOK DOWN, AND WE SAY,

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:47.100
HOW COULD THEY DO THIS? BUT
OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.430
AND IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
WHAT YOU'RE TRADING --

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.730
AS LONG AS THE PRICE
IS GOING UP REALLY FAST,
EVERYBODY WANTS IN.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.860
AND AS LONG AS THERE'S
A GREATER FOOL,

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:58.260
A LOT OF MONEY CAN BE MADE.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.300
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.460
HOLDING THE BAG OR THE
BULB AT THE END OF IT.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.200
McDormand: WHAT NONE
OF THE RUINED INVESTORS

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.800
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN
WAS THAT THE BREAKS IN COLOR

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.060
THEY SAW AS THE
EPITOME OF BEAUTY

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:12.430
WERE ACTUALLY CAUSED BY A VIRUS.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.230
THE TULIP BULBS THAT SOLD FOR

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:16.900
THE PRICE OF 5th
AVENUE TOWNHOUSES

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.060
TURNED OUT TO BE DAMAGED GOODS.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.660
Stewart: WELL,
THIS IS SOMETHING

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.900
THAT NOBODY UNDERSTOOD
AT THE TIME --

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.630
I MEAN, NO ONE IN THE
1600s AND THE 1700s

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:27.560
HAD ANY NOTION OF
PLANT DISEASES,

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.100
OR ANY IDEA THAT THE
VARIATION IN A FLOWER

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:35.430
COULD BE CAUSED BY
SOMETHING LIKE A DISEASE.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.160
McDormand: TODAY,
VIRUSES LIKE THE ONE

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.000
THAT ONCE DROVE THE TULIP'S
VALUE TO RECORD HEIGHTS

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.100
ARE THE ENEMY OF THE
GLOBAL TULIP TRADE,

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.360
BECAUSE INFECTED BULBS
CANNOT BE EXPORTED.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:50.030
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGISTS LIKE
HENK GUDE ARE WORKING HARD

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:51.400
TO COMBAT THEM.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.130
Gude: A TULIP THAT IS
INFECTED WITH A VIRUS

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:56.530
IS NOT A HEALTHY TULIP --

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.660
IT COSTS LOTS OF
ENERGY FOR THE PLANT

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.560
TO COPE WITH THE VIRUS.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:05.730
AND IF YOU REPLANT THE
BULB YEAR AFTER YEAR,

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:09.900
THEN ITS GROWING POTENTIAL
WILL DECLINE OVER THE YEARS.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:14.160
SO, IN A FEW YEARS, YOU
WILL NOT HAVE A TULIP LEFT.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.660
McDormand: GUDE WORKS FOR

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.830
THE APPLIED PLANT
RESEARCH CENTER

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.030
AT WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY
IN THE NETHERLANDS.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:23.630
Gude: TO FIND OUT IF A PLANT IS

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:27.800
INFECTED BY A VIRUS, WE
HAVE TO HOMOGENIZE IT,

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.700
TO SQUEEZE JUICE FROM IT,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.200
AND WE CAN DETECT THE PRESENCE

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.560
OF THE VIRUS IN THE JUICE

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.830
WITH LAB TECHNIQUES.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.530
WHEN WE UNDERSTAND
HOW THE PLANT GROWS,

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:44.330
WE CAN TRY TO MAKE THE PLANT DO

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:46.800
WHAT WE WANT IT TO DO --

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.560
AND IMMEDIATELY APPLY IT

00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:52.700
FOR THE BENEFIT OF GROWERS
AND BREEDERS AND EXPORTERS.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.860
McDormand: ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE IS JAN LIGTHART,

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:59.100
WHO HAS BEEN GROWING TULIPS
FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.030
AND HAS BECOME ONE OF HOLLAND'S
MOST SUCCESSFUL BREEDERS.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:07.460
Ligthart: WHAT YOU
SEE FROM HERE TO THERE

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:09.130
IS ALL NEW SEEDLINGS.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.960
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I SEE THEM FLOWERING.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.800
I WANTED TO BE A CARPENTER,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.460
JUST LIKE MY FATHER,
WORKING WITH WOOD.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:25.430
AND WHEN I SAW THE
TULIPS, I WAS ASTONISHED.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:29.000
I SAID, AH! THAT'S
WHAT I WANT TO BE!

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.400
TULIP GARDENER.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.730
McDormand: LIGTHART'S FIRST
STEP IN BREEDING A NEW VARIETY

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.130
IS TO ACT LIKE A
HUMAN BUMBLEBEE,

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:42.400
MOVING POLLEN FROM
ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:46.560
Ligthart: THE PROCESS
IS QUITE SIMPLE.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:49.130
WE USE ONE TULIP AS THE FATHER

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:52.960
AND THE OTHER JUST
LIKE THE MOTHER.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.430
AND WE MAKE POLLINATION.

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.930
Pollan: THE BREEDERS
OF TULIPS TODAY

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.560
ARE INTERESTED IN
NEW COMBINATIONS.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.300
THEY'RE SEX CRAZY, RIGHT?

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.500
THEY'RE OPERATING THESE,
YOU KNOW, PLANT BROTHELS.

00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.900
AND OUT OF THAT COMES A
GREAT DEAL OF VARIATION.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:13.800
AND OUT OF THAT VARIATION IS
THE FUTURE OF THE SPECIES.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.960
McDormand: DABBING THE POLLEN
TAKES JUST A FEW SECONDS.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.560
BUT IT CAN TAKE YEARS
BEFORE LIGTHART CAN BE SURE

00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:22.800
THAT HIS NEW VARIETY WILL
CONSISTENTLY PRODUCE FLOWERS

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.400
WITH THE QUALITIES
THE MARKET DEMANDS --

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:29.330
LIKE DURABILITY, DISEASE
RESISTANCE, AND BEAUTY.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:30.930
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:34.260
Ligthart: ONE OF THE
THOUSAND SEEDLINGS

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.030
ARE WHAT I WANT.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:40.860
THE REST IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.030
THAT'S THE HARDEST PART.

00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.530
YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUT

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.330
FOR THE FIRST,
THE ONLY GOOD ONE.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:51.000
McDormand: THIS YEAR,
LIGTHART IS PINNING HIS HOPES

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.830
ON THE BULBS FROM ONE OF HIS
LATEST BREEDING EXPERIMENTS.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.060
THIS TULIP, THAT
IS MY FAVORITE.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:07.330
I GIVE IT A BIG FUTURE.

00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.000
JUST THE RIGHT COLOR.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.700
PURE PINK.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:20.400
NINEFOR THE FIRST TIME,DS.
WHEN I SAW THIS TULIP BLOOMING

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.360
IN MY SEEDLINGS,
I WAS JUST AMAZED.

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.760
I SAT THERE ON MY KNEES

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:37.100
AND LOOKED AT THEM
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.300
OTHER TULIPS, YOU WALK BY

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:43.500
AND IT DOESN'T VENTURE
TO DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:48.300
AND WHEN YOU SEE THIS ONE,
YOUR HEART GETS... CK-CK!

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.330
THIS MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:56.530
EACH TIME I LOOK AT IT...

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:02.760
I FELL IN LOVE ON THE TULIP.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:06.000
[ ENGINE PUTTERING ]

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.030
McDormand: BUT LIGTHART'S LOVE
FOR HIS TULIPS DOESN'T STOP HIM

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.500
AND HIS FAMILY FROM
RIPPING THE FLOWERS

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.230
OFF THEIR STALKS EVERY SPRING.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.860
THE FLOWERS WOULD DIVERT
NUTRIENTS FROM THE BULBS,

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.960
WHICH, FOR A BREEDER
LIKE LIGTHART,

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.500
ARE WHAT BRINGS IN THE MONEY.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.660
Ligthart: WHAT I WANT
TO DO FOR A TULIP

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:28.360
IS TO CREATE A MUCH BIGGER
MARKET FOR THE WHOLE WORLD.

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:32.260
BECAUSE A TULIP MUST MAKE MONEY.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.060
IT'S A BUSINESS.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.260
YOU CAN'T HAVE THEM FOR FUN

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:42.930
BECAUSE WE HAVE
TO MAKE A LIVING.

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.560
McDormand: LIGTHART'S

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.560
OFTEN GET INTRODUCED TO THE

AND THERE ARE PEOPLE IN HOLLAND

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.730

OFF OF TULIPS YET AGAIN.

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:37.960

BECAUSE THERE ARE A MILLION

AT ALARMOF FLOWERS.SPEEDS.
AND IT IS LIKE A SEA

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.560
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WATCHING PAINT
BEING MIXED ON A PALETTE.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:30.030

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:03.800
WITH A VERY SIMPLE PURPOSE --

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.360
TO MOVE FLOWERS FROM

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.360
JUST LIKE OUR OWN, NOT
EVERYONE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL,

00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.730
OR SWEET.

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:15.900
BUT EVEN A LOWLY WEED CAN
GET US TO WORK FOR IT,

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.930
AND QUITE SLAVISHLY, AT THAT,

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:20.730
IF IT'S CLEVER ENOUGH
TO CASH IN ON A SKILL

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:22.600
THAT EVERY PLANT IS BORN WITH --

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.960
ITS ABILITY TO MAKE CHEMICALS.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.000
Pollan: THE GENIUS OF PLANTS

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.500
IS REALLY THE ARTS
OF BIOCHEMISTRY,

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.730
CREATING THESE
REALLY INTERESTING,

00:56:32.730 --> 00:56:34.800
COMPLICATED,
ORIGINAL MOLECULES.

00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:38.460
SOME ARE DESIGNED
TO PRODUCE FLAVORS.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:42.200
OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO
PRODUCE GREAT BEAUTY.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:46.030
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT
THIS CLASS OF PLANTS

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:49.200
THAT IS PRODUCING
THESE MOLECULES

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.560
THAT, INCREDIBLY,
HAVE THE POWER

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:54.230
TO ALTER WHAT GOES
ON IN THE HUMAN MIND.

00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:58.660
McDormand: THIS PLANT, BY
MAKING JUST SUCH A MOLECULE,

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:02.430
HAS ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.730
SCIENTISTS CALL IT CANNABIS.

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:07.000
IT IS BETTER KNOWN AS MARIJUANA.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.630
Pollan: CANNABIS RECOGNIZED,
METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING,

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:13.830
THAT THIS WAS ITS PATH
TO WORLD DOMINATION.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.130
PRODUCE MORE OF THIS MOLECULE,

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.900
AND THERE WILL BE
MORE MARIJUANA PLANTS

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.500
GIVEN MORE HABITAT BY
THIS CREATURE WHO LIKES

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.760
WHAT THIS MOLECULE SEEMS TO DO.

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.400
McDormand: AND BY
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.330
JUST HOW THAT MOLECULE WORKS,

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:31.000
SCIENTISTS STUMBLED ON
AN AMAZING DISCOVERY

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.400
ABOUT THE WORKINGS
OF OUR BRAINS.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.830
Pollan: THIS PLANT HAS OPENED UP

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.460
THIS VERY FRUITFUL
PATH OF INQUIRY

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.430
INTO UNDERSTANDING
HOW MEMORY WORKS,

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.830
HOW CONSCIOUSNESS WORKS,
HOW EMOTION WORKS.

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:46.100
WE HAVE UNLOCKED
THIS WHOLE MECHANISM

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:49.930
AND WE WOULD NOT KNOW EXISTED,
IF NOT FOR THIS PLANT.

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:54.060
Man: HUMAN BEINGS ARE
BORN WITH AN INNATE DRIVE

00:57:54.060 --> 00:58:00.400
TO EXPERIENCE OTHER STATES OF
CONSCIOUSNESS PERIODICALLY.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.200
I THINK YOU CAN SEE
THIS IN YOUNG KIDS,

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.500
WHO BEGIN SPINNING
AT EARLY AGES.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.660
AMUSEMENT PARK RIDES
SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.830
THERE'S AN ENDLESS
STREAM OF ACTIVITIES

00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:18.300
THAT CAN SHIFT CONSCIOUSNESS
-- EVERYTHING FROM SINGING,

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.760
DANCING, HAVING SEX,
JUMPING OUT OF AIRPLANES.

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:25.200
AND DRUGS ARE CLEARLY ONE WAY
OF GETTING THESE EXPERIENCES.

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:30.860
Man: PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE
THAT ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.530
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S
GOOD, BUT IT'S --

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:39.300
INDIVIDUALS SEEK IT OUT.

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.530
Weil: MARIJUANA
SEEMS TO HAVE MADE

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.460
AN EVOLUTIONARY DECISION
LONG AGO THAT IT WAS

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.630
GOING TO THROW ITS LOT
IN WITH HUMAN BEINGS.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:48.860
FROM THE PLANT'S
POINT OF VIEW,

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.560
THE PSYCHOACTIVITY IS AN
ATTRACTIVE CHARACTERISTIC

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.430
WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE
PLANT GREAT SUCCESS.

00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:58.900
THERE'S A LOT MORE MARIJUANA
BEING GROWN TODAY,

00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.900
AND THE REASON IS
THAT HUMANS LIKE IT.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:04.060
THEY LIKE IT BECAUSE
IT GETS THEM HIGH.

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:08.160
McDormand: BUT CANNABIS
CAN ALSO GET THEM

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.460
LOCKED UP.

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:15.530
750,000 ARRESTS A YEAR
FOR CANNABIS POSSESSION.

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:18.800
MAKES IT ABOUT THIRD
AMONG ALL CRIMES.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.230
AND SO YOU'VE GOT
25,000 OR 30,000

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.660
PEOPLE BEHIND BARS
AT ANY ONE TIME

00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:26.230
FOR CANNABIS OFFENSES.

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:29.400
McDormand: BUT
MARIJUANA STILL ENTICES

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.930
NEARLY 15 MILLION AMERICANS

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:34.230
TO SMOKE IT EVERY MONTH.

00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:38.400
AND NEARLY 100
MILLION HAVE TRIED IT.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.700
TO KEEP UP WITH THAT DEMAND,

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:45.560
CANNABIS GROWERS CATER TO
THE PLANT'S EVERY WHIM...

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.060
Man: WE'RE GOING TO LOSE
THAT TAP, AREN'T WE?

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:52.030
McDormand: PAMPERING IT
LIKE A SPOILED CHILD.

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:53.900
Man: WE DO ANYTHING
IT TELLS US TO.

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.260
IF THE PLANT SAYS
IT WANTS SOMETHING,

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:58.460
WE LISTEN AND WE GIVE IT TO IT.

00:59:58.460 --> 00:59:59.860
AND THAT'S THE WHOLE THING --

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.930
LISTENING CAREFULLY -- AND
WE'RE LISTENING ALL THE TIME

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:04.460
AND OBSERVING ALL THE TIME.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.930
WE WORK FOR THEM.

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.530
McDormand: THIS MAN AND
WOMAN LIVE IN A STATE

01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:12.530
WHERE GROWING MARIJUANA
FOR MEDICAL USE IS LEGAL.

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.960
WE AGREED TO CONCEAL
THEIR IDENTITIES,

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:19.200
BECAUSE THEY STILL RISK
PROSECUTION UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.360
Woman: YEAH, THAT'S A BEAUTY.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.130
McDormand: BUT WHATEVER
THE LEGAL RISKS,

01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:24.660
THE HORTICULTURAL
CHALLENGES THEY FACE

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.960
WOULD BE FAMILIAR TO
ANY FARMER OR GARDENER.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.030
Woman: IT'S A DAILY EFFORT,

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:32.260
AND THERE ARE THINGS LIKE,

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.560
OH, DID WE
OVER-NUTRIATE THE WATER?

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:39.560
DID WE UNDER-NUTRIATE
THE WATER?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.600
EVERYTHING HAS REALLY
TIGHT PARAMETERS,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.900
AND WE TRY TO KEEP AS TIGHT
AS CONTROL AS POSSIBLE,

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:46.260
BUT IT'S -- IT'S A BATTLE.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:51.260
Man: MY ASSOCIATE IS
REALLY THE GREEN THUMB

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:52.600
IN THIS ENTERPRISE.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.460
AND I'VE NOTICED THAT WHEN SHE'S

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.530
NOT AROUND FOR A
COUPLE OF DAYS,

01:00:58.530 --> 01:00:59.330
THE PLANTS KNOW IT.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.060
I MEAN, I'M NOT
MAKING THAT UP.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:05.030
I MEAN, I ALMOST HEAR THEM
WHISPERING, WHERE IS SHE?

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.260
THEY DON'T DO AS
WELL, YOU KNOW,

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:13.400
McDormand: STRANGE AS IT MAY
SEEM, THESE CANNABIS GROWERS

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.130
ARE PART OF A VERY
LONG TRADITION.

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:19.630
Weil: IN EVERY CULTURE AND
IN EVERY AGE OF HISTORY,

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:23.230
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF
HUMAN ENERGY HAS GONE INTO

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:27.300
THE PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION,
AND CONSUMPTION

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.760
OF PSYCHOACTIVE PLANTS.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.130
Man: THE ONLY SOCIETY
THAT WE KNOW OF

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:36.030
FOR WHOM THERE IS
NO NATIVE INTOXICANT

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:39.130
ARE THE INUITS, AND
THAT'S SIMPLY BECAUSE

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:43.430
NOTHING GROWS UP THERE
THAT THEY COULD USE.

01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:45.730
Weil: IN ALMOST EVERY SOCIETY,

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:49.330
ONE OR TWO OR A SMALL
NUMBER OF INTOXICANTS

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:51.900
ARE ACCEPTED -- AND
NOT ONLY ACCEPTED,

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.630
BUT THEIR USE IS
ACTIVELY PROMOTED --

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:57.400
AND THE REST ARE CONDEMNED.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.530
BUT THERE'S NO AGREEMENT
FROM CULTURE TO CULTURE

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:02.930
AS TO WHICH ARE THE GOOD ONES
AND WHICH ARE THE BAD ONES.

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:06.030
Pollan: SO YOU HAVE ALCOHOL,

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:08.660
WHICH IS AN EVERYDAY DRUG
USED IN OUR SOCIETY --

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:11.800
THAT HAS A TABOO ON
IT IN ISLAMIC SOCIETY.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:16.200
McDormand: AND THOUGH
CANNABIS IS ILLEGAL
IN MOST PLACES TODAY,

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.860
MANY CULTURES THROUGHOUT
HISTORY HAVE TOLERATED IT.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.930
FROM THE TIME THE PLANT
WAS FIRST DISCOVERED

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:25.700
IN INDIA AND CHINA
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO,

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:30.600
PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT AS MORE
THAN JUST AN INTOXICANT.

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.400
LONG BEFORE THE
DISCOVERY OF ASPIRIN,

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.830
CANNABIS WAS USED AS
A MEDICAL TREATMENT

01:02:36.830 --> 01:02:39.400
FOR RELIEVING PAIN.

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:41.200
DEALING WITH PAIN -- YOU KNOW,

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.460
THAT'S A TREMENDOUS
PART OF HUMAN LIFE.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:48.260
AND IT WAS A BIGGER PART
BEFORE MODERN TIMES.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.730
WE DIDN'T HAVE MANY PAINKILLERS.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:53.160
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANTIBIOTICS.

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:56.330
AND A LOT OF INTOXICANTS,
EVEN IF THEY DON'T

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:58.630
DIMINISH PAIN, THE
WAY OPIUM DOES,

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:00.230
THEY TAKE YOUR MIND OFF IT.

01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:01.830
AND THAT'S VERY,
VERY IMPORTANT.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.360
McDormand: IN
19th-CENTURY AMERICA,

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.800
CANNABIS WAS A POPULAR
TREATMENT FOR CONDITIONS

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.900
SUCH AS LABOR PAINS,
ASTHMA, AND RHEUMATISM.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.630
Pollan: YOU COULD WALK
INTO ANY DRUG STORE

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.600
IN AMERICA AND BUY
TINCTURES OF CANNABIS.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:21.530
CANNABIS WAS INCLUDED IN ALL
SORTS OF MEDICAL PREPARATIONS.

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.300
McDormand: BUT EVERYTHING WOULD
CHANGE IN THE 20th CENTURY,

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.230
WHEN THE PLANT GOT ITS
NEW NAME, MARIJUANA.

01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:33.830
TWAS A POPULAR
INTOXICANT. WHERE CANNABIS

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:35.630
IN FACT, PANCHO
VILLA'S REBEL ARMY

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:37.630
SANG A MARCHING SONG
ABOUT A COCKROACH

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:48.500
WHO FUELED HIMSELF
WITH MARIJUANA.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.600
DURING THE 1920s,
MANY MEXICANS

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.600
IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.730
AND SOME BROUGHT THE CUSTOM

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:57.930
OF MARIJUANA SMOKING WITH THEM.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:00.100
Man: CANNABIS WAS CERTAINLY

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.800
MORE COMMON AMONG
MEXICAN AMERICANS,

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:05.100
AND TO SOME EXTENT,
AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.460
IN THE '20s AND '30s
THAN IT WAS AMONG WHITES.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.960
I MEAN, YOU'D FIND IT,
YOU KNOW, VERY POPULAR

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.600
IN THE MUSIC SCENE
IN NEW ORLEANS,

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.000
VERY POPULAR AMONG AFRICAN
AMERICAN MUSICIANS.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.730
THE JAZZ WORLD WAS REALLY
SOAKED IN CANNABIS.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:20.600
McDormand: THE GREAT
LOUIS ARMSTRONG

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.760
FELT MARIJUANA ENHANCED
HIS ABILITY TO IMPROVISE.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.830
[ PLAYING JAZZ ]

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:28.530
Pollan: CANNABIS
PROPOSES THIS IDEA

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:32.400
OF TIME STOPPING,
BEING ABLE TO EXPLORE

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:36.600
THE PRESENT MOMENT -- FORGET
THE PAST, FORGET THE FUTURE,

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:45.830
JUST BE THERE AND SEE
WHAT YOU CAN COME UP WITH.

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:48.060
EVEN IF IT'S A
SONG YOU'VE PLAYED

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:51.230
A MILLION TIMES
BEFORE, IT BECOMES NEW,

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:53.400
STRANGE, WONDERFUL.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:05:00.700
YOU SEE NEW POSSIBILITIES IN
IT THAT WEREN'T THERE BEFORE.

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:06.530
McDormand: IN THE 1960s,
USE OF MARIJUANA SOARED.

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.160
THE DRUG HAD BEEN ILLEGAL
FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:13.630
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP AN ENTIRE
GENERATION FROM EMBRACING IT.

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:16.500
Pollan: IT WAS WELL SUITED

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.360
TO THE SPIRIT OF THAT TIME.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.160
YOU KNOW, EVERY DRUG
HAS ITS CHARACTER,

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.800
IS NOT ABOUT BEING HYPER
AND WORKING REALLY HARD.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:31.600
IT IS A DRUG THAT MAKES
YOU NOT WANT TO STRIVE.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.500
IT'S ABOUT KICKING BACK,
LISTENING TO MUSIC.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.800
SO IT JUST KIND OF FIT
THE SPIRIT OF THE '60s.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.730
Man: MARIJUANA SEEMS
TO SECOND THE MOTION,

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.330
NO MATTER WHAT THE MOTION IS.

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:49.260
McDormand: TO MANY AMERICANS,

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.100
THE FACT THAT MILLIONS
OF YOUNG PEOPLE

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:52.130
WERE SMOKING MARIJUANA

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.960
WERE SMOKING MARIJUANA

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.400
THREATENED THE VERY
FABRIC OF SOCIETY.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.130
THOSE FEARS PROMPTED
THE GOVERNMENT

01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:59.660
TO TAKE ACTION.

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:01.960
Narrator: OPERATION INTERCEPT
IS DESIGNED TO MAKE IT

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.330
MORE DIFFICULT TO
BRING MARIJUANA

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:07.360
McDormand: MOST
OF THE MARIJUANA WAS
COMING IN FROM MEXICO,

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.630
AND THE PLANT SOON FOUND
ITSELF UNDER ATTACK.

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:14.900
THE WEAPON -- A TOXIC
CHEMICAL CALLED PARAQUAT.

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.330
Pollan: WE HAVE
TO REMEMBER THAT IN THE
EVOLUTION OF A SPECIES,

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:20.500
EVERYTHING COUNTS AS A
FACTOR OF NATURAL SELECTION,

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.630
INCLUDING THINGS
LIKE, OH, THE DECISION

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:25.530
BY THE UNITED STATES
GOVERNMENT IN THE '70s

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.030
TO PRESSURE MEXICO TO SPRAY

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:29.000
HERBICIDE ON THEIR POT FIELDS.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.430
McDormand: FROM 1975
TO 1983, MEXICAN PILOTS

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:36.500
DOUSED THE COUNTRY'S CANNABIS
FIELDS WITH THE POISON.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.930
Pollan: THERE WAS SOME
CONCERN THAT IT WOULD

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:41.630
GET INTO THE
PRODUCT COMING NORTH

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.830
IF IT WAS CUT RIGHT
AFTER IT WAS SPRAYED,

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:46.030
AND THAT, AS PEOPLE
INHALED THIS, IT PROBABLY

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:46.900
WASN'T VERY GOOD FOR YOU.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.330
Man: THIS IS A DRUG-TESTING LAB

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.700
IN PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:51.760
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE RECEIVING

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.130
300 SAMPLES OF MARIJUANA
A DAY FROM SMOKERS

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:57.700
WHO WANT TO KNOW IF THEIR
POT IS CONTAMINATED.

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.060
Man: PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.400
ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM,

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.430
AND FRANKLY, I
DON'T BLAME THEM.

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.830
McDormand: MEXICAN MARIJUANA

01:07:04.830 --> 01:07:07.300
BEGAN TO DEVELOP
A VERY BAD NAME.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.660
Pollan: THIS HAD THE
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.360
OF CREATING A DOMESTIC
MARIJUANA INDUSTRY

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.660
THAT HADN'T REALLY
EXISTED BEFORE.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.300
McDormand: IT WAS CONCENTRATED

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.500
IN CALIFORNIA, HAWAII,
AND OTHER STATES

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.000
WHOSE CLIMATE WAS FAVORABLE
FOR THE TROPICAL PLANT.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.160
Pollan: ONCE THIS AMERICAN
MARIJUANA AGRICULTURE

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.530
GOT STARTED, IT WAS
VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL,

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:32.130
AND THE GOVERNMENT WAS KIND
OF SHOCKED TO FIND ONE YEAR

01:07:32.130 --> 01:07:34.100
THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT SEIZED

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:37.700
EXCEEDED THEIR ESTIMATE OF
THE TOTAL SIZE OF THE CROP.

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.060
AND THEY REALIZED, OOH, I
THINK WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING.

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.800
THERE MUST BE A LOT MORE
MARIJUANA OUT THERE.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.330
AND INDEED, THERE WAS,
ALL OVER THE WEST COAST.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:49.730
McDormand: THE GOVERNMENT
DISPATCHED HELICOPTERS

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.460
TO FIND THE FIELDS AND FORCE
THE GROWERS OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.560
Man: WHEN LOCAL AND
FEDERAL AGENTS RAIDED

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:57.360
THIS MARIJUANA FIELD IN
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TODAY,

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.830
THEY FOUND MORE
THAN $50,000 WORTH

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.230
OF MARIJUANA READY
TO BE HARVESTED.

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:04.900
A TASK FORCE IS WAGING AN
ALL-OUT WAR AGAINST POT.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.330
Pollan: SO, WITH THE RISE
OF THE DRUG WAR, IN A WAY,

01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:09.130
YOU'VE GOT A THREAT
TO THIS PLANT.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.700
AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO SEE

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.000
HOW THE PLANT COPED.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.900
McDormand: CANNABIS,
AS PLANTS SO OFTEN DO,

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.100
FOUND A WAY NOT ONLY
TO SURVIVE THE THREAT,

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.260
BUT TO COME OUT AHEAD.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:22.660
Pollan: AND WHAT HAPPENED?

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:25.530
WELL, THE GROWERS
AND THE PLANT

01:08:25.530 --> 01:08:28.200
ADAPTED -- THEY MOVED INDOORS.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:30.560
THE PROBLEM WITH
MOVING INDOORS IS,

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.400
THIS IS A 12-FOOT-TALL PLANT.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.130
SO WHAT THEY NEEDED WERE

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.630
THE GENES OF A
SHORTER CANNABIS PLANT

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:40.330
TO BREED WITH THEIR TALL PLANT.

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:43.630
McDormand: SO THE
PIONEERS OF INDOOR GROWING

01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:47.930
CROSS-BRED THE TALL
WARM-WEATHER SPECIES,
CANNABIS SATIVA,

01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:53.330
WITH A LOW-GROWING MOUNTAIN
SPECIES FOUND MOSTLY IN ASIA,

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:57.630
Pollan: THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER
THESE TWO GREAT STRAINS

01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:58.760
IN THE MARIJUANA FAMILY

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:04.200
AND CREATED A PLANT THAT WAS
SHORT, FAST, AND STRONG.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.000
Lenson: THE PLANT,
WHICH HAD ONCE

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.800
BEEN A SKINNY LITTLE
PIECE OF DITCH WEED,

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.930
IS NOW A PAMPERED,
SPECTACULARLY GOOD-LOOKING,

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:18.000
MULTI-COLORED, RICH,
RESINOUS BEING.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
HARDLY THE SPECIES
IT WAS BEFORE AT ALL.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.400
IT'S TURNED COMPLETELY
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.960
McDormand: NURTURED BY
CREATIVE INDOOR GARDENERS,

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.460
CANNABIS IS NOW A
FAR MORE POTENT PLANT

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:32.960
THAN IT WAS A GENERATION AGO.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.530
THE KEY TO THAT TRANSFORMATION
WAS STRIPPING AWAY

01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:40.360
THE RULE OF NATURE AND
REPLACING IT WITH OUR OWN.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.800
Man: IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL
ENVIRONMENT,

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.730
COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL.

01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:47.160
EVERYTHING ABOUT
OUR NATURAL WORLD

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.060
IS UNNATURAL, EVERYTHING.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.100
Woman: IT'S REALLY
LIKE A SUPER-PLANT.

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.100
Man: IN THE NATURAL WORLD,
THE PLANTS HERE WOULD BE

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.860
SIX TO NINE MONTHS
FROM SEED TO HARVEST.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.830
THAT'S JUST SIMPLY INEFFICIENT.

01:09:59.830 --> 01:10:02.630
YOU COULDN'T
JUSTIFY AN OPERATION

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.460
WITH SUCH A SLOW TURNAROUND.

01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:07.630
SO, INSTEAD OF SIX TO
NINE MONTHS, IN MY WORLD,

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:11.560
THESE PLANTS LIVE THEIR
ENTIRE LIFE CYCLE IN 90 DAYS.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.400
McDormand: TO GET
THEM TO DO THAT,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.830
TO PRECISELY CONTROLLED
AMOUNTS OF NUTRIENTS, WATER,

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:24.930
Pollan: THEY'RE UNDER LIGHTS
THAT ARE BLINDINGLY BRIGHT,

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.800
THOUSANDS OF WATTS,
24 HOURS A DAY.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:29.530
AND THESE PLANTS
ARE JUST, LIKE,

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.530
SOAKING UP THIS LIGHT
-- THEY LOVE IT.

01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:35.000
I MEAN, THEY'RE JUST BATHING
IN LIGHT AND GROWING SO FAST,

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.700
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THE
CREAK OF THEIR CELLS

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.360
AS THEY STRETCH AND DIVIDE.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.300
McDormand: ALL THAT
LIGHT GENERATES

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.160
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HEAT.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.060
Man: IF I DIDN'T
HAVE AIR CONDITIONING

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.430
AND AIR CIRCULATION
AND VENTILATION FANS

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:52.360
MOVING THE HEAT
OUT OF THAT ROOM,

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.930
THESE PLANTS WOULD COOK
IN A MATTER OF HOURS.

01:10:54.930 --> 01:11:00.400
IT'S SO COMPLICATED, WE'RE
NOT SMART ENOUGH TO DO IT.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.700
WE HAVE TO HAVE A
FULL-TIME ELECTRONIC NANNY

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:07.060
WATCHING THE PLANTS
ALL THE TIME.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.630
SO THESE AREN'T NORMAL PLANTS.

01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:11.660
THESE ARE SUPER-HYPER PLANTS

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:15.800
THAT ARE RIGHT ON THE
EDGE AT ALL TIMES.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.360
McDormand: IT'S NOT
JUST A QUICKER HARVEST

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.230
THE GROWERS ARE AFTER,

01:11:19.230 --> 01:11:22.860
BUT A BIGGER BUD
AND A STRONGER HIGH.

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.200
TO ACHIEVE THAT,

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.400
THEY INTERFERE WITH
THE NATURAL PROCESS.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.830
FEMALE MARIJUANA PLANTS
PRODUCE A STICKY RESIN

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:35.660
THAT CATCHES THE POLLEN
THAT MALE PLANTS PRODUCE.

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:39.400
THAT RESIN IS HIGHLY
PSYCHOACTIVE.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.930
TO TRICK THE FEMALES
INTO MAKING MORE OF IT,

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:47.760
THE GROWERS KEEP MALE PLANTS
EXILED FROM THE GROW ROOM.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:51.700
Man: SO, IN ESSENCE,
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.600
IS EXTREME SEXUAL FRUSTRATION.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.900
THIS IS A ROOM FULL OF WOMEN

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:59.100
WHO ARE LOOKING FOR
SOME GUY TO COME BY

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:03.160
AND GIVE THEM SOME POLLEN
SO THEY CAN CREATE SEEDS.

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.660
AND THEY TRY HARDER AND
HARDER AS TIME PASSES,

01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:09.060
AND THE MORE
UNSUCCESSFUL THEY ARE,

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:12.260
THE MORE THE PRODUCTION
OF THE RESINS

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.200
THAT IS INTENDED
TO ATTRACT POLLEN

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.960
INCREASE, AND THAT INCREASES

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:23.230
THE PSYCHOACTIVE
ELEMENTS OF THE PLANT.

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:27.160
Pollan: THEY ARE THE BEST
GARDENERS OF MY GENERATION,

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.800
I REALIZED AT A CERTAIN POINT.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.030
YOU KNOW, THE BEST
GARDENERS OF MY GENERATION

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:34.500
ARE NOT HYBRIDIZING
ROSES, ARE NOT, YOU KNOW,

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.860
THEY'RE WORKING WITH THIS
INCREDIBLY VALUABLE,

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.060
INCREDIBLY INTERESTING
PLANT CALLED CANNABIS.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.630
Woman: IF THIS TURNS
INTO ANYTHING GOOD,

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:41.760
THOUGH, LOOK AT IT, I MEAN,

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.300
THIS IS HOW THICK THE STALK IS

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.600
WHEN IT'S JUST GONE TO BLOOM.

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.530
IT'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL
SHAPE. IT IS NICE.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.800
Pollan: I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.000
THIS THING'S A
WEED. IT'S A WEED.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.130
IT'S A WEED THAT'S WORTH, YOU
KNOW, IN THE OPEN MARKET,

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:57.430
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
$6,000, $7,000 A POUND.

01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:59.460
PRETTY GOOD FOR A WEED, HUH?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.700
McDormand: BUT CANNABIS
ONLY FETCHES THAT PRICE

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.360
BECAUSE OF THAT ONE
PARTICULAR MOLECULE IT MAKES

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.530
THAT GETS PEOPLE HIGH.

01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:13.230
ITS NAME IS THC, AND
IT WAS DISCOVERED

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:17.960
IN A LAB IN JERUSALEM BY
CHEMIST RAPHAEL MECHOULAM.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.530
Man: CANNABIS HAD NOT
BEEN WELL INVESTIGATED,

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:24.100
WHICH WAS STRANGE -- AFTER
ALL, IT WAS BEING USED

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.260
ILLEGALLY OR LEGALLY
BY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.360
AND YET WE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT MUCH ABOUT IT.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:32.700
SO I THOUGHT, IT'S A GOOD
IDEA TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:32.730
FROM A MODERN POINT OF VIEW.

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:33.760
FROM A MODERN POINT OF VIEW.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.330
McDormand: IN THE LAB,
MECHOULAM AND HIS COLLEAGUES

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.300
BROKE CANNABIS
DOWN AND ZEROED IN

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:43.660
ON THE CHEMICAL COMPONENTS THAT
MIGHT BE CAUSING ITS EFFECTS.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.800
Mechoulam: WE ISOLATED
ABOUT 10 COMPOUNDS.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:51.330
SURPRISINGLY, OUT OF THE
10 COMPOUNDS WE ISOLATED,

01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:52.460
ONLY ONE --

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.630
WHICH NOW IS KNOWN AS

01:13:53.630 --> 01:13:57.300
DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL,
IN SHORT, THC --

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.900
ONLY ONE CAUSES THE
WELL-KNOWN HIGH.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:06.630
WE TESTED IT IN HUMANS
-- MANY OF MY FRIENDS.

01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:10.160
AND WE SAW THAT THE
COMPOUND IS EFFECTIVE,

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.600
AS WE EXPECTED IT TO BE.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.630
McDormand: THE IDENTIFICATION
OF THC ANSWERED ONE QUESTION,

01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:19.500
BUT RAISED ANOTHER --
JUST WHAT DID IT DO

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.830
TO THE BRAIN?

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:22.500
Woman: I HAD ALWAYS ASSUMED

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.760
THAT PEOPLE KNEW HOW
MARIJUANA WORKED.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.100
IT SURPRISED ME,
ACTUALLY, WHEN I BEGAN

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:30.260
LOOKING IN THE RESEARCH
LITERATURE, THAT --

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:31.300
THAT IT WAS REALLY CLEAR

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.460
THAT NO ONE REALLY
KNEW HOW IT WORKED.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:38.300
McDormand: IN 1988, ALLYN
HOWLETT FOUND THE ANSWER.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.630
SHE DISCOVERED THAT,
DEEP INSIDE THE BRAIN,

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:46.100
THC MOLECULES ACTIVATE A
PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN NETWORK

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.100
OF SPECIALIZED
CHEMICAL RECEPTORS.

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:52.130
Man: SO THAT WAS
PROOF THAT THERE IS

01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.460
A RECEPTOR PROTEIN IN THE BRAIN

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.430
THAT COMBINED TO THE THC
LIKE A KEY IN A LOCK.

01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:02.330
IT WAS VERY EXCITING, BECAUSE
WHAT THAT MEANT TO US WAS,

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:05.460
WE HAD A TOOL THAT COULD
BE USED FOR STUDYING,

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.030
AND OTHER RESEARCHERS
COULD USE IT, AS WELL.

01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:13.230
AND PEOPLE COULD STUDY WHERE
THE RECEPTOR WAS IN THE BRAIN.

01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:16.800
McDormand: HOWLETT AND OTHER
SCIENTISTS FOUND THE RECEPTORS

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.330
IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS,
WHICH FORMS MEMORIES;

01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:22.130
THE CEREBELLUM, WHICH
CONTROLS MOVEMENT;

01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:25.860
AND THE FRONTAL
CORTEX, WHERE WE THINK.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:28.860
Pollan: HERE WERE THESE
RECEPTORS THAT THIS CHEMICAL

01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:31.630
PRODUCED BY A PLANT
OUT IN THE WORLD

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:33.330
JUST SO HAPPENED TO HAVE

01:15:33.330 --> 01:15:36.460
THE PRECISE
COMBINATION TO UNLOCK.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:38.360
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY
THING THAT IS.

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:41.660
IS THAT WHY THAT RECEPTOR
NETWORK EXISTED,

01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:43.800
SO THAT PEOPLE COULD GET HIGH?

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.200
WE DON'T HAVE THOSE RECEPTORS

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.260
JUST SO THAT PEOPLE CAN
GET HIGH SMOKING POT.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:49.760
RECEPTORS ARE DEVELOPED

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.360
IN NEURONS SO THAT
THEY CAN COMMUNICATE

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.760
WITH A CHEMICAL
THAT THE BODY MAKES.

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.560
SO THAT WAS THE
LOGIC BEHIND GOING IN

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.430
AND TRYING TO EXTRACT
A COMPOUND IN THE BRAIN

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:05.660
THAT WOULD ACT JUST
LIKE MARIJUANA DID.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:09.530
McDormand: AND IN 1992,
PROOF CAME THAT THE BRAIN

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:12.430
DOES MAKE A COMPOUND
VERY MUCH LIKE THC.

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:17.360
IT WAS DISCOVERED BY NONE
OTHER THAN RAPHAEL MECHOULAM,

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.630
WHO NAMED IT ANANDAMIDE.

01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:22.960
WE CALL IT THE
BRAIN'S OWN MARIJUANA
BECAUSE THE COMPOUND

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.460
THAT IS MADE BY THE
BRAIN -- ANANDAMIDE --

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:32.260
SLEVEL AND CELLULAR LEVEL,
IN TERMS OF AT THE RECEPTOR

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.060
THAT THC HAS.

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:38.360
McDormand: IT TURNS OUT
THAT WHEN ANANDAMIDE

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:41.030
IS RELEASED IN THE
BRAIN, LIKE MARIJUANA,

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:46.130
IT AFFECTS SUCH BASIC THINGS
AS APPETITE, PAIN, AND MEMORY.

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:47.830
AND IT PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:52.400
IN A SOMETIMES UNDERAPPRECIATED
MENTAL FUNCTION --

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.200
FORGETTING.

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.900
Pollan: WHEN I
FIRST HEARD THAT,

01:16:55.900 --> 01:17:00.130
IT DIDN'T SEEM ADAPTIVE TO ME,
TO HAVE A DRUG FOR FORGETTING.

01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.360
MEMORY, WE UNDERSTAND, HAS
GREAT SURVIVAL UTILITY.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.230
YOU KNOW, YOU LEARN THAT
THAT'S A POISONOUS MUSHROOM

01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:06.330
OR THAT'S A DANGEROUS ANIMAL,

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.260
AND YOU STAY AWAY AND
YOU REMEMBER THAT.

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:10.330
BUT WHY WOULD
FORGETTING BE ADAPTIVE?

01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:12.060
AND I ASKED MECHOULAM
THIS QUESTION.

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.360
AND HE SAID, WELL, TELL ME,
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO REMEMBER

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.730
ALL THE FACES YOU SAW ON
THE SUBWAY THIS MORNING?

01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:22.260
FORGETTING WELL IS ALMOST

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.900
AS IMPORTANT AS
REMEMBERING WELL.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:28.200
FORGETTING IS ABOUT EDITING.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.830
IT'S ABOUT TAKING
THE FLOOD, THE OCEAN

01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:33.930
OF SENSE INFORMATION
COMING AT YOU

01:17:33.930 --> 01:17:41.260
AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:44.930
SO LIFE IS NOT JUST ABOUT
ACCUMULATING NEW MEMORIES.

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:48.900
MEMORY CAN CRIPPLE US, TOO.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:49.930
[ MAN YELLING ]

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:52.000
Pollan: YOU HAVE SOLDIERS

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.530
RETURNING FROM WAR ZONES,

01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:55.900
THAT ARE TRAUMATIZED
BY EXPERIENCES

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.160
THAT IN EFFECT
THEY CAN'T UNLEARN.

01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:02.600
SO IF YOU COULD HELP
THEM UNLEARN THAT --

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.200
ESSENTIALLY, A PRODUCTIVE
KIND OF FORGETTING,

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.000
EITHER WITH A DRUG OR SOME
OTHER KIND OF REGIME --

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.860
THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY USEFUL.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.830
McDormand: AND THAT'S EXACTLY

01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:15.830
WHAT ARON LICHTMAN
IS TRYING TO DO.

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:20.530
HE'S STUDYING HOW MICE
REMEMBER -- AND FORGET.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:24.060
FIRST, HE TRAINS THEM TO
FIND AN UNDERWATER PLATFORM.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.360
Man: THE MICE ARE
NATURAL SWIMMERS,

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.400
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A WAY OUT.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.200
THEY SWIM ALL AROUND THE
PERIMETER OF THE TANK.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.060
THEY'RE SWIMMING,
SWIMMING, SWIMMING.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.200
SOMETIMES THEY BUMP INTO
THE PLATFORM BY MISTAKE

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.230
AND THEY CLIMB ONTO IT.

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:39.000
OTHER TIMES, THEY
NEVER FIND IT.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.200
IT'S BEEN AT IT
SOFOR A WHILE.NT,

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.930
AND THE EXPERIMENTER HAS
TO GENTLY GUIDE THEM TO IT

01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:50.330
McDormand: THEN, LICHTMAN
TAKES THE PLATFORM AWAY.

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:54.130
A NORMAL MOUSE QUICKLY
REALIZES THE PLATFORM IS GONE.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:58.900
BUT A MOUSE WHOSE ANANDAMIDE
RECEPTORS HAVE BEEN BLOCKED

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.860
IS UNABLE TO FORGET.

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:04.300
Lichtman: THEY DON'T
LEARN TO GIVE UP.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:06.830
THEY KEEP ON LOOKING
FOR THAT PLATFORM,

01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:09.230
McDormand: SCIENTISTS
LIKE LICHTMAN HOPE

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:12.860
THAT LEARNING HOW TO REGULATE
ANANDAMIDE MAY ONE DAY

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.360
LEAD TO TREATMENTS FOR PEOPLE

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:16.630
WHO ARE HAUNTED
BY THEIR MEMORIES.

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:18.260
Lichtman: IF THEY CAN ELEVATE

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:21.330
NATURALLY OCCURRING
ANANDAMIDE IN HUMANS,

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:23.200
WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HAVE WHOLE NEW

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:30.230
THERAPEUTIC TARGETS TO TREAT
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME.

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:34.460
Mechoulam: BY USING A
PLANT THAT HAS BEEN AROUND

01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.500
FOR THOUSANDS OF
YEARS, WE DISCOVERED

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:42.930
A NEW PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM
OF IMMENSE IMPORTANCE.

01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:46.100
WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO GET THERE

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.100
IF WE HAD NOT LOOKED AT A PLANT.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.200
Pollan: THESE PLANTS ARE
CONSTANTLY UNDERGOING

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.760
THIS REVISION AND
THIS RE-REVISION

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.100
IN OUR CULTURAL IMAGINATION,

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.630
DEPENDING ON WHAT USES
THEY'RE PLAYING FOR US.

01:19:57.630 --> 01:20:03.030
ARE THEY DEMONS OR ARE
THEY, YOU KNOW, SAVIORS?

01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:04.300
WE SEE IT WITH THE APPLE,

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.130
WHICH WENT FROM EVIL
TO WHOLESOME TO EVIL.

01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:10.230
AND WE SEE IT WITH MARIJUANA,
WHICH ALSO HAS HAD

01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:12.530
THESE PERIODS OF
EVIL AND THIS PERIOD

01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:15.000
OF BEING CELEBRATED
BY THE COUNTERCULTURE.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.960
IS IT MORE UPLIFTING
OR MORE RELAXING

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:19.060
FOR YOUR BODY THAT YOU'RE AFTER?

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.460
UPLIFTING.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.160
McDormand: ONE PLACE
THAT'S WELL KNOWN

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.760
FOR CELEBRATING
CANNABIS IS AMSTERDAM.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.600
WE HAVE THE SHIVA,
WHICH IS LOVELY.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.460
McDormand: THOUGH MARIJUANA
IS NOT FULLY LEGAL HERE,

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:32.200
IT CAN BE LEGALLY
SOLD AND SMOKED

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.800
IN LICENSED COFFEE SHOPS,

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.800
DRAWING TOURISTS FROM
AROUND THE WORLD.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.400
FANTASTIC, LET'S
DO THAT FOR 10.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:43.460
Pollan: YOU CAN
WALK DOWN THE STREET

01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.430
AND CATCH THE WHIFF

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:46.860
OF MARIJUANA SMOKE
COMING OUT OF BARS --

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.330
CAFES, AS
THEY'RE CALLED --

01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:50.960
AND YOU CYOU WANT. EXACTLY
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.400
THAT'S MILDER, MORE DREAMY.

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:55.900
I THINK JUST THE BUD.

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:57.000
THANK YOU.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.930
OKAY, BYE.

01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:01.430
Pollan: YOU LOOK AT THE
SCENE AND YOU MARVEL AT IT.

01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:04.160
IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN
PEOPLE SITTING AROUND,

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:06.560
ENJOYING THEIR GLASS
OF WINE OR CIGARETTES.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.260
McDormand: AMSTERDAM EVEN
HAS SPECIAL GARDEN SHOPS

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.830

YOU PLANT THIS POTATO.

01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:50.860
WAS THE MEDITERRANEAN,
WHERE YOU COULD GROW
GRAIN MORE RELIABLY.

01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:56.300
THE POTATO DID VERY WELL AT
THE MORE NORTHERLY AREAS.

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:59.730
IT DID VERY WELL
IN WETTER AREAS.

01:30:59.730 --> 01:31:05.400
AND IT DID VERY WELL
IN REALLY POOR SOILS.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:09.060
THIS VAST NEW SOURCE OF
CALORIES THAT COULD UNDERWRITE

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.160
THE GROWTH OF THE POPULATION,

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:15.360
SUCH AS NEVER WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED WITHOUT THE POTATO.

01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:19.400
SINCE ONE INDIVIDUAL
CAN GROW SO MUCH FOOD,

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:22.300
YOU NEED FEWER
PEOPLE IN THE FIELDS

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.560
TO SUPPORT AN URBAN POPULATION.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:27.730
SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE

01:31:27.730 --> 01:31:30.730
THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
PROCEEDING AS IT WOULD

01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:34.000
WITHOUT THE POTATO TO
KIND OF SUPPORT IT.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.500
THIS NEW WORLD FOOD
REMADE THE OLD WORLD.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:43.160
McDormand: THE POTATO
THRIVED IN THE SOILS
OF NORTHERN EUROPE,

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.230
MOST DRAMATICALLY IN IRELAND,

01:31:45.230 --> 01:31:48.860
A COUNTRY SORELY IN
NEED OF A HEARTY FOOD.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.260
Pollan: FOR THE IRISH,

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:52.560
THE POTATO INITIALLY
WAS A GODSEND.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.600
McDormand: IRELAND'S POOR
FARMLAND AND BAD WEATHER

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:00.600
MADE IT A TOUGH
PLACE TO GROW CROPS.

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.830
BUT THE POTATO PLANT
ACTUALLY PROSPERED

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:05.100
IN THIS SOGGY ENVIRONMENT

01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:08.630
AND SEEMED TO END THE COUNTRY'S
LONG STRUGGLE WITH HUNGER.

01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:12.260
Pollan: IF YOU HAD
POTATOES AND COW'S MILK,

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.860
YOU HAD A COMPLETE DIET.

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.230
YOU HAD CALORIES, OBVIOUSLY,

01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:18.130
AND YOU HAD THE FULL
COMPLEMENT OF VITAMINS.

01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:22.230
SO THEY BECAME VERY
DEPENDENT ON THE POTATO.

01:32:22.230 --> 01:32:25.960
AND IN FACT, THE
POPULATION GREW.

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.930
THE PROBLEM WAS,
HOWEVER, THAT THE IRISH

01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:31.030
WERE PLANTING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY

01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:34.600
ONE KIND OF POTATO --
THE POTATO THEY CALLED
THE LUMPER.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.360
AND THEY PLANTED THE
LUMPER ALL OVER IRELAND.

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:41.760
SO THE IRISH HAD
REALLY MADE THEMSELVES

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.930
DEPENDENT ON THIS
ONE STRAIN OF POTATO.

01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:50.030
AND IN 1845, SOME SHIP
FROM SOUTH AMERICA

01:32:50.030 --> 01:32:52.360
WAS CARRYING A FUNGUS,

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:57.300
AND IT WAS A
WIND-SPREAD SPORE,

01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.760
AND OVER THE COURSE

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:00.930
OF A VERY FEW WEEKS,

01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:05.530
THE SPORES SPREAD
ACROSS ALL OF IRELAND,

01:33:05.530 --> 01:33:08.930
AND WITHIN DAYS OF INFECTION,
THE FIELDS WENT BLACK

01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:11.730
AND THE POTATOES IN THE
GROUND TURNED TO MUSH.

01:33:11.730 --> 01:33:17.360
McDormand: THE IRISH POTATO
FAMINE LASTED FOR THREE YEARS.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:22.460
IN THE END, THE FAMINE
KILLED ONE MILLION PEOPLE --

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:26.600
ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT
PEOPLE IN IRELAND.

01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:32.300
Pollan: SO THE IRISH
FAMINE IS, IN A WAY,

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:33.460
THE GREAT CAUTIONARY TALE

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:35.460
OF PUTTING ALL YOUR
EGGS IN ONE BASKET,

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:42.230
AND THE GREAT CAUTIONARY TALE
ABOUT MONOCULTURES OF ALL KINDS.

01:33:42.230 --> 01:33:46.230
IT'S A PARABLE ABOUT THE
IMPORTANCE OF BIODIVERSITY

01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:48.130
AND THE DANGERS OF MONOCULTURE.

01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:50.600
AND IT'S A PARABLE WE
FORGET AT OUR PERIL,

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.100
BUT, IN FACT, WE'RE IN THE
PROCESS OF FORGETTING TODAY.

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.660
McDormand: AND WHAT'S
MAKING US FORGET

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:00.160
IS ONE OF OUR FAVORITE FOODS.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:02.830
EACH YEAR, AMERICANS CONSUME

01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:07.260
ABOUT 7.5 BILLION
POUNDS OF FRENCH FRIES.

01:34:07.260 --> 01:34:11.030
THEY ARE THE MOST POPULAR
FAST FOOD IN THE COUNTRY.

01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:14.660
Pollan: WE LOVE
OUR FRENCH FRIES.

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:19.430
McDONALD'S KIND OF PIONEERED
THAT BEAUTIFUL RED BOX

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:22.700
THAT HAVE TO BE TALL ENOUGH TO
KIND OF SPROUT OUT OF THE BOX

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.730
LIKE A LITTLE BOUQUET
OF POTATO FLOWERS.

01:34:24.730 --> 01:34:28.800
McDormand: AND TO MAKE
THOSE LONG FRENCH FRIES,

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:30.030
THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY RELIES

01:34:30.030 --> 01:34:33.660
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON
ONE VARIETY OF POTATO --

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:36.760
THE RUSSET BURBANK.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.460
Pollan: AND THAT'S
WHAT McDONALD'S BUYS,

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:44.360
BECAUSE McDONALD'S WANTS PEOPLE
TO HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE --

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:48.300
THE SAME BEAUTIFUL, GOLDEN
McDONALD'S FRENCH FRIES,

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:51.200
WHETHER YOU'RE IN
PRAGUE OR LONDON

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.300
OR BEIJING OR NEW YORK OR IDAHO.

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.930
McDormand: McDONALD'S
BUYS ITS FRENCH FRIES

01:34:55.930 --> 01:35:00.460
FROM POTATO PROCESSING COMPANIES
LIKE THE J.R. SIMPLOT COMPANY.

01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:04.900
THIS IS ONE OF ITS
PLANTS, IN NAMPA, IDAHO.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:11.660
THE POTATO WE PROCESS THE
MOST IS THE RUSSET BURBANK.

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:13.860
THE RUSSET BURBANK
GIVES US PRETTY MUCH

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:19.500
THE IDEAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES,
IF WE'RE GOING TO CONVERT THEM

01:35:19.500 --> 01:35:21.460
INTO THE PRODUCT THAT
OUR CUSTOMER WANTS.

01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:25.060
Pollan: SO YOU SEE
HOW MONOCULTURES

01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:27.660
ON THE PLATE LEAD TO
MONOCULTURES ON THE LAND,

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:31.800
AND THAT A DESIRE FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT PERFECT FRENCH FRY

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.260
HAS A WHOLE, YOU KNOW,
CARRIES A WHOLE CHAIN

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:37.130
OF CONSEQUENCES, ALL THE
WAY BACK TO THE FARM.

01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:40.600
McDormand: THIS IDAHO FARM,

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.600
WHOSE FIELDS EXTEND
FOR NEARLY 100 MILES,

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:47.300
IS RUN BY RYAN CRANNEY
AND HIS FAMILY.

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:52.330
LIKE MOST IDAHO
POTATO FARMERS,

01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:54.030
THE CRANNEYS SELL
MOST OF THEIR CROP

01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:57.100
TO THE PROCESSING
COMPANIES THAT MAKE

01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:59.230
IF YOU WANT TO GET THEM IN
BEFORE THEY GET FROZEN,

01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:00.230
THEN WE NEED TO KEEP DIGGING.

01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:03.130
McDormand: SO, TO
SATISFY THEIR CUSTOMERS,

01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:05.760
THE CRANNEYS GROW MOSTLY

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.560
Man: THAT OUGHT TO
MAKE GOOD FRENCH FRIES.

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.930
Man: I THINK THERE
ARE OTHER VARIETIES

01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:13.600
THAT ARE EASIER TO GROW,

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:16.630
BUT THAT'S WHAT THE CONSUMER
DEMANDS, IS THE RUSSET BURBANK,

01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:20.160
AND I'D BE SHOT FOR
SUGGESTING OTHERWISE.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.930
McDormand: DESPITE THE
DEMAND FOR RUSSET BURBANKS,

01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:27.860
THE BUSINESS OF GROWING THEM
IS FAR FROM A SURE THING.

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.700
EACH YEAR, CRANNEY
AND HIS FAMILY

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.560
HAVE TO SHELL OUT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:37.760
FOR WATER, SEED, FERTILIZER,
CHEMICALS, AND LABOR.

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.160
BUT THEY HAVE LITTLE
CONTROL OVER THE PRICE

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.160
THEIR POTATOES WILL SELL
FOR AT HARVEST TIME.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.830
Cranney: IT'S VERY
RISKY, GROWING CROPS.

01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:52.360
WE HAD SOME REALLY HUGE LOSSES
ECONOMICALLY HERE ON THE FARM.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:56.930
I DON'T EVEN LIKE TO THINK
ABOUT IT, HOW BAD IT WAS.

01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:59.400
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
IN THE COMMUNITY,

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.830
FARMERS THAT WE GREW UP WITH,

01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:03.500
THAT HAVE BEEN HERE
AS LONG AS WE HAVE,

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.060
NO LONGER HAVE THEIR OPERATIONS.

01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:09.130
MANY OF US, THE ONLY
WAY WE COULD SURVIVE WAS

01:37:09.130 --> 01:37:12.530
TO RE-MORTGAGE OUR FARMS
AND RE-MORTGAGE OUR LAND,

01:37:12.530 --> 01:37:14.460
AND THAT'S HOW WE
STAYED IN BUSINESS.

01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:16.460
YOU CAN ONLY DO --
DIP INTO THE WELL

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:18.360
FOR SO LONG UNTIL
THE WELL GOES DRY.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:30.260
AND MANY OF US HAVE
BEEN TO THAT POINT.

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.430
WELL, IT'S NOT TOO BAD HERE,

01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:33.530
BECAUSE YOU'RE
RUNNING ENOUGH VOLUME.

01:37:33.530 --> 01:37:35.030
THEY'RE FLOWING
PRETTY GOOD, BUT...

01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:37.530
McDormand: IN ADDITION TO THE
ECONOMIC PERILS HE FACES,

01:37:37.530 --> 01:37:40.960
CRANNEY MUST CONTEND WITH
BIOLOGICAL ADVERSARIES --

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.460
THE INSECTS, FUNGI, AND VIRUSES
THAT PREY ON HIS PLANTS.

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:49.600
AND HIS RUSSET BURBANKS
ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE,

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.730
BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWN
IN A MONOCULTURE,

01:37:51.730 --> 01:37:54.630
JUST LIKE THE LUMPER POTATOES
WERE, BACK IN IRELAND.

01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:59.760
IF AN ENEMY CAN KILL ONE OF
CRANNEY'S RUSSET BURBANKS,

01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.900
IT CAN KILL THEM ALL.

01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.430
MY ROLE AS A FARMER
IS TO HELP THE PLANT

01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:06.100
OUT-COMPETE THE
DIFFERENT PESTS,

01:38:06.100 --> 01:38:09.730
WHETHER THAT BE WEEDS OR
WHETHER THAT BE INSECTS

01:38:09.730 --> 01:38:13.700
OR A FUNGUS OF SOME SORT.

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:17.800
IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE THAT
WE HAVE TO FIGHT THOSE OFF

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.130
AND TO PROTECT AGAINST THOSE.

01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:23.130
IT'S A RACE TO THE FINISH
LINE, WHETHER THE PESTS WIN

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:24.700
OR WHETHER THE
POTATO PLANT WINS.

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:28.430
McDormand: TO HELP HIS
POTATOES WIN THAT RACE,

01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:30.460
CRANNEY, LIKE THE
GREAT MAJORITY

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:34.930
OF LARGE-SCALE POTATO GROWERS
IN THE UNITED STATES,

01:38:34.930 --> 01:38:36.830
USES CHEMICAL PESTICIDES.

01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:40.500
THE CHEMICALS THE
CRANNEYS USE CAN BE TOXIC,

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.360
BUT THEY FOLLOW EPA GUIDELINES

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.100
THAT ESTABLISH LEVELS
THAT ARE CONSIDERED

01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:47.330
SAFE TO USE.

01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.330
Cranney: I DON'T
NECESSARILY LIKE TO APPLY

01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:53.500
THE INSECTICIDES -- OR ANY
CHEMICAL OF ANY SORT --

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.630
BUT IT'S SOMETHING
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:38:55.630 --> 01:39:00.460
IN ORDER TO KEEP
THE PLANTS HEALTHY.

01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:03.130
Man: WE DON'T USE A
CHEMICAL UNLESS WE NEED TO,

01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:05.730
AND IT'S KIND OF BY
PRESCRIPTION, BY FIELD.

01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:08.860
SO YOU JUST DON'T GO
IN AND JUST BLANKET

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:12.630
EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF
CHEMICALS AND FUNGICIDES ON.

01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:18.400
IF THAT POTATO DOESN'T NEED
ANY, WE WON'T APPLY IT.

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:19.660
IF IT DOES, WE DO.

01:39:19.660 --> 01:39:23.130
YOU KNOW, WE LOVE
OUR CHILDREN, TOO.

01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:26.530
AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT
ANYTHING ON THE FOOD

01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:31.430
THAT WE EAT ANY MORE
-- TO TAINT IT FOR US,
ANY MORE THAN YOU.

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:36.930
Pollan: YOU KNOW, THE CONTROL
OF NATURE IS EXPENSIVE.

01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:40.200
TO SPRAY ALL THOSE PESTICIDES,
TO HAVE 10 SPRAYINGS

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.630
OF FERTILIZER OVER A
COURSE OF THE SEASON,

01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:46.500
TO WATER, TO BUY ALL THAT
WATER AND PUMP ALL THAT WATER,

01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:52.260
THESE FARMERS ARE REALLY LIVING
ON, ON VERY THIN MARGINS

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.630
AND VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR ERROR.

01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:56.130
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S EASY FOR US

01:39:56.130 --> 01:39:58.460
TO SIT HERE AND CRITICIZE
THEM FOR SPRAYING

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.500
THESE CHEMICALS ON OUR
FOOD, BUT THE FACT IS,

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:03.830
IF THEY WERE TO GIVE UP
ON A SINGLE SPRAYING,

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:07.400
McDormand: IN 1995, RYAN
CRANNEY AND FARMERS LIKE HIM

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:10.760
WELCOMED THE NEWS OF AN
AGRICULTURAL BREAKTHROUGH

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:13.730
THAT PROMISED TO CUT
DOWN THEIR USE OF SPRAYS.

01:40:13.730 --> 01:40:18.330
MONSANTO, THE WORLD'S BIGGEST
BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY,

01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:20.300
CAME UP WITH A MUCH
LESS TOXIC METHOD

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:23.930
FOR KILLING ONE OF THE POTATO'S
MOST DEADLY ENEMIES --

01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:25.930
THE COLORADO POTATO BEETLE,

01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:29.530
WHICH CAN PICK THE
LEAVES OFF A PLANT

01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:31.330
VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT.

01:40:31.330 --> 01:40:31.360
Thornton: COLORADO
POTATO BEETLE,

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:32.600
Thornton: COLORADO
POTATO BEETLE,

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.060
WORLDWIDE, IS PROBABLY
THE MOST SERIOUS INSECT
PEST IN POTATOES.

01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:40.760
WE STILL ESTIMATE
THAT, YOU KNOW,

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.700
AND PROBABLY ACROSS
THE U.S. AS A WHOLE,

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:45.960
ABOUT 40% OF THE INSECTICIDES
THAT WERE APPLIED

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.360
WERE APPLIED FOR COLORADO
POTATO BEETLE CONTROL.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.900
McDormand: MONSANTO'S
INNOVATION WAS TO CREATE

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.600
A NEW KIND OF POTATO,
CALLED THE NewLeaf POTATO.

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.600
IT WAS THE FIRST POTATO TO
BE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.660
TO CONTAIN GENES FROM A
DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL SPECIES.

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:09.400
Woman: GENETIC ENGINEERING IS
A RADICALLY NEW TECHNOLOGY,

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.330
COMPARED TO
TRADITIONAL BREEDING.

01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:16.130
IT ALLOWS US TO MOVE GENES

01:41:16.130 --> 01:41:19.100
WITHOUT REGARD TO
SPECIES BARRIERS.

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:24.330
IT ALLOWS US TO MOVE A
GENE FROM A BUTTERFLY,

01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:25.460
YOU KNOW, INTO A CORN PLANT,

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:28.100
FROM A STARFISH
INTO A WHEAT PLANT.

01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.900
McDormand: MONSANTO'S
NewLeaf POTATO USED A GENE

01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:33.500
FROM A COMMON SOIL BACTERIUM,

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:37.060
ONE THAT MAKES A PROTEIN
THAT KILLS POTATO BEETLES

01:41:37.060 --> 01:41:38.860
WITHOUT CAUSING HARM TO HUMANS.

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:44.060
THE BACTERIUM IS CALLED
BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS,

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.530
OR Bt FOR SHORT.

01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:48.200
TO HELP MARKET ITS Bt POTATO,

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.060
MONSANTO HIRED PLANT
PHYSIOLOGIST MICHAEL THORNTON

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.460
TO BE ONE OF ITS LIAISONS
TO FARMERS IN IDAHO.

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:58.260
Thornton: MONSANTO
WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:00.800
THE GENE IN THAT
BACTERIUM, THE Bt GENE

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.060
THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
PRODUCTION OF THAT PROTEIN.

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:07.600
AND THEY COULD USE A
PROCESS TO INSERT THAT GENE

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:10.600
INTO A POTATO VARIETY,
ONE THAT GROWERS

01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.560
WERE ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.830
THE BEETLE EATS THAT LEAF

01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:18.260
AND GETS THAT Bt
PROTEIN INSIDE IT

01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:21.360
AND IT DISRUPTS ITS
DIGESTIVE SYSTEM,

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.330
AND THAT EVENTUALLY KILLS
THE COLORADO POTATO BEETLE.

01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:29.360
I CAME FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT
TECHNOLOGY AND NEW IMPROVEMENTS

01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.700
WERE A GOOD THING FOR
THE POTATO INDUSTRY,

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.330
SO I WAS VERY EXCITED TO
SEE SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:37.830
KIND OF A QUANTUM LEAP IN
TECHNOLOGY FOR THE INDUSTRY

01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:38.730
BE INTRODUCED.

01:42:38.730 --> 01:42:40.100
Pollan: THE PROMISE HERE WAS

01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:41.300
THAT YOU COULD
DIMINISH SPRAYING.

01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:44.060
YOU MIGHT PAY A LITTLE BIT
MORE FOR THESE POTATOES,

01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:46.930
BUT SINCE THEY GENERATED
THEIR OWN PESTICIDE,

01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:48.330
YOU COULD GIVE UP SOME
OF YOUR SPRAYINGS.

01:42:48.330 --> 01:42:54.100
AND THIS WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE
TO A LOT OF POTATO FARMERS.

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:55.860
AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS
REALLY GOING TO TAKE OFF.

01:42:55.860 --> 01:43:02.160
McDormand: IN 1996, THE NewLeaf
POTATO BEGAN MAKING ITS WAY

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.230
INTO FAST FOOD CHAINS
AND SUPERMARKETS.

01:43:05.230 --> 01:43:08.260
AS TIME WENT BY,
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:11.160
WERE EATING THE GENETICALLY
MODIFIED POTATOES,

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.430
BUT HARDLY ANY OF
THEM REALIZED IT,

01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:15.000
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAD RULED

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.860
THE POTATOES DIDN'T
NEED TO BE LABELED.

01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:20.700
Pollan: I REALIZED AS
I DID MY REPORTING,

01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:23.330
I'D BEEN IN A McDONALD'S.
I'D BOUGHT FRITO-LAY CHIPS.

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:26.230
AND THE THING I LEARNED
THAT I HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF,

01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:28.300
BECAUSE WE HADN'T BEEN
TOLD, IS THAT WE AMERICANS

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:31.460
HAD BEEN EATING THESE POTATOES
ALREADY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:34.430
Thornton: THE POTATO WAS
THE SAME, NUTRITIONALLY,

01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:37.700
HAD THE SAME LEVEL OF
VITAMINS, THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.600
IT JUST HAD THIS ONE
ADDITIONAL GENE THAT CODES

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.430
FOR A PROTEIN THAT MAKES UP LESS
THAN A TENTH OF ONE-PERCENT

01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:46.930
OF THE TOTAL PROTEIN
IN THE PLANT.

01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:48.130
AND THE DECISION BY

01:43:48.130 --> 01:43:51.560
THE FOOD AND DRUG
ADMINISTRATION WAS THAT,

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.560
UNLESS IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY
DIFFERENT --

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.100
UNLESS YOU'VE CHANGED
THE NUTRIENT PROFILE --

01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:01.500
IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE LABELED.

01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:04.230
NOW, IT SEEMS TO
ME THAT THE POTATO

01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:07.000
NEVER BEFORE PRODUCED
THIS PESTICIDE.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.600
SO TO SAY THAT POTATOES
PRODUCING PESTICIDE

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:12.760
ARE SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT
TO POTATOES THAT DON'T

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:17.030
SEEMS TO INVOLVE A CERTAIN
SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF.

01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:19.030
HEY, HEY! HO, HO!

01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:21.630
WE DON'T WANT NO
GMOs! HEY, HEY!

01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:24.060
McDormand: IN THE LATE
1990s, AS THE NewLeaf

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:26.360
WAS MAKING INROADS
INTO THE MARKET,

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.730
THE ISSUE OF GENETICALLY
MODIFIED ORGANISMS, OR GMOs,

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:33.560
WAS AROUSING INTENSE
OPPOSITION ALL OVER THE WORLD.

01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.600
WE DON'T WANT NO GMO!

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.160
HEY, HEY! HO, HO!

01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:39.200
Man: I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.130
IN MY BODY AND MY
DAUGHTER'S BODY

01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:43.460
WHEN THEY FEED CORN TO -- TO US

01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.700
THAT'S BEEN GENETICALLY ALTERED.

01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:47.860
THEY DON'T KNOW.
THEY CAN'T TELL YOU.

01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:49.430
WHAT DO WE WANT? SAFE FOOD!

01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:50.700
WHEN DO WE WANT IT? NOW!

01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:53.130
Mellon: THE Bt
POTATO OFFERS FARMERS

01:44:53.130 --> 01:44:53.160
REDUCED COST.

01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:53.930
REDUCED COST.

01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:56.630
IT DOESN'T OFFER
CONSUMERS ANYTHING.

01:44:56.630 --> 01:45:01.600
AND SO A LOT OF CONSUMERS,
IF THEY WERE GIVEN A CHOICE,

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:06.800
MIGHT SAY, WELL, IT DOESN'T
PROVIDE AN ADVANTAGE FOR ME.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.960
AND THEREFORE, NOT KNOWING
A WHOLE LOT ABOUT IT,

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:14.960
I MIGHT -- I MIGHT
SIMPLY SAY NO.

01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:16.860
Pollan: I DO KNOW
McDONALD'S WAS GETTING

01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:19.060
A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CALLS
AND LETTERS ASKING THEM,

01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:24.530
IS IT TRUE THAT YOU
ARE SERVING GENETICALLY
MODIFIED POTATOES?

01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:26.660
THIS IS A COMPANY, LIKE
MANY FOOD COMPANIES,

01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:28.830
EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE
TO PUBLIC OPINION.

01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:31.260
AND THEY PROBABLY
SAW A POTENTIAL

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:35.030
PRUIN MONSANTO'S BUSINESS,
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:38.160
BUT THEY VERY QUIETLY SAID
THAT AFTER THE FOLLOWING YEAR,

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:41.260
THEY WOULD NO LONGER
BE TAKING THEM.

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:45.100
AND WITH THAT, THE
NewLeaf POTATO WAS OVER.

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:49.030
McDormand: IN 2001,
MONSANTO STOPPED SELLING

01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:50.060
THE NewLeaf POTATO.

01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:53.500
IT HAD CAPTURED ONLY
ABOUT 5% OF THE MARKET.

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:55.830
BOTH McDONALD'S AND MONSANTO

01:45:55.830 --> 01:46:00.160
DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED
FOR THIS PROGRAM.

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.930
Thornton: I WAS VERY
DISAPPOINTED -- TO SEE

01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:05.800
THIS WHOLE DREAM JUST
KIND OF BEING SHUT DOWN

01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:08.830
OVER RELATIVELY A
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:11.800
SEEMED TO ME TO BE A TRAGEDY.

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:13.100
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A TRAGEDY.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:16.260
I THINK IT WAS PART
OF A VERY LARGE DEBATE

01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:20.000
ABOUT HOW OUR SOCIETY
OUGHT TO RESPOND TO THE USE

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:25.530
OF A RADICALLY NEW TECHNOLOGY
LIKE GENETIC ENGINEERING

01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:30.060
McDormand: BUT SINCE THE
DEMISE OF THE Bt POTATO,

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.760
MONSANTO HAS BEEN
VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.900
SELLING OTHER GENETICALLY
ENGINEERED CROPS --

01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:38.730
LIKE CORN, SOYBEANS,
AND COTTON.

01:46:38.730 --> 01:46:42.730
ENTOMOLOGIST BRUCE
TABASHNIK HAS BEEN STUDYING

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:45.130
THE Bt COTTON CROP IN ARIZONA.

01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:49.630
Man: WE'RE IN A SPECIAL
SITUATION IN ARIZONA RIGHT NOW

01:46:49.630 --> 01:46:56.430
WHERE ABOUT 98% OF THE
COTTON GROWN IS Bt COTTON.

01:46:56.430 --> 01:47:00.500
IT'S BEING USED AS PART
OF A PROGRAM TO ERADICATE,

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:04.560
OR AT LEAST GREATLY
SUPPRESS, PINK BOLLWORM.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.200
McDormand: THE BOLLWORM
IS AS DANGEROUS

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.500
TO THE COTTON CROP AS
THE COLORADO BEETLE

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.760
IS TO POTATOES.

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:15.100
WE HAVE LOTS OF DAMAGE
INSIDE THE BOLL HERE.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:18.600
ONE OR MORE CATERPILLARS
HAS BEEN FEEDING

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:20.830
ON THE SEEDS INSIDE THE BOLL,

01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:23.360
WHICH IS GREAT
FOR THE INSECTS,

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:27.800
BUT NOT GOOD FOR THE
PLANT OR FOR THE FARMER.

01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:30.760
McDormand: TABASHNIK
HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.360
ONE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS
ABOUT Bt CROPS --

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.430
THE DEGREE TO WHICH
INSECTS EVOLVE RESISTANCE

01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:39.700
TO THE BUG-KILLING PROTEIN.

01:47:39.700 --> 01:47:42.630
SOME OF HIS WORK IS PARTLY
FUNDED BY MONSANTO,

01:47:42.630 --> 01:47:47.730
WHICH IS LEGALLY REQUIRED
TO MONITOR Bt RESISTANCE.

01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:51.830
FOR YEARS, ORGANIC FARMERS
HAVE CONTROLLED PESTS

01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:53.130
WITH A SPRAY FORM OF Bt.

01:47:53.130 --> 01:47:55.630
BUT NOW THAT Bt
HAS BEEN ENGINEERED

01:47:55.630 --> 01:48:00.130
INTO CROPS, EXPOSING
INSECTS DAY IN AND DAY OUT,

01:48:00.130 --> 01:48:02.330
TABASHNIK HAS
FOUND THAT THE BUGS

01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:04.900
ARE MORE LIKELY TO
DEVELOP RESISTANCE.

01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.360
Tabashnik: IN THE DECADES OF USE

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:13.160
OF Bt SPRAYS, THERE'S ONLY ONE
INSECT THAT EVOLVED RESISTANCE.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:18.530
ON THE OTHER HAND, AFTER ABOUT
A DOZEN YEARS OF Bt CROPS,

01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:20.600
WE ALREADY HAVE THREE EXAMPLES

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.160
OF INSECTS THAT HAVE
EVOLVED RESISTANCE.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:26.760
McDormand: BUT
TABASHNIK STILL THINKS

01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.030
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS

01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:31.060
DO MORE TO HELP THE
ENVIRONMENT THAN TO HARM IT.

01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:32.830
Tabashnik: I THINK
THAT ULTIMATELY

01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:36.260
YOU CAN'T BE ABSOLUTELY SURE
THAT NO HARM WILL COME,

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:40.660
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
USING Bt CROPS,

01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:42.600
THE BENEFITS ARE REDUCED
INSECTICIDE USE.

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:47.460
THE RISKS ARE MUCH MORE
DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:50.760
AND MUCH MORE UNCERTAIN.

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.460
Ryan: IN MY OWN MIND, IT
SEEMS LIKE IT MAKES SENSE

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:57.200
THAT WE COULD GO TO MORE
GENETICALLY MODIFIED

01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:01.130
THAT WOULD ALLOW US NOT
TO APPLY THESE CHEMICALS
ON THE PLANTS,

01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:06.360
AND THEY WOULD HAVE A NATURAL
RESISTANCE TO THESE INSECTS.

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.700
IT SEEMS LIKE THE
LOGICAL WAY TO GO FOR ME,

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:10.530
AND I ASSUME SOMEDAY
IT WILL GO THERE.

01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:13.600
McDormand: BUT FOR FOOD
CROPS LIKE THE POTATO,

01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:17.300
GENETIC ENGINEERING
AND CHEMICAL PESTICIDES

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:17.330
ARE NOT THE ONLY CHOICES.

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:18.460
ARE NOT THE ONLY CHOICES.

01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:22.130
Pollan: YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE GROWING MONOCULTURES,

01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:23.860
YOU SORT OF HAVE
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:25.600
LOTS OF PESTICIDES
TO KEEP THEM GOING,

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:28.100
OR GENETICALLY MODIFIED
CROPS TO KEEP THEM GOING.

01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:31.100
BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO ABANDON MONOCULTURE,

01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:36.100
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:39.930
McDormand: MIKE HEATH, WHO
GROWS POTATOES IN IDAHO

01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:42.060
JUST 60 MILES
FROM THE CRANNEYS,

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:44.500
IS AN ORGANIC FARMER.

01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:47.060
Man: IN A CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM,

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:48.530
YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL.

01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:50.030
YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL NATURE.

01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:52.560
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK
WITH IT AS BEST WE CAN.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:56.630
McDormand: WHILE HIS NEIGHBORS
DEVOTE MOST OF THEIR ACREAGE

01:49:56.630 --> 01:49:58.560
TO THE RUSSET
BURBANK, HEATH IS

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.660
MORE OF AN
EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY GROWER.

01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:05.160
Heath: WE HAVE 16 VARIETIES
ALTOGETHER THIS YEAR.

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:07.860
SO WE'RE PRETTY DIVERSIFIED.

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:10.260
THAT'S OUR MAIN STRENGTH,
IS OUR DIVERSIFICATION.

01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:14.100
McDormand: HEATH
GROWS NORKOTAHS,

01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:21.230
RED NORLANDS, ALL
BLUES, AND ELBAS.

01:50:21.230 --> 01:50:23.930
BY PLANTING LOTS OF
DIFFERENT VARIETIES

01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:28.330
AND CONTROLLING PESTS WITH
NATURAL ENEMIES LIKE LADYBUGS,

01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:31.260
HE FARMS WITHOUT
USING TOXIC CHEMICALS.

01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:35.930
Heath: THE CONVENTIONAL
FARMERS CERTAINLY

01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:37.860
KNOW HOW TO FARM WITH CHEMICALS.

01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:41.660
I -- I MYSELF, IF I
HAD TO GO BACK TO THAT,

01:50:41.660 --> 01:50:42.830
I'D -- I WOULD QUIT.

01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:47.530
McDormand: HEATH'S
LABOR COSTS ARE HIGH.

01:50:47.530 --> 01:50:49.460
HE DOESN'T CULTIVATE
AS MANY ACRES

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.160
OR GROW AS MUCH FOOD
AS THE CRANNEYS.

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:55.200
BUT SINCE HE SPENDS NEXT
TO NOTHING ON PESTICIDES

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.460
AND GETS GOOD PRICES
FOR HIS ORGANIC POTATOES

01:50:58.460 --> 01:50:59.530
IN SPECIALTY MARKETS,

01:50:59.530 --> 01:51:01.830
HE USUALLY EARNS
MORE MONEY PER ACRE.

01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:03.830
Heath: I USED TO BE
REALLY PRETTY STUPID,

01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:08.000
YOU KNOW, AS
FAR AS MY NEIGHBORS WERE
CONCERNED, PRETTY SILLY.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.230
BUT I HAVE A LOT
MORE RESPECT NOW

01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:14.430
THAN I DID 10, 15 YEARS AGO.

01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:16.430
THEY CAN SEE THAT I'M
STILL IN BUSINESS,

01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:18.760
AND WE'VE GOT GOOD MARKETS,

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.830
AND WE GROW A GOOD PRODUCT,

01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:22.130
AND I'M PROUD TO BE
AN ORGANIC FARMER.

01:51:22.130 --> 01:51:26.060
Pollan: YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
OTHER WAYS TO SKIN A CAT.

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:28.160
AND FARMERS ARE FIGURING IT OUT.

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.600
AND THEY'RE FIGURING OUT

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.130
HOW TO GROW FOOD
WITHOUT PESTICIDES,

01:51:32.130 --> 01:51:34.560
AND THE KEY -- THE KEY
INSIGHT THAT YOU FIND

01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:38.230
IN ALL THE CREATIVE FARMERS
WHO HAVE SOLVED THIS PROBLEM

01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:40.130
IS GETTING AWAY
FROM MONOCULTURE.

01:51:40.130 --> 01:51:43.300
THE ANSWER TO THE
PROBLEMS OF MONOCULTURE

01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.860
IS NOT NEW TECHNOLOGIES,
IT'S NOT BAND-AIDS.

01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:50.930
IT'S GETTING AWAY
FROM MONOCULTURE.

01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:53.630
Mellon: I THINK
IF WE COULD LEARN

01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:56.860
FROM THE PERUVIANS,
IF WE COULD STEP BACK

01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:00.660
AND APPRECIATE THE DIVERSITY
THAT THEY'VE GIVEN US

01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:01.700
IN THE POTATO

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:06.000
AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
IT IN OUR AGRICULTURE,

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.200
THAT IS THE WAY FORWARD.

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:09.760
Thornton: I THINK
SOME OF THE METHODS

01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:13.060
THEY'VE DEVELOPED IN PERU
TO USE GENETIC DIVERSITY

01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:17.500
BY PLANTING A WHOLE RANGE OF
VARIETIES WITHIN ONE FIELD

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.760
IS A VERY GOOD STRATEGY,

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:22.600
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE HOW
WE READILY ADAPT THAT

01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:25.530
TO A PRODUCTION
SYSTEM THAT NOT ONLY

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:28.130
HAS TO FEED PEOPLE
IN THE U.S.,

01:52:28.130 --> 01:52:29.630
BUT FEED A WORLDWIDE POPULATION

01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:31.960
WITH A PRODUCT THAT'S
A CERTAIN QUALITY.

01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:35.700
Pollan: THE ORDER
WE IMPOSE ON NATURE

01:52:35.700 --> 01:52:39.430
IS NEVER MORE THAN
TEMPORARY OR ILLUSORY.

01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:42.130
IN THE END, THE LOGIC
OF NATURE WILL WIN OUT

01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:47.160
OVER THE LOGIC OF CAPITALISM,
THE LOGIC OF THE FACTORY,

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.730
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SO AND
IT ALWAYS WILL BE SO.

01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:53.930
NATURE IS STRONGER THAN
ANY OF OUR DESIGNS.

01:52:53.930 --> 01:53:07.660
AND NATURE RESISTS OUR CONTROL.

01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:10.560
FOR ME, THE MOST
IMPORTANT LESSONS

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:14.830
TO TAKE AWAY FROM THESE TALES
IS THAT WE ARE NOT SIMPLY

01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:17.560
STANDING OUTSIDE
THE WEB OF LIFE,

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:20.260
BUT THAT WE ARE PART
OF THAT WEB OF LIFE

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:22.000
AND THAT EVERYTHING WE DO --

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.560
WHAT WE CHOOSE TO EAT,

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:26.860
WHAT FLOWERS WE CHOOSE
TO PUT ON OUR TABLES,

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:29.160
WHAT DRUGS WE CHOOSE TO TAKE --

01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.500
THESE ARE EVOLUTIONARY VOTES

01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:39.460
WE ARE CASTING EVERY DAY IN
MANY, MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:41.830
WHEN WE USE THESE
METAPHORS AND WE TALK

01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:44.500
ABOUT PLANTS HAVING
A STRATEGY TO DO THIS

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:47.330
OR WANTING THIS
OR DESIRING THIS,

01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:49.260
WE'RE BEING
METAPHORICAL, OBVIOUSLY.

01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.600
I MEAN, PLANTS DO NOT
HAVE CONSCIOUSNESS.

01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.000
BUT THIS IS A FAULT
OF OUR OWN VOCABULARY.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.030
WE DON'T HAVE A VERY GOOD
VOCABULARY TO DESCRIBE

01:53:58.030 --> 01:54:01.030
WHAT OTHER SPECIES DO TO US
-- BECAUSE WE THINK WE'RE

01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:07.500
THE ONLY SPECIES THAT
REALLY DOES ANYTHING.

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:10.900
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT
YOU CAN PUT YOURSELF

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:13.600
IN THE PLACE OF
THESE OTHER SPECIES

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.560
AND LOOK AT THE WORLD
FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW,

01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:19.630
I THINK IT FREES
US FROM OUR SENSE OF
ALIENATION FROM NATURE,

01:54:19.630 --> 01:54:23.260
AND WE BECOME MEMBERS
OF THE BIOTIC COMMUNITY,

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:26.700
ONE AMONG MANY SPECIES,
ALL OF THEM TOGETHER

01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:40.160
