WHERE OTHER SEES $AND GLOOM,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
E.O. WILSON SEES SIGNS OF

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
LIFE.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'M PUTTING IT IN -- I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'M PUTTING MY HOPE PRIMARILY

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
IN HUMAN COMMON SENSE.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
YOU KNOW, I LIKE WHAT ABBA EBAN

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
ONCE SAID, "WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
MEN TURN TO REASON."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.000
MEANWHILE, IN THE SHADOW OF

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
THE CAPITOL, THE STRUGGLE TO

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
RECLAIM A NEIGHBORHOOD, AND SAVE

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
LIVES.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
WE'RE JUST THE BEGINNING OF

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
BEAUTIFUL.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
ON THIS EDITION OF BILL

MOYERS "JOURNAL."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
FROM OUR STUDIOS IN NEW YORK,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
BILL

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Moyers: WELCOME TO THE

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
"JOURNAL."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
OUR SIX-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON IS A

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
CELEBRATED ANT-CATCHER IN OUR

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
HOUSEHOLD.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
HE GAVE ME THIS LATEST SPECIMEN

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
FOR MY RECENT BIRTHDAY.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I LOOK AT IT AND FIND MYSELF

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
WONDERING THAT A CHILD'S

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
CURIOSITY CAN LEAD TO A LIFETIME

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
OF LEARNING, AND FINALLY TO AN

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALL LIVING

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
THINGS.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'M NOT MAKING THAT UP.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
E.O. WILSON.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
AS A BOY IN ALABAMA, HE

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
DISCOVERED THE FIRE ANT AND WENT

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
ON TO BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
PREEMINENT SCIENTISTS, RENOWNED

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
AS A BIOLOGIST, WITH 25 BOOKS TO

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
HIS CREDIT, TWO PULITZER PRIZES

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
AND HONORS GALORE.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
THE IVORY BILLED WOODPECKER

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
COUNTS HIM A SOULMATE, AND

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
THERE'S NOT AN ANTHILL IN THE

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
WORLD THAT WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
HIM PEERING DOWN INTO IT.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
ALL THIS, A GREAT MARRIAGE, A

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
FINE DAUGHTER, A FILM ON HIS

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
LIFE IN THE MAKING.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
LAURELS TO REST ON FROM NOW TO

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
KINGDOM COME, IF THERE IS ONE.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
NOW IN HIS EIGHTH DECADE, HE'S

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
BEEN OFFERED ONE MORE WISH.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000
IS.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
THIS SHOULD BE A BIG SCIENCE

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
PROJECT.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Moyers: AT THE RECENT TED

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
CONFERENCE-- AN ANNUAL GATHERING

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
OF BIG THINKERS IN TECHNOLOGY,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
ENTERTAINMENT AND DESIGN-- E.O.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.000
WILSON WAS ASKED TO MAKE A WISH

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
THAT COULD "CHANGE THE WORLD."

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
THE SEARCH FOR LIFE TO

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
UNDERSTAND IT AND FINALLY ABOVE

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
ALL TO PRESERVE IT.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
THAT IS MY WISH AND LET US CALL

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
IT THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LIFE.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Moyers: HE SHOWED THEM A

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
MOCK-UP OF WHAT HE HAS IN MIND;

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
A DIGITAL ONLINE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
EVERY SINGLE LIVING SPECIES ON

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
EARTH.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
SCIENTISTS AND LAYMEN EVERYWHERE

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
COULD REFER TO IT AND WOULD BE

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
ENCOURAGED TO CONTRIBUTE TO IT.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
IT WOULD START OUT AS A

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
SCIENTIFIC COMPENDIUM OF

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT A GIVEN

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
SPECIES, AND BECOME A MAGNET FOR

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
NEW INFORMATION, IMMEDIATELY

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
TRANSLATED INTO MOST LANGUAGES,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
OPEN AND FREE TO EVERYONE FROM

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
FIRST GRADERS TO BIOLOGISTS IN

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
THE FIELD OR IN THE LABORATORY.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A DREAM OF

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
MINE, BILL, OF CLASSIFYING ALL

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
THE SPECIES AND FINDING OUT WHAT

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
MAKES UP THE BIOSPHERE.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
WE'RE MAYBE TODAY ABOUT ONE-

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
TENTH THROUGH THE DISCOVERY OF

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
SPECIES, MAYBE 90%--

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Moyers: THAT'S ALL WE KNOW

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
TODAY?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
10% OF THE EXISTING SPECIES?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.000
YEAH.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THE VAST

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
MAJORITY OF KINDS OF ANIMALS

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
MOSTLY AND MICROORGANISMS ON

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
EARTH.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
WE LIVE IN AN UNEXPLORED PLANET.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Moyers: WELL, THAT SHOWS HOW

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
UNINFORMED I AM BECAUSE I

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
FIGURED YOU ALL HAD PRETTY WELL

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
MADE THE FINAL CENSUS OF

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
EVERYTHING THAT'S ALIVE ON

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
EARTH.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
WELL, YOU MAKE MY POINT.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
WE HAVE SCARCELY BEGUN.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
ONCE IT'S ONLINE, IT WILL ALLOW

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
YOU TO GO TO YOUR COMPUTER

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, SINGLE

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
ACCESS ON COMMAND, PULL UP ANY

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
SPECIES OUT OF THE TENS OF

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
MILLIONS ON EARTH, PULL UP WAYS

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
TO IDENTIFY SPECIES IF YOU HAVE

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
A PLANT OR AN INSECT IN FRONT OF

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.000
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT, AND FIND

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
OUT EVERYTHING THAT IS KNOWN

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
ABOUT IT UP TO THAT TIME.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Moyers: SORT OF A YOUTUBE OF

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
BUGS, INSECTS, AND FUNGI, RIGHT?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
YES, AND EVERYTHING.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Moyers: EVERYTHING.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
AND PEOPLE SAY THIS IS

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
AMAZING, "THAT CAN'T BE DONE."

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I HAD RECENTLY--

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Moyers: YEAH, IT'S AMAZING,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
ED, IT CAN'T BE DONE.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
WELL, A VERY DISTINGUISHED

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
SCIENTIST WROTE ME RECENTLY WHEN

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE ON THIS

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
SEVERAL YEARS AGO, THAT THIS WAS

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
WHAT WE MUST DO.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
AND HE SAYS LITERALLY "ED, WHAT

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
HAVE YOU BEEN SMOKING?"

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Moyers: SO I CAN SEE WHAT

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
THIS WILL DO FOR THE PROTEGES OF

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
ED WILSON.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
WHAT WILL IT DO FOR MY FIVE

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
GRANDCHILDREN?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
A LOT.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
CONSIDER HOW IGNORANT WE ARE AND

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
WE DON'T KNOW THE GREAT MAJORITY

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
OF THE KINDS OF CREATURES LIVING

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
IN MOST PONDS OR PATCHES OF

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
WOODS THAT YOU WOULD PICK EVEN

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
AROUND HERE.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.000
THIS MEANS THAT WHEN WE'RE

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
PLANNING THE ENVIRONMENT, WE'RE

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
TRYING TO STABILIZE THE

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
ENVIRONMENT, WE'RE TRYING TO GET

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, WE'RE

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
TRYING TO STOP THE ECOSYSTEM

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
FROM COLLAPSING IN THE FACE OF

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
GLOBAL WARMING OR WHATEVER.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
WE REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
EACH ONE OF THOSE HABITATS.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
IT'S LIKE UNDERTAKING A MEDICAL

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
EXAMINATION BY YOUR DOCTOR MAYBE

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
NOT FEELING TOO WELL, YOU KNOW?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING, BUT YOUR

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
DOCTOR EXAMINES YOU AND HE ONLY

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
KNOWS 10% OF WHAT'S INSIDE YOU

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
IN ALL OF THE ORGANS.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
WE NEED THEN TO MOVE ECOLOGY WAY

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
AHEAD OF WHERE IT IS TODAY,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
REALLY CHANGE THINGS.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Moyers: NO ONE IN OUR TIME

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
HAS ADDED MORE TO OUR

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
UNDERSTANDING OF EARTH'S ECOLOGY

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
THAN ED WILSON.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
ONE OF THE WORLDS BEST KNOW

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
SCIENTISTS, WILSON'S EXPLORATION

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
OF NATURE STARTED IN MOBILE,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
ALABAMA.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
AS A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY, HE

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
DISCOVERED THE VERY FIRST FIRE

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
ANT COLONY IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
WELL, I WAS AT THE PLACE

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.000
WHERE THEY WERE FIRST

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
INTRODUCED.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I DISCOVERED THE FIRST COLONY OF

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
FIRE ANTS IN THE LITTLE

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
POPULATION WHEN IT WAS JUST

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.000
BEGINNING TO SPREAD.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Moyers: NEAR MOBILE?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
YEAH, IN MOBILE.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
WE LIVED FIVE BLOCKS FROM THE

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
DOCK AREA.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
SO I CAUGHT ONE OF THE FIRST

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
COLONIES WHEN IT WAS

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
MULTIPLYING.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
IT BELONGS TO A GROUP OF SPECIES

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
OF ANTS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
SERIOUS PESTS.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Moyers: I THINK WE BOTH WOULD

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
PROBABLY STILL BE LIVING IN THE

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
SOUTH IF IT WEREN'T FOR THOSE

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.000
INFERNAL FIRE ANTS, RIGHT?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
THEY COME FROM URUGUAY, AND THEY

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
JUST KEEP SPREADING.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
AND DOWN SOUTH, YOU KNOW, WE

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
REFER TO THEM AS "FAR AIN'T,"

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
AND THAT'S NOT DIALECT.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
IT MEANS THEY COME FROM FAR AWAY

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
AND THEY AIN'T GOING HOME.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
WELL, THERE ARE THOUSANDS AND

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
THOUSANDS OF THESE SPECIES, AND

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
SOME OF THEM REALLY AREN'T THAT

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
FUNNY.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Moyers: HE IS THE PREEMINENT

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
EXPERT IN ANT BEHAVIOR AND

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
COMMUNICATION.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
HIS RESEARCH ON THESE HIGHLY

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
SOCIAL CREATURES HAS TAKEN HIM

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
ACROSS THE GLOBE, FROM THE

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
PACIFIC ISLANDS TO THE

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
CARIBBEAN, AND HAS LEAD TO

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
DISCOVERIES OF HUNDREDS OF NEW

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
SPECIES.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
HIS CONTINUOUS WORK ON ANTS AND

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000
OTHER INSECTS HELPED FORM NEW

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.000
SCIENTIFIC VIEWS ABOUT HOW

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
ANIMALS AND HUMANS EVOLVE.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
NOT ALL ANT USE VIOLENCE TO

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
DOMINATE THEIR WORLD.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
SOME USE MORE SUBTLE METHODS.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Moyers: WHERE DID YOU GET

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
THIS PASSION FOR ANTS?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
WHEN I WAS A KID.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
AS A LITTLE BOY THROUGH MY

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
TEENAGE YEARS, I BECAME

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
INCREASINGLY FASCINATED BY THE

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
DIVERSITY OF LIFE.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
ONE DAY WHEN I WAS ONLY SEVEN

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
YEARS AND FISHING, I PULLED A

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
PIN FISH-- THEY'RE CALLED WITH

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
SHARP DORSAL SPINES-- UP TOO

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
HARD AND FAST AND I BLINDED

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
MYSELF IN ONE EYE.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I LATER DISCOVERED I WAS ALSO

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
HARD OF HEARING, POSSIBLY

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
CONGENITAL, IN THE UPPER

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
REGISTER.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
SO WHEN PLANNING TO BE A

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
PROFESSIONAL NATURALIST, I NEVER

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
CONSIDERED ANYTHING ELSE IN MY

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
ENTIRE LIFE.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I FOUND I WAS LOUSY AT BIRD

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
WATCHING AND COULDN'T TRACK FROG

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
CALLS EITHER, SO I TURNED TO THE

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
TEAMING SMALL CREATURES THAT CAN

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
BE HELD BETWEEN THE THUMB AND

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
FOREFINGER.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
THE LITTLE THINGS THAT COMPOSE

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
THE FOUNDATION OF OUR

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
ECOSYSTEMS.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
THE LITTLE THINGS THAT I LIKE TO

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
SAY RUN THE WORLD.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
YOU KNOW, EVERY KID HAS A BUG

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
PERIOD AND I NEVER GREW OUT OF

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
MINE.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I JUST STARTED, AS MOST KIDS DO,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
YOU KNOW, CATCHING BUGS AND

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
FROGS IN BOTTLES AND SO ON.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Moyers: WHEN THE WILSON

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
FAMILY MOVED NORTH, HE CARRIED

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000
HIS CURIOSITY ABOUT NATURE WITH

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
HIM.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
HIS FAMILY SETTLED IN A PLACE

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
PERFECT FOR A BUDDING

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
NATURALIST.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
PROVIDENTIALLY WE LIVED WITHIN

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
WALKING DISTANCE OF ROCK CREEK

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
PARK AND THE WASHINGTON ZOO.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
SO A CHILD INTERESTED IN INSECTS

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
COMBINED WITH THE FEDERAL

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
MAGNIFICENCE DISPLAYING, YOU

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
KNOW, THE WONDERS OF NATURE,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
AND READING THE "NATIONAL

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
GEOGRAPHIC."

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
MUSTN'T MISS THE "NATIONAL

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
GEOGRAPHIC."

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
THE "NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC" WAS AN

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
INSPIRATION TO ME.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
YOU KNOW, ALL THOSE GREAT

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
PICTURES OF WHAT THEY CALLED

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
BEETLES, JEWELS OF THE JUNGLE.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
AND, YOU KNOW, BUTTERFLIES,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
MAGNIFICENT INSECTS OF THE WORLD

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
AND SO ON.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
YOU KNOW, I PORED OVER THAT.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
AND THAT'S... I SAID, "HOW CAN I

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
BE OTHERWISE?"

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
OTHER THAN AN NATURALIST.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO ALL MY

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.000
LIFE.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Moyers: I WOULD HAVE THOUGHTÑi

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
THAT GROWING UP IN MOBILE YOU

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
MIGHT HAVE BECOME A DEVOTEE

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
OF... WHAT WAS IT?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
THE LORD GOD BIRD?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
YES, IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
THE LORD GOD BIRD.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
INTERESTING NAME FOR THAT.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
THAT'S THE IVORY-BILLED

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
WOODPECKER

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Moyers: NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY, "LORD GOD,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
WHAT KIND OF BIRD IS THAT?"

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
THAT'S HOW IT GOT THE NAME.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Moyers: IT WASN'T THAT

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
COMMON.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.000
NO, I KNOW.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
YOU KNOW, THESE...

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Moyers: WE HAD SOME OVER IN

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
LOUISIANA, NEAR EAST TEXAS, YOU

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
KNOW?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.000
YEAH, AT THE SINGER TRACK.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Moyers: RIGHT.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
THAT'S WHERE THE LAST ONE WAS

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
SEEN IN 1944.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Moyers: THE LAST ONE?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
YEAH, A LITTLE BOY USED TO GO

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
OUT TO SEE THE LAST KNOWN ONE AT

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
A CERTAIN SPOT IN SINGER.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
IT WAS A VERY SAD STORY.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
THE SINGER RESERVE HAD BEEN CUT

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
OVER AND THE IVORY BILLS JUST

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
WENT DOWN.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.000
AND THEN THERE WAS FINALLY JUST

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
ONE LEFT.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
A LITTLE BOY WOULD GO AND WATCH

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
IT UNTIL ONE DAY A STORM CAME

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
OVER THERE, AND THEN HE COULDN'T

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
SEE IT ANYMORE.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
AND THAT WAS THE LAST IT WAS

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
SEEN UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Moyers: YEAH, ONE WAS SPOTTED

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
IN EASTERN ARKANSAS.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
UH-HUH, YEAH.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Moyers: '05.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
2005.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.000
YEAH.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Moyers: WHY... BUT WHY SHOULD

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
WE CARE IF THE WOODPECKER GOES?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I MEAN, WE'VE LOST... HOW MANY

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:42.000
SPECIES HAVE WE LOST?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SPECIES

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WE'VE LOST IN THE MILLENNIUM.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
NO.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
BUT HOW MANY SPECIES GOING

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
EXTINCT OR BECOMING VERY RARE DO

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
YOU THINK IT TAKES BEFORE YOU

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
SEE SOMETHING HAPPENING?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
WE NOW KNOW FROM EXPERIMENTS AND

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
THEORY THAT THE MORE SPECIES YOU

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
TAKE OUT OF AN ECO... YOU KNOW,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AN ECOSYSTEM LIKE A POND, PATCH

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
OF FOREST, A LITTLE BIT OF

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
MARINE SHALLOW ENVIRONMENTS, THE

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
MORE YOU TAKE OUT THE LESS

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
STABLE IT BECOMES.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
IT NOW IS LESS LIKELY YOU HAVE A

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
TSUNAMI OR YOU HAVE A SEVERE

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
DROUGHT OR YOU HAVE A FIRE, THE

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
LESS LIKELY THAT THAT ECOSYSTEM,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
THAT BODY OF SPECIES IN THAT

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT IS GOING

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
TO COME BACK ALL THE WAY.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.000
SO IT BECOMES LESS STABLE WITH

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
FEWER SPECIES.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
AND THEN WE ALSO KNOW IT BECOMES

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
LESS PRODUCTIVE.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S NOT ABLE TO

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
PRODUCE AS MANY KILOGRAMS OF NEW

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
MATTER FROM PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
PASSAGE THROUGH THE ECOSYSTEM.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
IT'S LESS PRODUCTIVE.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
IT SURE IS LESS INTERESTING,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
THOUGH, ISN'T IT?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
AND MORE THAN THAT WE LOSE THE

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
SERVICES OF THESE SPECIES.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Moyers: THE SERVICES OF THESE

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.000
SPECIES?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
YES SERVICES OF THESE SPECIES

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
TO US.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
LIKE POLLINATION AND WATER

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
PURIFICATION.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Moyers: THAT WE GET FREE FROM

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
NATURE.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.000
YEAH.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
HERE'S AN EASY WAY TO REMEMBER

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
IT.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
WE GET FROM NATURE SCOT-FREE--

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
SO LONG AS WE DON'T SCREW IT UP

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
AND DESTROY IT-- APPROXIMATELY

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
THE SAME AMOUNT OF SERVICES AS

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
FAR AS YOU CAN MEASURE THEM IN

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
DOLLARS AS WE OURSELVES PRODUCE

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
EACH YEAR.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
IT WAS ABOUT $30 TRILLION A

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
YEAR.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:36.000
"T," TRILLION.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
AND THESE CREATURES THEY HAVE

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
BUILT IN THEM, IN THEIR GENES

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
AND THEN IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGY AN

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
ENDLESS ARRAY OF DEFENSES, MANY

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
OF WHICH WE COULD USE AND WE

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
HAVE USED, LIKE PRODUCING

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
ANTIBIOTICS WE NEVER HEARD OF

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
USING CHEMICALS THAT WE NEVER

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
DREAMED EXISTED.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000
AND SO WE HAVE ALREADY BENEFITED

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
IMMENSELY FROM WILD SPECIES IN

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THAT WAY.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
BUT YOU KNOW, LET ME GET TO THE

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
BOTTOM LINE AS FAR AS I'M

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
CONCERNED.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
AND THAT IS ISN'T IT MORALLY

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
WRONG TO DESTROY THE REST OF

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
LIFE, YOU KNOW, IN ANY WAY YOU

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
LOOK AT IT FOR WHAT IT'S GOING

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
TO DO TO HUMAN SPIRIT AND

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
AESTHETICS?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Moyers: ARE WE DESTROYING IT?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
WELL, YES, WE ARE.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
IF WE DO NOT ABATE THE VARIOUS

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
CHANGES WE'RE CAUSING CLIMATE,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
HABITAT DESTRUCTION, THE

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
WE WILL, BY THE END OF THE

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
CENTURY, LOSE OR HAVE RIGHT AT

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION ABOUT

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
HALF THE SPECIES OF PLANTS AND

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
ANIMALS IN THE WORLD, CERTAINLY

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
ON THE LAND.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Moyers: HALF THAT WE HAVE

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
NOW?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
YEAH, HALF.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Moyers: WILL BE GONE BY THE

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.000
END OF THE 21st CENTURY?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
YEAH.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Moyers: MANY BIOLOGISTS

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
BELIEVE WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF A

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
MASSIVE WAVE OF EXTINCTIONS

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
ACROSS THE NATURAL WORLD.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
EVERYTHING FROM CORAL,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
BUTTERFLIES, TIGERS, AND APES

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
ARE THREATENED.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
THE U.N. RECENTLY REPORTED THAT

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
IN JUST 30 YEARS, ONE QUARTER OF

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
ALL MAMMALS WILL BE EXTINCT.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
AS WE CONTINUE TO CHIP AWAY AT

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
NATURAL HABITATS, ALTER THE

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
CLIMATE AND CONSUME THE EARTH'S

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
RESOURCES AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
PACE, SCIENTISTS SAY WE'RE

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
TRIGGERING AN EXTINCTION CRISIS

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
UNLIKE ANY THE EARTH HAS SEEN

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
ED WILSON'S 2002 BOOK "THE

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
FUTURE OF LIFE" WAS A WAKE-UP

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
CALL.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000
NOW HE'S WRITTEN THIS ONE, "THE

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
CREATION," ADDRESSED TO

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
RELIGIOUS FOLKS IN PARTICULAR

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
STATING THAT IF THIS RISE IN

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
EXTINCTION CONTINUES, THE COST

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000
TO HUMANITY WILL BE

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
CATASTROPHIC.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
YOU WRITE THAT WE HUMANS HAVE

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
BECOME A JUGGERNAUT?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
YES.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Moyers: YOU USE THE METAPHOR

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
OF A GIANT METEORITE.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
WE HUMAN BEINGS ARE A GIANT

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
METEORITE.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
YEAH.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Moyers: THE BIGGEST AND MOST

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
DAMAGING THE EARTH HAS EVER

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
KNOWN.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT WE ARE A

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
HUGE METEORITE?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
WELL, 65 MILLION YEARS AGO,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
THIS NOW IS PRETTY WELL

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
ESTABLISHED, EARTH WAS STRUCK BY

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.000
AN UNUSUALLY LARGE METEORITE OFF

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
THE COAST OF WHAT IS NOW

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
YUCATAN.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
AND EVEN THOUGH THAT MAY HAVE

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
ONLY BEEN ABOUT TEN KILOMETERS

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
ACROSS, ITS POWER WHEN IT STRUCK

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
THE WORLD CAUSED GIGANTIC

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
TSUNAMIS OVER A LARGE PART OF

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
THE WORLD.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
IT RANG THE EARTH'S SURFACE LIKE

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
A BELL.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS OCCURRED.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
CLOUDS FORMED OVER THE EARTH

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
THAT DROPPED... KNOCKED OUT SUN

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
AND GREATLY REDUCED

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
A MAJORITY OF SPECIES OF PLANTS

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
AND ANIMALS DIED.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
AND AMONG THE GROUPS THAT DIEDñr

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
OUT FINALLY AND CONCLUSIVELY AT

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
THAT TIME WERE THE DINOSAURS.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
SO WHAT WE ARE DOING IF WE DON'T

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
TAKE CARE OF THE LIVING

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
ENVIRONMENT, THEN WE'RE GOING TO

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
GO START, BY THE END OF THIS

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
CENTURY, GETTING PRETTY CLOSE TO

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
THE IMPACT OF THAT BIG METEORITE

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
65 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Moyers: AND HOW WOULD THAT

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
CHANGE LIFE ON EARTH?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
WELL, WE JUST LIVE IN AN

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
IMPOVERISHED ENVIRONMENT.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
IT'D BE A LOT TOUGHER.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
WE WOULDN'T HAVE AS MANY

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
POLLINATORS.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
WE WOULDN'T HAVE AS MANY FUTURE

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
CROPS AND GENES TO FEED

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
OURSELVES.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
OF SECURITY GIVEN TO US FREE IN

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
TERMS OF WATER MANAGEMENT.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
ALL SORTS OF THINGS WOULD HAPPEN

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
IN THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
BUT IT... I MEAN, IT SHOULD BE A

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
HORROR TO PEOPLE.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Moyers: I'M SITTING HERE

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
TRYING TO BELIEVE IS THIS

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
DISTINGUISHED MAN, WINNER OF TWO

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
PULITZER PRIZES, AUTHOR OF 25

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
BOOKS, TELLING ME THAT HE

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
CONCEIVES OF THE OBLITERATION OF

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
NATURE?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
YES.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Moyers: THE OBLITERATION OF

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
NATURE?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
YES.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
AND DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
PEOPLE ACTUALLY SAY THAT'LL BE A

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
GOOD THING?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Moyers: WHY?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT IT'S

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
THE FATE OF HUMANITY TO GO ON

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
HUMANIZING THE PLANET AND TURN

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
THIS PLANET LITERALLY INTO

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
SPACESHIP EARTH.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
IN OTHER WORDS--

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Moyers: LIVE IN A SYNTHETIC

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
ECOSYSTEM.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
YES THAT'S RIGHT OR PEOPLE

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
WHO SAY, "WELL, LET'S KEEP ON

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
GOING THE WAY WE'RE GOING.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
LET'S USE UP THE EARTH.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
AND BY THAT TIME, OUR SMART

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
SCIENTISTS"-- TRUST ME, I'M A

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
SCIENTIST, AND I'M... NONE OF US

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
COULD BE VERY THAT SMART.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
BUT THEY FIGURE THAT THEY...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
THAT BY THAT TIME MAYBE WE CAN

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
MAKE IT TO THE NEXT PLANET,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
TERRAFORM IT, YOU KNOW?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
TURN IT INTO AN EARTH-LIKE PLACE

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
AND SO FORTH.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
DREAM ON.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
THIS IS CRAZY.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
THIS IS THE ONLY PLANET WE'RE

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
EVER GOING TO HAVE.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
THIS PLANET HAS TAKEN TENS,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS TO

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
CREATE THIS BEAUTIFUL NATURAL

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
ENVIRONMENT WE HAVE THAT'S TAKEN

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
CARE OF US SO WELL THAT IS, IN

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
FACT, OUR GREATEST NATURAL

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
HERITAGE, AND WE'RE THROWING IT

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AWAY IN A MATTER OF A FEW

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
DECADES.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Moyers: BUT WHAT IS THE

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
SERIOUS RESPONSE TO THE ARGUMENT

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
THAT, LOOK, WE HUMAN BEINGS HAVE

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
ALWAYS ADAPTED TO SEVERE... TO

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I MEAN, SOME COME, SOME GO.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
THE MAYANS ARE GONE, THE

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
SUMERIANS ARE GONE, THE AZTECS

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.000
ARE GONE, BUT HUMAN BEINGS ARE

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
STILL HERE.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
WE HAVE CONSTANTLY ADAPTED.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
WE WILL ADAPT TO THE

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
CIRCUMSTANCES WILSON IS

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
DESCRIBING.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
YES, BUT CONSIDER THIS.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
IN TERMS OF EVOLUTION, YOU KNOW,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
THE COMMON RESPONSE IS, "WELL,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
EVOLUTION ALWAYS PROVIDED NEW

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
SPECIES."

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000
WELL, THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
THE BIRTH RATE OF SPECIES IS

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
GOING DOWN.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
WHY IS IT GOING DOWN?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
BECAUSE WE'RE DESTROYING THE

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
CRADLES IN WHICH NEW SPECIES ARE

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
BORN, THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
SO WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
WELL, IF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
DECIDED THAT IT WANTS TO LIVE IN

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING IS

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
ARTIFACTUAL AND THE PRODUCT OF

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
OUR BRAINS WE GIVE AWAY THIS

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
GREAT HERITAGE AND ALL OF THIS

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
MYSTERY AND BEAUTY AND

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
COMPLEXITY THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
BEGUN TO EXPLORE, WELL, I GUESS

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
IF THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WANT,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
GET.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
BUT I HAVE MORE FAITH IN HUMAN

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
BEINGS' INTELLIGENCE AND TASTE

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
THAN THAT.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Moyers: BUT WASN'T

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
CIVILIZATION PURCHASED BY THE

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
SUBVERSION OF NATURE?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
IT WAS.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
AND THAT'S WHY WE DESTROYED SO

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
MUCH ALREADY.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
WHEN THE... THE AGRICULTURE

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
REVOLUTION BEGAN, AS YOU KNOW,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
ABOUT 10,000 YEARS AGO, WE WENT

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
FROM A HUNTER/GATHERER EXISTENCE

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WHERE WE WERE MORE OR LESS IN

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
BALANCE-- WE WEREN'T WIPING OUT

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
SPECIES AT ANY GREAT RATE-- TO

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
ONE IN WHICH WE BEGAN TO TURN

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
PARTICULARLY FORESTS AND THE

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
GRASSLANDS, INTO AGRICULTURAL

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
FIELDS.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
THAT PROCEEDED TO AN EXTENT THAT

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
IT DID, DID FORM THE ECONOMIC

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
BASIS FOR GREAT HUMAN POPULATION

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
GROWTH AND FOR THE EVOLUTION OF

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
CIVILIZATION.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THAT'S NOT

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
A GOOD?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
IT'S JUST THAT HAVING... THAT IT

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
TOOK A MILLION YEARS FOR

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
HUMANITY, YOU KNOW, COMING

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
THROUGH THESE EARLY STAGES

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE IN NATURE

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
TO FINALLY LEARN HOW TO BREAK

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
NATURE.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
AND WE DID THAT 10,000 YEARS

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
AGO, AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
BREAK IT.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
AND NOW WE REALIZE THAT WE'VE

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
GOT TO PUT ON THE BRAKES AND

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
BRING THIS TO A HALT.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
DOWN.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
IT'S DOWN NOW... MANY OF THE

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS IN THE WORLD,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ONES TOOK 10%

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
OF WHAT IT WAS, AND WE'RE NOT

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
STOPPING.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
WE'RE GOING TO BE THROUGH THE

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000
WHOLE BIT OF IT IN MANY PARTS OF

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
THE WORLD UNLESS WE DO

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
SOMETHING.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NEAR THE

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
END OF NATURE IN MANY PARTS OF

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
THE WORLD.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Moyers: THE END OF NATURE.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
THE END OF... WHAT DO YOU MEAN

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
BY--

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I MEAN THE END OF A LARGE

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
PART OF THE REST OF LIFE ON THE

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
PLANET.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Moyers: THE LIFE THAT CAN...

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
COULD SURVIVE WITHOUT US.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000
OH, IT WOULD DO WONDERFULLY

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
WELL WITHOUT US.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Moyers: WELL, THAT'S WHAT I

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
WANTED TO ASK.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I MEAN, LET'S... NATURE WAS

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB BEFORE

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
WE ARRIVED AS THE LATECOMERS,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
RIGHT?

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.000
WONDERFULLY WELL.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Moyers: WONDERFULLY WELL.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
SO WHERE DID THIS IDEA COME FROM

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
THAT WE'RE THE CROWN JEWEL OF

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000
CREATION?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
WELL, YOU KNOW, I SORT OF

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
THINK WE ARE, IN ONE SENSE.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
THAT IS TO SAY, WE ARE THE BRAIN

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
OF THE BIOSPHERE.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
WE ARE THE ONES THAT FINALLY,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
AFTER 4.5 BILLION YEARS OF

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
EVOLUTION-- THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
TO GET WHERE WE ARE-- ACTUALLY

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
DEVELOPED ENOUGH POWER,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
REASONING POWER TO SEE WHAT'S

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
HAPPENING TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
HISTORY THAT CREATED US AND TO

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.000
REALIZE ALMOST TOO LATE WHAT

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
WE'RE DOING.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
SO IN THE SENSE THAT WE ARE

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
SOMETHING NEW UNDER THE SUN AND

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
ON THE EARTH, WE HAVE AN

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
ENORMOUS... WE'RE THE ONES THAT

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
CAN DESTROY THE WORLD.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.000
NO OTHER SINGLE SPECIES EVER HAD

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT POWER.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
WE HAVE THE POWER TO DESTROY THE

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
WORLD, THE LIVING WORLD.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
AND WE ALSO HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
TO AVOID DOING IT.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
AND IT'S... IT'S SORT OF A RACE

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
TO THE FINISH LINE THAT WE WILL

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
DEVELOP THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
POLICIES AND THE DECENCY TO

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
BRING IT TO A HALT, NOT JUST FOR

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
LIFE ITSELF, BUT FOR FUTURE

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
GENERATIONS BEFORE, YOU KNOW,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
THE JUGGERNAUT TAKES US OVER.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Moyers: WHY ARE WE ESCALATING

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
SO RAPIDLY NOW THE DESTRUCTIVE

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:16.000
IMPACT OF OUR BEHAVIOR?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
IT'S... IT'S MAINLY THAT

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
IT... WE'RE JUST BEING THE KIND

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
OF RECKLESS, IGNORANT, UNCARING

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
SPECIES WE'VE BEEN UP 'TIL NOW

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
THAT'S DOING THE DAMAGE.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
WE'RE STILL INCREASING IN

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
NUMBERS.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
WE'RE AT 6.5 BILLION.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
HOWEVER, WE'RE GOING TO... WE'RE

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
SLOWING.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Moyers: YEAH, THE PREDICTION

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
IS THAT WHEN WE REACH NINE

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
BILLION WE'LL BEGIN TO--

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
YEAH, WE'LL PEAK.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
SO THAT'S 40% MORE THAN WHAT WE

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
HAVE NOW.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THAT.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
THAT RIGHT NOW IS A SERIOUS

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
PROBLEM.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
IT'S NOT THE BIG PROBLEM.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
THE BIG PROBLEM IS CONSUMPTION.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
RISING PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
SO THIS IS WHY THE WORLD HAS GOT

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
TO HAVE A GREEN REVOLUTION.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Moyers: AND BY THAT YOU MEAN?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
I MEAN, LET'S KEEP ON

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
IMPROVING OUR QUALITY OF LIFE,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
BUT LET'S FIGURE OUT-- AND WE'VE

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
GOT THE BRAINS TO DO IT-- OF HOW

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
TO INCREASE THE ECONOMY GROWING

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
IMPROVING WITH FEWER AND FEWER

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
MATERIALS AND LESS AND LESS

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
FOSSIL BASED OR NON-RENEWAL...

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.000
RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Moyers: SO YOU'RE PUTTING

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
YOUR HOPE IN NEW TECHNOLOGY?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
I'M PUTTING MY HOPE PRIMARILY

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
IN HUMAN COMMON SENSE.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
YOU KNOW, I LIKE WHAT ABBA EBAN

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
ONCE SAID DURING THE 1967 WAR.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
HE SAID, "WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
MEN TURN TO REASON."

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
AND I THINK WE ARE AT THE STAGE

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
NOW WE ARE READY TO TURN TO

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
REASON.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
NOW IF WE CAN ONLY PERSUADE THE

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
LEADERSHIP OF THE STRONGEST AND

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000
WEALTHIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
TO GAIN THIS UNDERSTANDING, THEN

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
THE TECHNOLOGY WILL BECOME

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
RELATIVELY EASY.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
THAT IS TO GO GREEN AND PUT LESS

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
OF WHAT WE CALL THE ECOLOGICAL

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
FOOTPRINT ONTO THE WORLD.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
WE'LL EASE UP ON THE REST OF THE

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
WORLD AND BECOME SUSTAINABLE AND

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
ALLOW THE REST OF LIFE TO

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
SURVIVE AND COME THROUGH.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I LIKE TO CALL IT THE

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
BOTTLENECK.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:23.000
COME THROUGH THE BOTTLENECK

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
WE'RE IN NOW.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
WE'LL COME OUT THE OTHER END IF

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
WE USE OUR HEAD WITH THE KIND OF

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
IMPROVED LIVES THAT WE ALL DREAM

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
OF AND WITH BRINGING AS MUCH OF

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
THE REST OF LIFE WITH US AS

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
POSSIBLE.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY I SAY WHAT

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
WE'RE DOING NOW, IF WE DON'T

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
STOP IT, IS THE FOLLY OUR

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
DESCENDENTS WILL LEAST LIKELY

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
FORGIVE US 100 YEARS NOW, 200

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
YEARS.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
THEY SAID, "WHAT DID THEY THINK

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
THEY WERE DOING?"

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Moyers: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
THAT SO MANY SMART PEOPLE REMAIN

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
PASSIVE IN THE FACE OF THE

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
DESTRUCTION OF THE CONDITIONS

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
FOR SURVIVAL?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Moyers: I ASK THE QUESTIONS,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
ED.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
YOU'RE A SCIENTIST.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
YOU FIND OUT THE ANSWERS.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
YOU TALK TO SO MANY SMART

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000
PEOPLE, I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
COME UP WITH A QUICK ANSWER.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
IF I KNEW, I'D... I WOULD FIGURE

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
OUT WITH OTHERS BETTER WAYS OF

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
PERSUASION.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
IT REALLY IS SLOW.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
IT'S SLOW IN TAKING OVER.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Moyers: WHAT WOULD THE

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
STEWARDSHIP OF THE EARTH MEAN TO

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
US PERSONALLY?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
IF I SAID, "I'M GOING TO TAKE MY

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
SHARE OF THE RESPONSIBILITY,"

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000
WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO ME

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
PERSONALLY?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
I THINK MOST PEOPLE LISTENING

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
WANT TO DO SOMETHING.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
IT CAN BE FROM JUST BEING

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
LOCALLY ACTIVE IN SAVING A

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
WOODLAND ALONG A NEARBY RIVER OR

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
REGIONALLY IN ALLYING YOURSELF

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
WITH A DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
ENVIRONMENT, WHICH-- OR ONE OF

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
THE CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
WORKS LOCALLY-- TO ENSURE THAT A

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
CERTAIN BIOLOGICALLY RICH AREA

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
OR WETLAND IS SET ASIDE AS A

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
PARK AND A RESERVE RATHER THAN

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
BEING TURNED OVER TO DEVELOPERS.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
BUT LET ME TELL YOU THE ONE THAT

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
I THINK MOST PEOPLE MIGHT BE

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
LISTENING TO US KNOW THE ANSWER.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
WE NEED LEADERSHIP.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
WE DESPERATELY NEED LEADERSHIP

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
THAT WORKS OFF OF WHAT WE HAVE

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
LEARNED THROUGH SCIENCE, THAT

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
HAS PRODUCED A CONSENSUS ABOUT

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE EARTH'S

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000
ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
LIVING CREATION.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000
AND SEES THE POTENTIAL IN IT AND

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
NOT JUST THE NEED IN IT AND

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
GIVES, IN THIS COUNTRY

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
ESPECIALLY, THE KIND OF VISION

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
OF A FUTURE THAT WE CAN WORK FOR

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
AS A PEOPLE TOWARD, AS A PEOPLE,

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000
THAT I THINK PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
FOR.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Moyers: THERE IS A BIAS,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
THOUGH, AT THE MOMENT AGAINST

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
SCIENCE THAT DISRUPTS OUR

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
RELIGIOUS BELIEF OR SCIENCE THAT

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
DIMINISHES OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
RIGHT.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
BOTH BASED UPON MISCONCEPTIONS.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Moyers: HOW SO?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
A GREENING OF AMERICA MEANS

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
NEW MARKETS, NEW WAYS OF

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
DEVELOPING RESOURCES, NEW

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
TECHNOLOGIES, NEW DIRECTIONS,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
NEW ERAS OF EDUCATION, TRAINING,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
AND ON.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
SO AS FAR AS ECONOMY IS

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
CONCERNED, THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
AS FAR AS RELIGION IS CONCERNED

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
I HAVE... I HAVE A VERY

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
DIFFERENT VIEW FROM WHAT MANY

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
SCIENTISTS AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
HAVE OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
AND THAT IS, HAVING GROWN UP AS

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
A SOUTHERN BAPTIST--

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Moyers: YOU ANSWERED THE

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
ALTAR CALL.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
YOU WENT UNDER THE WATER.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I DID.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000
AND I GREW UP IN ONE OF THE

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
REDDEST OF THE RED STATES.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
AND I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
FOR THEM, YOU KNOW, FOLKS WHO

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
ARE CALLED THESE DAYS EVEN

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
FUNDAMENTALISTS AND THE 42% OF

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000
AMERICANS IDENTIFIED AS

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
EVANGELICAL.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I LIKE THEM.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
I THINK THEY'RE HIGHLY

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
INTELLIGENT AND A LARGE

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
PERCENTAGE OF THEM HIGHLY

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000
EDUCATED AND SO ON.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
SO IT'S ALWAYS OCCURRED TO ME

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
THAT THE SCHISM BETWEEN

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
SCIENTISTS, AGREED MOST ARE

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
LIBERAL AND NON-BELIEVERS, AND

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF AMERICANS,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
75%, YOU KNOW, WHO COULD BE

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
CALLED RELIGIOUS TO SOME EXTENT

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
WAS... MIGHT BE AN ARTIFACT.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Moyers: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
HAVE IN COMMON WITH CONSERVATIVE

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
CHRISTIAN?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
WELL, ACTUALLY, JUST ABOUT

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
EVERYTHING EXCEPT CERTAIN

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
BELIEFS OF WHERE IT ALL CAME

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
FROM AND WHO'S LOOKING OVER US.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
WE ARE MUCH CLOSER TOGETHER.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
I COULD GO DOWN, YOU KNOW, AND

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
PICK A PASTOR FROM SOME SMALL

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
COUNTRY CHURCH ALONG THE BYWAY

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
OF THE HIGH... OF ALABAMA AND

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I'LL BET WE'D-- AS I SUGGESTED

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
IN THAT BOOK-- WE SAT DOWN AND

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
TALKED ABOUT OUR DEEPEST BELIEFS

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
TOGETHER, WE'D COME UP WITH MORE

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
AGREEMENTS, AGREEMENTS ON MORE

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
THINGS THAN DISAGREEMENTS.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.000
AND THEN ISN'T IT THE AMERICAN

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
WAY?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
WE COULD SAY, "LET'S PUT THAT

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
ASIDE FOR AWHILE AND WORK

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
TOGETHER WHEN WE REALLY HAVE

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
TOGETHER ON."

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Moyers: YEAH, BUT, ED,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
BUT MANY OF THE CHRISTIANS WHO

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
READ THE BIBLE LITERALLY REJECT

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
THE CONCLUSION OF YOU SCIENTISTS

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.000
THAT WE'VE EVOLVED FROM LOWER

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
FORMS.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
I MEAN, THEY BELIEVE THE EARTH

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
IS NOT OUR HOME.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
WE'RE HEAVEN BOUND.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
SOME OF THEM BELIEVE THE SECOND

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
COMING OF JESUS IS SO

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
IMMINENT...

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.000
I KNOW.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Moyers: ...THAT CARING FOR

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
THE EARTH IS OF LITTLE

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
CONSEQUENCE.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
BUT YOU...

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
NOW...

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Moyers: ...YOU ADDRESSED THIS

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
BOOK, YOUR LATEST BOOK, "THE

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
CREATION: AN APPEAL TO SAVE LIFE

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
ON EARTH," TO A SOUTHERN BAPTIST

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000
PASTOR.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.000
YOU AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
YES.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Moyers: WE GREW UP WITH THEM.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
YES.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Moyers: WHY DID YOU WRITE

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
THIS BOOK TO A SOUTHERN BAPTIST

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
PASTOR?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
WELL, I DID PARTLY BECAUSE

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
THAT'S MY BACKGROUND.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
ALTHOUGH, I'M NOW A SECULAR

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
HUMANIST.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
A REAL... A THOROUGH GOING

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
SECULARIST.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
IT'S MY BACKGROUND.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000
I UNDERSTOOD IT.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I RESPECTED GREATLY THE PEOPLE

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000
OF THE CULTURE I GREW UP IN.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
BUT ALSO, THERE WAS THE NEW YORK

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.000
EFFECT, WHAT I CALL THE NEW YORK

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
EFFECT.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
IN ADDRESSING EVANGELICALS

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
INSTEAD OF UNITARIANS.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Moyers: WELL, THERE'S A LOT

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
MORE OF 'EM FOR ONE THING.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
( LAUGHTER )

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.000
THERE ARE MORE BAPTISTS IN TEXAS

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
THAN THERE ARE PEOPLE, AND I

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000
GUESS THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE OF

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.000
ALABAMA.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
SO, YOU ADDRESSED THEM...

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE MUSCULAR.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:30.000
THEY'RE POWERFUL.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
WELL, ALSO  AS I SAY, THE NEW

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
YORK EFFECT IS THAT IF YOU CAN

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
MAKE IT IN NEW YORK, YOU CAN

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.000
MAKE IT ANYWHERE.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU CAN MAKE

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
IT WITH SOUTHERN BAPTISTS, YOU

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000
CAN MAKE IT ANYWHERE.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
AND THE ARGUMENT I MAKE IN THE

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
CREATION IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
IT'S THAT IT IS... I SAID "LET

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
US IN THE SERVICE OF A

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
TRANSCENDENT MORAL OBLIGATION

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
AND CONCERN PUT ASIDE OUR

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
DIFFERENCES FOR THE TIME BEING

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
AND NOT FUSS WITH EACH OTHER

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
OVER EVOLUTION, IN OTHER WORDS

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
WHERE IT ALL CAME FROM.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
LET US AGREE LOOKING AT THE

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
EVIDENCE THAT IS DISAPPEARING.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
AND LET US, DARE I USE THE WORD,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
GATHER AT THE RIVER."

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000
COME TOGETHER ON COMMON GROUND

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
WHERE WE CAN EXERCISE THE

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000
EXTRAORDINARY POWER WE HAVE

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
JOINTLY.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
AND I ARGUE AND FEW PEOPLE

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
DISAGREED WITH ME THAT SCIENCE

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
AND RELIGION ARE THE TWO MOST

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
POWERFUL SOCIAL FORCES IN THE

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
WORLD.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
HAVING THEM AT ODDS AT EACH

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
OTHER ALL THE WAY UP TO THE

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.000
HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
THE POPULAR MEDIA ALL THE TIME

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
IS NOT PRODUCTIVE.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Moyers: IN YOUR BOOK, YOU ASK

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000
BOTH SCIENCE AND RELIGION TO SET

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES ABOUT

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
METAPHYSICAL ISSUES.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
MEET ON THE NEAR SIDE OF

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
METAPHYSICS.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Moyers: MEET ON THE NEAR SIDE

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
OF METAPHYSICS.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.000
RIGHT.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Moyers: BUT CAN YOU ASK

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
RELIGION TO DO THAT WHEN BY

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
NATURE RELIGION IS CONCERNED

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
WITH THE METAPHYSICAL, WITH

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
UNSEEN DEITIES?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
SURE, YOU CAN.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LOT OF

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
PHYSICISTS FRIENDS WORKING ON

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
STRING THEORY WHO ARE ALSO

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
PREOCCUPIED WITH THINGS THEY

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
CAN'T SEE OR MEASURE.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
BUT HOWEVER, THE POINT HERE IS

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
YES YOU CAN AND WE'VE DONE IT.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
TO IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
SCIENCE AND RELIGION CORPORATE

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
TOGETHER.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Moyers: IT WAS THAT LAST YEAR

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
ED WILSON PLAYED AN IMPORTANT

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
ROLE IN ORGANIZING A COALITION

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
OF SCIENTISTS AND EVANGELICAL

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
CHRISTIANS TO MEET ON GLOBAL

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
WARMING AND HABITAT

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
PRESERVATION.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
WE WILL NOT ALLOW EVANGELICAL

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
CHRISTIANS WITH SCIENTIST TODAY,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
WE WILL NOT ALLOW IT THE,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
CREATION, TO BE DEGRADED,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
DESTROYED BY HUMAN FOLLY.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Moyers: YOU SAY YOU'RE A

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
SECULAR HUMANIST.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO HEAR WHEN

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
YOU SAY THAT?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000
THAT TERM DRIVES THE

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
EVANGELICAL, THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
INTO A FRENZY.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
A HUMANIST IS A PERSON WHO

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
BELIEVES THAT IN MATTERS ETHICAL

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:20.000
AND IN MATTERS OF ESTHETIC AND

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
CENTRAL CONCERN SHOULD PUT

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
HUMANITY AS THE FIRST AND FINAL

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
PURPOSE OF IT ALL.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
THAT WE HAVE JUST THIS ONE

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
PLANET TO LIVE.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
WE ARE NOT BEING LOOKED OVER.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
BUT WE ARE ON OUR OWN,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
ESSENTIALLY.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
OURSELVES AND WE BETTER GET

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
TOGETHER AS A SPECIES AND WORK

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
IT OUT AND STOP RELYING ON

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
SUPERNATURAL POWERS.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT HUMANISM

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000
IS.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Moyers: YOU DESCRIBE THE

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
WORLD AS IT IS AND YET, YOU'RE

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
NOT A MAN WHO'S A... YOU'RE NOT

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
A PESSIMIST.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
YOU'RE... THERE'S A LOT OF HOPE

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
IN THE CREATION.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY TO MAKE A

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
DIFFERENCE ON THE FOOTPRINT THAT

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
WE HUMANS ARE LEAVING ON THIS

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
EARTH?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I THINK PROBABLY IT GOES

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
DOWN... LET'S GO DOWN ONE LAYER

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
OF THOUGHT FROM WHAT WE HAD

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
EARLIER, AND GO TO THE DEEPEST

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
LEVEL.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
IF WE COULD CHANGE OUR

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
WORLDVIEW, IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
RADICAL.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
IT WOULD MEAN SEEING OURSELVES

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
AS A BIOLOGICAL SPECIES IN A

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
BIOLOGICAL WORLD.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
THAT WE ARE A SPECIES

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
EXQUISITELY WELL ADAPTED TO THIS

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
PLANET AND THAT WE ORIGINATED

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
HERE AND THAT OUR PECULIARITIES,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
INCLUDING THE ONES THAT THREATEN

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
US ALL THE TIME, THAT THREATEN

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
YOUR OWN... THREATEN OUR OWN

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
EXISTENCE ARE... CAN BE

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
UNDERSTOOD BY THE HISTORY OF THE

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
WAY WE ORIGINATED IN THAT LIVING

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
WORLD.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
AND IF WE COULD JUST PLACE

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
OURSELVES REALISTICALLY IN THAT

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
CONTEXT AND STOP THINKING OF

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
OURSELVES AS SEMI ANGELS, YOU

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
KNOW, ON THE WAY... THAT THIS IS

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
JUST A WEIGH STATION ON A WAY ON

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
UP TO AN IDEALIZED EXISTENCE,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
CHANGE THAT.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
THEN I THINK WE WOULD GET PRETTY

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
SERIOUS ABOUT PEACE AND LONG

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
TERM SECURITY AND SAVING THE

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
REST OF LIFE.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.000
AND... AND KEEPING OUR OPTIONS

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
OPEN FOR THE FUTURE.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Moyers: E.O. WILSON, THANK

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000
YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING ME ON

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
THE JOURNAL.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
ME.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Moyers: E.O. WILSON'S WISH IS

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
ONE STEP CLOSER TO REALITY.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
IT HAS BEEN A DREAM COME

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
TRUE.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Moyers: THE JOHN D. AND

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
CATHERINE T. MacARTHUR

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
FOUNDATION RECENTLY MADE A GRANT

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
OF $20 MILLION TOWARD CREATING

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LIFE.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Moyers: LISTENING TO E.O.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
WILSON, MY COLLEAGUES AND I

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
FOUND OURSELVES TALKING ABOUT

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
DIAMOND TEAGUE.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
DIAMOND TEAGUE CAME INTO OUR

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
LIVES THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
IN A REPORT ABOUT SOME KIDS WHO

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
LIVE IN THE SHADOW OF THE U.S.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
CAPITOL, BUT MIGHT AS WELL BE ON

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON FOR ALL

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
OFFICIAL WASHINGTON CARES.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
THEY LIVE IN AN IMPOVERISHED

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
NEIGHBORHOOD, RIDDLED WITH

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
VIOLENCE AND TOXIC WASTE.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
A RIVER FLOWS THROUGH IT, DIRTY

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
AND DANGEROUS FROM POLLUTION.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
DIAMOND TEAGUE AND HIS PALS

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
FOUND MEANING IN THEIR LIVES AS

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
THEY SET OUT TO CLEAN UP THE

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
RIVER AND REDEEM THEIR

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
COMMUNITY.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
THIS REPORT ON THE EARTH

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
CONSERVATION CORPS WAS PRODUCED

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
BY WILLIAM BRANGHAM AND REPORTED

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
BY NPR's DANIEL ZWERDLING.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Reporter: DARIUS PHILLIPS

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
WOULD BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
THAT HE WAS THE KIND OF MAN YOU

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
SHOULD BE AFRAID OF.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
PEOPLE ON THE STREETS HERE IN

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
WASHINGTON, D.C. USED TO CALL

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
HIM "THE BIG HURT."

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
AND YOU COULD SAY SOMETHING

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
ABOUT, SAY SOMETHING TO ME, YOU

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO SAY

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
ANYTHING, YOU COULD LOOK AT ME A

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
DIFFERENT WAY, AND I'M DOWN YOUR

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
NECK, JUST LIKE THAT.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Reporter: PHILLIPS SOLD

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
CRACK, HE STOLE CARS, HE ROBBED

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
TAXI DRIVERS.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000
HE'S 22 YEARS OLD.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
MY WHOLE PHILOSOPHY AT THAT

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
PARTICULAR TIME WAS NEVER LEAVE

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
THE HOUSE WITH LESS THAN $5,000

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
ON YOU.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIKE, THAT WAS

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
MY QUOTA FOR THE DAY.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I GOT TO PUT TEN IN THE BANK

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
EVERY DAY, AND I ALWAYS GOT TO

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
WALK AROUND WITH FIVE IN MY

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
POCKET, EVERY DAY.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Reporter: LASHAUNTYA MOORE IS

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
A 24-YEAR-OLD WELFARE MOTHER.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
HER BROTHER'S IN PRISON FOR

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
SHE STARTED HAVING BABIES WHEN

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
SHE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I HAD THAT FANTASY THAT THE

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
GUY, HE LOVED ME AND WE WERE

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
GOING TO GET MARRIED AND WE WERE

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
GOING TO HAVE A BIG HOUSE AND

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
TAKE CARE OF OUR BABY.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A GOOD

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
LIFE AND WE WERE GOING TO BE

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
HAPPY.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
SO, THAT WAS MY PLAN.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
AND I TOLD THAT TO MY FATHER.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
AND HE WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE LIVING

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
IN A DREAM WORLD."

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Reporter: THERE'S NOT MUCH

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
REASON TO EXPECT THAT THESE

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD EVER MAKE IT

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
OUT OF THIS WORLD.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000
BUT NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
TRANSFORM THEIR LIVES AND

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
THEY'RE DOING IT PARTLY BY

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
TRANSFORMING THE AREA WHERE THEY

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
LIVE.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
AREA, CLEANUP ON THE EXTERIOR OF

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
THE GATE.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Reporter: A FEW MONTHS AGO,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
THEY JOINED A NON-PROFIT PROGRAM

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
CALLED THE EARTH CONSERVATION

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
CORPS.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
THE BASIC IDEA SOUNDS SIMPLE:

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
YOU RECRUIT A FEW DOZEN YOUNG

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
MEN AND WOMEN FROM THE

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
COMMUNITY-- EVEN IF THEY HAVE

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
CRIMINAL RECORDS OR IF THEY'RE

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
DROP-OUTS-- AND YOU HIRE THEM TO

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
CLEAN UP AND RESTORE THEIR

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
BUT NOTHING IS SIMPLE IN THIS

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
PART OF THE NATION'S CAPITAL.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
THIS WASHINGTON ON THE BANKS OF

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
THE SHINING POTOMAC RIVER; WE'RE

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
TALKING ABOUT THIS WASHINGTON ON

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
THE BANKS OF THE OTHER RIVER.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
THEY CALL THE RIVER AND THE

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
NEIGHBORHOOD ANACOSTIA.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
MOST CALL THIS WHOLE AREA

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
"SOUTHEAST."

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
IT'S ONLY A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
U.S. CAPITOL, BUT IT'S ONE OF

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS IN

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
AMERICA.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
WHEN WE CAME HERE, YOU

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
COULDN'T SEE THE RIVER STANDING

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
HERE.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
THERE WERE TRASH HEAPS 100 FEET

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
HIGH.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Reporter: BOB NIXON USED TO

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
BE A HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
HE CAME TO WASHINGTON IN THE

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
EARLY 1990s, TO SHOOT A FILM

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
NIXON STAYED AND HE SET UP THE

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
EARTH CONSERVATION CORPS,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
BECAUSE HE FELT HE HAD TO DO

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
ENVIRONMENT.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
THEY DIDN'T JUST DUMP TRASH

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
HERE, THEY DUMPED PEOPLE HERE.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, 90% OF THE

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
PUBLIC HOUSING COMMUNITIES IN

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
WASHINGTON ARE, YOU KNOW, WITHIN

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
A MILE AND A HALF OF THIS DUMP

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
RIGHT HERE.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Reporter: EVERY CITY HAS A

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
PLACE LIKE SOUTHEAST.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
THIS IS WHERE THEY PUT THE

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
PROJECTS, THIS IS WHERE THEY PUT

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
THE FACTORIES AND THE FREEWAYS.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
THIS IS WHERE EVERYBODY PUTS

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
THEIR POLLUTION.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
BUT THE KILLINGS ALONG THESE

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
STREETS GIVE WASHINGTON ITS

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
HORRENDOUS DISTINCTION: IT HAS

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
THE HIGHEST MURDER RATE OF ANY

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
MAJOR CITY IN THE COUNTRY.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY, YOU

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000
KNOW, "SUCH AND SUCH DIED."

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
YOU KNOW, "SUCH AND SUCH DIED."

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.000
TWO FRIENDS OF MINE WERE

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000
KILLED.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
AND MY UNCLE WAS SHOT UP AT THE

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
SAME TIME.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
HE WAS SHOT IN THE STOMACH WITH

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
AN A.K.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
I HAD TO GO TO 11 FUNERALS.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Reporter: THESE YOUNG PEOPLE

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000
SAY WHEN THEY FIRST HEARD ABOUT

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
THE EARTH CONSERVATION CORPS,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.000
THE LAST THING THE CARED ABOUT

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
WAS CLEANING UP THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.000
SURVIVE.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
THE CORPS PAYS ROUGHLY MINIMUM

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
WAGE, PLUS THEY GET HEALTH

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
INSURANCE AND A $5,000

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
SCHOLARSHIP IF THEY GO BACK TO

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
SCHOOL.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
BUT SOMETHING CLICKS WHEN THEY

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
GET OUT ON THE ANACOSTIA.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
THEY GO ABOUT A MILE UPSTREAM,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
AND THEY SEE THEIR COMMUNITY IN

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
A NEW WAY.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
BASICALLY LIKE FIVE, TEN

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
MINUTES AWAY, I LIVE FROM HERE.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
AND THIS IS... THIS IS NOT ALL I

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
KNOW, BUT THIS IS WHERE, THIS ISçó

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.000
A PART OF ME.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
THIS IS MY HERITAGE.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
AND TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING SO

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
BEAUTIFUL, IT'S OVERWHELMING

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AROUND HERE,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
AND YOU CAN SAY THAT I'M A PART

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
OF SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Reporter: PHILLIPS AND THE

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
OTHER CORPS MEMBERS TAKE VIDEOS

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
WHEREVER THEY GO SO THEY CAN

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
DOCUMENT THEIR HERITAGE AND SHOW

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
HOW THEY'RE TRYING TO SAVE IT.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
I'M AT THE MOUTH OF BEAVER

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
DAM RIGHT NOW, READY TO TAKE

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
THREE MORE WATER SAMPLES.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Reporter: THE PROBLEM IS,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
THIS RIVER HAS BECOME ONE OF

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
MOST POLLUTED IN AMERICA.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
YOU CAN'T TELL BY LOOKING AT IT,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
BUT HEALTH OFFICIALS ESTIMATE

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
THAT MORE THAN A BILLION GALLONS

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
OF RAW SEWAGE END UP IN THE

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
ANACOSTIA, EVERY YEAR.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
TODAY, THE CORPS IS GOING OUT ON

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
ONE OF ITS REGULAR PATROLS.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
THEY'VE HEARD THAT RAW SEWAGE

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
MIGHT BE POURING INTO A

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
TRIBUTARY ILLEGALLY, AND THEY'RE

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
INVESTIGATING.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
WHEN THEY FIND SUSPECT DUMPING,

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
THEY REPORT IT.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
MY NAME IS JEROME GLOVER OF

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
THE EARTH CONSERVATION CORPS.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
THIS IS THE FIRST DAY OF OUR

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
TESTING OF THE WATER QUALITY.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
IT HASN'T RAINED IN LIKE, FOUR

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
OR FIVE DAYS.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
IN 24 HOURS, WE'LL KNOW.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Reporter: AND THE NEXT

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
MORNING, THE RESULTS CONFIRM

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
WHAT THEY SUSPECTED.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
THESE BIG GLOPS RIGHT HERE,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
IT SHOWS THAT THE ANACOSTIA IS

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
CONTAMINATED WITH FECAL

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
COLIFORMS.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Reporter: FECAL WHAT?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
COLIFORM.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
IT'S... IT'S LIKE HUMAN CRAP,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
FOR REAL.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
SO, YEAH, AND THERE IT IS RIGHT

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
THERE.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Reporter: BOB NIXON SAYS

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
THESE CORPS MEMBERS ARE DOING

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
SOME OF THE WORK THEIR

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
THIS IS, IN A LOT OF SENSE,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
GROUND ZERO FOR A LOT OF ISSUES

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
THAT ARE FACING OUR WHOLE

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
COUNTRY.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
THEY'RE FIGHTING

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
ENVIRONMENTAL... PEOPLE CALL IT

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
"ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE," I THINK

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
IT'S "ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE."

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
ALL SORTS OF SORT OF INJUSTICES

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.000
PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO UNTANGLE.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Reporter: WHEN YOU TALK TO

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
CORPS MEMBERS, THEY ALL GIVE

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THEY'RE

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
CAUGHT UP IN THIS WORK.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I LOVE THE RESEARCH, BECAUSE

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
IT'S FUN.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
IT'S LIKE BEING A DETECTIVE.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
YOU GET TO FIND OUT WHO'S

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
ACTUALLY DOING WHAT, AND WE CAN

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
WRITE LETTERS AND GET THINGS TO

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
I WANT TO BE A ZOOLOGIST, A

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
MARINE BIOLOGIST, ANYTHING THAT

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
HAS TO DO WITH ANIMALS.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
I LOVE IT.

RIVER.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
THEY'RE TEACHING THE NEXT

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
GENERATION ABOUT THE

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
ENVIRONMENT.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
DAVID SMITH HELPS RUN THE CORPS.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
HE'S PICKED JEROME SCOTT TO BE

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
ONE OF THE GUIDES.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
GREATER THAN MINE.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
INVASIVE AND EXOTIC SPECIES OF

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
HE'S DONE.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
MAN, I COULD GO ON FOR ABOUT 15

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
LAST YEAR.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Reporter: SMITH SAYS, PICTUREÑi

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
JEROME SCOTT THROUGH THE EYES OF

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
THESE KIDS FROM THE INNER CITY.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
YOU NEVER SEE A BLACK GUY ON

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
A BOAT TEACHING ENVIRONMENTAL

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
SCIENCES.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
SO BY SEEING A BLACK GUY FROM

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
D.C., ON A BOAT, TEACHING YOU

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
ABOUT POLLUTION AND

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
ENVIRONMENTAL, AQUATIC

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
VEGETATION, THAT SORT OF THING,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
IT MAKES IT MORE OF A REALITY

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.000
YOURSELF.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
THE KIDS THINK THAT THE

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
RIVER'S SO DIRTY, YOU KNOW, THAT

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
THERE COULD BE NO WAY FISH COULD

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
BE LIVING IN IT.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
BUT WE SHOW THERE IS FISH LIVING

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
IN IT.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
THEY ARE SOME STRONG FISH, YOU

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Reporter: SO YOU LOVE THE

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
FACT THAT THEY'RE SURVIVORS?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
THEY'RE SURVIVORS.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
THEY'RE, THEY'RE SURVIVING FISH.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
EXACTLY.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Reporter: THE EARTH

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
CONSERVATION CORPS HAS SURVIVED

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS NOW.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
AND THAT'S A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT,

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
OBSTACLES.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
MORE THAN HALF THE KIDS WHO SIGN

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
THEY FINISH THEIR ONE-YEAR TERM.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
IN THE PAST, SOME LEFT FOR

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000
BETTER PAYING JOBS, BUT OTHER

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
CORPS MEMBERS WERE ON DRUGS,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
SOME GOT KICKED OUT BECAUSE THEY

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
STARTED FIGHTS.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
CORPS MEMBERS SAY IF THEY'RE

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
REALLY GOING TO SUCCEED, THEY

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
HAVE TO REMAKE THEMSELVES.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
THEY HAVE TO UNLEARN THE

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000
BEHAVIOR THAT HELPED THEM GET BY

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000
WE GOT EVERYBODY HERE?

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000

HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN HOW TO

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
DEAL WITH THEIR ANGER.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.000
REMEMBER IN FEEDBACK, THERE

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
ARE NO NEGATIVES.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
WE ACCOMPLISHED THIS AND WE CAN

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
IMPROVE THIS.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
ME?

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I'M VERY SHORT TEMPERED.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I USED TO BE VERY, VERY SHORT

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
TEMPERED, AND I WILL GO OFF JUST

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
LIKE THAT.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
ALMOST GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH A

FELLOW CORPS MEMBERS JUST A FEW

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
WEEKS AGO.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
SHE GOT FURIOUS WHEN HE WOULDN'T

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
HELP HER WITH SOMETHING, AND SHE

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
SAID SHE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
AND I SAID, "IS THAT A

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
THREAT?"

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
AND USUALLY IF SOMEONE SAY,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
"YES," THEN I'M DOWN YOUR THROAT

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
IN A PHYSICAL WAY AND I'M GOING

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO KILL ME?

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
LET ME GET AT YOU FIRST BEFORE

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME?

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
THIS TIME, I JUST... I

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
RELAXED.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
THEY TELL YOU YOU HAVE A SHORT

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
WINDOW WHERE IT'S YOUR "THINKING

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
PROCESS TIME," AND YOU USE THAT

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
TIME RIGHT THERE TO THINK ABOUT

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO DO

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
SOMETHING.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
THAT CONSEQUENCES IS GOING TO

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
FOLLOW BEHIND THAT.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
BUT THIS TIME, I USE ALL OF MY

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
SKILLS THAT DAY, AND EVERYBODY

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
WAS PROUD OF ME.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
MY... MY SUPERVISOR, YOU KNOW,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
DAVID, EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "MAN,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
YOU ACTUALLY DID IT."

CHANGE THEMSELVES, THEY CAN'T

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
CONTROL THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
VIOLENCE HAS BECOME SO COMMON

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
HERE IN SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
IMAGINE THIS WORLD WITHOUT

ONE OF THE CORPS MEMBERS WAS

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
MURDERED.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
THEY'RE ABOUT TO DO THIS

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000

TEAGUE.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
CHARISMATIC YOUNG MEN WHO HAS

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
EVER JOINED THE CORPS.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
THEY SAY TEAGUE WORKED SO HARD

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
JOKINGLY CALLED HIM "CHOIR BOY."

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
HE WAS SHOT IN THE HEAD IN FRONT

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.000
HE WAS 19 YEARS OLD.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
THE DAY TEAGUE WAS MURDERED,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
CORPS MEMBERS KEPT THEIR CAMERAS

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
THEY WANTED TO CAPTURE

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
EVERYONE'S REACTION AS THEY

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
JEROME, LET ME TALK TO YOU,

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.000
MAN.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
BREAK IT TO JEROME SCOTT.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
HE WAS DIAMOND TEAGUE'S BEST

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
FRIEND.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
I'VE EVER HAD TO DO, MAN.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000

I WISH IT WAS A JOKE.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
HIS MOTHER WANTS YOU TO GIVE HER

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
A CALL.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
YEAH.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000

FIRST TIME JEROME SCOTT HAS

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
GRIEVED FOR A BEST FRIEND.

HIS BUDDY GOT SHOT TO DEATH

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000

SHE NEEDS YOU.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
OKAY.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
I WROTE DOWN HER NUMBER.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000

BEGAN, AN AVERAGE OF ONE CORPS

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
EVERY YEAR.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
ACCORDING TO THE CORPS' RECORDS,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS WAS BEATEN

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000

Reporter: WHEN DIAMOND TEAGUE

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
GOT KILLED, CORPS MEMBERS

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
SEARCHED THROUGH THE NEWSPAPERS

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
FOR SOME SORT OF ARTICLE ABOUT

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
HIS MURDER.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:08.000

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
THIS AIN'T THE REAL WORLD.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Reporter: CORPS MEMBERS WANT

"ENDANGERED SPECIES."

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000

MEMBERS OF THE EARTH

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
CONSERVATION CORPS CAME, TOO, IN

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000

FOR TEAGUE'S FAMILY, THE VIDEO

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:44.000

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
FOR DARIUS PHILLIPS, TEAGUE'S

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
DEATH WAS A KIND OF BEGINNING.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:52.000
IT'S TIRESOME TO COME TO

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000

THEY'VE PRESSURED THE CITY TO

ON THIS SIDE IS THE PARK AREA,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
AND LITTLE TABLES AND

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
TALK ABOUT THEIR WORK AND HOW

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
IT'LL AFFECT THEIR FUTURE, THEY

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
SOUND AS IF THERE'S NO LIMIT TO

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000
I KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS

I KNOW A LOT ABOUT DUMPING RULES

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000

LANDSCAPING.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:01.000

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
IT OFF.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
MAYBE THE CORPS MEMBERS' DREAMS

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
WILL COME TRUE.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.000

LOST MORE THAN HALF ITS FUNDING

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
FOUNDATIONS AREN'T GIVING WHAT
