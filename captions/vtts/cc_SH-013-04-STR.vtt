2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.400
Fie, fie on all tiredjades, on all mad masters,

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.070
and all foul ways.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.000
Was ever a man so beaten?

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.470
Was ever man so rayed?

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.570
Was ever man so weary?

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.370
I am sent before to make afire,

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.970
and they are coming afterto warm them,

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.700
but I, with blowing thefire, shall warm myself,

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.330
for considering theweather,

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.730
a taller man than I willtake cold.

12
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.930
Holla.

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400
Ho.

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.400
Curtis!

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.600
Who is that calls socoldly?

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.130
A piece of ice.

17
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.500
A fire, good Curtis.

18
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.430
Is my master and his wifecoming, Grumio?

19
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.030
Ay, Curtis, ay, andtherefore fire, fire.

20
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.630
Cast on no water.

21
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.200
Is she so hot a shrew asshe's reported?

22
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.730
She was, good Curtis,before this frost,

23
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.070
but wilt thou make a fire,

24
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.030
or shall I complain onthee to our mistress

25
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.000
for being slow in thy hotoffice?

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.400
I prithee, good Grumio, tellme, how goes the world?

27
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.670
A cold world, Curtis, inevery office but thine,

28
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.930
and therefore, fire.

29
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.330
Do thy duty, and have thyduty,

30
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.830
for my master and mistressare almost frozen to death.

31
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.430
There's fire ready.

32
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100
Therefore, good Grumio,the news.

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.470
Why, "Jack, boy; ho, boy,"and as much news as I wilt.

34
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.400
Come, you are so full ofcony-catching.

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.900
And therefore fire, for Ihave caught extreme cold.

36
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.070
Where's the cook?

37
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.830
Is supper ready, the housetrimmed,

38
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.130
rushes strewed, cobwebsswept?

39
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.000
Carpets laid, andeverything in order?

40
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.170
All ready.

41
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.870
Therefore, good Grumio, Ipray thee, the news.

42
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.070
First, know my horse istired,

43
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.130
my master and mistressfallen out.

44
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.370
How?

45
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.030
Out of their saddles intothe dirt.

46
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.730
Thereby hangs a tale.

47
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.130
Let's hear it, goodGrumio.

48
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.470
Lend thine ear.

49
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.570
Here.

50
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.800
There.

51
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.670
This is to feel a tale,not to hear a tale.

52
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.700
And therefore 'tis calleda sensible tale,

53
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.570
and this cuff was but toknock at your ear

54
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.830
and beseech it listening.

55
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.230
Now I begin.

56
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.300
Imprimis, we came down afoul hill,

57
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.530
my master riding behind mymistress--

58
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.700
Both of one horse?

59
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.870
What's that to thee?

60
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.270
Why, a horse.

61
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.670
Tell thou the tale, buthadst thou not crossed me,

62
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.730
thou shouldst have heardhow her horse fell,

63
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.370
and she under her horse.

64
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.130
Thou shouldst have heardin how miry a place,

65
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.370
how she was bemoiled,

66
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.400
how he left her with thehorse upon her,

67
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.370
how he beat me because herhorse stumbled,

68
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.300
how she waded through thedirt to pluck him off me,

69
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.400
how he swore, how she prayedthat never prayed before,

70
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.300
how I cried, how thehorses ran away,

71
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.870
how her bridle was burst,

72
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.700
how I lost my crupper withmany things of worthy memory

73
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.900
which now shall die inoblivion

74
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.500
and thou returnunexperienced to the grave.

75
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.800
By this reckoning, he ismore shrew than she.

76
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.870
Ay, and that thou and theproudest of you all

77
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.170
shall find when he comeshome,

78
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.170
but what talk I of this?

79
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.630
Call forth Nathaniel,Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,

80
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.400
Walter, Sugarsop, and therest.

81
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.600
Are they ready?

82
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.730
They are.

83
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.930
Call them forth.

84
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.130
Do you hear, ho?

85
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.530
You must meet my master tocountenance my mistress.

86
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.700
She has a face of her own.

87
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.930
Who knows not that?

88
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.630
Thou, it seems, that calls forcompany to countenance her.

89
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.100
I call them forth tocredit her.

90
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.830
She comes to borrownothing of them.

91
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.530
Welcome home, Grumio.

92
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.630

97
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.330

103
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.700
I hear my master.

104
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.370
What, no man at door tohold my stirrup nor totake my horse?

105
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.370
- Where is Nathaniel? -Here, sir.

106
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.370

107
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.600
- Philip? - Here, sir.

108
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.700
Here, sir; here, sir;here, sir; here, sir!

109
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.000
You logger-headed andunpolish'd grooms.

110
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.330
What, no attendance?

111
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.630
No regard?

112
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.530
No duty?

113
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.330
Where is the foolish knaveI sent before?

114
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.430
Here, sir, as foolish as Iwas before.

115
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.470
You peasant swain, youwhoreson malt-horse drudge!

116
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.070
Did I not bid thee meet mein the park

117
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.270
and bring along theserascal knaves with thee?

118
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.300
Nathaniel's coat, sir, wasnot fully made.

119
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.500
Gabriel's pumps were allunpink'd i' the heel,

120
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.530
and there was no link tocolour Peter's hat,

121
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.830
and Walter's dagger wasnot come from sheathing.

122
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.130
There was none fine butAdam, Ralph, and Gregory.

123
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.800
The rest were ragged, old, andbeggarly, yet as they are,

125

Go, rascals, go, and fetchmy supper in.

127
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.970
Where is the life thatlate I led--

128
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.300
Where are those--

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.570
Sit down, Kate, andwelcome.

You villains, when?

139
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.970
It was the friar of ordersgray,

140
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.330
an he forth walked on hisway.

141
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.530
Ouch, you rogue,

142
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.030
you pluck my foot awry.

143
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.430
Take that, and mend theplucking off the other.

144
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.530
Be merry, Kate.

145
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.630

150
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.000
Where are my slippers?

151
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.300
Shall I have some water?

152
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.300
Ugh.

Come, Kate, and wash andwelcome heart--oh!

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.070
Whoreson villain!

Will you let it fall?

156
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.500
Patience, I pray you.

157
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.700
'Twas a fault unwilling.

158
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.630
A whoreson beetle-headed,flap-ear'd knave.

159
00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.870
Come, Kate, sit down.

160
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.030
I know you have a stomach.

161
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.730
Will you give thanks,sweet Kate?

162
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.870
Or else shall I?

163
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.970
What's this?

164
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:01.970
Mutton?

165
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.900
Ay.

166
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.070
Who brought it?

167
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.200

'Tis burnt--

169
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.630
Ah, ah!

170
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.630
And so is all the meat.

171
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:17.100
What dogs are these?

172
00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.570
Where is the rascal cook?

173
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.330
How durst you, villains,bring it from the dresser,

174
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.570
and serve it thus to methat love it not?

175
00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.900
Theretake it to you,trenchers, cups, and all...

176
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.830
you heedless joltheads andunmanner'd slaves.

177
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.100
Do you grumble?

178
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.830
I'll be with you straight.

179
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.400
I pray you, husband, benot so disquiet.

180
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.370
The meat was well if youwere so contented.

182
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.730
Ah, ha, hoo, hoo!

Shh!

184
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.370
And dried away, and I expresslyam forbid to touch it,

185
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.330
for it engenders choler,planteth anger,

186
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.230
and better 'twere thatboth of us did fast--

187
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.470
since, of ourselves,ourselves are choleric--

188
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.100
than feed it with suchover-roasted flesh.

189
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.170
Uck.

190
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.430
Be patient.

191
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.370
Tomorrow 't shall bemended,

192
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:17.870
and for this night, we'llfast for company.

193
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:23.570
Yeeearghhh!

194
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.470
Come, I will bring thee tothy bridal chamber.

195
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.500
Didst ever see the like?

196
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.130
He kills her in her ownhumor.

197
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:15.870
Where is he?

198
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.170
In her chamber, making asermon of continency to her

199
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.770
and rails and swears andrates that she, poor soul,

200
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.600
knows not which way tostand, to look, to speak,

201
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.700
and sits as one new-risenfrom a dream.

202
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.500
Away, away, for he iscoming hither.

203
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.530
Thus have I politiclybegun my reign...

204
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.470
and 'tis my hope to endsuccessfully.

205
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:21.400
My falcon now is sharp andpassing empty...

206
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.230
until she stoop, she mustnot be full-gorged,

207
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.200
for then she never looksupon her lure.

208
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:36.670
Another way I have to manmy haggard,

209
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.330
to make her come and knowher keeper's call--

210
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.370
that is, to watch her aswe watch these kites

211
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.270
that bate and beat andwill not be obedient.

212
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.770
She eat no meat today nornone shall eat.

213
00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.600
Last night, she slept notnor tonight she shall not.

214
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.670
As with the meat,

215
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:13.470
some undeserved fault I'll findabout the making of the bed,

216
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:17.170
and here I'll fling thepillow, there the bolster,

217
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.800
this way the coverlet,another way the sheets.

218
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.970
Ay, and amid this hurly, Iintend that all is done

219
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.170
in reverend care of her,

220
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.500
and in conclusion, sheshall watch all night,

221
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:39.900
and if she chance to nod,I'll rail and brawl

222
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.730
and with the clamor keepher still awake.

223
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:49.100
This is a way to kill awife with kindness,

224
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:56.570
and thus, I'll curb hermad and headstrong humor.

225
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.870
He that knows better howto tame a shrew,

226
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.300
now let him speak.

227
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.700
'Tis charity to show.

228
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.400
Is't possible, friendLicio, that Mistress Bianca

229
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.230
doth fancy any other butLucentio?

230
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.670
I tell you, sir, she bearsme fair in hand.

231
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.630
Sir, to satisfy you inwhat I said,

232
00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.600
stand by and mark themanner of his teaching.

233
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.800
Now, mistress, profit youin what you read?

234
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.170
What, sir, read you?

235
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.430
First resolve me that.

236
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.430
I read that I profess, theArt to Love.

237
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.570
And may you prove, sir,master of your art.

238
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.970
While you, sweet dear,prove mistress of my heart.

239
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.770
Quick proceeders, marry.

240
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.470
Now, tell me, I pray,

241
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.670
you that durst swear atyour mistress Bianca

242
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.730
loved none in the world sowell as Lucentio.

243
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.970
Despiteful love,unconstant womankind.

244
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.270
I tell thee, Licio, thisis wonderful.

245
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.600
Mistake no more.

246
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.430
I am not Licio nor amusician as I seem to be

247
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:25.500
but one that scorn to livein this disguise

248
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.230
for such a one as leaves agentleman

249
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.830
and makes a god of such acullion.

250
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.930
Know, sir, that I amcall'd Hortensio.

251
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.330
Signior Hortensio, I haveoften heard

252
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.600
of your entire affectionto Bianca,

253
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.900
and since mine eyes arewitness of her lightness,

254
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.430
I will with you if you beso contented

255
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.330
forswear Bianca and herlove forever.

256
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.700
O, see how they kiss andcourt.

257
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.670
Signior Lucentio, here ismy hand,

258
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.000
and here I firmly vow

259
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.900
never to woo her no morebut do forswear her

260
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.730
as one unworthy all theformer favors

261
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.700
that I have fondlyflatter'd her withal.

262
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.900
And here I take theunfeigned oath

263
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.730
never to marry with herthough she would entreat.

264
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.270
Fie on her.

265
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.330
O, see how beastly shedoth court him.

266
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.730
O, would all the world buthe had quite forsworn.

267
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:13.230
For me, that I may surelykeep my vow,

268
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.300
I will be married to awealthy widow

269
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.030
ere three days pass thathath as long loved me

270
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.870
as I have loved this prouddisdainful haggard.

271
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.230
And so farewell, SigniorLucentio.

272
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.500
Kindness in women, nottheir beauteous looks,

273
00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.800
shall win my love,

274
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.470
and so I take my leave inresolution as I swore before.

275
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.600
Resolution-- resolution--

276
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.900
Mistress Bianca, bless youwith such grace

277
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.730
as 'longeth to a lover'sblessed case.

278
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.130
Nay, I have ta'en younapping, gentle love,

279
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.570
and have forsworn you withHortensio.

280
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.730
Tranio, you jest.

281
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.570
What, have you bothforsworn me?

282
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.000
Mistress, we have.

283
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.270
Then we are rid of Licio.

284
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.030
I' faith, he'll have alusty widow now

285
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.870
that shall be wooed andwedded in a day.

286
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.970
God give him joy.

287
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.070
Ay, and he'll tame her.

288
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.230
He says so, Tranio.

289
00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.230
Faith, he is gone unto thetaming school.

290
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.470
The taming school?

291
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.730
Is there such a place?

292
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.700
Ay, mistress, andPetruchio is the master

293
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.370
that teacheth tricks 11and 20 long

294
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.600
to tame a shrew and charmher chattering tongue.

295
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.430
Master, master, I havewatch'd so long

296
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.830
that I am dog-weary, ain'I?

297
00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.030
But at last I spied

298
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.000
an ancient angel coming downthe hill will serve a turn.

299
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.400
What is he, Biondello?

300
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.700
Master, a mercatante or apedant, I know not what,

301
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.930
but formal in apparel, ingait, and countenance

302
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.200
surely like a father.

303
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.370
What of him, Tranio?

304
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.530
If he be credulous andtrust my tale,

305
00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.200
I'll make him glad to seemVincentio

306
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.200
and give assurance toBaptista Minola

307
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.830
as if he were the rightVincentio.

308
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.700
Take in your love, andthen let me alone.

309
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.830
Look, Tranio.

310
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.930
God save you, sir.

311
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.300
Ah, and you, sir.

312
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.470
You are welcome.

313
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.000
Travel you far on?

314
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.370
Or are you at thefarthest?

315
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.700
Sir, at the farthest for aweek or two,

316
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.630
but then up farther, andas far as Rome,

317
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.700
and so to Tripoli if Godlend me life.

318
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.570
What countryman, I pray?

319
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.770
Ah, of Mantua.

320
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.030
Mantua, sir?

321
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.400
Marry, God forbid.

322
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.500
And come to Padua carelessof your life?

323
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.870
My life, sir?

324
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.070
How, I pray? For that goeshard.

325
00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.070
Ha, ha, ha.

326
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.070
'Tis death for anyone inMantua to come to Padua.

327
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.270
Oh.

328
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.470
Know you not the cause?

329
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.630
Oh, ah, ah--

330
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.770
Your ships are stay'd atVenice, and the duke,

331
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.900
for private quarrel 'twixtyour duke and him,

332
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.870
hath publish'd andproclaim'd it openly.

333
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.000
'Tis, marvel, but that youare but newly come,

334
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.200
you might have heard itelse proclaim'd about.

335
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.930
Alas, sir, it is worse forme than so,

336
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.700
for I have bills for moneyby exchange

337
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.670
from Florence and musthere deliver them.

338
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.730
Well, sir, to do youcourtesy,

339
00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.900
this will I do, and this Iwill advise you--

340
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.330
First, tell me, have youever been at Pisa?

341
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.070
Ay, sir, in Pisa have Ioften been,

342
00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:51.300
Pisa renowned for gravecitizens.

343
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.630
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

344
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.000
Among them know you oneVincentio?

345
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.670
I know him not, but I haveheard of him,

346
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.400
a merchant of incomparablewealth.

347
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.630
He is my father, sir, andsooth to say

348
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.730
in countenance somewhatdoth resemble you.

349
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.800
As much as an apple dothan oyster and all one.

350
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.670
To save your life in thisextremity,

351
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.500
This favor will I do youfor his sake,

352
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.200
and think it not the worstof all your fortunes

353
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.000
that you are like to SirVincentio.

354
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.370
His name and credit shallyou undertake,

355
00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.530
and in my house, you shallbe friendly lodged.

356
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.700
Look that you take uponyou as you should.

357
00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.070
You understand me, sir?

358
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.170
Ah, ah, well--

359
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.330

Then go with me to makethe matter good.

365
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.830
This, by the way, I letyou understand:

366
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.030
my father is here look'dfor every day

367
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.330
to pass assurance of adower in marriage

368
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.400
'twixt me and oneBaptista's daughter here.

369
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.170
In all these circumstances,I'll instruct you.

370
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.070
Go with me to clothe youas becomes you.

371
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.930
Yeah, yeah, well-- ha, ha,ha, ha.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.100
Come away.

373
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.100
Oh.

374
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:19.000
No, no, I dare not for mylife.

375
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.600
The more my wrong, themore his spite appears.

376
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.900
What, did he marry me tofamish me?

377
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.270
Beggars that come unto myfather's door

378
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.830
upon entreaty have apresent alms.

379
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.430
If not, elsewhere, theymeet with charity,

380
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.430
but I, who never knew howto entreat

381
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.500
nor never needed that Ishould entreat,

382
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.470
am starved for meat, giddyfor lack of sleep,

383
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.970
with oaths kept waking,and with brawling fed,

384
00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.600
and that which spites memore than all these wrongs,

385
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.170
he does it under name ofperfect love

386
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.100
as who should say if Ishould sleep or eat

387
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.300
'twere deadly sickness orelse present death.

388
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.730
Oh.

389
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.370
I prithee, go, and get mesome repast.

390
00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.830
I care not what so it bewholesome food.

391
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.600
What say you to a neat'sfoot?

392
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.730
'Tis passing good.

393
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.000
I prithee, let me have it.

394
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.230
I fear it is too cholerica meat.

395
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:36.000
How say you to a fat tripefinely broil'd?

396
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.200
I like it well.

397
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.030
Good Grumio, fetch it me.

398
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.270
I cannot tell.

399
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.530
I fear it is choleric.

400
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.600
What say you to a piece ofbeef and mustard?

401
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.930
A dish that I do love tofeed upon.

402
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.930
Ay, but the mustard is toohot a little.

403
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.130
Why then, the beef, andlet the mustard rest.

404
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.570
Ah, now, that you shallnot.

405
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.270
You shall have themustard, or you get nobeef of Grumio.

406
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.700
Then both, or one, oranything thou wilt.

407
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.300
Why then, the mustardwithout the beef.

408
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.900
Go, get thee gone, thoufalse, deluding slave,

409
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.170

Go, get thee gone, I say!

Ah, what news with you,sir?

449
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.400
Here is the cap yourworship did bespeak.

450
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:32.200
Why, this was molded on aporringer,

451
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.800
a velvet dish.

452
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.900
Tsk, tsk.

453
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.970
'Tis lewd and filthy.

454
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.030
Why, 'tis a walnut or acockleshell,

455
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.900
a knack, a toy, a trick, ababy's cap.

456
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.930
Away with it.

457
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.300
Come, let me have abigger.

458
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.930
I'll have no bigger.

459
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:52.030
This doth fit the time,

460
00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:53.970
and gentlewomen wear suchcaps as these.

461
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.930
When you are gentle, youshall have one too

462
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.030
and not till then, hmm?

463
00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.330
That will not be in haste.

464
00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:00.500
Why, sir, I trust I mayhave leave to speak,

465
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.670
and speak I will!

466
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.400
I am no child, no babe!

467
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.330
Your betters have enduredme say my mind,

468
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.300
and if you cannot, bestyou stop your ears.

469
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.370
My tongue will tell theanger of my heart,

470
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.330
or else my heartconcealing it will break,

471
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.930
and rather than it shall,

472
00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.770
I will be free even to theuttermost

473
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.270
as I please in words!

474
00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.800
Why, thou say'st true!

475
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.630
It is a paltry cap,

476
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.670
a custard coffin, abauble, a silken pie.

477
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.230
I love thee well in thatthou likest it not.

478
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:32.400
Love me or love me not, Ilike the cap,

479
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.730
and it I will have, or Iwill have none!

480
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.970
Thy gown?

481
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.170
Why, ay.

482
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.170
Come, tailor, let ussee't.

483
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.800
Oh.

484
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.370
O mercy, God.

485
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.830
What masquing stuff ishere?

486
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.130
What's this?

487
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.900
A sleeve?

488
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.770
'Tis like a demi-cannon.

489
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.500
What, up and down, carvedlike an apple tart?

490
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.700
Here's snip and nip andcut and stitch and slash

491
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.530
like to a censer in abarber's shop.

492
00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:09.970
Why, what, i' devil's name,tailor, call'st thou this?

493
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.330
I see she's like to haveneither cap nor gown.

494
00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.930
You bid me make it orderlyand well

495
00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.770
according to the fashionand the time.

496
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.470
Marry, and did, but if yoube remember'd,

497
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.070
I did not bid you mar itto the time.

498
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.730
Go, hop me over everykennel home,

499
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.670
for you shall hop withoutmy custom, sir.

500

I'll none of it.

501
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.170
Hence, make your best ofit.

502
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.930
I never saw abetter-fashion'd gown,

503
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.700
more quaint, more pleasing,nor more commendable.

504
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.930
Belike you mean to make apuppet of me.

505
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.770
Why, true, he means tomake a puppet of thee.

506
00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.030
She says your worship meansto make a puppet of her.

507
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.830
Monstrous arrogance.

508
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.270
Thou liest, thou thread,thou thimble,

509
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.930
thou yard, three-quarters,half-yard, quarter, nail,

510
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:54.530
flea, thou nit, thouwinter cricket, thou.

511
00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.230
Braved in my own housewith a skein of thread?

512
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.800
Away, thou rag, thouquantity, thou remnant,

513
00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.630
or I shall so be-mete theewith thy yard

514
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.970
as thou shalt think onprating whilst thou livest.

515
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.130
I tell thee, I, that thouhast marr'd her gown.

516
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.470
Your worship is deceived.

517
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.800
The gown is made just asmy master made direction.

518
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.670
Grumio gave order how itshould be done.

519
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.530
I gave him no order. Igave him the stuff.

520
00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.400
But how did you desire itshould be made?

521
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.070
Marry, sir, with needleand thread.

522
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.870
But did you not request tohave it cut?

523
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.800
Thou hast faced manythings. Face not me.

524
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.670
Thou hast braved many men.Brave not me.

525
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.430
I will neither be facednor braved.

526
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.670
I say unto thee, I bid thymaster cut out the gown,

527
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.400
but I did not bid him cutit to pieces.

528
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.030
Ergo, thou liest.

529
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:34.270
Why, here is the note ofthe fashion to testify.

530
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.470
Read it.

531
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.530
The note lies in's throat,if he say I said so.

532
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.270
"Imprimis, a loose-bodiedgown"--

533
00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.230
Master, if ever I saidloose-bodied gown,

534
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:42.470
sew me in the skirts ofit,

535
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.700
and beat me to death witha bottom of brown bread.

536
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.930
I said a gown.

537
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.130
Proceed.

538
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.700
- "with a small-compassedcape"-- - I confess the cape.

539
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.030
- "with a trunk sleeve"--- I confess two sleeves.

540
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.430
"the sleeves curiouslycut."

541
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.670
Ay, there's the villainy.

542
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:55.970
Error i' the bill, sir.

543
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.630
I commanded the sleevesshould be cut out and sewnup again,

544
00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.100
and that, I'll prove uponthee

545
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.300
though thy little fingerbe armed in a thimble.

546
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.500
This is true that I say,

547
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.270
an I had thee in place wherethou shouldst know it.

548
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.000
Take thou the bill, giveme thy mete-yard, andspare not me.

549
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.470
God-a-mercy, Grumio, thenshall he have no odds.

550
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:15.170
Well, sir, in brief, thegown is not for me.

551
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.500
You are i' the right, sir.

552
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.800
It is for my mistress.

553
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.530
Go, take it up unto thymaster's use.

554
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.930
Villain, not for thy life.

555
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.200
Take up my mistress' gownfor thy master's use.

556
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.030
Why, sir, what's yourconceit in that?

557
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:27.400
O, sir, the conceit isdeeper than you think for.

558
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.430
Take up my mistress' gownto his master's use.

559
00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.470
Ha, ha, ha.

560
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:37.370
Hortensio...

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.470
say thou wilt see thetailor paid.

562
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.570
Go take it hence, begone,and say no more!

563
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.230
Tailor, I'll pay thee forthy gown tomorrow.

564
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.370
Take no unkindness of hishasty words.

565
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:47.670
Ah, ah, ah--

566
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.900
Away, I say.

567
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:50.370
Um, uh--

568
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.600
Commend me to thy master.

569
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.170
Well, come, my Kate.

570
00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.400
We will unto your father's

571
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.000
even in these honest, meanhabiliments.

572
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Our purses shall be proud,our garments poor...

573
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:19.300
for 'tis the mind thatmakes the body rich.

574
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.670
As the sun breaks throughthe darkest clouds,

575
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.630
so honour peereth in themeanest habit.

576
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.700
What, is the jay moreprecious than the lark

577
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.630
because his fathers aremore beautiful?

578
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.730
Or is the adder betterthan the eel

579
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.870
because his painted skincontents the eye?

580
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.530
O, no, good Kate, neitherart thou the worse

581
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.230
for this poor furnitureand mean array.

582
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:47.500
If thou account'st itshame, lay it on me,

583
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.470
and therefore, frolic.

584
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:50.730
We will hence forthwith

585
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.770
to feast and sport us atthy father's house.

586
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.130
Go, call my men, and letus straight to him,

587
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.070
and bring our horses untoLong-lane end.

588
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.900
There will we mount, andthither walk on foot.

I dare assure you, sir,'tis almost two.

592
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:10.030
It 'twill be supper timeere you come there.

593
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.470
It shall be seven ere I goto horse.

594
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:22.270
Look, what I speak or door think to do,

595
00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.500
you are still crossing it.

596
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.330
Sirs, let't alone.

597
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.500
I will not go today, andere I do,

598
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.770

599
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.330
Sir, this is the house.

Please it you that I call?

Ay, sir, what else?

602
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.370
And but I be deceived,

603
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:09.700
Signior Baptista mayremember me, near 20 yearsago in Genoa

604
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.000
where we were lodger satthe Pegasus.

605
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.700
'Tis well, and hold yourown in any case

606
00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.900
with such austerity as'longeth to a father.

607
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.100
I warrant you.

608
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.900
But, sir, here comes yourboy.

609
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.130
'Twere good he wereschool'd.

610
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.300
Fear you not him.

611
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.300
Sirrah Biondello,

612
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.430

613
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.230
Imagine 'twere the rightVincentio.

614
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.570
Tut, fear not me.

615
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.530
But hast thou done thyerrand to Baptista?

616
00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:29.400
I told him that yourfather was at Venice

617
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.500
and that you look'd forhim this day in Padua.

618
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.770
Thou'rt a tall fellow.

619
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.470
Hold thee that to drink.

620
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.330
Here comes Baptista.

621
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.800
Set your countenance, sir.

622
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.300
Signior Baptista, you arehappily met.

623
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.170
Sir, this is the gentlemanI told you of.

624
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.930
I pray you, stand goodfather to me now.

625
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.030
Give me Bianca for mypatrimony.

626
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.300
Soft son.

627
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.770
Sir, by your leave,

628
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:57.830
uh, ah, having come to Paduato gather in some debts,

629
00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.230
my son Lucentio made meacquainted

630
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:05.030
with a weighty cause oflove between your daughterand himself,

631
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.430
and for the good report Ihear of you

632
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:10.200
and for the love hebeareth to your daughter--

633
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.170
and she to him--

634
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.300
to stay him not too long,

635
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.200
I am content in a goodfather's care,

636
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.030
to have him match'd,

637
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.730
and if you please to likeno worse than I,

638
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.870
upon some agreement, me shallyou find ready and willing

639
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:29.030
with one consent to haveher so bestow'd,

640
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.870
for curious I cannot bewith you,

641
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.530
Signior Baptista, of whomI hear so well.

642
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.670
Sir, pardon me in what Ihave to say.

643
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:42.000
Your plainness and yourshortness please me well.

644
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.230
Right true it is,

645
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:45.300
your son Lucentio heredoth love my daughter

646
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.530
and she loveth him,

647
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.070
or both dissemble deeplytheir affections--

648
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.870
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

649
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.900
And therefore, if you sayno more than this,

650
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.770
that like a father youwill deal with him

651
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.700
and pass my daughter asufficient dower,

652
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:58.300
the match is made, and allis done.

653
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.730
Your son shall have mydaughter with consent.

654
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.900
Ah, well--

655
00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.470
I thank you, sir.

656
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.100
Where then do you knowbest

657
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:08.070

658
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.200
as shall with eitherpart's agreement stand?

659
00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.930
Not in my house, Lucentio,for, you know,

660
00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.100
pitchers have ears, and Ihave many servants.

661
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.070
Besides, old Gremio ishearkening still,

662
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.900
and happily, we might beinterrupted.

663
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.630
Then at my lodging,

664
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.970
an it like you, there dothmy father lie,

665
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.230
and there, this night,

666
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.500
we'll pass the businessprivately and well.

667
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.000
Send for your daughter byyour servant here.

668
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.100
My boy shall fetch thescrivener presently.

669
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.330
Ay.

670
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.470
The worst is this, that atso slender warning,

671
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:38.170
you are like to have athin and slender pittance.

672
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.500
It likes me well.

673
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.770
Cambio, get you home,

674
00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.630
and bid Bianca make herready straight,

675
00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.570
and if you will, tell whathath happened.

676
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.300
Lucentio's father isarrived in Padua

677
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.170
and how she's like to beLucentio's wife.

678
00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.030
I pray the gods she maywith all my heart.

679
00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.730
Dally not with the gods,but get thee gone.

680
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.200
Signior Baptista, shall Ilead the way?

681
00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.400
Welcome.

682
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400
One mess is like to beyour cheer.

683
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.330
Come, sir, we will betterit in Pisa.

684
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.800
I'll follow you.

685
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.100
Cambio.

686
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:25.530
What sayest thou,Biondello?

687
00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.470
You saw my master wink andlaugh upon you?

688
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.670
Biondello, what of that?

689
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.630
Faith, nothing but hasleft me here behind

690
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.200
to expound the meaning ormoral of his signs and tokens.

691
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.500
I pray thee, moralizethem.

692
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.700
Then thus.

693
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.830
Baptista is safe,

694
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.300
talking with the deceivingfather of a deceitful son.

695
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.600
And what of him?

696
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.900
His daughter is to be broughtby you to the supper.

697
00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.030
And then?

698
00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.800
The old priest of SaintLuke's church

699
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.270
is at your command at allhours.

700
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.530
And what of all this?

701
00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.770
I cannot tell,

702
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.330
expect they are busied abouta counterfeit assurance.

703
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.630
Take you assurance ofher--

704
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.030
"Cum privilegio adimprimendum solum"--in't, eh?

705
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.570
To the church, take thepriest, clerk, and somesufficient honest witnesses.

706
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.470
Now, if this be not thatyou look for, I have nomore to say,

707
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.430
but bid Bianca farewellforever and a day.

708
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.670
Hearest thou, Biondello?

709
00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.770
I cannot tarry.

710
00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.530
I knew a wench married inan afternoon

711
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.030
as she went to the garden forparsley to stuff a rabbit,

712
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.870
and so may you, sir, andso, adieu, sir.

713
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.170
My master hath appointedme to go to Saint Luke's,

714
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.130
to bid the priest be readyto come against

715

I may, and will if she beso contented.

717
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:22.170
She will be pleased.

718
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.630
Then wherefore should Idoubt?

719
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.600
Hap what hap may, I'llroundly go about her.

720
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.270
It shall go hard if Cambiogo without her.

721
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:41.470
Come on, i' God's name, oncemore toward our father's.

722
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:44.770
Good Lord, how bright andgoodly shines the moon.

723
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.430
"The moon"--the sun: it isnot moonlight now.

724
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:50.370
I say it is the moon thatshines so bright.

725
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.930
I know it is the sun thatshines so bright.

726
00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:55.570
By my mother's son, andthat's myself,

727
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.570
it shall be moon or staror what I list,

728
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.600
or ere I journey to yourfather's house.

729
00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.430
Go on, and fetch ourhorses back again.

730
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.770
Evermore cross'd and cross'd,nothing but cross'd.

731
00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.900
Say as he says, or weshall never go.

732
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.730
Forward, I pray, since wehave come so far,

733
00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.370
and be it moon or sun orwhat you please,

734
00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.430
an if you please to callit a rush-candle,

735
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.130
henceforth I vow it shallbe so for me.

736
00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.730
I say it is the moon.

737
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.700
I know it is the moon.

738
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.930
Nay, then you lie.

739
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.200
It is the blessed sun.

740
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.030
Then, God be bless'd, itis the blessed sun,

741
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.600
but sun it is not if yousay it is not,

742
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.700
and the moon changes evenas your mind.

743
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.370
What you will have itnamed, even that it is,

744
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.330
and so it shall be so forKatharine.

745
00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.700
Petruchio, go thy ways.

746
00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.830
The field is won.

747
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.930
Well, forward, forward.

748
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.070
Thus the bowl should run

749
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.200
and not unluckily againstthe bias.

750
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.270
But, soft.

751
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.670
Company is coming here.

752
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.770
Good morrow, gentlemistress.

757
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.170
What stars do spangleheaven with such beauty

758
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.070
as those two eyes becomethat heavenly face?

759
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.130

I hope thou art not mad.

769

This is a man...

770
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.500
old, wrinkled, faded,wither'd,

771
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.100
and not a maiden as thousay'st he is.

772

Now I perceive thou art areverend father.

792
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:59.670
Wonder not nor be notgrieved.

But is this true?

801
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:18.070
Or is it else yourpleasure, like pleasanttravellers,

802
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.300
to break a jest upon thecompany you overtake?

803

I do assure thee, father,so it is.

804
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.500
Come, go along, and seethe truth hereof,

Well, Petruchio, this hasput me in heart.

Have to my widow, and ifshe be froward,

808
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.300
now hast thou taughtHortensio to be untoward.

809
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.970
I marvel Cambio comes notall this while.

810
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.170
Sir, here's the door.

811
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.400
This is Lucentio's house.

812
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.830
My father's lies moretoward the marketplace.

813
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.970
Thither must I, and here Ileave you, sir.

814
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.930
You shall not choose butdrink before you go.

815
00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.900
I think I shall commandyour welcome here,

816
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.870
and by all likelihood,some cheer is toward.

817
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.600
They're busy within.

818
00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.530
You were best knocklouder.

819
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.530
What's he that knocks as hewould beat down the gate?

820
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:21.130
Is Signior Lucentiowithin, sir?

821
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.370
He's within, sir, but notto be spoken withal.

822
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.170
What if a man bring him ahundred pound or two

823
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.200
to make merry withal?

824
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.170
You can keep your hundredpounds to yourself.

825
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.170
He shall need none so longas I live.

826
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.370
Nay, I told you your sonwas well-beloved in Padua.

827
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.830
Do you hear, sir?

828
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.100
To leave frivolouscircumstances, I pray you,

829
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.300
tell Signior Lucentio thathis father

830
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:48.430
is come from Pisa and is hereat the door to speak with him.

831
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.570
Thou liest.

832
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.770
His father is come fromPadua

833
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.670
and here looking out atthe window.

834
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:55.970
Art thou his father?

835
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.670
Ay, sir, so his mothersays if I may believe her.

836
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.030
Why, how now, gentleman.

837
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.830
Why, this is flat knaveryto take upon you anotherman's name.

838
00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.370
Lay hands on the villain.

839
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.200
I believe a' means to cozensomebody in this city

840
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:14.070
under my countenance.

841
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.070
