00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.830


2
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.500
You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

3
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.970
Resolved; resolved.

4
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.070
First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

5
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.130
Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.

6
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.170
For the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread,

7
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.930
not in thirst for revenge.

8
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.300
He's a very dog to the commonalty.

9
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700
Consider you what services he has done for his country?

10
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.370
Very well; and could be content to give him good report for it

11
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.100
but that he pays himself with being proud.

12
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.700
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

13
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.500
I say unto you, what he hath done famously,

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.400
he did it to that end.

15
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
Though soft-conscienced men

16
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230
can be content to say it was for his country,

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.500
he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud,

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.230
which he is, even till the altitude of his virtue.

19
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.670
What he cannot help in his nature

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.670
you account a vice in him.

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.770
What shouts are these?

22
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.570
The other side of the city is risen.

23
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.600
Soft.

24
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.370
Who comes here?

25
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.900
Worthy Menenius Agrippa,

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.830
one that hath always loved the people.

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.670
Where go you with bats and clubs?

28
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.770
The matter?

29
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.530
Speak, I pray you.

30
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.500
Our business is not unknown to the senate.

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.070
They have had inkling this fortnight

32
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.200
what we intend to do,

33
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.400
which now we'll show them in deeds.

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.300
Why, masters, my good friends,

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.030
mine honest neighbors,

36
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030
will you undo yourselves?

37
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.500
We cannot, sir.

38
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.330
We are undone already.

39
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.670
I tell you, friends,

40
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.230
most charitable care have the patricians of you.

41
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.670
Care for us?

42
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.670
True, indeed.

43
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.200
They ne'er cared for us, yet suffer us to famish,

44
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.870
and their storehouses crammed with grain;

45
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.000
make edicts for usury, to support usurers;

46
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.430
repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich;

47
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.000
and provide more piercing statutes daily

48
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to chain up and restrain the poor.

49
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.630
If the wars eat us not up, they will,

50
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.670
and there's all the love they bear us.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.430
Either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious

52
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.400
or be accused of folly.

53
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.300
I shall tell you a pretty tale.

54
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.930
It may be you have heard it, but since it serves my purpose,

55
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.230
I'll venture to stale it a little more.

56
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.270
Well, I'll hear it, sir, yet you must not think

57
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.470
to fob off our disgrace with a tale.

58
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.170
But, and it please you, deliver.

59
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.830
There was a time when all the body's members

60
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.000
rebelled against the belly,

61
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.700
thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain

62
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.670
in the midst of the body, idle and unactive,

63
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.470
still cupboarding the viand,

64
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.030
never bearing like labor with the rest,

65
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.200
where the other instruments did see and hear, devise,

66
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.100
instruct, walk, feel, and mutually participate,

67
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.930
did minister unto the appetites and affection

68
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.930
common of the whole body.

69
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.970
The belly answered

70
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.930
Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

71
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.270
Sir, I shall tell you.

72
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.700
With a kind of smile,

73
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.870
which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus

74
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.070
for, look you,

75
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.730
I may make the belly smile as well as speak.

76
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.330
It tauntingly replied to the discontented members,

77
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
the mutinous parts that envied his receipt,

78
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.600
even so most fitly as you malign our senators

79
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.500
for that they are not such as you.

80
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.230
Your belly's answer, what?

81
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.730
Your most grave belly was deliberate,

82
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.370
not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:

83
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.500
"True is it, my incorporate friends,"

84
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.430
quoth he, "That I receive the general food at first,

85
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.130
"which you do live upon, and fit it is,

86
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.370
"because I am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body.

87
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.100
"But, if you do remember,

88
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.770
"I send it through the rivers of your blood,

89
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.970
"even to the court, the heart, to the seat of the brain,

90
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.900
"and through the cranks and offices of man,

91
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.170
"the strongest nerves and small inferior veins

92
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.800
"from me receive that natural competency

93
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.130
"whereby they live,

94
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.970
and though that all at once, you, my good friends

95
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.430
this said the belly, mark me

96
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.030
Ay, sir; well, well.

97
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.470
"Though all at once cannot see what I do deliver out to each,

98
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.370
"yet I can make my audit up,

99
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.330
"that all from me do back receive the flour of all,

100
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.730
and leave me but the bran."

101
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.500
What say you to it?

102
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.030
It was an answer.

103
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.630
How apply you this?

104
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.300
The senators of Rome are this good belly,

105
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.770
and you the mutinous members.

106
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.630
For examine their counsels and their cares,

107
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.600
digest things rightly touching the weal of the common.

108
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.370
You shall find no public benefit that you receive,

109
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.670
but it proceeds or comes from them to you

110
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.930
and no way from yourselves.

111
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.300
What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,

112
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.800
that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,

113
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.900
make yourselves scabs?

114
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.630
We have ever your good word.

115
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.200
He that will give good words to thee

116
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.130
will flatter beneath abhorring.

117
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.530
What would you have, you curs, that like nor peace nor war?

118
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.970
The one affrights you; the other makes you proud.

119
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.570
He that trusts to you,

120
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.900
where he should find you lions, finds you hares;

121
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.200
where foxes, geese.

122
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.270
You are no surer, no,

123
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.770
than is the coal of fire upon the ice

124
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.130
or hailstone in the sun.

125
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.430
Your virtue is to make him worthy whose offense subdues him

126
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.570
and curse that justice did it.

127
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.600
Who deserves greatness deserves your hate.

128
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.070
Trust ye?

129
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.700
Hang ye.

130
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.100
What's the matter

131
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.830
that in these several places of the city

132
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.470
you cry against the noble senate,

133
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.170
who, under the gods, keep you in awe,

134
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.270
which else would feed on one another?

135
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.970
What's their seeking?

136
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.770
For corn at their own rates,

137
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.400
whereof, they say, the city is well stored.

138
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.670
Hang them!

139
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.400
They say!

140
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.730
They'll sit by the fire

141
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.570
and presume to know what's done in the capitol;

142
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.070
who's like to rise, who thrives and who declines;

143
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.400
side factions and give out conjectural marriages;

144
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.930
making parties strong and feebling such as stand

145
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.530
not in their liking below their cobbled shoes.

146
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.130
They say there's grain enough.

147
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.430
What says the other troop?

148
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.300
O, they're dissolved.

149
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.470
Hang them!

150
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.600
They said they were an-hungry,

151
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.500
sighed forth proverbs, that hunger broke stone walls,

152
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.870
that dogs must eat, that meat was made for mouths,

153
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.230
that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only.

154
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.300
With these shreds, they vented their complainings,

155
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.030
which being answered and a petition granted them,

156
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.330
a strange oneó

157
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.900
to break the heart of generosity,

158
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.400
and make bold power look pale.

159
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.630
They threw their caps

160
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.700
as they would hang them on the horns of the moon,

161
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.400
shouting their emulation.

162
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.930
What is granted them?

163
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.170
Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms

164
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.330
of their own choice.

165
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.600
One's Junius Brutus, Sicinius Velutus,

166
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.970
and I know notó 'Sdeath!

167
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.870
The rabble should have first unroofed the city,

168
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.500
ere so prevailed with me.

169
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.130
It will, in time, win upon power

170
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.730
and throw forth greater themes for insurrection's arguing.

171
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.500
This is strange.

172
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.030
Go, get you home, you fragments!

173
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.270
What's the matter?

174
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.370
The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

175
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.470
I am glad on it.

176
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.570
Then we shall have means to vent our musty superfluity.

177
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.470
They have a leader, Tullus Aufidius,

178
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.030
that will put you to it.

179
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.330
I sin in envying his nobility,

180
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.170
and were I any thing but what I am,

181
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.230
I would wish me only he.

182
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.270
You have fought together.

183
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.530
Were half to half the world by the ears and he.

184
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.330
Upon my party, I'd revolt only to make my wars with him.

185
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.030
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt.

186
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.400
Then, worthy Marcius, attend upon Cominius to these wars.

187
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.930
It is your former promise.

188
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.730
Sir, it is, and I am constant.

189
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.070
Titus Lartius,

190
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.570
thou shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.

191
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.570
What, art thou stiff?

192
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.600
Stand'st out.

193
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.100
No, Caius Marcius, I'll lean upon one crutch

194
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.370
and fight with t'other, ere stay behind this business.

195
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.600
O, true-bred.

196
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.270
Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

197
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.800
He has no equal.

198
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.470
When we were chosen tribunes for the peopleó

199
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.830
Marked you his lip and eyes?

200
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.100
Nay, but his taunts.

201
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.170
Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

202
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.730
Be-mock the modest moon.

203
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.770
And the present wars devour him.

204
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.500
He is grown too proud to be so valiant.

205
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.000
Such a nature, tickled with good success,

206
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.570
disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon.

207
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.370
But I do wonder his insolence

208
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.300
can brook to be commanded under Cominius.

209
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.730
Fame, at the which he aims,

210
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.670
in whom already he's well graced,

211
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.430
cannot better be held nor more attained

212
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.830
than by a place below the first,

213
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.870
for what miscarries shall be the general's fault,

214
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.100
though he perform to the utmost of a man,

215
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.300
and giddy censure will then cry out of Marcius,

216
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.270
"O if he had borne the business."

217
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.930
Besides, if things go well,

218
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.030
opinion that so sticks on Marcius

219
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.900
shall of his demerits rob Cominius.

220
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.870
So your opinion is, Aufidius,

221
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.030
that they of Rome are entered in our counsels

222
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.370
and know how we proceed.

223
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.700
Is it not yours?

224
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.570
What ever have been thought on in this state

225
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.000
that could be brought to bodily act

226
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.170
ere Rome had circumvention?

227
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.500
"Tis not four days gone since I heard thence."

228
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.070
These are the words.

229
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.430
I think I have the letter here; yes, here it is.

230
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.130
"They have pressed a power,

231
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.600
"but it is not known whether for east or west.

232
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.030
"The dearth is great, the people mutinous,

233
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.200
"and it is rumored, Cominius, Marcius, your old enemy,

234
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.100
"who is of Rome worse hated than of you,

235
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.730
"and Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,

236
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.070
"these three lead on this preparation whither 'tis bent.

237
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.270
"Most likely, 'tis for you.

238
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.330
Consider of it."

239
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.700
Our army's in the field.

240
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.670
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready to answer us.

241
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.670
Nor did you think it folly

242
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.500
to keep your great pretenses veiled

243
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.370
till when they needs must show themselves,

244
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.900
which in the hatching, it seemed,

245
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.900
appeared to Rome.

246
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.670
By the discovery, we shall be shortened in our aim,

247
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.470
which was to take in many towns

248
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.670
ere almost Rome should know we were afoot.

249
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.530
Noble Aufidius,

250
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.430
take your commission, hie you to your bands.

251
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.430
Let us alone to guard Corioli.

252
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.470
If they set down before us,

253
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.900
for the remove, bring up your army,

254
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.270
but, I think, you'll find they've not prepared for us.

255
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.630
O, doubt not that; I speak from certainties.

256
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.730
I leave your honors.

257
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.070
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,

258
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.500
'tis sworn between us

259
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.900
we shall ever strike till one can do no more.

260
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.130
I pray thee, daughter,

261
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:48.330
sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.

262
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.800
If my son were my husband,

263
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.930
I should freelier rejoice in that absence

264
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.430
wherein he won honor

265
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.130
than in the embracements of his bed

266
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.570
where he would show most love.

267
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.600
When yet he was but tender-bodied

268
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.900
and the only son of my womb,

269
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.870
when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way,

270
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.500
when for a day of kings' entreaties

271
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.470
a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding,

272
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.470
I, considering how honor would become such a person,

273
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.430
was pleased to let him seek danger

274
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.470
where he was like to find fame.

275
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.430
To a cruel war I sent him from whence he returned,

276
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.330
his brows bound with oak.

277
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.170
I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy

278
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.370
at first hearing he was a man-child

279
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:36.200
than now in first seeing he'd proved himself a man.

280
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.730
But had he died in the business, madam, how then?

281
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:47.030
Then his good report should have been my son.

282
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.530
I therein would have found issue.

283
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.570
Hear me profess sincerely:

284
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.470
had I a dozen sons,

285
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.170
each in my love alike and none less dear

286
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.200
than thine and my good Marcius.

287
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.000
I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country

288
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.800
than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

289
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.470
Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

290
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.870
Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.

291
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.500
Indeed, you shall not.

292
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.830
Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum.

293
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.370
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,

294
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.930
as children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.

295
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.300
Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus:

296
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.630
"Come on, you cowards.

297
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.570
You were got in fear, though you were born in Rome,"

298
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.730
his bloody brow with his mailed hand then wiping,

299
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.100
forth he goesó

300
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.100
His bloody brow.

301
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.530
O, Jupiter, no blood.

302
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.730
Away, you fool.

303
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.870
It more becomes a man than gilt his trophy.

304
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.970
The breasts of Hecuba, when she did suckle Hector,

305
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.630
looked not lovelier than Hector's forehead

306
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.870
when it spit forth blood at Grecian sword, contemning.

307
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.970
Tell Valeria we are fit to bid her welcome.

308
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.730
Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius.

309
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.170
He'll pluck Aufidius' head below his knee

310
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.370
and tread upon his neck.

311
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.170
My ladies both, good day to you.

312
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.400
Sweet madam.

313
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.100
I am glad to see your ladyship.

314
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.670
How do you both?

315
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.530
You are manifest housekeepers.

316
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.170
What are you sewing here?

317
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.100
A fine spot, in good faith.

318
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.630
How does your little son?

319
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.100
I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

320
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.330
He'd rather see the swords and hear a drum

321
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.100
than look upon his schoolmaster.

322
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.070
On my word, the father's son.

323
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.430
I'll swear, 'tis a very pretty boy.

324
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.770
On my troth,

325
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.670
I looked upon him on Wednesday half an hour together.

326
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.370
Has such a confirmed countenance.

327
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.970
I saw him run after a gilded butterfly,

328
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.700
and when he caught it, he let it go again,

329
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.630
and after it again.

330
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.300
And over and over he comes.

331
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.530
And up again, catched it again.

332
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.200
Or whether his fall enraged him, or how 'twas,

333
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.570
he did so set his teeth and tear it.

334
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.870
O, I warrant, how he mammocked it.

335
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.470
One on 's father's moods.

336
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.230
Indeed; la, 'tis a noble child.

337
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.800
A crack, madam.

338
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.930
Come, lay aside your stitchery.

339
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.630
I must have you play the idle housewife

340
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.730
with me this afternoon.

341
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.000
No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

342
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.130
Not out of doors.

343
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.100
She shall; she shall.

344
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.400
Indeed, no, by your patience.

345
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.070
I'll not over the threshold

346
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.970
till my lord return from the wars.

347
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.130
Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably.

348
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.270
Come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

349
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.070
I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers,

350
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.130
but I cannot go thither.

351
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.600
Why, I pray you?

352
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.500
'Tis not to save labor, nor that I want love.

353
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.930
You would be another Penelope.

354
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.070
Yet, they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence

355
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.430
did but fill Ithaca full of moths.

356
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.970
Come; I would your cambric were sensible as your finger

357
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.400
that you might leave pricking it for pity.

358
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.270
Come, you shall go with us.

359
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.030
No, good madam, pardon me.

360
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.300
Indeed, I will not forth.

361
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.930
In truth, la, go with me,

362
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.700
and I'll tell you excellent news of your husband.

363
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.300
O, good madam, there can be none yet.

364
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.230
Verily, I do not jest with you.

365
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.470
There came news from him last night.

366
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.870
Indeed, madam?

367
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.200
In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.

368
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.600
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth,

369
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.500
against whom Cominius the general is gone,

370
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.870
with one part of our Roman power.

371
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.400
Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down

372
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.370
before their city, Corioli.

373
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:01.900
They nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars.

374
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.870
This is true, on mine honor.

375
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.470
And so, I pray, go with us.

376
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.500
Give me excuse, good madam.

377
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.500
I will obey you in everything hereafter.

378
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.630
Let her alone, lady.

379
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.870
As she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.

380
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.370
In troth, I think she would.

381
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.230
Summon the town.

382
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.330
Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

383
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.730
No, nor a man that fears you less than he.

384
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.300
That's lesser than a little.

385
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.200
Hark you; far off.

386
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.370
There is Aufidius.

387
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.270
List what work he makes amongst your cloven army.

388
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.570
O, they are at it.

389
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.300
Their noise be our instruction.

390
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.400
Ladders, ho!

391
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.470
All the contagion of the south light on you,

392
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.030
you shames of Rome,

393
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.730
you herd of boils and plagues.

394
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.300
Plaster you o'er that you may be abhorred

395
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.800
farther than seen

396
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.570
and one infect another against the wind a mile.

397
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:24.070
You souls of geese that bear the shapes of men,

398
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.270
how have you run from slaves that apes would beat.

399
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.070
Pluto and hell.

400
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.700
All hurt behind, backs red and faces pale

401
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.730
with flight and agued fear.

402
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.530
Mend and charge home or, by the fires of heaven,

403
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.400
I'll leave the foe and make my wars on you.

404
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.070
Look to it.

405
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.470
What is become of Marcius?

406
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.170
Slain, sir, doubtless.

407
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.970
Following the fliers at the very heels,

408
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.130
with them he enters,

409
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.300
who, upon the sudden, clapped to their gates.

410
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.200
He is himself alone to answer all the city.

411
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.530
Look, sir.

412
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.200
'Tis Marcius.

413
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.800
Let's fetch him off or make remain alike.

414
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.070
Come I too late?

415
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.230
The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor

416
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.100
more than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue

417
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.900
from every meaner man.

418
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.130
Come I too late?

419
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.370
Ay, if you come not in the blood of others

420
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.700
but mantled in your own.

421
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.900
But how prevailed you?

422
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.000
Will the time serve to tell?

423
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I do not think.

424
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Where is the enemy?

425
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.030
Are you lords of the field?

426
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.470
If not, why cease you till you are so?

427
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.130
Marcius, we have at disadvantage fought

428
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.530
and did retire to win our purpose.

429
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.630
I do beseech you,

430
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.300
by all the battles wherein we have fought,

431
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.100
by the blood we have shed together,

432
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.230
by the vows we have made to endure friends,

433
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.900
that you directly set me against Aufidius and his Antiates

434
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.470
and that you not delay the present

435
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.600
but, filling the air with swords advanced and darts,

436
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.070
we prove this very hour.

437
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.400
Though I could wish you were

438
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.700
conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you,

439
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.030
yet dare I never deny your asking.

440
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.000
Take your choice of those that best can aid your action.

441
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.370
Those are they that most are willing.

442
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.200
If any such be here as it were sin to doubt

443
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.700
that love this painting wherein you see me smeared,

444
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.530
if any fear lesser his person than an ill report,

445
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.200
if any think brave death outweighs bad life

446
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.400
and that his country's dearer than himself,

447
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.030
let him alone, or so many so minded, wave thus

448
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.570
to express his disposition and follow Marcius.

449
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.600
O, me alone.

450
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:38.930
Make you a sword of me?

451
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.500
I'll fight with none but thee,

452
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.430
for I do hate thee worse than a promise breaker.

453
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.430
We hate alike.

454
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.470
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor more than thy fame and envy.

455
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.130
Fix thy foot.

456
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.430
Let the first budger die the other's slave,

457
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.270
and the gods doom him after.

458
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.570
If I fly, Marcius, holloa me like a hare.

459
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.970
Within these three hours, Tullus, alone I fought

460
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.400
in your Corioli walls and made what work I pleased.

461
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.700
'Tis not my blood wherein thou seest me masked,

462
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:42.100
for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest.

463
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.230
Wert thou the Hector that was the whip of thy bragged progeny.

464
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.970
Thou shouldst not 'scape me here.

465
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.070
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.

466
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.100
Good or bad?

467
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.800
Not according to the prayers of the people,

468
00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.900
for they love not Marcius.

469
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.700
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

470
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.470
Pray you, who does the wolf love?

471
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.500
The lamb.

472
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.630
Ay, to devour him,

473
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.570
as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius.

474
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.400
He's a lamb indeed that baas like a bear.

475
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.670
He's a bear indeed that lives like a lamb.

476
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.800
You two are old men.

477
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.500
Tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

478
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500
Well, sir.

479
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.070
In what enormity is Marcius poor

480
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.870
that you two have not in abundance?

481
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.230
He's poor in no one fault but stored with all.

482
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.270
Especially in pride.

483
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.700
Topping all others in boasting.

484
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.600
This is strange now.

485
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.170
Do you two know how you are censured here in the city,

486
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.600
I mean of us of the right-hand file; do you?

487
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.870
Why, how are we censured?

488
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.370
Because you talk of pride now.

489
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.570
Will you not be angry?

490
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.930
Well, well, sir.

491
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:39.930
Well?

492
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.070
Why, 'tis no great matter,

493
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.900
for a very little thief of occasion will rob you

494
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.470
of a great deal of patience.

495
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.000
Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures,

496
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.630
at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so.

497
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.370
You blame Marcius for being proud?

498
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.970
We do it not alone, sir.

499
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.470
I know you do very little alone for your helps are many,

500
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.570
or else your actions would grow wondrous single.

501
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.400
Your abilities are too infant-like

502
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.170
to do much alone.

503
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.870
You talk of pride.

504
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.500
O, that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks

505
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500
and make but an interior survey of your good selves.

506
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500
O, that you could.

507
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.730
What then, sir?

508
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.930
Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud,

509
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.530
violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.

510
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.730
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

511
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.000
You know neither me, yourself, nor anything.

512
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.300
You are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs.

513
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.900
You'd wear out a good wholesome forenoon

514
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.000
hearing a cause

515
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.730
between an orange wife and a fosset-seller

516
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.670
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence

517
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.370
to a second day of audience.

518
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.770
But when you're hearing a matter between party and party,

519
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.930
if you chance to be pinched with the colic,

520
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.830
you make faces like mummers,

521
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.700
set up the bloody flag against all patience,

522
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.830
and, in roaring for a chamber pot,

523
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.700
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled

524
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.170
by your hearing.

525
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.830
All the peace you make in their cause

526
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.230
is calling both the parties knaves.

527
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.370
You are a pair of strange ones.

528
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.570
God-den to your worships.

529
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.900
More of your conversation would infect my brain,

530
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.730
being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians.

531
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.000
I'll be bold to take my leave of you.

532
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.800
If I should tell thee over this thy day's work,

533
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.600
thou'd not believe thy deeds.

534
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.830
But I'll report it

535
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.330
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,

536
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.870
where great patricians shall attend and shrug,

537
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.130
in the end admire,

538
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.130
where ladies shall be frighted, and, gladly quaked, hear more,

539
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.630
where the dull tribunes that, with the fusty plebeians,

540
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.270
hate thine honors, shall say against their hearts,

541
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.200
"We thank the gods our Rome hath such a soldier."

542
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.230
Pray now, no more.

543
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.970
My mother, who has a charter to extol her blood,

544
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.100
when she does praise me, grieves me.

545
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.630
I have done as you have done, that's what I can,

546
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.500
induced as you have been, that's for my country.

547
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.770
He that has but effected his good will

548
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.570
hath overta'en mine act.

549
00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.730
You shall not be the grave of your deserving.

550
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.330
Rome must know the value of her own.

551
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.070
Therefore, I beseech you, in sign of what you are,

552
00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:00.300
not to reward what you have done before our army hear me.

553
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.630
I have some wounds upon me and they smart

554
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.330
to hear themselves remembered.

555
00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.330
Should they not,

556
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.100
well might they fester against ingratitude

557
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.430
and tent themselves with death.

558
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.030
Of all the treasure in this field achieved and city,

559
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.600
we render you the tenth to be taken forth

560
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.600
before the common distribution at your only choice.

561
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.700
I thank you, General,

562
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.970
but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword.

563
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.930
I do refuse it and stand upon my common part

564
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.430
with those that have beheld the doing.

565
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.170
May these same instruments,

566
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.630
which you profane, never sound more!

567
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.870
When drums and trumpets shall in the field prove flatterers,

568
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:55.630
let courts and cities all be made of false-faced soothing!

569
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.600
For that I have not washed my nose that bled

570
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.670
or foiled some debile wretch

571
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.530
which, without note, here's many else have done.

572
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.100
You shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical,

573
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.700
as if I loved my little should be dieted

574
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.000
in praises sauced with lies.

575
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.100
Too modest are you,

576
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.400
more cruel to your good report

577
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.670
than grateful to us that give you truly.

578
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.000
By your patience, if against yourself you be incensed,

579
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.130
we'll put you,

580
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.570
like one that means his proper harm,

581
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.700
in manacles, then reason safely with you.

582
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.630
Therefore, be it known, as to us, to all the world,

583
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.000
that Caius Marcius wears this war's garland,

584
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.430
and from this time, for what he did before Corioli,

585
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:51.230
call him, with all the applause and clamor of the host,

586
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:56.200
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

587
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.600
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

588
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.030
Coriolanus!

589
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.200
Bear the addition nobly ever.

590
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:16.000
I will go wash,

591
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.230
and when my face is fair,

592
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:24.670
you shall perceive whether I blush or no.

593
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.700
The gods begin to mock me.

594
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.770
I, that now refused most princely gifts,

595
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.030
am bound to beg of my lord general.

596
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.300
Take it; 'tis yours.

597
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.370
What is it?

598
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:45.730
I sometime lay here in Corioli at a poor man's house.

599
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.700
He used me kindly.

600
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.900
He cried to me.

601
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.370
I saw him prisoner.

602
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.500
But then Aufidius was within my view,

603
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.900
and wrath o'erwhelmed my pity.

604
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.870
I request you to give my poor host freedom.

605
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.070
O, well begged.

606
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.900
Were he the butcher of my son,

607
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.200
he should be free as is the wind.

608
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.470
Deliver him, Titus.

609
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.870
Marcius, his name?

610
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.300
By Jupiter, forgot.

611
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.070
I am weary.

612
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:45.930
Yea, my memory is tired.

613
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.070
Have we no wine here?

614
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.930
The town is ta'en.

615
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:56.400
'Twill be delivered back on good condition.

616
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.600
Condition.

617
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.270
I would I were a Roman,

618
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.670
for I cannot, being a Volsce, be that I am.

619
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.430
Condition.

620
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.700
What good condition can a treaty find

621
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.570
in the part that is at mercy?

622
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.530
Five times, Marcius, I've fought with thee.

623
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.330
So often hast thou beat me and wouldst do so, I think,

624
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.770
should we encounter as often as we eat.

625
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.670
By the elements, if e'er again I meet him beard to beard,

626
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.000
he's mine,

627
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.230
or I am his.

628
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.470
Mine emulation hath not that honor in it it had

629
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.100
for where I thought to crush him in an equal force.

630
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.300
True sword to sword,

631
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.500
I'll potch at him some way

632
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.600
or wrath or craft may get him.

633
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.370
He is the devil.

634
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:04.630
Bolder, though not so subtle.

635
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.670
My valor's poisoned with only suffering stain by him,

636
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:12.430
for him shall fly out of itself.

637
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:15.970
Nor sleep nor sanctuary,

638
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:20.800
being naked, sick, nor fane nor capitol,

639
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.570
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,

640
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.500
embarquements all of fury,

641
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.600
shall lift up their rotten privilege

642
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:34.000
and custom against my hate to Marcius.

643
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.570
Where I find him,

644
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.170
were it at home, upon my brother's guard,

645
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:44.270
even there, against the hospitable canon,

646
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:51.470
would I wash my fierce hand in his heart.

647
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:54.470
