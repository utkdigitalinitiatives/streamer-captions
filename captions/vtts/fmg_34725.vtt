"HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE..."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
IT'S THE RECYCLING
OF ELEMENTS -

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THAT IS WHAT WE
CALL "GEOCYCLES".

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
GEOCYCLES ARE THE
PROCESSES ON EARTH

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
THAT MOVE AND
RECYCLE MATTER.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
THE EARTH IS A
DRAMATIC PLACE.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
AND WHILE IT CONTINUES
TO CHANGE AND EVOLVE,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
IT HAS PROCESSES WHICH KEEP
OUR PLANET IN BALANCE.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
GLOBAL STUDIES USE NEW AND
EXPANDING TECHNOLOGIES

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND
HOW THE EARTH WORKS.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
MODERN EARTH SCIENCE LOOKS
AT THE EARTH AS A SYSTEM.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
BUT WITHIN THE
EARTH'S SYSTEM WE HAVE

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
A WHOLE LOT
OF SUBSYSTEMS.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
WHEN WE LOOK
AT THE EARTH,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
WE SEE FOUR
FUNDAMENTAL SYSTEMS.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
WE SEE THE HYDROSPHERE
WHICH IS ALL THE WATER

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
ON THE PLANET; WE SEE
THE LITHOSPHERE WHICH IS

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
THE ROCKY OUTER SHELL OF
THE EARTH; WE SEE THE

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
BIOSPHERE WHICH IS ALL
LIVING MATTER ON THE

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
PLANET; AND WE SEE THE
ATMOSPHERE WHICH IS THIS

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
DELICATE THIN ENVELOPE OF
GAS THAT PROTECTS US FROM

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
ALL SORTS OF NASTY
THINGS FROM OUTER SPACE

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
AND CONTAINS THAT PLEASANT
GAS CALLED "OXYGEN"

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
WHICH ALLOWS US TO
LIVE AND BREATHE.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
THE IMPORTANT THING TO
NOTE ABOUT EACH OF

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
THESE SYSTEMS IS THEY
ALL WORK TOGETHER.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
NO ONE SYSTEM
WORKS IN ISOLATION.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
THESE SYSTEMS
WORK TOGETHER TO

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
RECYCLE EARTH'S PRECIOUS
MATTER AND ELEMENTS

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
LIKE WATER,
ROCKS, AND CARBON.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
THE CARBON CYCLE IS A
REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
CARBON BEING CYCLED
THROUGH THE SPHERES.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
CARBON IS THE FOURTH
MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
IN THE UNIVERSE
AND IS CONSIDERED

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
THE BUILDING
BLOCK OF LIFE.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
THE CARBON CYCLE IS VERY
COMPLEX, AND THERE ARE

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
MANY WAYS IT CAN CYCLE
BETWEEN ALL THE SPHERES.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
BUT THERE ARE TWO
MAJOR CATEGORIES:

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
THE SHORT TERM AND THE
LONG TERM CARBON CYCLE.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
THE SHORT TERM, OR
BIOLOGICAL CARBON CYCLE,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
OCCURS OVER PERIODS OF
DAYS TO THOUSANDS OF YEARS

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
AND IS ALSO CALLED THE
BIOLOGICAL CARBON CYCLE

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
BECAUSE BIOLOGY PLAYS AN
IMPORTANT ROLE OF CARBON

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
MOVING BETWEEN LAND,
OCEAN, AND ATMOSPHERE

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
THROUGH PROCESSES SUCH
AS PHOTOSYNTHESIS.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
THE SHORT TERM CARBON CYCLE
REALLY IS CARBON BEING

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
TAKEN UP BY PLANTS IN THE
PROCESS OF THEIR LIVING -

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
BASICALLY SOMETHING
CALLED "PHOTOSYNTHESIS".

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
CARBON IN THE PRESENCE
OF WATER AND SUNLIGHT

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
IS GOBBLED UP BY PLANTS,
AND PLANTS HAVE THE

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
GRACIOUS QUALITY
OF PRODUCING OXYGEN

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
AND OF PROCESSING
SUGARS.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
SO, CARBON IS TAKEN UP
BY PLANTS AND, IN TURN,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
PLANTS ARE EATEN BY
ANIMALS WHICH THEN DIE

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
AND WHEN THEY DECOMPOSE
THEY CAN LIBERATE

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
THOSE ELEMENTS BACK
TO THE PLANET.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
THE LONG TERM, OR
GEOLOGICAL CARBON CYCLE,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
OCCURS OVER PERIODS
OF MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
IN THE LONG TERM CARBON
CAN BE CONSUMED BY PLANTS

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
IN PARTICULAR AND THOSE
PLANTS CAN THEN BE BURIED

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THAT PRODUCES VERY
VALUABLE THINGS LIKE OIL

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
AND NATURAL GAS AND
LIBERATING THAT CARBON

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
AGAIN, IN A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT FORM.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
WHEN OIL AND NATURAL GAS
ARE BURNED FOR ENERGY,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
CARBON IS RELEASED BACK
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
BUT THE BALANCE OF CARBON
ON EARTH IS IN DANGER

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
OF BEING DISRUPTED.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
WE ARE CUTTING DOWN MORE
AND MORE TREES, DECREASING

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
ORGANISMS THAT ABSORB
AND USE THE CARBON.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
WE ARE ALSO A SOURCE OF
EXTRA CARBON BECAUSE WE'RE

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
BURNING FOSSIL FUELS AND
WE ARE INPUTTING EXTRA

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
AMOUNTS OF CARBON INTO
THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
COMBINED WITH OXYGEN,
FORMS THIS CARBON DIOXIDE

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
THAT IS IN THE NEWS AND
EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
CARBON DIOXIDE IS
AN IMPORTANT GAS

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
IN OUR ATMOSPHERE.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
BUT SCIENTISTS WORRY
AN INCREASE OF CO2'S

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
IN THE ATMOSPHERE COULD
CAUSE EXTREME CHANGES

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
ON THE EARTH, LIKE CHANGING
SEA LEVELS, TEMPERATURES,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
AND WEATHER PATTERNS.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
THE HYDROLOGIC CYCLE
IS PROBABLY EARTH'S

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
MOST IMPORTANT CYCLE.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
AND WHAT IT IS, IS HOW
FRESH WATER CYCLES

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
THROUGH THE EARTH
AND THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
OUR CIVILIZATION IS
ENTIRELY DEPENDENT

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
ON SOURCES
OF FRESH WATER.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
FRESH WATER FOR
DRINKING WATER,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
FRESH WATER FOR AGRICULTURE
AND, INCREASINGLY,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
WATER FOR A WIDE VARIETY
OF INDUSTRIAL USES.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
OFTEN CALLED THE "WATER
PLANET", EARTH IS COVERED

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
WITH THIS PRECIOUS
RESOURCE IN OCEANS,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
THE AIR, THE SOIL, BUT MOST
OF IT IS NOT FRESH WATER.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
IF YOU LOOK AT
THE WORLD'S WATER,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
MOST OF IT'S SALT WATER.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
ABOUT 97% OF ALL THE WATER
ON THE PLANET EARTH IS

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
SALT WATER AND NOT
READILY AVAILABLE

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION
OR INDUSTRIAL USE.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
THAT 3% OF FRESH WATER
ON THE PLANET EARTH,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
MOST OF THAT'S TAKEN UP
IN GLACIAL ICE - ABOUT 2%.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
THAT LEAVES US
ABOUT A PERCENT

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
OF USEABLE FRESH WATER.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
OF THAT USEABLE FRESH
WATER, MOST OF THAT -

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
ABOUT 90% OF THAT
- IS GROUND WATER.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
HOW WE GET THE IMPORTANT
GROUND WATER WE NEED

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
IS THROUGH THE
HYDROLOGIC CYCLE.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
THE WATER ON EARTH IS
ESSENTIALLY CONSTANTLY

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
BEING RECYCLED.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
YOU'VE GOT WATER
EVAPORATING FROM THE OCEANS

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
AND CURRENTLY A LOT FROM
THE DIFFERENT ICE CAPS.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF THE
WATER DRAINING FROM ICE

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
TO WATER THAT GETS MOVED
UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
WHERE IT'S MOVED
AROUND, YOU KNOW,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
IT FORMS CLOUDS
AND WE GET RAIN.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
THAT WATER
EVENTUALLY

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
- WHEN IT FALLS
ON LAND, ANYWAY -

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
EITHER FLOWS BACK TO
THE OCEAN AND RECYCLES

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
ITSELF THAT WAY OR GOES
INTO THE UNDERGROUND

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AND BECOMES, YOU
KNOW, GROUND WATER -

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
A VERY APT NAME FOR IT
- WHERE IT STILL MOVES.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
ONCE IT GETS UNDERGROUND
IT DOESN'T JUST STAY STILL.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
IT'S STILL GUIDED BY
THE FORCES OF GRAVITY,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
SO WILL SLOWLY WORK ITS
WAY DOWN AND ACTUALLY

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
SLOWLY MOVE EITHER TO
SPRINGS OR PLACES WHERE

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
IT FEEDS INTO RIVERS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
SOMETIMES THE GROUND WATER
IS CAUGHT IN THE WATER TABLE

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
- THE UPPER LIMIT OF
THE GROUND WATER

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
WHERE WE CAN
DRILL FOR IT.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
IN THE WINTER YOU'VE
GOT ALL THESE ICICLES

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
SEEMING TO SPRING
RIGHT OUT OF THE ROCK.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
WHAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY
LOOKING AT IS YOU'VE CUT

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
THROUGH THE PATH TO THE
WATER TABLE OF RAIN WATER.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
THE WATER IS OBVIOUSLY
AFFECTED BY GRAVITY,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
BUT WHEN WE CUT THROUGH
IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
WE INTERRUPT
THAT PATHWAY.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
SO INSTEAD OF SLOWLY
FLOWING THROUGH THE ROCK,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
IT NOW COMES OUT IN THE AIR
AND MOVES THROUGH THE AIR.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
AND A LOT OF PLACES
WHERE YOU SEE THESE

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
SEEPS AND SPRINGS,
THAT'S THAT GROUND WATER

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
MOVING OUT ONTO
THE SURFACE.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
DUE TO FORCES OF GRAVITY,
IF WE DO NOT INTERRUPT

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
THE FLOW OF GROUND
WATER, IT WILL FLOW INTO

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
RIVERS AND OCEANS
EVENTUALLY EVAPORATING

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
AND START THE CYCLE
ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
ROCKS ARE ALWAYS BEING
CREATED AND DESTROYED

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
IN WHAT WE CALL
THE ROCK CYCLE.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
SO, BECAUSE WE HAVE PLATE
TECTONICS AND WE HAVE THE

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
EARTH'S SURFACE CONSTANTLY
BEING RENEWED, WE'RE ALSO

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
FORMING AND DESTROYING
ROCKS ALL THE TIME.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
BECAUSE ROCKS ARE
CONSTANTLY BEING RECYCLED,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
THERE IS NO TRUE BEGINNING
OR END TO THE ROCK CYCLE.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
BUT WE CAN ARBITRARILY
START WITH AN IGNEOUS ROCK,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
FORMED FROM MOLTEN
LIQUID MINERALS

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
MOLTEN MAGMA FROM THE EARTH
COOLS BENEATH THE SURFACE

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
AND IT FORMS CRYSTALLINE
IGNEOUS ROCK -

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
LIKE A GRANITE,
FOR INSTANCE.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
IF WE UPLIFTED IGNEOUS ROCK
ONTO THE EARTH'S SURFACE

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
THROUGH A PLATE TECTONIC
PROCESS, THAT ROCK WILL

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
EVENTUALLY BE BROKEN
DOWN INTO WHAT'S CALLED

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
"DETRITUS", MORE COMMONLY
KNOWN AS SEDIMENT.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
THAT MATERIAL WILL
THEN BE TRANSPORTED,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
USUALLY BY WATER, BUT
ALSO WIND AND ICE

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
ARE VERY EFFICIENT
TRANSPORT MEDIUMS

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
THAT CAN MOVE
SEDIMENT ABOUT.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
IF THAT SEDIMENT IS
COMPACTED AND CEMENTED

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
TOGETHER, WE'VE MADE
A SEDIMENTARY ROCK.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
WE'VE TAKEN AN IGNEOUS
ROCK THAT'S ON THE SURFACE

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
OF THE EARTH AND WE'VE
MADE A SEDIMENTARY ROCK.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
SEDIMENTARY ROCK IS
THEN USUALLY COMPACTED

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
BY THE WEIGHT OF
OVERLYING LAYERS.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
IT'S LAYER UPON LAYER UPON
LAYER OF SEDIMENT AND IT'S

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
GETTING VERY, VERY - MORE
PRESSURE, MORE TEMPERATURE.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
THOSE PRESSURES AND
TEMPERATURES EVENTUALLY,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
DEEP IN THE EARTH, CAUSE
THE ROCK TO CHANGE AGAIN.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
IT CAUSES THE CHEMISTRY TO
WANT TO REARRANGE ITSELF

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
TO ACCOMMODATE TO THOSE
PRESSURES AND TEMPERATURES.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
SO, THAT PROCESS IS
CALLED "METAMORPHISM".

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
METAMORPHISM
MEANS "CHANGE FORM",

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS
ARE PRODUCED FROM

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
PRE-EXISTING ROCKS -
SEDIMENTARY, IGNEOUS,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
OR EVEN OTHER
METAMORPHIC ROCKS.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
AND IF WE TAKE THAT
METAMORPHIC ROCK,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
NOW WE'VE ALMOST COME
FULL CYCLE, IF WE TAKE THAT

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
METAMORPHIC ROCK AND
SUBJECT IT TO ENOUGH HEAT

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
TO WHERE IT MELTS AND THEN
WE TAKE THAT MOLTEN ROCK -

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
SOMETHING CALLED "MAGMA"
- AND WE LET IT COOL AND

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
CRYSTALLIZE, WE'RE RIGHT
BACK WHERE WE STARTED WITH

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
OUR IGNEOUS ROCK AND WE'VE
COMPLETED THE ROCK CYCLE.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
EARTH'S SURFACE IS
CONSTANTLY CHANGING.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
ROCKS CAN BE TRANSFORMED AND
TRANSFERRED TO NEW LOCATIONS

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
DUE TO FORCES OF NATURE
SUCH AS WIND AND WATER,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
SOMETIMES CREATING DRAMATIC
AND MAJESTIC SCENERY.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
EARTH'S MATERIALS ARE
BROKEN DOWN AND MOVED

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
DUE TO SURFACE PROCESSES
SUCH AS WEATHERING,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
MASS WASTING,
AND EROSION.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
WEATHERING IS THE SURFACE
PROCESS THAT BREAKS DOWN

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
OR ALTERS ROCKS AT
OR NEAR THE SURFACE.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY
TYPES OF WEATHERING.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THERE'S MECHANICAL
WEATHERING AND THERE'S

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
CHEMICAL WEATHERING.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
MECHANICAL, SOMETIMES CALLED
"PHYSICAL" WEATHERING,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
RESULTS WHEN A ROCK
IS MECHANICALLY

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
OR PHYSICALLY
BUSTED APART.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE
A TREE ROOT THAT WOULD GROW

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
UP IN A CRACK OF A ROCK
AND SPLIT THE ROCK IN TWO.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
IN WINTER WHEN THERE'S
LOTS OF ICE, ICE TENDS TO

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
GET INTO CRACKS AND
BREAK APART ROCKS.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
WATER BREAKS DOWN
ROCKS REALLY WELL

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
THERE'S A LOT OF IT

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AND IT CAN PRODUCE
A GREAT FORCE.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
WATER IS ALSO AN
IMPORTANT FACTOR

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
IN CHEMICAL WEATHERING.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
CHEMICAL WEATHERING IS A
REACTION TYPICALLY WITH

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
ACIDIC RAIN WATER OR
ACIDIC GROUND WATER

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
OR THE OXYGEN IN THE
ATMOSPHERE THAT WILL

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
CHEMICALLY ALTER
AND CHANGE THE ROCK.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
USUALLY WHAT CHEMICAL
WEATHERING WILL DO

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
WILL BEGIN TO BREAK
THE ROCK DOWN,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
IT WILL BEGIN TO
DISINTEGRATE THE ROCK.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL
WEATHERING WILL WORK

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
IN TANDEM AND
THEY'LL OFTEN WORK

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
VERY EFFICIENTLY TOGETHER
BECAUSE PHYSICAL WEATHERING

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
TAKES THE ROCK AND
MAKES A BIG ROCK INTO

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
A BUNCH OF LITTLE SMALL
ROCKS THAT IS MUCH MORE

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
SUSCEPTIBLE NOW TO
CHEMICAL WEATHERING.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
SO CHEMICAL WEATHERING
AND MECHANICAL OR PHYSICAL

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
WEATHERING WORK TOGETHER
TO DISINTEGRATE ROCKS.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
CHEMICAL WEATHERING IS
MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
IN HUMID CLIMATES WHERE
MECHANICAL WEATHERING

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
IS MORE PRONOUNCED
IN ARID CLIMATES.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
CLIMATE FACTORS SUCH AS
TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
AFFECT THE BREAKDOWN OF
ROCK AND THUS THE TYPE

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
OF SOIL YOU WILL
FIND IN A REGION.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
SOIL IS ONE OF THE MAJOR
PRODUCTS OF WEATHERING.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
IT IS ESSENTIALLY THE
COMBINATION OF PARTICLES

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
OF ROCK, MINERALS,
AND ORGANIC MATERIAL

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
PRODUCED THROUGH THE
WEATHERING PROCESS

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
THAT CONTAINS THE NUTRIENTS
NECESSARY TO SUPPORT

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
THE VARIOUS FORMS OF
PLANT LIFE ON THE PLANET.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
IT'S VERY TRUE.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
CLIMATE CAN HAVE
A DRAMATIC EFFECT

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
ON THE KINDS OF
SOILS THAT FORM.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IN A DESERT WE
DON'T GET A LOT OF RAINFALL.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
WE ONLY GET MAYBE SIX OR
SEVEN INCHES OF RAIN A YEAR.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
AND SO THE AMOUNT OF
CHEMICAL WEATHERING WE GET

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
IN A DESERT IS NOT A WHOLE
LOT AND THAT MEANS THAT

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
WE'LL GET CERTAIN KINDS
OF FEATURES FORMING IN

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
THE SOIL, OR PROPERTIES
OF THE SOIL THAT REFLECT

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
THE LIMITED RAINFALL WE
GET IN A DESERT AREA.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
BUT IN AN AREA LIKE
AMAZONIA WHERE YOU GET

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
100 INCHES OF RAIN
OR MORE, THE SOILS

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
BECOME VERY STRONGLY
CHEMICALLY WEATHERED

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
OVER THOUSANDS
OF YEARS.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
AND THE SOILS WE SEE
IN THAT AREA THEN ARE

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE
SOILS WE SEE IN A DESERT.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
AND IN THAT PARTICULAR
CASE, THE DIFFERENCES IN

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
THOSE SOILS MOSTLY REFLECT
DIFFERENCES IN CLIMATE

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
WHICH ARE, OF COURSE,
DIRECTLY RELATED

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
TO DIFFERENCES
IN THE BIOTA

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
ASSOCIATED WITH
THOSE SOILS.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
SO IT'S VERY TRUE THAT
CLIMATE, VEGETATION,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
TOPOGRAPHY OR GEOGRAPHY
HAS A DRAMATIC EFFECT

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
ON THE TYPES OF
SOILS WE SEE.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
SOILS ARE ANOTHER ONE OF
EARTH'S PRECIOUS RESOURCES.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
BECAUSE OF SOIL WE CAN GROW
CORN, COTTON, OR APPLES,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
DEPENDING ON THE CLIMATE
AND NUTRIENTS IN THE SOIL.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
MASS WASTING REFERS TO THE
MOVEMENT OF ROCK OR SOIL

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF GRAVITY.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
MASS WASTING IS A FORM OF
EROSION, OR FORM OF THESE

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
BREAKDOWN PROCESSES WHERE
THERE'S LARGE CATASTROPHIC

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
LANDSLIDES OR ROCKSLIDES.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT IS
REFERRED TO AS MASS WASTING.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
THINGS LIKE MUDSLIDES
WHICH ARE MAJOR GEOLOGIC

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
FORCES THAT ACTUALLY
CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
AND OBVIOUSLY
THINGS LIKE FLOODS.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
HISTORICALLY, THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER HAS EVEN

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
CHANGED ITS COURSE
MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE WE

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
KIND OF "ENGINEERED" IT
INTO ITS CURRENT PATH.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
BUT THAT'S A RESULT OF
FAIRLY REGULAR FLOODS

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
- YOUR 500 YEAR,
YOUR 1000 YEAR FLOODS -

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
WHICH HERE YOU'RE
STARTING TO GET INTO

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
A HUMAN TIME FRAME
WHERE THE PATHS OF

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
EVEN SOME OF THESE LARGE
RIVERS HAVE MOVED.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
MASS WASTING CAN CHANGE
THE LANDSCAPE VERY QUICKLY,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
BUT OTHER PROCESSES
LIKE EROSION CAN HAPPEN

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
VERY SLOWLY AND CAN
PRODUCE AMAZING SIGHTS.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
MOST OF THESE GRAND
GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
THAT WE SEE AND GO ON
FAMILY VACATIONS TO

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
ARE THE RESULT OF REALLY
LONG TERM EROSION.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
PLACES LIKE THE GRAND
CANYON, THAT WAS FORMED

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
ENTIRELY FROM EROSIVE
PROCESSES FROM MASSIVE

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
RIVERS AND SEASONAL
FLOODING THAT JUST

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
CONTINUALLY WORE AWAY
AT SPECIFIC PARTS

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
AND REVEALED THESE
HUGE ROCK LAYERS.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
EROSION HAPPENS WHEN
WATER AND WIND AND ICE

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
CARRY AWAY PARTICLES
OF ROCK AND SOIL,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
CARVING AND SHAPING
THE LANDSCAPE.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
YOU'VE GOT RAIN...

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
GLACIERS ARE A VERY
BIG EARTH-MOVING FORCE.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
GLACIERS ARE PART OF
THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
AND THE ROCK CYCLE AND
ARE BASICALLY THICK ICE

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
THAT FORMS OVER HUNDREDS
OR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
THERE ARE TWO BASIC
KINDS OF GLACIERS:

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
ALPINE AND CONTINENTAL.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
CONTINENTAL GLACIERS
COVER THOUSANDS OR

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF SQUARE MILES.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
FOR EXAMPLE,
GREENLAND IS ALMOST

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
ENTIRELY COVERED IN ICE.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD
MODERN-DAY EXAMPLE OF

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
A CONTINENTAL GLACIER
BECAUSE IT COVERS

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
THE ENTIRE CONTINENT.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
CONTINENTAL GLACIERS ARE
EXTREMELY THICK AND CAN

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
LITERALLY SCOUR
THE LANDSCAPE FLAT.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
AS THEY'RE MOVING FORWARD,
AS THEY'RE GROWING,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
THEY'RE BASICALLY SCRAPING
UP EVERYTHING IN THEIR WAKE.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
SO THEY'RE PICKING UP
ROCKS, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
CARVING GROOVES INTO THE
ROCK AND PICKING UP DIRT.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
AND AS THEY'RE LEAVING,
AS THEY'RE RECEDING,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
THEY'RE LEAVING
THAT STUFF BEHIND.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
THEY'RE DUMPING OUT
EVERYTHING THEY'VE

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
PICKED UP ON THE WAY.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
THE NORTHERN PART
OF NORTH AMERICA,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
IF YOU LOOK AT THE
LANDSCAPE IN THE MIDWEST

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
AND PLACES AROUND
THE GREAT LAKES

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
YOU NOTICE AREAS THAT
ARE EXTREMELY FLAT.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
THEY'RE FLAT AND THEY'VE
BEEN GROUND DOWN TO BEDROCK

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
AND THE REASON THAT IS
IS WE'VE HAD CONTINENTAL

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
GLACIERS BASICALLY SCOUR
AWAY MUCH OF NORTH AMERICA.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
ALPINE GLACIERS WHICH
YOU FIND IN THE ALPS,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IN EUROPE,
OR EVEN IN PARTS

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
OF THE SIERRA
NEVADA IN CALIFORNIA -

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
THESE ARE GLACIERS
THAT ARE MUCH SMALLER

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
AND FORM IN HIGH
MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
AND PRODUCE VERY DRAMATIC
TOPOGRAPHIC FEATURES,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
LIKE THE MATTERHORN IS
AN EXAMPLE OF A FEATURE

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
THAT'S BEEN CARVED OUT
BY ALPINE GLACIAL ICE.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
THE RUGGED PEAKS, THE
GRANDEST OF CANYONS,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
THE BEAUTIFUL AND UNUSUAL
LANDSCAPES - ALL RESULTS

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
OF THE WATER AND AIR AND
WIND AND OTHER PROCESSES

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
THAT HAVE SCULPTED
THE VARIOUS TERRAINS

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
OVER MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
THE EFFECT THEY HAVE
ON OVERALL TERRAINS

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
CANNOT BE SEEN ON
THE SHORT TERM,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
YOU HAVE TO WAIT
VERY LONG TERM.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
OFTEN THEY'RE HAPPENING
BELOW US AS WE SPEAK.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING UNDER OUR FEET,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
BUT THESE SAME PROCESSES
ARE CONTINUOUSLY GOING ON

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
AND EVENTUALLY, MILLIONS
OF YEARS FROM NOW,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
WHEN THE SURFACE HAS BEEN
ERODED, WHEN WATER AND AIR

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
HAVE PUSHED ASIDE
EVERYTHING THAT'S HERE

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
AND DEPOSITED IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE
NOW TALKING ABOUT

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
WILL HAVE COME TO THE
SURFACE AND REPLACED IT

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
AND WE'LL SEE THE
RESULTS OF THOSE FORCES.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
THE RESULTS OF THE FORCES
AND PROCESSES ON EARTH

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:11.000
HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE
TO SHAPE OUR PLANET.
