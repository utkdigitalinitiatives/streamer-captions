00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.010



00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.910

        In my mind, there's nothing
        quite like that moment in the
      

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.070

        theater where the curtains rise,
        and there before you is
      

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.730

        another world.


00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.650

        And that's you department,
        the design department.
      

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.120

        Like any department in the
        theater, you have to begin
      

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.270

        with planning.


00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.190

        What's your first step?


00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.110

        Well, it's to read the script.


00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.600

        And most scripts have
        a set description.
      

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.730

        For example, Peter
        Pan-- which we're
      

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.260

        working on at the moment--


00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.820

        will give you a description
        of the house
      

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.120

        Mr. and Mrs. Darling.


00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.440

        The exterior.


00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.370

        I do some thumbnail sketches
        like this, reading scripts and
      

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.700

        taking notes and having
        chats with the
      

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.050

        director and what he wants.


00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.230

        And research as well?


00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.330

        Researching books, libraries,
        museums, films, photographs,
      

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.400

        anything we can get a hold of
        which is relative to the style
      

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.640

        and period.


00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.420

        From this we go into a
        more detailed sketch.
      

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.340

        Goodness, I should say.


00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.810

        This was the first idea I had
        for the outside of Mr. and
      

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.070

        Mrs. Darling's house
        in Bloomsbury.
      

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.330

        And you can see Peter
        Pan up there.
      

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.530

        Now, having presented this to
        the director, although he
      

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.540

        liked it, it wasn't suitable
        for the style he
      

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.230

        was going to it.


00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.660

        And it was more of a straight


00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.160

        Victorian play than a pantomime.


00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.720

        So from this sketch we've gone
        into that, which is the
      

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.770

        original style of building.


00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.400

        This finished result is
        basically a back cloth with a
      

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.020

        practical door.


00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.440

        And you've got other
        sketches, yeah?
      

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.130

        I want to see these.


00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.570

        Well, these are the
        mermaid's lagoon,
      

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.630

        which is another scene.


00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.650

        Again, this is the first
        ideas we had.
      

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.900

        And another one here.


00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.800

        But great depth it produces.


00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.960

        Well, that's part of stage
        design as art is to create
      

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.210

        depth and space in a black
        box, basically.
      

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.790

        Now from these, we
        go into a model.
      

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.700

        Now the model is based
        on the ground plan.
      

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.630

        This is the ground plan
        of the stage.
      

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.510

        It's done to scale.


00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.630

        And this is the first
        stage of a model.
      

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.370

        It's a white card model.


00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.170

        It's just made out of mounting
        board and PVA glue.
      

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.650

        Now because this has to be taken
        away-- i.e. struck--
      

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.790

        during the show, in front
        of the audience,
      

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.590

        this has been trucks.


00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.610

        That on wheels, isn 't it?


00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.730

        On wheels.


00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.970

        So the scene change will
        actually be in view of the
      

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.840

        audience and it will do this.


00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.360

        It will come off to the
        back of the theater.
      

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.650

        These two pieces will then come
        off into the wings, and
      

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.750

        these two pieces--


00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.250

        i.e. the kennel and
        bit of wall--
      

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.670

        will just disappear
        into the wings.
      

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.860

        We then have a front cloth which
        comes flying in, which
      

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.410

        you can see downstairs.


00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.510

        Everything is planned, so we
        can know exactly how each
      

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.320

        piece of scenery was going
        to fit into the
      

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.810

        wings and on stage.


00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.820

        Because in this show it is
        incredibly heavy scenery, so
      

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.290

        there's only a certain
        amount of wing space.
      

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.330

        So each section has to fit, not
        only on stage, but also
      

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.210

        off stage as well.


00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.710

        And so, presumably, the next
        stage would be painting it.
      

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.990

        Well, from this we actually
        go into a full color
      

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.340

        model, which are these.


00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.280

        So it is from this stage that
        then we go into painting.
      

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.730

        And we use the model to
        base the painting on.
      

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.520

        And texturize it
        as well, I see.
      

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.240

        That's right.


00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.420

        Wonderful.


00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.520

        And painting we're
        coming onto next.
      

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.590

        And will I be allowed a--


00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.760

        Of course.


00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.160

        --go at painting?


00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.330

        Oh, I will?


00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.980

        Oh, good.


00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.230

        Looking forward to that.


00:03:51.230 --> 00:04:01.740



00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.980

        How do you begin
        with painting?
      

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.750

        Surely you don't just
        take a brush and
      

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:06.750

        begin with your backcloth?


00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.760

        What's the order of events?


00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.930

        Well, after we've done a black
        and white pencil sketch, we
      

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.070

        start on these color visuals--
        which again, are to scale--
      

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.850

        and we use these artist's
        gouache because they represent
      

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.750

        a very good color match to the
        scenery paint that we use.
      

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.050

        Now the backcloth is squared up
        in half inch squares, and
      

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.900

        when we paint it onto the actual
        real backcloth, we
      

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.710

        scale it up to one
        foot squares.
      

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.700

        So we just enlarge it
        square by square.
      

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.540

        These are other examples
        of different shows.
      

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.530

        This is a pantomime.


00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.450

        And this one is a little
        more complicated view
      

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.790

        of a dockland scene.


00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.370

        Now again, these are all half
        inch squares, but because it's
      

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.050

        a little more detailed we grid
        this into two foot squares.
      

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.110

        So it just gives us an
        extra bit of help.
      

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.050

        Further detail.


00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.600

        That's right.


00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.030

        And now let's return to this
        lagoon, which I saw last as a
      

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.140

        sketch, and it has become
        more colorful.
      

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.690

        That's right.


00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.120

        From that sketch, we've now
        got a scale model of the
      

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.320

        various cut cloths, ground rows,
        rocks and paraphernalia.
      

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.580

        What is missing on this model is
        two large clam shells with
      

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.160

        pearls that light up and
        mermaids that drape around it.
      

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.200

        We've got something downstairs,
        I know, and this
      

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.400

        is its mini version.


00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.270

        It's the nursery, isn't it?


00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.750

        That's right.


00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.580

        Exactly the same process
        as the other
      

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.690

        sketches I've showed you.


00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.380

        We're in the middle of painting
        this, and this is
      

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.290

        where we started from.


00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.370

        And here is the actual
        life-sized set, and I must say
      

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.400

        it looks grand.


00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.040

        Ian, this is our front
        cloth, as well.
      

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.210

        It's a front cloth isn't it?


00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.570

        Now can you explain how this
        works in relation to the set?
      

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.100

        Well, how it originates
        is this--
      

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.500

        This is the design.


00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.570

        Again, it's enlarged by squaring
        up half inch squares
      

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.570

        on the design, and then
        producing one foot squares on
      

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.890

        the actual gauze.


00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.600

        And so each square is then
        reproduced and enlarged on to
      

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.360

        the actual painting.


00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.920

        But light is going to
        shine through this.
      

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.090

        There's a set beyond this.


00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.600

        Right.


00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.140

        So we'll see this nursery
        through this gauze.
      

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.780

        Now what kind of paint
        do you use?
      

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.530

        Well, we don't use emulsion
        paint or any oil-based paint.
      

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.320

        The paints are down here.


00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.920

        They're originally pure powder
        pigment, which is a very
      

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.620

        strong medium, mixed with would
        glue watered down 50%
      

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.090

        with water, and a bit of
        methylated spirits.
      

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.570

        The methylated spirits helps
        to break down the paint.
      

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.880

        What does the glue do?


00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.450

        Well, the glue stops the powder
        paint from coming off
      

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.440

        on your hands, and from
        literally just flaking away.
      

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.350

        Well, that's handy.


00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.630

        So the glue is the binder, the
        methylated spirits is a
      

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.700

        vehicle to get everything
        going and
      

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.940

        bringing out the color.


00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.130

        And this is a bit of that I've
        mixed up, which we're going to
      

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.710

        paint a chest of drawers with.


00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.080

        Oh, right.


00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.770

        Am I going to do that?


00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.410

        Yes.


00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.240

        Oh, good.


00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.330

        Over here are the beginnings
        of the chest of drawers.
      

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.670

        So I'll just line this up
        using a straight edge.
      

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.350

        In this case, it's a piece
        of tray with a
      

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.130

        cupboard handle on it.


00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.900

        And you just run the
        brush along.
      

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.330

        Like a giant ruler.


00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.660

        That's right.


00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.790

        That's clever.


00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.980

        Like this.


00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.420

        Now if you'd like to go and a
        bit of wood graining, just
      

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.290

        brushing along.


00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.700

        Right.


00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.450

        Just one straight--


00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.830

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.080

        That's right.


00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.810



00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.090

        Is there enough paint in that?


00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.560

        Yeah.


00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.050

        Really?


00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.720

        That's good.


00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.610

        And just keep going.


00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.510

        And you're going to talk to us
        about different painting
      

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:38.720

        techniques, aren't you--


00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.060

        That's right.


00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.180

        --in programs to come?


00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.510

        But meanwhile, I've got
        a nursery to finish.
      

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.010

        Do you mind?


00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.950

        I'll have to carry on.


00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:44.440

        You're doing a fine job.


00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.690

        Thank you.


00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:56.810



00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.340

        There are all kinds of painting


00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.980

        techniques in theater design.


00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.460

        We've already looked at the
        traditional one, with paint
      

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.310

        and brush, but today Ian is
        going to show us some far more
      

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.280

        exciting ways with paint,
        aren't you?
      

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.850

        That's right.


00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.990

        What have we got here?


00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.170

        We've got a woodland gauze for
        Babes in the Wood, and I'm
      

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.820

        going to show you a quick way of
        making leaves with a spray
      

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:21.970

        gun, stencil made out of
        cardboard, and just spraying
      

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.450

        in leaf shapes.


00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.240

        Well, that's very
        straightforward.
      

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.650

        And instant, isn't it?


00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:29.130

        That's right.


00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:34.990

        If you haven't got access to
        spray equipment, then a sea
      

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.600

        sponge will do very much
        the same thing.
      

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.300

        But again, it's just pushing the
        paint through the stencil.
      

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.050

        And that's a natural
        sponge, is it?
      

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.860

        That's right.


00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.430

        Something you get from the
        chemist. You can also use this
      

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.400

        in it's own right to create
        a leaf motif or
      

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.370

        some breakup, anyway.


00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.490

        Leaf motif.


00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.410

        Great.


00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.730

        And what else?


00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.470

        What is this for?


00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.880

        Do you use that as well?


00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.750

        This is a good one.


00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.420

        Again, this is jute scrim,
        which we use
      

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.920

        to reinforce plaster.


00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.780

        Is it the same as
        a piece of sack?
      

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.490

        Very similar.


00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.770

        You can use sacking.


00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:21.010

        This is nice to just break up
        pattern of moss or anything
      

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.010

        that's going on in a woodland.


00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:23.750

        Lovely.


00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.730

        And is that the point treating
        a gauze like this, that it's
      

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.130

        building up lots of different
        shapes and
      

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.850

        textures and patterns?


00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:33.200

        That's right.


00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.890

        Not to create a specific hard
        line design, but just to give
      

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.610

        and effect?


00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.520

        Well, with this woodland scene
        we need something quite soft
      

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.340

        and ethereal.


00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.230

        And if we've got an area like
        this, that needs breaking up,
      

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.590

        a good way is splattering it.


00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:46.910

        Ah, right.


00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.640

        I'm standing back.


00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.450

        And you can just splatter by
        pushing and spraying paint on
      

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.830

        to the gauze.


00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.580

        Oh, great fun.


00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:58.830

        Like that.


00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.020



00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.090

        Can I have a go?


00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.340

        Yeah.


00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:05.160



00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.890

        There's enough paint on there.


00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.400

        And so you wouldn't--


00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.560

        sorry to be crude about it-- but
        you wouldn't actually have
      

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.660

        to be anything of an artist to
        have a go at this, would you?
      

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.120

        No, not really.


00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.280

        Not in the formal sense
        of the word.
      

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.640

        Even I can do this.


00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.580

        That's right.


00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.930

        And if you shake the brush in a
        vertical manner, like that,
      

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.190

        you can get more direction
        into it.
      

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.320

        Put some more paint on it.


00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.250

        Yeah, that's it.


00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.390

        What would that effect--


00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.820

        Well, if you do it lower down
        you can get grass effects and
      

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.250

        break ups like that.


00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.010

        Oh, I see.


00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.950

        You see.


00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:39.170

        Right.


00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.120

        That's fine.


00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.370

        Oh, brilliant.


00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:51.040



00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.180

        There's a great deal in
        a set like this, Ian.
      

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.240

        It's beautiful.


00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.560

        Thank you.


00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.310

        And a lot of detail.


00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.920

        Let's start with this wonderful
        fireplace, which
      

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.310

        looks very realistic.


00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.270

        Tiling and everything.


00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.560

        Tell us about that.


00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.570

        Well, the tiles are just painted
        hardboard, and then
      

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.380

        they're varnished over.


00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.930

        But these chaps, they're
        supposed to be wooden toy
      

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.650

        soldiers, and they were
        originated in clay, then a
      

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.640

        Plaster of Paris model taken,
        and then fiberglass and
      

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.380

        gelcoat was made into these.


00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.140

        And these--


00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:21.520

        [KNOCKING]


00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.300

        Strong, as well.


00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.550

        That's right.


00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.610

        Lovely.


00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.490

        Moving right along, fully
        practical doors, of course.
      

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:28.800

        That's right. full
        catches rather
      

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.040

        than normal door catches.


00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.150

        Right.


00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.440

        And this-- there's something
        rather unusual about this
      

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.710

        porthole window, isn't There?


00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.720

        Well this molding is actually
        made of rubber.
      

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.560

        It's an extruded rubber,
        and it's bendy.
      

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.480

        The reason we do this, is it's
        cheaper and quicker to buy
      

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.580

        this by the yard from the
        suppliers and glue this flex
      

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.850

        mold around, and wood grain it,
        than it is to build this
      

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.890

        up in wood and then put
        a router around it.
      

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.810

        It also takes a lot of knocks
        and bruises, whereas wood
      

00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:59.910

        would tend to chip.


00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.500

        Right.


00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.320

        Well, very practical.


00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.670

        Now French windows--


00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.840

        at the moment, you can go
        right through them.
      

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.040

        Is there going to be any glass
        or plastic in them?
      

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.980

        We don't use glass, but
        we use clear Perspex.
      

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.020

        And we'll get a bar of soap and
        just streak it across the
      

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.410

        front of the Perspex,
        just to cut down the
      

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.050

        flare of the lights.


00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.840

        It'll look fine on stage.


00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.590

        So it won't look streak--


00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.760

        No.


00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.730

        --or smeared?


00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.660

        It'll look like glass.


00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.320

        That's right.


00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.050

        How clever.


00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:25.940

        All right.


00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.450

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.180

        There's something rather special
        about this chest,
      

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:28.650

        isn't there?


00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.650

        Well, Tinkerbell flies into the
        nursery and she's hunting
      

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.300

        for Peter's shadow, and
        the chest of drawers
      

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.030

        has to open by itself.


00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.130

        And what we've got is a little
        stop so this drawer doesn't
      

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.350

        push out, bit behind it, we have
        a hole where the stage
      

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.080

        crew will put their hand and a
        handle, which they'll operate.
      

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.680

        And it's bolted onto the set.


00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.690

        So it will all appear
        as if by magic.
      

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.400

        That's right.


00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.040

        Brilliant.


00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.600

        These look like ordinary
        paintings, at first glance,
      

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.110

        but actually they're
        gauze aren't they?
      

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.020

        That's right, it's the same
        technique we used for the
      

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.030

        front cloth, but here--


00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:09.780

        because the people controlling
        Peter Pan's flying wires--
      

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.590

        they need to have a look on
        set, and since this is a
      

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.250

        completely enclosed set, we've
        got these vision holes.
      

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.050

        And we'll show you
        around the back.
      

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:16.410

        All right.


00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.980

        Let's have a look round here.


00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.670



00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.920

        These are them?


00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.700

        This is the back of the set.


00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:28.980

        And what we've got is a bit of
        a black tat covering this
      

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.720

        gauze panel.


00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.260

        And we can see on to the set.


00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.490

        And bear in mind the back
        stage is going to be
      

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.410

        completely pitch black, so the
        audience won't see the
      

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.950

        technicians working the flying
        lines, but the technicians can
      

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.720

        see Peter Pan and the cast
        working the stage.
      

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.830

        And it's a safe way of working,
        and we can control
      

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.060

        the up and down movements.


00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.520

        And they won't be seen buy
        the audience at all?
      

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.170

        No, that's right.


00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:52.720

        And there's another one here,
        because we'll need a bit of
      

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.960

        vision down stage.


00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.980

        And when they're not in use, we
        just cover them up with a
      

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.460

        bit of black.


00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.110

        Excellent.


00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.200

        And why is it all black?


00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.390

        Well in this scene--


00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.790

        this on trucks, which are
        plywood bases on casters, and
      

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.990

        these trucks are spun round
        during the scene change.
      

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.980

        And the audience will actually
        see this scene
      

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.650

        change, and it splits.


00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.350

        Going back to the plan we had
        earlier, the white card model
      

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.150

        I showed you how the
        set change was
      

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.570

        actually going to operate--


00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.940

        and because it's going to be
        seen, wwe've painted the
      

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.790

        reverse of the set all black
        just to hide it.
      

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.150

        Yes, I see.


00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.550

        Right.


00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.780

        Now, this is pretty
        solid stuff.
      

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.370

        It's not like our flats.


00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.290

        Now how is this constructed?


00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.050

        It's good, solid, joinery
        quality timber, mortise and
      

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.620

        tenon joints, with-- this is
        what we call a shoe and a
      

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.480

        toggle rail.


00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.700

        And it's plywood covered
        in canvas.
      

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.100

        Right.


00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.160

        And you've got a lot
        of hinges, I see.
      

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.500

        It's all jointed.


00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.120

        It's all put together with spit
        pin hinges here and here.
      

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.020

        And these pins--


00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.990

        which are strong wire
        which come out--
      

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.370

        which means that the two pieces
        of scenery can split.
      

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:00.480

        Right.


00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.470

        So a very solid, practical
        piece of building.
      

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.190

        Very creative, too.


00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:07.440

        Thank you.


00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:17.630



00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.490

        Ian, when I go to the theater,
        I expect to see a great deal
      

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.320

        of movement, of flexibility,
        of scene changes.
      

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.650

        That's all very stimulating.


00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.930

        And although you showed us on
        the white card model how easy
      

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:34.690

        it was to move large pieces of
        furniture on a piece of paper,
      

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.680

        how do you actually transfer
        that kind of technology to a
      

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.510

        large pieces of set like this?


00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.490

        Well, we choreograph the set
        change using the white card
      

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.320

        model and ground plan.


00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.330

        And every piece of scenery has
        its own truck, which has
      

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.180

        caster underneath.


00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.130

        And we can actually decide on
        how to get rid of the nursery
      

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.240

        set into the wings by actually
        moving the model and
      

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.340

        playing with it.


00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.600

        So it's a piece of choreography,
        really.
      

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.840

        So this piece-- this kennel--


00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.280

        will split from the fireplace,
        and it will do something like
      

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.040

        this-- very easily, because
        it is on wheels--
      

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.570

        and will rotate.


00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.330

        And if you get over on
        the other end, we'll
      

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.250

        do exactly the same.


00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.430

        And this will be done in
        view of the audience.
      

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.250

        And this will--


00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.610

        It's amazingly easy to
        move, actually, isn't
      

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.850

        it, with two people?


00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:29.350

        That's right.


00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.640

        And this kennel then--


00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.520

        So I'll put it round
        the other end.
      

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.770

        --will go behind.


00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.680



00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.680

        That's good.


00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:44.630

        The reason why we're doing this
        is because we want the
      

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:49.500

        audience to see the nursery
        split up stage.
      

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.030

        Now, we've painted this black
        just in case parts of the set
      

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.990

        behind will be seen
        by the audience.
      

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.010

        It's just clipped.


00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.250

        Each piece is clipped with
        a simple cabin hook--
      

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.820

        gate hook--


00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.580

        like that.


00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.880

        And it will hold it tight?


00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.130

        That's it.


00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.460

        That's all we need.


00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.010

        Hold it still for
        the duration.
      

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.900

        And this is just hardwood?


00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.120

        Plywood?


00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.980

        It's timber frame and plywood,
        and then on the front it's
      

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.110

        covered with canvas.


00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.830

        And the reason we cover the
        flats with canvas is it's
      

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.450

        better to paint with.


00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.550

        When you paint raw plywood, you
        always get the grain, as
      

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:24.960

        you can see here.


00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.450

        Right.


00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.950

        And explain about the
        trucks again?
      

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.240

        These are the casters, but
        how is the frame made?
      

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.030

        Well, it's a timber frame with
        a plywood base, and the
      

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.150

        casters are bolted to
        the underneath.
      

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.290

        Just ordinary furniture
        casters?
      

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.970

        No, we don't use ball casters
        in sofas and armchairs,
      

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.200

        they're heavy duty industrial
        casters which have a rubber
      

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.800

        tire, and it stops the noise.


00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.630

        Oh, yes.


00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.710

        Good point.


00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.090

        And presumably, you have to
        keep them well oiled.
      

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:54.670

        Oh, yes.


00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:55.910

        Well greased and oiled.


00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.400

        Because actually this--


00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.340

        I mean, it's very sturdy, it's
        large, and it's probably quite
      

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.770

        heavy, isn't it?


00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.610

        It is quite heavy but, the
        reason we put everything on
      

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.630

        casters, it will move quite
        silently into the wings.
      

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.880

        Yes.


00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.900

        It's actually quite mobile.


00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.200

        And this is Nana's kennel.


00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.640

        Can we turn that around,
        actually?
      

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.500



00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.880

        Now, would you have a
        real dog for this?
      

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.130

        No, we'll have an actor in a
        dog costume, and we'll just
      

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.420

        put a piece of carpet
        underneath.
      

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.280

        It saves the costume being torn
        by the timber, and makes
      

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.960

        the actor's knees wear
        a little better.
      

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.990

        Very comfortable.


00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.370

        I think I could get
        used to this.
      

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:37.230

        I'd be all right.


00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:42.030

        So, creative, practical,
        anyone could do it.
      

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.280

        And we can move you.


00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:57.310



00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.750

        Yes.


00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.110

        Allison are we there yet?


00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:02.400

        Not yet, Christina.


00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.900

        Pieces of scenery can be a great
        deal of fun, but they
      

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.640

        can also be hazardous.


00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.560

        As you can see if you come
        around the side of this little
      

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.070

        wonder, what looks so
        3-dimensional from the front
      

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:17.390

        is actually very thin and can
        be quite wobbly as well.
      

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.410

        It's held up at the back just
        with two French braces and a
      

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:23.130

        couple of stage weights.


00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.400

        And how heavy would
        these weights be?
      

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.650

        Very heavy.


00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.000



00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.190

        Perhaps one person would
        only want to carry one.
      

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.880

        Around the back of these, for
        safety's sake you tend to put
      

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.350

        this-- which is hazard tape.


00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:40.490

        Obviously, when the show's
        on, back here is
      

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:41.130

        going to be very dark.


00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.770

        Right.


00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.450

        Stop people stubbing
        their toes?
      

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.920

        Yes, and from knocking
        it overs.
      

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.770

        If you knock one of these French
        braces out of the way,
      

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.860

        it's possible that the
        whole piece of
      

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.390

        scenery will fall over.


00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.250

        So you want to be very
        careful of that.
      

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.870

        Hazard tape is quite expensive,
        but really, it's a
      

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.100

        false economy not to buy it.


00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:56.740

        OK?


00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.450

        Right.


00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:57.660

        Good.


00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.930

        Now come over here.


00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.320

        We've got the larger
        flats here.
      

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.650

        I'll show you how this
        French brace works.
      

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.260

        There's a very particular
        way of putting it on.
      

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:11.580

        If you see it on the eye, up
        here, this prong, which looks
      

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.780

        like a bull's horn, needs to
        be pulled right around.
      

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.590

        It's not done quite
        right on this one.
      

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.370

        So if you just hold this piece
        of scenery just here, I'll
      

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:23.330

        take the weight off.


00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.570

        Let's have a look.


00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.650

        Now, don't let go, will you?


00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.960

        All right, you want to put the
        bull's horn through there, and
      

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.080

        then twist it.


00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.770

        And you see, when it's twisted
        to it's full extent, the wood
      

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.090

        is nearly up against this.


00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.330

        And that's the safest
        point to hold that.
      

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.050

        Now, don't let go yet.


00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.350

        And then you put the
        weight back on the
      

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.640

        bottom, there you are.


00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.560

        And that secure again.


00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:52.690

        Right.


00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:53.070

        OK?


00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.010

        So you can let go now.


00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.700

        And if this flat had a door in
        it, that would be quite secure
      

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.860

        for shutting up against
        it and slamming it?
      

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.400

        Oh, it's quite solid,
        isn't it?
      

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.430

        It is quite solid.


00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.290

        One of the ways to tell if
        you've braced something
      

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.040

        sufficiently, if you kick
        the bottom of it--
      

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.370

        if the whole flat wobbles you
        need some more weight on the
      

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.800

        back or it's going
        to fall over.
      

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.280

        And if it's fairly sturdy
        like that, then
      

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.760

        you've done a good job.


00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.140

        Obviously, when you're using
        French brace like this with a
      

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.730

        doorway, you don't want to
        brace across the doorway,
      

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.220

        because the person that's coming
        out is going to fall
      

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.650

        straight over it.


00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.550

        And everyone in the audience
        is going to see it as well.
      

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:27.810

        Right.


00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.370

        Let's come to this
        side of the set.
      

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:34.880

        And when it comes to things
        like pictures--
      

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.120

        you need to be quite careful
        fixing pictures to the wall.
      

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.510

        Obviously, you don't want
        things to fall off.
      

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.000

        So if you were to fix something
        like you would
      

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.880

        normally, say , and put
        a hook into a wall and
      

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.920

        fasten it like that.


00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.190

        That is not ideal for the
        theater, because if anybody
      

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.010

        did kick the back it's possible
        the whole thing could
      

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:54.240

        wobble off.


00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.610

        So ideally, what you do is
        drill a couple of holes
      

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.610

        through where you wanted it,
        and put some wire through
      

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.590

        that, and wire it to the
        back of the picture.
      

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.400

        Perhaps, here and here.


00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.610

        So that the picture was held
        securely with the wire.
      

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.980

        And the wire went
        right through to
      

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.990

        the back of the flat?


00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.570

        Right through to the
        back of flat.
      

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.940

        And you twist it up
        around the back.
      

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.370

        So if somebody kicked it, then
        you wouldn't have the ultimate
      

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:18.440

        disaster of the picture
        falling off the wall.
      

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.800

        Unless you wanted it to.


00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.860

        Rugs.


00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.880

        Obviously, at home when you
        have a rug on a polished
      

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:26.180

        floor, you to find some way of
        securing it, otherwise you'll
      

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:26.610

        break your neck.


00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:27.710

        It can be quite a problem.


00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.040

        On stage it's just the same.


00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.850

        How would you go about
        securing this?
      

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.020

        Well, the easiest way, really,
        is to use our old friend,
      

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.020

        gaffer tape.


00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.200

        And any type of tape that's
        particularly strong you can
      

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.080

        use like this.


00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.140

        If you turn it into--


00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.960

        so it's like double-sided
        tape, like this.
      

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.380

        Pop it under a corner.


00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.090

        You'd want to do all
        four corners.
      

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:47.310

        And that's all?


00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.050

        Just the four corners?


00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:48.830

        It will be quite secure.


00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:49.140

        Yes.


00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.670

        Quite secure.


00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:51.840

        Go on then, have a go.


00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.750

        How about, then?


00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.590

        You're a mine of information,
        aren't you?
      

00:22:54.590 --> 00:23:05.390



00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.880

        Many professional actors who
        work with touring companies--
      

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.930

        they feel that life on the road
        can be very demanding.
      

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.860

        But there are a number of
        amateur companies who not only
      

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.470

        have to transport themselves all
        over the region to put on
      

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.670

        a show, but their lights,
        sound equipment,
      

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.450

        and scenery as well.


00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.450

        Paul and Graham, you've been
        with the Hamlet Players for
      

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.180

        five years now, haven't you?


00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.580

        How did it all begin?


00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.150

        Well, it started off with the
        fact that it's very difficult
      

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.450

        to get an audience in one
        particular village.
      

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.210

        So we thought, well, if
        they don't come to
      

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.780

        us, we'll go to them.


00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:42.540

        So we erected this scenery here,
        which is quite adaptable
      

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.930

        and it can be put
        up very quickly.
      

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.840

        So we have to get everything
        that will fit on the small
      

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.730

        trailer behind Paul's car.


00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:51.310

        Amazing.


00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.850

        Now, I'm concerned that you
        didn't find enough people in
      

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.410

        one village.


00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.680

        Do you actually have a home
        in that village, and--
      

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.140

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.990

        We've got a little village hall
        where we do some of our
      

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.750

        rehearsing.


00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.650

        But, it's very difficult
        to get an audience.
      

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.860

        We can get perhaps 20, and
        by moving around as
      

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:06.890

        we do with a play--


00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.930

        three nights, three separate
        audiences.
      

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.100

        It's great.


00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.190

        And you're known primarily
        to be a touring company?
      

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.830

        Yes, it's taken quite a bit of
        time, but we're now actually
      

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.130

        getting to be known, and people
        actually will come.
      

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:20.500

        We'll get quite a
        good audience,
      

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.060

        probably 60, 70, or so.


00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.620

        Yeah, great.


00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:26.890

        Well, this is all very neatly
        packed now, but I would like
      

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.550

        to unwrap it and see
        you put it up.
      

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.440

        See how it all goes together.


00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.690

        OK, will do.


00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:36.350



00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.830

        Well, Paul, this is amazing.


00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.670

        How long does it actually
        taken you to erect?
      

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:42.750

        Well, it took about 3/4 of an
        hour, and it doesn't take very
      

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.670

        long because we use these
        wing nuts and bolts.
      

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:48.710

        And it's quickly bolted
        together, and then supported
      

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.760

        all the way around.


00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.930

        So it doesn't take
        that long at all.
      

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:51.670

        That's amazing.


00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.380

        There's still a bit of
        touching up going on.
      

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:53.940

        Yeah.


00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.870

        what we do-- because it's bolted
        together you get a gap,
      

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.890

        so what we do, we run some
        masking tape down there, and
      

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.870

        then we paint that in, and
        then it dries up once the
      

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.250

        lights have been on.


00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.820

        And that works quite well.


00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:07.910

        And pictures and things--


00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:08.580

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.510

        --we're only half way
        at the moment.
      

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:15.490

        Obviously pictures, switches,
        carpet, obviously all the
      

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:17.140

        furniture and things.


00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.110

        And these flats are actually
        made of hardboard.
      

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.970

        Yes, hardboard.


00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.670

        So it works because it's
        cheap, basically.
      

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:29.370

        Cheap, durable, it's
        quite hard.
      

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.880

        I mean, we can actually
        get pictures on.
      

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.120

        We can use screws and nails to
        hold the pictures on, and it
      

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.130

        works quite well.


00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:39.570

        And because that panel--


00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:40.690

        obviously, that's a door.


00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.200

        That can be moved around
        into whatever
      

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.040

        position we want it in.


00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.270

        Right.


00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.740

        This makes them quite
        light, as well.
      

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.310

        That's right, it makes
        it light, yeah.
      

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.520

        Now, they're only
        eight foot high,
      

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.010

        aren't they, these flats?


00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:49.270

        Yes.


00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:49.750

        That's right.


00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:50.830

        The reason for that being?


00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.670

        Well, because most village halls
        and things we go to, the
      

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.320

        actual ceiling height is quite
        low, so to get an average--
      

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.770

        we normally make them eight by
        four, and that seems to work
      

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.230

        quite well.


00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.100

        And also, it fits onto the
        trailer quite well, and it's
      

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.920

        easy to handle.


00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.850

        And what about width?


00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.930

        I mean, you must go to some
        place, halls, that are quite
      

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.050

        different in shape?


00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.120

        That's right.


00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.290

        If we get to a smaller stage,
        we just remove a panel, and
      

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.000

        then bolt it all together, and
        just make it to any size we
      

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.960

        want, basically.


00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.260

        Amazing.


00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:19.990

        It's not a problem.


00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.220

        So it's portability,
        and adaptability?
      

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.470

        Yes, that's it.


00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:36.890



00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.120

        Ian, you've got a veritable
        Santa's workshop here.
      

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.570

        This is where you make
        your small props.
      

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.080

        That's right.


00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:42.490

        Right.


00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.400

        Now, obviously, this
        as a candle.
      

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.050

        Why are you making it?


00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.680

        Well, I get asked an awful lot
        for candles, and we can't use
      

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.380

        real flame on stage because of
        the fire regulations, we we
      

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.670

        have to make them.


00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:58.440

        Now, this little thing is run
        off a 9-volt battery, and its
      

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.130

        hidden inside this matchbox.


00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.580

        Now it's made--


00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.130

        this is the actual flame.


00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.700

        It's a printed circuit, which
        you can you get from the
      

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.230

        electrical wholesaler's.


00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.480

        And a piece of plastic tubing
        with hot glue poured over
      

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.360

        this, and that's inserted
        inside.
      

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.070

        And then to make the flame, it's
        plumber's clear silicon,
      

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.720

        dotted on there and pulled
        out to the flame shape.
      

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.950

        And then we paint it up,
        put inside of the tray.
      

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:27.560

        Right.


00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.160

        Wonderful.


00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.140

        That's great.


00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.740

        What else can you show us?


00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:31.820

        These books.


00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.550

        Now, these are wonderful.


00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:34.240

        Very light.


00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.440

        Why not use real ones?


00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.220

        Is that the reason?


00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.450

        Well because if we have a whole
        shelf of books, it's
      

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.500

        going to be very heavy.


00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.170

        So we make these out of
        polystyrene, cardboard, and
      

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.400

        then muslin and PVA scrimmed
        over the top and painted.
      

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.340

        We can do a whole library
        of books like this.
      

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.880

        Now these.


00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.690

        These are real, obviously.


00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.150

        And now why would something like
        this be used, as opposed
      

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:56.650

        to something--


00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:56.750

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.040

        Well, if we've got a fight
        scene, we need
      

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.890

        proper fight swords.


00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.350

        This gives a very good sound.


00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.290

        Now these will be choreographed
        as a fight
      

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.060

        scene, so we use real swords.


00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:06.510

        Right.


00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.150

        And you're very careful
        with those.
      

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:10.220

        Now this bomb--


00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.250

        Lovely.


00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:11.830

        Boom.


00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.680

        This is made out of a toilet
        ball cock and a piece of
      

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.050

        doweling inside.


00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.320

        What is this, then?


00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.120

        That's right.


00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.830

        And then we'd have
        a firework--
      

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.750

        a little sparkler--


00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:20.770

        coming in.


00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:21.870

        It works a treat.


00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:22.450

        Oh, excellent.


00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.230

        So you'd throw about
        between you.
      

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:26.590

        And this--


00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:27.250

        this is wonderful.


00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.250

        How long did this
        take to make?
      

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.520

        Well, it's about a
        morning's work.
      

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.770

        It's a pantomime cake, and it's
        made out of polystyrene
      

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.780

        and, again, muslin with PVA
        scrimmed over the top, and
      

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.070

        lots of glitter, and we use
        ready-made Christmas
      

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.140

        decorations for the candles.


00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.840

        And the same flicker effect?


00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.850

        Well, that's right.


00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:44.050

        The same thins as that.


00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:44.550

        So it can light up.


00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.740

        That's marvelous.


00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.970

        Now, it was this.


00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.640

        Yes, a mallet.


00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.270

        It is presumably a pantomime
        mallet, is it?
      

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:51.550

        It's soft.


00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.560

        Yes, that' right.


00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.620

        Well, what it is made out
        of is a wooden dowel--
      

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.740

        a wooden stem--


00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.520

        foam, and latex, with
        muslin over it.
      

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.950

        And that gives us a nice
        soft [INAUDIBLE] to it.
      

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.500

        I'd better check it
        out, actually.
      

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.750

        Oh, well that worked.


00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:21.430



00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.310

        Hello.


00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.560

        Oh, have we arrived?


00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.230



00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.060

        My goodness, it's
        a bit difficult
      

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:30.990

        crawling out of there.


00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.110

        How would Cinderella manage
        that in a crinoline and a
      

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.850

        powdered wig?


00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:35.490

        She'd actually use the door,
        which is on the other side.
      

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.030



00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.650

        Ian, this is a fantastic
        construction.
      

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:43.230

        How would you begin making
        a Cinderella coach?
      

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.820

        Well this is made of steel,
        predominately.
      

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.600

        And there's a steel base
        and a steel frame.
      

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.740

        This is plywood profiling,
        and then it's covered
      

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.620

        in Artex and glitter.


00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.310

        And then we have
        fairy lights--
      

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.070

        put power from a 12-volt
        batter from the back.
      

00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.500

        Brilliant.


00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.560

        And it's fully practical,
        isn't it?
      

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.070

        That's right.


00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.250

        It is quite heavy, and it will
        be pulled by three actual
      

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.440

        horses-- white ponies.


00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:06.590

        Oh, sweet.


00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:07.950

        Lovely.


00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.460

        The interesting thing here is,
        because we wanted the wheels
      

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.470

        to light up, we've got a little
        mechanical gizmo there.
      

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:16.190

        It's a series of electrical
        brushes with contacts, which
      

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.350

        make the lights light up.


00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.630

        Right.


00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.970

        Is this a rubber trim?


00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:20.550

        That's right.


00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.000

        They're actually real steel
        tires and rubber tires.
      

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.340

        You've got to look after your
        stage, as well, haven't you?
      

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:26.590

        That's right.


00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.820

        Now going on to something that
        looks equally heavy, this
      

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.950

        cannon is actually very light
        and maneuverable.
      

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:32.430

        That's right.


00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:37.250

        It's very lightweight, and it's
        on casters, which makes
      

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.810

        it easier to move off stage.


00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.550

        This is made of polystyrene--


00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.130

        Polystyrene?


00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.820

        Polystyrene base, and then


00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.360

        fiberglass inside, for strength.


00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.780

        There's a practical
        pyrotechnic we
      

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.110

        use to make the explosion.


00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:52.810

        Oh, lovely.


00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.650

        It's a real canon.


00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.300

        That's right.


00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:55.960

        Right.


00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.420

        Moving on to this, now.


00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.650

        This is from Peter
        Pan, isn't it?
      

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.160

        Yes, this is going to
        be in Peter Pan.
      

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.080

        This is Tinkerbell's castle,
        or little house.
      

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.870

        Now, this is made out of
        plastic tubing, this is
      

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.060

        Styrofoam--


00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.360

        which is a little bit
        like polystyrene--
      

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.880

        but the magic is these all light
        up, and how we do that
      

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.520

        is-- if you lift the lid--


00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.380

        Oh, my word.


00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.750

        --we see fiber optics.


00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.240

        These black spaghetti-like
        things are fiber optics.
      

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.910

        And in here is the projector,
        which is the light source.
      

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:27.470

        So it all flashes
        and twinkles.
      

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.270

        That's right.


00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.060

        That's amazing.


00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:31.250

        And again, it's got
        a fiberglass rock,
      

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:32.370

        and its all on wheels.


00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.540

        So on casters again?


00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.010

        That's right.


00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.520

        So it's all very maneuverable?


00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:35.970

        Yes.


00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.630

        And what is this crispy stuff?


00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.460

        Well, this is a bit of plumber's
        jute scrim, which is
      

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.900

        covered in PVA and in glitter.


00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:45.800

        Right, because it's
        quite stiff, that?
      

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.280

        That's right.


00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.120

        Lovely.


00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.910

        Now this has to be one
        of my favorites.
      

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.890

        This is a sedan chair,
        isn't it?
      

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:52.950

        No, it's a palanquin.


00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:53.800

        A palanquin?


00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.610

        All right, what's
        the difference?
      

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.700

        Well, the palanquin has wheels
        at the back and pulled by one
      

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:02.560

        person, the sedan chair has four
        people on each corner,
      

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.720

        and it's lifted up.


00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.730

        Timber structure, and then the
        top of the roof is made of
      

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.470

        hardboard, and just trimmed
        and painted up.
      

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.000

        And it's for Aladdin,
        isn't it?
      

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.490

        That's right.


00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:15.200

        And works like a rickshaw,
        I think.
      

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.830

        That's it.


00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:17.680

        And one person will
        pick it up.
      

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.690

        That's marvelous.


00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:19.730

        Shall we go to the park?


00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.020

        Chop, chop to to the pop shop!


00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:31.060



00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.760

        Theater is the world of make
        believe, and it's important
      

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.690

        that extends to practicalities
        on stage.
      

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.310

        And starting with a subject
        close to my heart, can we
      

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.240

        begin with food?


00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.840

        We can, yes.


00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.610

        I want to make some ice cream.


00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.270

        Now, this is dried
        mashed potatoes.
      

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.240

        Comes in a form like that.


00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.650

        OK?


00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:49.840

        So--


00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.030

        What, for ice cream?


00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.810

        For ice cream, that's right.


00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:54.130

        And because the main problem
        using ice cream under stage
      

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:58.720

        lights is that, of course, it
        melts very quickly, even more
      

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.930

        quickly than normal.


00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.040

        And of course, mashed potato
        isn't going to do that.
      

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:08.410

        So we'll mix this up to get a
        consistency fairly creamy, so
      

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.270

        it mimics ice cream, because
        when it's finished, it looks
      

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.770

        exactly like ice cream.


00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.990

        I would never have guessed
        of using something
      

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.800

        savory for ice cream.


00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.370

        Well, that's right.


00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.420

        I mean, I've often seen mashed
        potato being used for all
      

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.750

        manner of meals on the stage.


00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.680

        That's right.


00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.850

        Not ice cream.


00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:28.490

        And we'll leave that to cool
        down now, and we'll go on to
      

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.200

        some bread, here.


00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.030

        OK.


00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.730

        That looks like a fairly
        ordinary loaf.
      

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.270

        It is, but it's been
        dried out.
      

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:33.880

        It's heavy.


00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.150

        It is, it's very solid.


00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.150

        You can do it with any loaf.


00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.660

        I happened to make this one
        first. You put it in the oven,
      

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:45.810

        very low temperature, and just
        heat it for hours and hours
      

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.830

        and hours on end, obviously
        making sure it's not going to
      

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.160

        burn, until it dries
        out the inside.
      

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.220

        And this will last for about six
        weeks without going moldy.
      

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.210

        Really?


00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:53.550

        But you couldn't eat it.


00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:53.800

        No.


00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800

        I wouldn't suggest you eat it.


00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.260

        It probably tastes revolting.


00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:00.490

        This is some spider's web.


00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.300

        Now if you take the other side
        of this and stretch it--
      

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.850

        you buy this in joke shops.


00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.030

        Children like using it.


00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.080

        Here we are.


00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.700

        This stretches out--


00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:10.110

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.820

        And how would you use
        this on stage?
      

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.600

        If you want to make something
        look old, or particularly
      

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.950

        authentic-- there we
        are, we'll put our
      

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:18.650

        Mr. Spider in there.


00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:19.690

        So for cobwebs?


00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.910

        For cobwebs, that's right, you'd
        put it perhaps on the
      

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:24.800

        corner of a window or
        something like that.
      

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.470

        Amazing.


00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:28.820

        You can nail that in or stick
        it to at the edges.
      

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.070

        Stick it with some glue.


00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.380

        Now some drinks.


00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.740

        Now this here is
        called caramel.
      

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:41.620

        It's basically just burnt sugar,
        but this has actually
      

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.320

        been chemically made .


00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.060

        You need to buy it from a
        chemist, and it's sterile.
      

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.700

        I use a tiny, tiny
        little bit of it.
      

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.940

        And what are you making first?


00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:53.490

        I want to make some whiskey
        in this glass, here.
      

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.470

        And that's just ordinary
        water?
      

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:55.720

        It's ordinary water.


00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.790

        Of course, you wouldn't want
        to real whiskey on stage.
      

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.230

        Well, I don't know.


00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.490

        You only really need a tiny,
        tiny little bit of it, and
      

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.760

        then just mix it
        in very slowly.
      

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.340

        So, you shouldn't
        use up cold tea?
      

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.480

        I thought people use cold
        tea for whiskey?
      

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.380

        Some people do use cold tea, and
        also flat Coca-Cola, but
      

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.610

        those tend to go off under the
        stage lights very quickly,
      

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.710

        especially Coca-Cola, because
        it's so sugary.
      

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.760

        What does this taste like?


00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.260

        Can I?


00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.600

        Yes, please taste it.


00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.180

        Tell me what it tastes of.


00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.830

        Water.


00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:24.960

        Exactly.


00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.610

        It tastes of nothing at
        all, whereas cold
      

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:27.640

        tea is quite revolting.


00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.000

        Yes.


00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.750

        Now this is some tea
        we'll make here.
      

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:32.130

        That's for hot tea?


00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.800

        Well, you can make
        it hot or cold.
      

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.260

        This is cold, because people who
        are in the audience won't
      

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:37.550

        have any idea whether it's
        hot or cold, anyway.
      

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.680

        If they think it's a
        cup of tea, then--
      

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.330

        Why couldn't you use
        proper hot tea?
      

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.140

        Well, you could, but it might be
        that you don't want to have
      

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.930

        something hot on stage, or that
        the person who's drinking
      

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.170

        it doesn't like tea.


00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:50.970

        Right.


00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.680

        Well, that's thoughtful.


00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.090

        That's right.


00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:53.430

        Here we are.


00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.670

        I've got quite a milky
        tea there.
      

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.810

        Right.


00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:56.920

        Good.


00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.940

        All right, another thing
        we can make is
      

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.160

        some parchment paper.


00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.590

        That's very easy to make.


00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:05.150

        Here's one that's finished.


00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.570

        Now how did you do that?


00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.560

        Well, this really
        is very simple.
      

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.810

        Take a tea bag that's just been
        nicely dampened, and just
      

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:17.290

        wipe it across the
        page, like this.
      

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:18.540

        Here we are.


00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.560



00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.900

        Wipe this across.


00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.180

        Do all of this side, then turn
        it over and do the other side.
      

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.320

        And then as it dries, it goes
        crinkly and gets quite a nice
      

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.250

        parchment effect.


00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.500

        Oh, that's brilliant.


00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.620



00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.240

        Now I'll let that one
        dry on that side.
      

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.850

        And that's a dry one?


00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.210

        And that's a dry one.


00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:39.930

        And that really feels crispy
        and crinkly and old.
      

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:40.440

        That's right.


00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:43.490

        The only thing you have to be
        careful about is that you
      

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:46.170

        don't use water-based
        inks on there.
      

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.600

        Because if you do, of course,
        the the ink will spill.
      

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.710

        Won't be able to read your
        script or your lines.
      

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.040

        Let's go back to our ice
        cream, over here.
      

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.130

        Should be just about ready.


00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.720

        Now let's take a nice
        scoop of that.
      

00:36:58.720 --> 00:36:59.970

        And our ice cream cornet.


00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:02.920



00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.220

        There you are, Christina.


00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.350

        An ice cream just for you.


00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.100

        Must I?


00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:07.350

        Just steaming away.


00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.850



00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.580

        Mmm-mmm.


00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.920

        Ham and pea, next.


00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.170

        That's right.


00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:23.200



00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.770

        We're clearly on to the
        advanced stages
      

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:26.950

        of prop making here.


00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.420

        This is where you make statues
        and masks, isn't it?
      

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.300

        That's right.


00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.400

        Please explain how
        you do that.
      

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.840

        Well, this is a full head latex
        mask, and this is used
      

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.860

        for a dancer who is going
        to be a Greek statue.
      

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.140

        Now this made from clay.


00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.850

        Carved in clay and then a
        plaster mold similar to this
      

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.220

        was made over the whole thing.


00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.650

        And then it was turned upside
        down like that, with the
      

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:53.870

        plaster mold around it.


00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:58.070

        And then liquid latex, which we
        have here, it's literally
      

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:00.360

        just poured in.


00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.690

        Nice and thick.


00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.350

        You can see how that
        works like that.
      

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:09.190

        Now the trick with latex in a
        plaster mold- and it's got to
      

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:12.720

        be a plaster of Paris mold--


00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.380

        is that you just
        gently pat it.
      

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.710

        It gets all the air
        bubbles out.
      

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.630

        And plaster of Paris has
        a marvelous property.
      

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.480

        It sucks liquids into itself,
        so the longer you leave it,
      

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.850

        the thicker the mold is.


00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.070

        It looks like yogurt.


00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:27.520

        That's right.


00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.390

        Now this was left overnight--


00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:30.390

        24 hours--


00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.880

        and it's quite a thick latex.


00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.000

        So that was just in 24 hours?


00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.070

        Well, you leave this overnight,
        for 24 hours, and
      

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:38.930

        then you pour out the residue.


00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.040

        And you leave it to set.


00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.210

        And the skin is what's left.


00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:42.290

        That's right.


00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:43.080

        It smells horrible.


00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:43.520

        That's right.


00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.070

        It's the ammonia.


00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.530

        Now the longer you leave it, the
        thicker the latex will be.
      

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.790

        So that's one process.


00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.640

        Now this is made out of
        fiberglass metal.
      

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.530

        Now this is a set dressing
        for the pirate
      

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.480

        ship in Captain Hook.


00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.620

        Now this is a very
        special mold--
      

00:38:57.620 --> 00:38:59.650

        that's the finished product,
        and this is the
      

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.450

        mold it came from.


00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:02.890

        Now this is silicon--


00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.240

        hot melt silicon called
        Gelflex--
      

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.530

        and it comes in little blocks
        like this, and you can carve
      

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.110

        it up like jelly.


00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:14.610

        Put in this big melting pot, and
        three or four hours later
      

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:18.480

        it'll liquefy and you can pour
        it onto your original.
      

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.250

        Now this was carved in clay,
        and a wooden box was formed
      

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:25.000

        and this liquid silicone--


00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.460

        which goes up to 150 Celsius--


00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.840

        was poured over the thing.


00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.390

        And four hours later it sets,
        you take your clay out and you
      

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:36.950

        are then left with
        a mold like this.
      

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:43.030

        Which we can make fiberglass,
        resin, or even pour lead into
      

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.460

        if you like.


00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.960

        So that's a silicone mold.


00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.090

        This is made in fiberglass.


00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.280

        And this is a mask to go on
        a cornice of a castle.
      

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.020

        A little bit of coat hanger
        wire was just used to clip
      

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.140

        over the back of the scenery.


00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.210

        It's actually quite light.


00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.070

        I expected it to--


00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.310

        I mean, it sounds metallic,
        so I expected it
      

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.080

        to feel that way.


00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.120

        Again this was made in
        a very similar way.
      

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:12.340

        Again, clay original, and this
        is a latex mask-- the same
      

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.240

        latex we've used here.


00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.240

        Now this is mask of
        sad and happy.
      

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.720

        Now we can make two mother
        molds to support this.
      

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.030

        The clay original is then
        covered with latex, and when
      

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.680

        that latex is set--


00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.850

        because it's very floppy, we
        then cover it we plaster of
      

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.920

        Paris, like that.


00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.840

        Scoop it around, and when that
        sets, we turn the whole thing
      

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.920

        upside down, scoop out the clay,
        wash this out, and then
      

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:47.070

        we are ready to then make
        fiberglass impression.
      

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.430

        And then we have an original.


00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.980

        If you're doing anything really
        large and the plaster
      

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:55.350

        of Paris is too heavy,
        we can --
      

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:57.140

        again, say latex--


00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:03.390

        but instead of a plaster of
        Paris mother mold, we use a
      

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.290

        fiberglass mother mold,
        which is much lighter.
      

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:08.200



00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.200

        And this is made in exactly the
        same way, except this is
      

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.470

        papier mache.


00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.040

        Now this was made in clay--


00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.950

        again, a clay original--


00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:20.220

        and then plaster of Paris was
        then carved and poured onto
      

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.050

        this clay original.


00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.940

        Then the clay was scooped out
        and we papier mached inside.
      

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:29.360

        Now this goes over
        an actor's head.
      

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:30.900

        and it's Velcroed.


00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.450

        Right.


00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.610

        That's cool.


00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.620

        So one half goes like
        that, the other half
      

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.890

        slots in like this.


00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:44.110

        And we tuck in the Velcro
        tabs like so.
      

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.960

        Dark in here.


00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.810

        How do I do then?


00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:49.060

        Wonderful.


00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:59.390



00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:03.710

        Props are an integral part of
        any play for a performer, and
      

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.840

        you usually notice them when
        they're not there.
      

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.410

        That's what I have discovered.


00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.170

        Tell us about where you keep
        props all together?
      

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:11.370

        Right.


00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.320

        Well the best place, obviously,
        to keep props is on
      

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.130

        a props table.


00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.850

        And you tend to have one either
        side of the stage
      

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:17.510

        behind the set.


00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.010

        This is because if you don't
        have a specific place to put
      

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.540

        something, you'll tend to find
        that the actor involved will
      

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:25.810

        just leave something where
        they last finished.
      

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:28.060

        So you might find that a glass
        is left in the middle of the
      

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.330

        floor, or something goes back
        to the dressing room.
      

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.620

        Which obviously isn't ideal,
        because the stage manager then
      

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.280

        takes half an hour afterwards to
        find everything and return
      

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.450

        it to base.


00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:38.860

        Now, if you take making a props
        table, the best way is
      

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:42.050

        to take a table and then
        cover it in some paper.
      

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.960

        This is just lining paper.


00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:47.240

        You could use the back
        of wallpaper.
      

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.220

        Stick this in down here.


00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.960

        And then set your props out on
        it in the most sensible way.
      

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.410

        So obviously, if something's to
        go on first, you'd want it
      

00:42:55.410 --> 00:43:00.120

        nearest the edge of the table
        that was nearest the door.
      

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.360

        And then you need to make
        a home for a prop.
      

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.710

        Now here we've got a comedy saw
        to go on somebody's head.
      

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:12.600

        And in order to make a home for
        it, you draw around it, so
      

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.350

        then when you look at the props
        table you're going to be
      

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.990

        under no doubt whatsoever--


00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:19.480

        Not in this case, anyway.


00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:20.970

        -- that it goes in this home.


00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.010

        And then when you've drawn
        around it, you write
      

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.170

        underneath it.


00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:27.750

        Nice big letters, because
        remember, it's going to be
      

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.750

        dark back here when
        the show's on.
      

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.380

        And that's the home
        now for this saw.
      

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:34.700

        Every time you come and look at
        the props table, if there's
      

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.010

        a gap there, you know
        it's gone missing.
      

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:39.020

        Somebody needs to put it back.


00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.710

        Let's create a home for these
        slippers as well.
      

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.110

        The reason you write down the
        side of it, is if you're doing
      

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.890

        something like a
        cup and saucer,
      

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.510

        obviously, it's just round.


00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:52.720

        So you need to know what's
        come from there.
      

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.670

        There we are.


00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:54.920

        Slippers.


00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.220



00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.470

        Pair.


00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.720



00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.750

        That's right.


00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.430

        It could be that their both
        left feet, and there's a
      

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.640

        particular reason why it
        is that for the show.
      

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.580

        In which case you would specify
        that underneath.
      

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.000

        Two left feet.


00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.480

        Two left feet.


00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.930

        That's right.


00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:18.320

        Could be just an insult,
        of course.
      

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.400

        And then, see let's
        do this one.
      

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.340

        This is a letter.


00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.370

        Now this is going to
        be a running prop.
      

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:23.970

        Running prop?


00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:24.750

        What does that mean?


00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.260

        A running prop is something
        that's going to
      

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:30.000

        be used each show.


00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.240

        It could be something like a
        cigarette that's smoked each
      

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.720

        show or a sweet.


00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.030

        Oh, I see.


00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.880

        Used up.


00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.450

        That's right.


00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:37.700

        Disposable prop.


00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.720

        So the stage manager will need
        to have made sure that there's
      

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.590

        enough of those for the number
        of performances you have. Say
      

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:46.960

        we've used that--


00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:49.840

        So I've gone, ah, I wish I'd
        never heard from him.
      

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.430

        --on stage, and now we need to
        make sure that before the next
      

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.370

        show goes up, we've got
        something to fill that gap.
      

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.400

        And that will immediately remind
        us that we need another
      

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.250

        running prop.


00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.130

        Now we've got homes for these,
        what you tend to find-- if we
      

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.430

        didn't have this, all this
        beautiful space behind us
      

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:06.840

        which is lovely and clear--


00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.720

        will be full of all
        bits of props that
      

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.760

        people have left behind.


00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:10.610

        For tripping over.


00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:11.310

        Exactly--


00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.020

        tripping over, and
        getting broken.
      

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.580

        Now all you need to do now is
        train your actors to put
      

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.660

        things back on the table
        and telling you if
      

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.790

        something gets broken.


00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:24.940

        So that you can fix it, if it
        needs to be fixed immediately,
      

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.740

        and then do a proper repair
        before the show
      

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.430

        goes up the next day.


00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:31.160

        Because one of the main problems
        you come up against
      

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.920

        is people coming to you two
        minutes before they need it
      

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.200

        saying, oh, it's broken.


00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.240

        And you say, when
        did it break?
      

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.780

        And they say, last night.


00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:39.760

        Not very helpful.


00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.030

        Not very helpful, no.


00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.100

        So check your props.


00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.470

        Check your props is the
        essence of this.
      

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.240

        So meanwhile we've got
        an empty space
      

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.320

        for our running letter.


00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.120

        So we're coming back to check
        this empty space.
      

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.730

        We think, right, need
        a new letter.
      

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:52.150

        There we are.


00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:53.590

        And we've completed
        our props table.
      

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.840

        Ready for the next
        performance.
      

00:45:54.840 --> 00:46:05.450



00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:08.640

        Here before us is a slice
        of theatrical history.
      

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.000

        Now Diane, we are amongst
        pantomime costumes ready to go
      

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.160

        out on hire, aren't we?


00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.310

        Yes.


00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.060

        And two of them have a rather
        special story, don't they?
      

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:16.820

        These two?


00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.510

        Yes.


00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.240

        They come from the film The
        Slipper and the Rose.
      

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.240

        The original film?


00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.830

        Yes, I believe they do.


00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.370

        Well, that must be at
        least 20 years old.
      

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.320

        Yes.


00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:30.800

        They were brought in
        by the theater, at
      

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.850

        least 14 years ago.


00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.390

        And as you can see, the most


00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:35.950

        beautiful fabrics and trimmings.


00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.360

        Very delicately done.


00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.290

        And also, very heavy.


00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:41.520

        Gracious.


00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.760

        That's extraordinary.


00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.840

        And have they been worn
        often in those years?
      

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.390

        Oh, yes.


00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:52.010

        I mean, they're costumes that go
        on hire virtually ever year
      

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.950

        plus during the year.


00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:55.390

        Because as you can
        see, they're so--
      

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.660

        Very well made.


00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.160

        --beautifully made
        and durable.
      

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.050

        Do you dry clean them?


00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:02.480

        Yes.


00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:07.410

        They go on hire, and then when
        they come back they are dry
      

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.250

        cleaned and then refurbished.


00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.550

        And I maintain this is why they
        have stayed as beautiful
      

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:17.370

        as they have over the years,
        because the grime can't get in
      

00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:18.230

        to hurt the fabrics.


00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:22.800

        Now these gorgeous things once
        were bridesmaid's dresses, is
      

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.010

        that right?


00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:23.480

        That's correct.


00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:23.810

        Yes.


00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:29.430

        These were some dresses that
        were brought in by a director,
      

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:35.260

        and I redesigned them to make
        the chorus girls' ballgowns.
      

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.640

        Presumably adding the sequins?


00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.660

        Yes, that's right.


00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:44.210

        We put the panel down the
        front, using the calico
      

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:49.560

        underneath to strengthen
        it and give it body.
      

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:54.030

        And also buying organza and
        making more of the sleeve, and
      

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.530

        also making panniers.


00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:56.970

        Beautiful.


00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:01.320

        And talking of panniers,
        this is outrageous.
      

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.740

        Who is this for?


00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:07.160

        This was actually Cyril
        Fletcher's, in fact.
      

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:07.430

        Really?


00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.210

        Yes, he used to have all
        his costumes made.
      

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:12.600

        And this is rather splendid,
        because in actual fact, it
      

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.260

        hasn't a battery to the
        back, and a light
      

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.010

        comes on the flower.


00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:19.060

        That's the flower?


00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:20.750

        Yes, each side of the--


00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:21.890

        Was this a dame's costume?


00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:23.410

        This is an ugly sisters
        costume.
      

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.380

        Ugly sisters.


00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.470

        Rather like having a sofa on,
        this dress, isn't it?
      

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:28.650

        And more uglies--


00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.620

        Lots more uglies.


00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.700

        --costumes I would think.


00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.710

        Yes, rather splendid.


00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:33.810

        And this is rather gorgeous.


00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:38.290

        Yes, this was worn by Wayne
        Sleep in Goldilocks.
      

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:43.970

        And this is an example of making
        and designing costumes
      

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.160

        for dancers.


00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:48.090

        As you see, this expands,
        so he has
      

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.530

        complete freedom of movement.


00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:51.080

        These are the trousers?


00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.990

        Same with his trousers.


00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.560

        He can dance, do the
        splits, whatever.
      

00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.560

        Like a second skin.


00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.660

        That's Lycra, is it?


00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.220

        That's right.


00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.310

        Gorgeous.


00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:05.890

        And moving on to this beautiful
        salmon effect thing.
      

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.200

        Now who is this for?


00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.190

        Well, this was made for Georgina
        Hale, who was our
      

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:11.840

        fairy godmother.


00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.390

        And the director particularly
        wanted her to be ultraviolet--
      

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:20.360

        UV. And as you can imagine,
        when he said this, I--
      

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.490

        he really wanted her
        in one dress.
      

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.240

        And you can imagine--


00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:27.150

        I couldn't imagine the fairy
        godmother in that color, but
      

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:30.690

        by putting the white organza
        over the top , it softened it.
      

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.220

        But it still gave
        the UV effect?
      

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.000

        Yes, it still gave
        the UV effect.
      

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.460

        All the jewelry at the
        front, we actually
      

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.310

        take from our stock.


00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.020

        Right.


00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:40.920

        And it's gorgeous.


00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.640

        And stiff wings, as well.


00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:43.860

        Yes that's right.


00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:45.210

        Yes.


00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:46.550

        She used to use it.


00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.210

        Diane, I've never been able to
        wear something like this.
      

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.930

        I've never had the chance
        to, really.
      

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.950

        Could you do me as
        a fairy princess?
      

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.200

        Well, we can try.


00:49:54.200 --> 00:50:05.140



00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.140

        Diane, we're now in the
        workroom, the hub of where it
      

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.990

        all happens in the theater.


00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.580

        That's right.


00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:11.320

        Yes.


00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:11.740

        Definitely.


00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.680

        What are you doing now?


00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:20.750

        At the moment, I've just cut
        out the calico cotton mount
      

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.790

        for a skirt.


00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.710

        And all our costumes are
        in fact, mounted
      

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:31.930

        onto a cotton backing.


00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:36.530

        Mainly four the fact of the
        strain, because when we make a
      

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:40.650

        costume, we have to make sure
        they're really strong and they
      

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:41.840

        will stand up to--


00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.520

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:50.320

        --as well as doing the run
        that we expect from them.
      

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:52.980

        So this is for a character
        in Peter Pan, is it not?
      

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.910

        That's right.


00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.580

        This is for one of
        the dancers.
      

00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.230

        Splendid.


00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:58.690

        And that's made of
        velvet, isn't it?
      

00:50:58.690 --> 00:51:00.190

        That's right, yes.


00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.010

        It's a rustic velvet.


00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:02.500

        Beautiful.


00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.000

        And that will then go on
        hire for a Peter Pan
      

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.350

        production, or anything?


00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:11.200

        Well, it will, in fact, be
        as a separate skirt.
      

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.920

        Yes.


00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.420

        Talking about skirts, I know
        Lisa is working on
      

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.000

        another one over here.


00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.840

        That's right.


00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:17.790

        Yes.


00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.110

        Who is this one for?


00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.860

        This is for another
        chorus girl.
      

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.450

        And it's an Edwardian skirt.


00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:26.560

        It's very heavy.


00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:27.930

        It's very heavy, yes.


00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.270

        But of course, it does
        have to be strong.
      

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:34.120

        And in actual fact, we don't
        have to think about movement
      

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.700

        for these particular costumes,
        as it's going to
      

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:40.120

        be just like a picture.


00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.830

        The girls are not dancing.


00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:42.710

        The boys are not dancing.


00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:44.830

        I think they'll be
        glad for that.
      

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:48.280

        So they are just standing.


00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:52.840

        Lisa has done her pleating, and
        also she's put a placket
      

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:53.890

        in the back.


00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:54.650

        Right.


00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.240

        Very beautifully done, if I
        might say so, not being a
      

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.420

        seamstress myself.


00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:01.170

        Now, how would you do up a
        heavy skirt like this?
      

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:03.310

        Because you obviously wouldn't
        put a zip in, would you?
      

00:52:03.310 --> 00:52:03.850

        No.


00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:04.960

        No, what we do--


00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:08.390

        Lisa has put the placket in,
        and then what we do, we use
      

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:10.830

        really large poppers.


00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:13.230

        Holy moly, they're
        very, very big.
      

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.190

        -poppers.


00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:18.180

        And also at the waistband
        we would then use--
      

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.930

        we call them trouser
        hooks and bars.
      

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:26.510

        We thread a piece of tape
        through the trouser hook, and
      

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:29.810

        then we sew it on, and then
        just secure here.
      

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.180

        And this then doesn't
        come off.
      

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.030

        Because when they move--. if
        you use thread, it cuts
      

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.900

        through, but it won't cut
        through the tape.
      

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.750

        And then also, that's the
        actual bar that we use.
      

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:44.080

        Right.


00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.830

        Brilliant.


00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:48.100

        Now I know also that at this
        theater, you have a whole
      

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:50.070

        store of your own costumes.


00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:52.150

        You update them, don't
        you, as well?
      

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.590

        Yes.


00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:54.180

        Alter them for different
        shows.
      

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:55.090

        That's right.


00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.370

        This is one.


00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:01.160

        Yes, this is that a jacket that
        we actually got out and
      

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:04.820

        we want to reuse it.


00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.260

        It is quite old.


00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.310

        This is quite old.


00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:11.010

        It's been here for at
        least 15 years.
      

00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:11.830

        Goodness.


00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:13.670

        And what we've done--


00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.250

        we cheated a little bit, because
        obviously we have
      

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:18.340

        budgets to keep to.


00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:21.430

        And what we're going to do is--
        we're actually going to
      

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:26.590

        attach this front inside
        the jacket.
      

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:30.530

        So that actually gets attached
        down like that.
      

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:35.920

        Note that this is all being
        backed and boned.
      

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.980

        Oh, it's boned as well.


00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.420

        Yes, that's right.


00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:41.550

        And also we have
        used hook tape.
      

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:44.690

        A tip with hook tape
        is the fact that--
      

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:48.660

        how you would never use a zip,
        because a zip will break and
      

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.550

        pull open, but not all
        the hooks will come
      

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:53.710

        off in one go, quickly.


00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:54.300

        Right.


00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.340

        Oh, that's brilliant.


00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.220

        And this braid is all
        added as well?
      

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:02.210

        That's all added, which is being
        done at this minute.
      

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:07.030

        And then we've actually made a
        skirt, in fact, to go with it,
      

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:09.980

        which is made ready
        for fitting.
      

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:10.710

        Right--


00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.730

        So, it's a process of make and
        mend really, isn't it?
      

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:15.120

        You're mending all the time.


00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.370

        Yes, that's right.


00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:27.470



00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:30.830

        Diane, one of the most popular
        characters in the pantomime is
      

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:32.010

        the principal boy.


00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:32.630

        That's correct.


00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:34.830

        Now it must be very confusing
        to children to see girls
      

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.360

        playing boys and men
        playing women.
      

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.660

        I don't know why it should
        be so, but it is
      

00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:40.310

        traditional, isn't it?


00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.900

        It is very traditional, yes.


00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.440

        Now, I rather fancy being
        principal boy myself, and you
      

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.130

        thought I might make a rather
        good Dick Whittington.
      

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:51.600

        Have you managed to find
        something for me?
      

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.520

        Well, yes, I have. In fact,
        I think the coloring--
      

00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.310

        Oh, lovely.


00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:57.300

        --suits you.


00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.440

        Oh, yes.


00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.320

        I think I can probably
        get used to that.
      

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.570

        I'll just slip it on.


00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:04.820



00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.910

        Oh, yes, I like this.


00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:08.590

        And the color is so
        right on you.
      

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:09.830

        Very nice.


00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:11.150

        Oh, I could get used to this.


00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:14.660

        We need to make your
        legs look longer.
      

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.120

        We're giving you some
        really high boots.
      

00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:17.670

        Good gracious.


00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:22.430

        Not just any, but high
        heeled boots.
      

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:26.630

        These are thigh boots which are
        traditionally worn by a
      

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:28.050

        principal boy.


00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:29.260

        Indeed.


00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.170

        I'm gonna need a hand.


00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.530

        We'll manage.


00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:33.380

        That's it.


00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:34.390

        That's right.


00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.880

        Oh, yes, a bit taller now.


00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:39.040

        That's right, yes.


00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.730

        And we need to get your
        hair off your face.
      

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.750

        Oh, right.


00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:48.330

        And also we'll give you a hat,
        which we've got ready.
      

00:55:48.330 --> 00:55:49.450

        Complete the picture.


00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:50.700

        That's right.


00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.020



00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:57.990

        Now, principal boys, do they
        always wear fishnet tights?
      

00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.750

        Not always.


00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.230

        Often support tights.


00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:03.790



00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:09.870

        And often, if they don't use
        thigh boots, they then have
      

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:12.130

        very high court shoes.


00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:18.990

        The idea is to keep the
        principal boy tall and show
      

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:20.770

        lots of leg--


00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.480

        and a long leg.


00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.820

        That's probably why I've never
        been cast as principal boy.
      

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:27.820

        I think you will--


00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.860

        After today.


00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.830

        And now, hats.


00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:37.670

        And I'll show you how not
        to put to your hat on.
      

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:40.340

        That looks absolutely
        dreadful.
      

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:43.560

        But you put it on like this--


00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.890

        really stunning.


00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:46.310

        I see.


00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:47.370

        Right.


00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:49.540

        So, I feel complete now.


00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.760

        In fact, I think I feel a
        thigh slap coming on.
      

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.360

        Oh, yes.


00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.300

        Yes, I like this.


00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.230

        However, I'm not sure I'd make
        it to London in these.
      

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:10.420



00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:12.400

        Diane, the moment has come.


00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:15.200

        You did promise me you could
        turn me into a fairy princess.
      

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.250

        Yes.


00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:20.320

        How about Cinderella
        at the ball?
      

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.580

        Well, all things are possible.


00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.320

        Yes, you look wonderful.


00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.200

        This is Cinderella, yes?


00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.070

        That's right.


00:57:28.070 --> 00:57:31.280

        This gown was made for Annabel
        Croft when she was the
      

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.980

        Cinderella at the
        Theatre Royal.
      

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:39.380

        When I came to designing it, I
        thought I should look at the
      

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.500

        design through the
        eye of the child.
      

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:46.590

        And I wanted the children to
        go to Annabel and say, you
      

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.130

        look beautiful.


00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:52.390

        And I must admit, this is
        exactly what did happen.
      

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:53.500

        So it was very nice.


00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:53.860

        Splendid.


00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.660

        And how do you begin with
        a dress like this?
      

00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.160

        Well, to start with, we
        obviously have to
      

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.890

        think about the base--


00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:03.350

        the crinoline underneath.


00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:08.460

        But you can see, you make the
        crinoline underneath--
      

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:10.200

        that's all the wires--


00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.630

        then obviously, we have to make
        petticoats to go over, so
      

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:17.430

        that we don't see any wires.


00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:23.420

        And then yet another
        silver fabric.
      

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.640

        Because I wanted to keep it all
        sparkly, we then put the
      

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:30.290

        white organza over the top.


00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:34.600

        So when Cinderella moves,
        it sparkles, it
      

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:36.080

        lights, very well.


00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.780

        And the diamante helps
        that, doesn't it?
      

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.560

        That's right.


00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:40.200

        That also helps.


00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.460

        This is all sewn on by hand.


00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.410

        Little things like this were
        made up especially.
      

00:58:47.410 --> 00:58:52.140

        And the same with this front--


00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:55.010

        they're all small diamantes
        that were
      

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.710

        individually sewn on.


00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.540

        Goodness, it must have taken
        you forever to do all that.
      

00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:00.750

        Yes, it did take quite
        a long time.
      

00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.350

        And obviously, all the
        bodice is boned.
      

00:59:03.350 --> 00:59:05.980

        Yes, I can feel that.


00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.720

        That's wonderful.


00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.780

        So now all we're missing
        is the final touch.
      

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.700

        Well, Diane, we have a
        choice of two wigs.
      

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.060

        Which should it be, I wonder?


00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:18.090

        Well, I think we'll go
        for Cindarella's wig.
      

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.520

        First of all, we need to make
        sure we've got your hair well
      

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.400

        out of the way.


00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:26.250

        We've already clipped it up,
        and we have here an old
      

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:30.360

        stocking, which we've cut in
        half and put a knot in.
      

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:35.910

        Which is a very good way of
        getting rid of the hair.
      

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:38.510

        Getting rid of your
        stockings as well.
      

00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:39.890

        Yes.


00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:41.980

        You can, in fact, get
        wig nets, but
      

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.320

        this is just as efficient.


00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.120

        That's right.


00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.260

        We've got rid of--


00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.510

        I look like a peanut.


00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:52.510



00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:54.680

        Now if we take the wig and--


00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.020

        if you can, in fact, hold the
        front on your forehead.
      

00:59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.040



01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.410

        OK.


01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:01.790

        That's right.


01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:07.980

        And then I'll pull it from
        the back, very tightly.
      

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:13.160

        And in actual fact, you would
        clip it to your hair.
      

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:13.470

        What?


01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.760

        With grips?


01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.060

        With grips.


01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.290

        And clip it right though.


01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:19.410

        Make sure it was firmly on.


01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:22.870

        Yes, firmly secured.


01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:23.830

        Wonderful.


01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:25.350

        Instant hairdo.


01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:26.140

        That's correct.


01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:26.870

        Amazing.


01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.470

        Yes.


01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.690

        Then we need to put--


01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:30.670

        Earrings on?


01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:31.920

        --some more jewels.


01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.290



01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:35.900

        Lovely.


01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.340

        That's right.


01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.590

        And a bracelet.


01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:42.720



01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:46.840

        I think that's right, and
        then the headdress.
      

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.340

        We have, in fact, got a small
        tiara today, but in actual
      

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.510

        fact, you can often use an
        ostrich feather with some
      

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:59.190

        diamante on, which just
        go across the side.
      

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.320

        Ah.


01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.570

        My prince awaits.


01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:14.760



01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.950

        Well, no prizes for
        getting what our
      

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:19.120

        design subject is today.


01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.630

        And although we are very used
        to people dressing up for
      

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:25.180

        pantomimes as goblins and
        fairies and wicked witches and
      

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.330

        all the rest of it--


01:01:26.330 --> 01:01:30.730

        animals play a large part in
        each annual pantomime.
      

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.760

        And this wonderful chap--


01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.330

        Ian, you're going to tell
        us all about it.
      

01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:34.810

        This is right.


01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:36.480

        This crocodile-- what's his
        name, first of all?
      

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.690

        He must have a name?


01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:38.610

        Well, we haven't actually
        got a name for him--
      

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:40.430

        just big bad croc.


01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.260

        But he's Captain Hook's enemy.


01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:42.650

        This


01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:43.030

        Is wonderful.


01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.370

        And this is he how he works.


01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:47.630

        And look-- fully working
        eyes, as well.
      

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.140

        Now, there's someone in here.


01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.800

        We have to say that.


01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.070

        Are you all right in there?


01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:53.070

        Oh, yes.


01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:54.010

        Let's get him out.


01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:54.310

        Right.


01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:55.140

        What's it made of?


01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.000

        This is definitely boil
        in the bag job.
      

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.290

        Boil in the bag.


01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:01.930

        Well, this is latex, steel--


01:02:01.930 --> 01:02:04.710

        and this is how it's made.


01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.070

        That's incredible.


01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:08.630

        And you can feel the
        heat rising.
      

01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:10.070

        Can you breath in, Paul?


01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:10.360

        Relax.


01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.600

        That's it.


01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.090

        Well done.


01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:16.830

        OK.


01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:18.300

        And out he comes from
        the cocoon.
      

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.860



01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.620

        It's not something you'd like
        to do eight times a week.
      

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:27.400

        No, not eight nights a week.


01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.850

        It's based on a boiler suit, and
        the actor's legs work the
      

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:36.000

        back legs of the crocodile.


01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.430

        And the head works the head?


01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.900

        And the arms work--


01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.540

        That's right.


01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:41.460

        So it's like crawling
        on all fours.
      

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.200



01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.600

        It's not a quick change.


01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.240

        But how long could someone stay
        in something like this?
      

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.300

        The most--


01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:55.640

        about 15 minutes at the very,
        very most, because it's so
      

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.280

        hot, that they will dehydrated
        very quickly.
      

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.670

        Is it quite hard to physically
        work, Paul?
      

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:03.580

        Yes, it is.


01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.070

        To move across.


01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:06.550

        Yes.


01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:08.020

        It's very effective, though.


01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:08.520

        Yes.


01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.970

        Very hard on the chest.


01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:13.750

        Now, how we make this--


01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:18.270

        if you come inside, you can see
        it's internal workings.
      

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:21.790

        Now what we've got here is an
        aluminum frame, which makes
      

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:24.330

        the arms. And it's on
        a cross system.
      

01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.110

        Is that what you began with?


01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:26.380

        That's right.


01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.730

        So there's a big wooden and
        aluminum framed section, in a
      

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:33.820

        cross section, to make the
        arms and the main body.
      

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:37.340

        And there's a big padding for
        the chest. And in here--
      

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:38.590

        let's turn it around--


01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:42.070



01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:43.710

        we have a cap.


01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:47.020

        A skull cap, where the
        actor's head goes in.
      

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.380

        And this operates the head.


01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.960

        Now these cables are bicycle
        cables for brake systems, and
      

01:03:53.960 --> 01:04:00.130

        there are levers down in the
        feet, which operate the eyes
      

01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:02.200

        and the jaw movement.


01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.840

        How long did it take
        you to make?
      

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.010

        It took three weeks to make.


01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:06.490

        Solidly?


01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:07.210

        That's right.


01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:09.000

        And how old is he?


01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.960

        He's about 12 years old.


01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.310

        This is originally done at a
        theater hall in Plymouth.
      

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:14.740

        And has it been used
        every year?
      

01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:16.200

        Almost every year.


01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.780

        That's extraordinary.


01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.010

        So which one of you is
        longer in the tooth?
      

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:21.260

        I think definitely me.


01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:33.030



01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.630

        So Dave, we've got the lights
        down here on the bars, but
      

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:37.760

        it's what we do them that's
        important, isn't it?
      

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.340

        Yes.


01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.600

        Because a badly lit actor might
        be upstaged by the set.
      

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.430

        Yes, and don't forget-- a badly
        lit actor is also an
      

01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:46.320

        unheard voice, possibly.


01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:46.950

        Very true.


01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.100

        That's right.


01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:50.880

        Now there are three basic
        directions to light an actor
      

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.770

        from, aren't there?


01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:52.740

        Yes.


01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.390

        That most important way would
        be from the front, to ensure
      

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:58.260

        that the face is visible.


01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.220

        But it can give quite a flat
        texture, can't it?
      

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:05.330

        Yes, you need to be careful to
        keep the angle to one side.
      

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:07.700

        Don't go straight to the front,
        because that will
      

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:08.940

        flatten the face completely.


01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.640

        The nose will disappear.


01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.600

        Yes.


01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.820

        Second way is from the back.


01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.900

        Back light separates the
        performer from the background.
      

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.550

        And the third way is from the
        front and at a low level.
      

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.730

        Right, and that can
        be quite spooky.
      

01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.310

        It shines up under the
        chin, doesn't it?
      

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:25.070

        Yes.


01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.840

        It can be used very, very low
        level for filling shadows
      

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.780

        under the chin, or with a
        brighter level of light
      

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.270

        creates a nice spooky
        shadow behind.
      

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.890

        Right.


01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.210

        Now there are five different
        lanterns, really, that we tend
      

01:05:38.210 --> 01:05:41.180

        to use for lighting an
        actor, aren't there?
      

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:41.900

        First one's a flood.


01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.500

        Tell us something
        about a flood.
      

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.890

        Floods are usually only used
        for lighting backdrop.
      

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:49.700

        They're a nice, even spread
        of light, but they are,
      

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.180

        otherwise, uncontrollable.


01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:51.390

        Right.


01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:52.940

        So you can't do a
        great with them?
      

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.750

        No.


01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:55.250

        How about a Fresnel?


01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:58.760

        Most useful lantern
        in the range.
      

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.720

        Can be adjusted from a fairly
        tight spot right out to almost
      

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.930

        a flood position.


01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:07.170

        But it has quite soft
        edges, doesn't it?
      

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:08.400

        Nice soft edges.


01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.760

        The lanterns blend in nicely
        with one another, lighting
      

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.530

        different areas on the stage.


01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:17.010

        Now a profile spot, that gives
        very hard edges, doesn't it?
      

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:21.170

        Profile spots are normally
        used for lighting an
      

01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:22.600

        individual point, yes.


01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:24.290

        A hard edge.


01:06:24.290 --> 01:06:27.670

        Some can be focused back to
        soft, although some don't have
      

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:29.000

        that facility at all.


01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:29.780

        Right.


01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:31.460

        Now you can get a
        zoom profile.
      

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.500

        Now what's better about
        a zoom profile?
      

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.800

        Well, a zoom profile
        has two lenses.
      

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.310

        You can focus it to be a hard
        edge beam or a soft beam, or
      

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.170

        adjust the diameter
        of the beam.
      

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.850

        So you can have a large
        spot or a small one?
      

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:44.670

        Yes.


01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:45.540

        All right.


01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.150

        Now, you can get PAR
        cans, as well.
      

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:49.100

        When would we use a PAR can?


01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:53.120

        PAR cans, in a drama setting,
        are normally used for light
      

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.210

        through windows--


01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.640

        sunlight in particular.


01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.270

        They're nice and powerful.


01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:58.500

        They can't be focused.


01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:58.690

        Right.


01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:00.470

        So you tend to buy the type
        of PAR can that you
      

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:01.690

        actually want to use.


01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:02.630

        You do, as a rule.


01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:03.380

        Yes.


01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.240

        You do have a certain amount of
        adjustment over the angle
      

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.020

        of the beam.


01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:10.370

        The beam is oval and you
        can swivel it around.
      

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.260

        But that's the only
        adjustment.
      

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.920

        Now we've got a zoom
        profile down here.
      

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.050

        Would you like to show me
        how you'd rig this?
      

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:18.310

        Right.


01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.690

        Well, the lantern is in the
        stored position, standing on
      

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:22.650

        the front end, which-


01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.090

        Is that so it protects
        it's lens?
      

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:28.120

        It protects the lens, and it's
        the most stable position.
      

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.670

        The first part of rigging is
        to actually hook the hook
      

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.510

        clamp over the barrel.


01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.670

        Right.


01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:35.800

        Making sure, of course, not to
        catch any of the cables that
      

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:36.220

        are running underneath.


01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.670

        Yes, it's not a good idea
        to screw the clamp
      

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.770

        into lighting cables.


01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:40.970

        No, not really.


01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:44.440

        Make sure that clamp
        is nice and tight.
      

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.740

        That's whats keeps it secure.


01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.170

        That actually keeps it secure.


01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:47.600

        Right.


01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.310

        And then we've got
        the safety chain.
      

01:07:49.310 --> 01:07:51.900

        Most important-- the
        safety chain.
      

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:55.280

        If you're hiring equipment in,
        make sure that the company
      

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.170

        does supply appropriate safety
        chains to go with the weight
      

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:00.970

        of the lantern that
        you're hiring.
      

01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.410

        But they're actually quite
        cheap to buy, as
      

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:02.810

        well, aren't they?


01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:03.340

        Yes.


01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:06.680

        Yes, they're not expensive at
        all, and it's definitely not
      

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.820

        worth having lanterns on your
        rig that don't have them on.
      

01:08:09.820 --> 01:08:11.730

        No, right.


01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:12.660

        Now we've got the cable.


01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:13.110

        Next-- the cable.


01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:15.500

        What should we do with this?


01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.180

        Secured in a clip, though,
        issn't it?
      

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.250

        Do all lanterns have that?


01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:19.270

        No.


01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:21.670

        You'll find that this is
        probably only on some of the
      

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:22.730

        newer lanterns.


01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:25.400

        Most of the old ones didn't have
        this, but it does prevent
      

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:27.630

        too much strain on the
        mains connection
      

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:28.820

        to the lantern itself.


01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:28.940

        Right.


01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:29.430

        Yes, that's good.


01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.300

        So that will wrap
        around there.
      

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.150

        Goes off to a plug--


01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:33.840

        And the plug will get plugged
        in over here?
      

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.340

        --over there.


01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.830

        Make sure that you have-- before
        you fix this cable--
      

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:41.120

        sufficient slack, so that
        when you come to focus--
      

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.040

        Ah, so it doesn't
        get to tight.
      

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:43.230

        Right.


01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:46.490

        You tip the lantern into it's
        focusing position, and you're
      

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:50.210

        going to need to swivel it in
        several different directions--
      

01:08:50.210 --> 01:08:50.920

        When you come to focus it.


01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.430

        --so that you don't need to
        pull that too tightly.
      

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.160

        And there we have a
        rigged lantern.
      

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.600

        So we're rigged now.


01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.200

        We can get on to more
        creative things.
      

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:08.260



01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:10.670

        Dave, the last time we were
        talking, we were talking about
      

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:13.050

        how to rig lights, but where
        you draw the power for the
      

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:14.670

        lights is also very important,
        isn't it?
      

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:15.900

        Very important, indeed.


01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.330

        Now when you're in a theater
        like this, usually the power
      

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:19.220

        will be all on hand.


01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:22.780

        But if we have to run a lighting
        rig off 13 amp
      

01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:26.480

        sockets, then how would we
        set about doing that?
      

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:30.270

        The easiest way is to remember
        that six 500 watt lanterns
      

01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:33.330

        will run off one
        13 amp socket.
      

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:34.840

        Be careful with that,
        though, because
      

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.290

        some more modern lanterns--


01:09:36.290 --> 01:09:39.870

        you may hire actually have
        650 watt lamps in them.
      

01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:40.950

        Right.


01:09:40.950 --> 01:09:44.270

        So a kilowatt lamp takes
        approximately
      

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:44.860

        four amps to use it.


01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.320

        Four amps, approximately.


01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:47.070

        Four amps.


01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:50.900

        But do remember to make sure
        that the catering department
      

01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.980

        don't plug enormous urns and
        things into your same circuit.
      

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.160

        Otherwise, it's all
        going to go bang.
      

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.860

        It's all going to
        go bang, yes.
      

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.080

        Now we've got some gels here.


01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.550

        Now we would use these
        to add interesting
      

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.390

        effects to the lights.


01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:05.360

        Is that right?


01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:05.990

        Right.


01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.350

        Yes.


01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:09.420

        It's important to decide at
        and early stage, I think,
      

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:11.310

        exactly what the production
        is going to look like.
      

01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:12.760

        Is it going to use
        natural colors?
      

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.840

        Is it going to use
        strong colors to
      

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.200

        suggest different things.


01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.630

        As a general thing, red- or
        pink-colored lights tend to
      

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:23.780

        suggest something that's warm,
        and blues tend to suggest
      

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.050

        something that's cold.


01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:27.030

        Yes, This is very true.


01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:29.100

        And we've got a great variety of
        all the different ones that
      

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.390

        you can choose.


01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.630

        Now one of the things when
        you're using gels, is to
      

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:36.060

        remember that it's additive
        color mixing, isn't it?
      

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.660

        It's not like paint, where you
        mix the colors and it will
      

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.230

        eventually get to black.


01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:43.320

        When you mix gel colors, it
        eventually comes to white
      

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:43.900

        light, doesn't it?


01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:45.240

        Yes, it does.


01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.030

        And so it's always best
        to- in advance, say--
      

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:51.580

        perhaps get a torch, and shine
        through the various gels onto
      

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:54.560

        a white surface, so that you
        know what color you're going
      

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.310

        to end up with.


01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.600

        Yes.


01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.320

        I usually do it onto the back
        of a hand, actually, because
      

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.950

        that gives you an idea
        of what it will look
      

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:01.460

        like on flesh tones.


01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:02.590

        Oh, right.


01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.920

        That's a good idea.


01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:04.500

        Which is a useful
        thing to see.
      

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.510

        Especially when you're
        lighting actors.
      

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:06.390

        Yes.


01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:07.130

        Yes.


01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:08.950

        Now we can get gobos, as well.


01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:14.850

        Now, a gobo fits into a profile
        spot, doesn't it?
      

01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:15.250

        Yes.


01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:17.820

        You must remember it must
        always be a profile.
      

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:20.230

        You can't use them in any
        other type of lantern.
      

01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:21.720

        They must be in a profile.


01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.130

        This particular one, here,
        is a fire one.
      

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.220

        But you can get all sorts of
        different ones, can't you?
      

01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:28.380

        Very large range--


01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.500

        several hundred.


01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.750

        You can have them custom-made,
        at a price.
      

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:33.960

        And you find those in
        catalogs, do you?
      

01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.460

        Yes.


01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:36.960

        Almost all good stage
        suppliers will
      

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.260

        have a range of these.


01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:38.710

        Right.


01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:42.100

        They are, actually, quite
        easy to make.
      

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.910

        I made a break up gobo.


01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.520

        Here's one that I made.


01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.730

        And all the holes in it would
        break up the light nicely,
      

01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:51.080

        wouldn't it?


01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.680

        So it was textured, perhaps
        for a forest effect or
      

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.490

        something like that.


01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:54.580

        Yes.


01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.780

        They're most often used to
        create a dappled effect for
      

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:00.390

        walking through a forest.
        A very effective
      

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:01.830

        and very cheap way.


01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:02.630

        And extremely easy to make.


01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:06.940

        I made this from an old foil
        takeaway carton that you just
      

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:10.930

        cut around the edges of-- just
        around here-- and flatten out.
      

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:16.690

        And I took some needle files,
        which you can buy in a case.
      

01:12:16.690 --> 01:12:18.680

        And they're all different
        shapes and sizes.
      

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.680

        I use a round one.


01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.900

        And just punch out the holes--


01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.490

        like that.


01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:27.260

        And fold the edges over
        so that you get
      

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.310

        a good strong edge.


01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.310

        That's important, isn't it?


01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:29.730

        Right.


01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:31.310

        It is important to have--


01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:32.850

        Then these fit onto a frame.


01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.170

        Here's some that you've
        made, here.
      

01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:38.090

        And her'es a pumpkin on that
        you made earlier on.
      

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:38.500

        Yes.


01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.650

        Very festive.


01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:41.910

        An important point to remember
        with gobos--
      

01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:43.610

        they get very hot.


01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.390

        And you need to put them in
        upside down and back to front.
      

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.900

        Yes.


01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.250

        Otherwise, they come
        out all higgeldy
      

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.500

        piggeldy They do.


01:12:49.500 --> 01:13:00.390



01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:02.600

        Graham Higgins, from the
        Hamlet Theatre Company.
      

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.520

        The last time we spoke,
        I saw your trailer
      

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.050

        full of lots of flats--


01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.430

        which are now up--


01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:09.770

        and of course that's not
        the only thing you
      

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:10.690

        transport, is it?


01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:13.020

        You have a great deal else
        to go in there, as well.
      

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:13.560

        Absolutely.


01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.320

        You can see all the scenery that
        the cast have been busy
      

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.090

        putting up--


01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.950

        pictures on the walls.


01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:20.350

        And then you come into
        my little job, which
      

01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:22.440

        is lights and sound.


01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:22.650

        Right.


01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:25.620

        So you take all the lighting and
        sound equipment with you?
      

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.070

        What we've got-- we've just
        bolted onto these uprights-- a
      

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:31.090

        couple of wooden pillars--
        because we're not sure what
      

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:33.070

        we're going to find in a
        village hall to secure
      

01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.720

        anything to.


01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.150

        Sure.


01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.060

        They may not have anything
        set up at all.
      

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.080

        The main thing is we can't go
        above three kilowatts, because
      

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.390

        we blow the circuit.


01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:41.390

        That's certainly important.


01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:44.410

        So proper lights up there, but
        the one at the back's the fun
      

01:13:44.410 --> 01:13:46.920

        one, because it's just a light
        from a do it yourself shop.
      

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.260

        Watch the way that lights up.


01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.300

        Ah-ha.


01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.150

        So nothing fancy and
        professional?
      

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:53.300

        Nothing.


01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.730

        Look at the foot lights that
        we've made ourselves.
      

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:59.330

        40 watt bulbs, just a little
        bit of reflective metal--
      

01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:00.770

        shall I show you
        them coming up?
      

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:02.350

        And they really just light


01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:03.490

        up the cast. Yes.


01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:05.520

        And they're quite unusual these
        days, but they have a
      

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.480

        lovely effect.


01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.110

        Yeah.


01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.210

        It's also useful in a place like
        this, because it shows
      

01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.600

        the cast, so they don't
        get into the audience.
      

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.730

        Do you want to see the sound?


01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:13.040

        Oh, yes.


01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.070

        You've got all that, as
        well, haven't you?
      

01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.850

        Yeah.


01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:16.600

        Brought this from home.


01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.590

        So this is ordinary,
        domestic equipment?
      

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:19.930

        Yeah.


01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:22.570

        CD player and tape.


01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:25.650

        What I've got set up on here
        are some sound effects.
      

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.270

        We're going to do
        a country scene.
      

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:28.700

        So can I play something
        for you?
      

01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.320

        Please do.


01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.970

        [BIRD SOUNDS PLAYING]


01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:34.220

        Wouldn't normally see me.


01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.890



01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.920

        And an alternative one.


01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:40.880

        We think it's a bit
        more woodlandish.
      

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:44.480

        [BIRD SOUNDS PLAYING]


01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:44.810

        OK.


01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:45.980

        Rooks.


01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.390

        Yeah.


01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:48.980

        I'm not a bird fan.


01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:51.040

        So you would operate
        this yourself?
      

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:51.920

        Yeah.


01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.170

        Hiding behind there.


01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:53.480

        Right.


01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.510

        And you're the only member of
        the company who doesn't act,
      

01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:57.270

        is that right?


01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.380

        Pretty well, yeah.


01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.430

        Someone has to do this
        side of the business.
      

01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:04.320

        But they all do other
        things as well.
      

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.600

        You've seen them--


01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.020

        thy come in, they do the
        painting, they put the panels
      

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:12.210

        up, and then they go and get
        their makeup on, while I put
      

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:13.400

        the lighting in place.


01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.340

        That's quite unusual, as well,
        because normally actors are
      

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:18.360

        actors, and ever shall be.


01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.320

        And that's the way--


01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.960

        They can't just be
        actors here.
      

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.120

        They've got to come--


01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:23.800

        one of them's got to pull the
        curtains for me, because I
      

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.440

        can't be doing the lighting
        effects if they're not pulling
      

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.600

        the curtains.


01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.240

        That's OK as long as things go
        well, but you've got a cast,
      

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.850

        and we've got all of them on
        stage and you suddenly think--
      

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:36.330

        who is going to shut
        the curtains?
      

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:38.910

        And do I do the lights
        or shut the curtains?
      

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:40.470

        And it's me that
        gets the blame.
      

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:41.170

        There we go.


01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:41.850

        A shame.


01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:43.100

        It is.


01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:54.700



01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:55.680

        This is Kay.


01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.020

        This is Kay.


01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:57.040

        And what are you going to do
        with Kay this morning?
      

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.950

        Well, today we're making Kay--


01:15:58.950 --> 01:16:00.910

        we're removing her makeup
        first-- but we're making her
      

01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:02.470

        into a 1940s woman.


01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.610

        So we've already got the hair
        done, and so we're getting
      

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:06.000

        into the whole feel of it.


01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.510

        And now I'm just taking
        off the makeup to be
      

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:08.260

        able to start it.


01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:08.660

        Right.


01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:10.430

        So it's important to come
        with a clean face.
      

01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:12.930

        Yes, it helps to come with a
        clean face, and then you can
      

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:15.910

        put on the other makeup
        from there, and start.
      

01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:18.750

        So I'm just removing your
        lipstick there, Kay.
      

01:16:18.750 --> 01:16:22.410

        So you've given Kay a good
        covering with foundation for
      

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:23.410

        her '40s lady.


01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:26.720

        Now, how would she choose
        the color for Herself
      

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.450

        As I say, what's very important
        within the theater
      

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:33.200

        and the stage makeup, is to make
        sure it's a pinky tone.
      

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.260

        And here I have chosen
        really quite a pinky
      

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.880

        tone, as you can see.


01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.270

        And we've applied it to the
        whole of her face by having
      

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:44.180

        first put on a moisturizer so
        that the blending of it is as
      

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:44.800

        good as you can get.


01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.930

        Now can you raise your face for
        me, and I can just make
      

01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:51.990

        sure that the ears and the neck
        are covered, and that you
      

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:56.020

        go down, making sure that
        the color is continuous.
      

01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.280

        There we go.


01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.370

        Is there any particular
        difference in color because
      

01:16:59.370 --> 01:17:00.520

        it's for a '40s play?


01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:00.990

        No.


01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:04.030

        There is a difference in color
        as to what's complimentary, in
      

01:17:04.030 --> 01:17:07.190

        terms of a female makeup
        versus a male makeup,
      

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.120

        in terms of a tone.


01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.010

        So the men's tones are tanned,
        but the female tones are much
      

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:14.820

        more pinky, and that, then,
        is complimentary.
      

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.840

        So if Kay is doing
        this herself.
      

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.080

        She looks in the mirror--


01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:22.400

        and would she aim for a heavier
        color than she would
      

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.450

        wear to a party, for example?


01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:26.320

        Yes.


01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.650

        Definitely more reddy, more
        pinky, reddy tones than she
      

01:17:29.650 --> 01:17:31.060

        would wear to a party.


01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:31.710

        Right.


01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:32.380

        Definitely.


01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.600

        And you're powdering already?


01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:37.430

        Yes I'm powdering having gone
        over the whole of her skin
      

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:38.170

        with a base, yes.


01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:39.020

        It is quite fine.


01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:39.920

        It doesn't have to be heavy.


01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.210

        This is before any eye shadow
        or anything like that?
      

01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:43.460

        Absolutely.


01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:45.650



01:17:45.650 --> 01:17:48.070

        OK, now what I'm doing
        just now is finally
      

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:50.260

        putting on the lipstick.


01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:55.490

        Having defined the eyebrows,
        having put on the blue
      

01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:58.270

        eyeshadow which is of the
        '40s period, having
      

01:17:58.270 --> 01:18:00.050

        to find your eyes--


01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:04.080

        and now it's just putting on a
        very strong red that's shaping
      

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:07.530

        and giving full size
        to your lips.
      

01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:09.750

        OK?


01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:11.220

        How do you feel?


01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.470

        Very good.


01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:14.700



01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:17.190

        Now, as far as the top
        lip is concerned--
      

01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:19.060

        if you just close your
        mouth for me.
      

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.170



01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:27.000

        And then you can take that line
        a little bit above your
      

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.380

        own lip line, here,
        just to shape it.
      

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.980

        And you do a slight pout--


01:18:33.980 --> 01:18:35.230

        that's it--


01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:37.160



01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.580

        which helps to get the shape.


01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:44.670

        I'm finishing now with the
        blusher, taken at the sides.
      

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:46.950

        Can you suck your cheeks
        in for me please?
      

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:48.600

        That's it.


01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.770

        And shape them out to the bone,


01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:53.730

        lifting and giving highlight.


01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.180

        Right.


01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.270

        And then blending it up
        on to the temple.
      

01:18:58.270 --> 01:19:01.080

        Now what do you think of that?


01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.520

        I feel I looks like
        Jane Russell.

        So this is Fiona, our heroine.


01:19:19.890 --> 01:19:20.690

        Is that right?


01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:21.360

        Yes, it is.


01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.200

        Now what's different about
        leading lady makeup?
      

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:25.430

        What's special about that?


01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:27.880

        Well, what I've done here is
        instead of using any of the
      

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:32.480

        theatrical bases, I've put on a
        normal street base, and then
      

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.510

        I've added red to the color to
        make sure it is going to be of
      

01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:38.510

        a pinky tone.

        What, on the face?

        Yes.


01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:47.340

        And just blend it within the
        coloring so that you've
      

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:49.200

        completely worked around.


01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.770

        And do a lifting structure to
        the face itself, which is seen
      

01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:54.610

        as we blend it in.


01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:57.130

        Will she not just look hot?


01:19:57.130 --> 01:19:59.300

        No, because once you've actually
        powdered, it all
      

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:02.200

        settles in, because this is
        where I was saying how
      

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:07.700

        important it is to have the
        soft, pinky tones that work so

        well on the stage.


01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.700

        OK, now one of the things you
        can do after you put on the
      

01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:18.170

        base, is to use the corrective
        pencil underneath the eyes,
      

01:20:18.170 --> 01:20:23.250

        just to be able to take away
        any shadowing there.
      

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:29.100

        And also follow the nose to
        mouth line, and blend it away?
      

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.630

        Doesn't that make her look
        younger, though?
      

01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:32.250

        Yes.


01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:32.640

        Oh, I see.


01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.550

        That's the whole point.


01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:34.580

        Yes.


01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.770

        In terms of a leading lady, what
        one is planning to do in
      

01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:40.270

        a situation like this, is to do
        the very best to make her
      

01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:44.180

        look the best she can look.


01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:44.360

        Right.


01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:50.010

        So by doing this side and filing
        in your eyebrows, I
      

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:55.270

        think you find that it opens up
        your eyes and the attention
      

01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:56.690

        goes to the top part
        of your face.
      

01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:56.890

        Yes.


01:20:56.890 --> 01:20:58.310

        It's something I never
        considered doing, simply
      

01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:00.210

        because I have quite heavy
        eyebrows anyway.
      

01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:01.620

        To actually define
        them further I
      

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:02.680

        didn't think was necessary.

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:09.710

        Now, having put this line
        underneath your eye, just
      

01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:11.470

        going out in a straight way--


01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:16.200

        you now have a gap between the
        upper line and the lower line.
      

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.720

        So if you look just up at the
        ceiling, you can fill in with
      

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.870

        some light white to make a
        contrast, and therefore make

        the eyes look larger.

        Again, you can take the white,
        and go closely underneath
      

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:39.310

        towards the corner
        of your eye.
      

01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:42.960

        And much more of that is being
        used these days, than the red
      

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.190

        dot that used to go there.


01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:48.020

        Now, in this situation, I'm
        going to start by using a dark
      

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:51.760

        pencil to define your lips,
        to give them shape.
      

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:55.470

        And if you can just
        smile for me--
      

01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:56.030

        that's it.


01:21:56.030 --> 01:22:00.610

        Then it helps you to get a good
        definition of your mouth
      

01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:03.130

        while you're smiling.


01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:08.570

        And for the fill in,
        we'll use pink.
      

01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:11.770

        And just go through with that.


01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:13.610

        And if you'd like to turn your
        hea, there, just that little
      

01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:15.930

        bit that way-- that's fine.


01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.870

        And again, smile.


01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:24.420



01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:27.680

        Yes, keep smiling.


01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.200

        What it does, is it gives you a
        very strong base on which to
      

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.330

        apply the lipstick.


01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.940

        That's great.


01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.330

        And then you're done.


01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:35.580

        Beautiful.


01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:46.280



01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.290

        Now you look like good-natured,


01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:50.100

        genial sort of fellow.


01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.010

        What's Derry about
        to do to you?
      

01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:53.270

        I believe I'm going
        to be turned
      

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:54.750

        into a dastardly villain.


01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:55.270

        You are.


01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:59.110

        And a ruggedly dastardly
        villain, at that.
      

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:01.030

        So off we go.


01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:05.700

        We have quite a warm color on
        here, just to change the whole
      

01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:08.300

        of your skin tone.


01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:09.570

        Mediterranean villain?


01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:11.210

        Yeah, I have the feeling
        that's exactly what
      

01:23:11.210 --> 01:23:12.460

        it's going to be.


01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.350



01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:17.540

        Now close your eyes for me.


01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:18.790

        That's good.


01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:24.400



01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.820

        Have you played many
        villains before?
      

01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:30.140

        I think the first year we did
        the pantomime, I played the
      

01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.140

        evil flesh creep.


01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.510

        Basically, I was done up in
        green fluorescent paint.
      

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:40.060

        That was about the limit
        of the makeup job.
      

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.290

        Green fluorescent?


01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:44.770

        And I shouted a lot.


01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:47.230

        Now I think what we'll do, is
        we'll darken your mustache.
      

01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:50.500

        And for that, for speed, one of
        the fastest ways of doing
      

01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:54.590

        that is to just use the mascara
        wand to go over the
      

01:23:54.590 --> 01:24:00.220

        whole of the area, just to bring
        in the darkness there.
      

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:04.550

        And then it's another way,
        rather than using pencil, to
      

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.460

        darken existing eyebrows.


01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:09.860

        And in this case,
        I'm using black.
      

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.310

        OK.


01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:15.250

        Now I'm just finishing off
        by doing an eyeliner.
      

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:18.170

        Which again, is absolutely
        essential for stage.
      

01:24:18.170 --> 01:24:21.130

        Although if I were doing it for
        television, I would not
      

01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:23.340

        put the eyeliner on, just
        because it makes your eyes
      

01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:25.750

        look too nice.


01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:28.110

        And therefore not what we
        want from the villain.
      

01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:32.980

        Now I'm going to go on to
        putting stubble on your face.
      

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.790

        And what are you using
        there, to put on--
      

01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:37.130

        I'm using a stipple sponge--


01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:41.920

        what's known as a simple sponge,
        which is a very good
      

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.230

        way of getting the dots
        that a beard line
      

01:24:45.230 --> 01:24:47.450

        makes on to the skin.


01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:49.710

        Now, if you'd like to raise your
        face up a little bit, you
      

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:55.070

        can then go underneath and give
        a good, strong jaw line.
      

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:58.350

        Make sure it does
        get in there.
      

01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:03.250

        Now, what also helps making
        a villainous character, is
      

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:06.430

        making sure that the eyebrows
        are closer together.
      

01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:11.770

        It produces that distrusting
        look.
      

01:25:11.770 --> 01:25:15.330

        As well as having done a bit
        underneath the eyes to break
      

01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:22.080

        up the area there, so that it's
        a little bit grubbier in
      

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.570

        terms of the shadow
        that I used.
      

01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:29.890

        So finally, we'll end up with
        some powder, just to
      

01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:30.800

        finish it all off.


01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.250

        And I'll use quite a dark
        powder, just to set it.
      

01:25:33.250 --> 01:25:36.840



01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.160

        And just to go over the whole.


01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.880

        Would you look up for me?


01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.610

        It's interesting, Derry, that
        you actually haven't
      

01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:46.370

        overstated this at all, but
        it's still very effective.
      

01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:51.610

        Well, it's one of those things
        that less can often be more,
      

01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:52.800

        in terms of what you
        were saying.
      

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.780

        Just little things, but
        they will still read.
      

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.620

        There we go.


01:25:57.620 --> 01:26:02.970

        Now also just adding in that
        touch of lift to the eyebrow,
      

01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:08.920

        to make it slightly more
        villainous on both sides, does
      

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.330

        add in that detail
        of aggression.
      

01:26:12.330 --> 01:26:13.480

        That's better.


01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.830

        You see, I think that will
        give him the lift.
      

01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:19.680

        Do you feel slightly
        meaner now?
      

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:22.300

        Yes, can you complete the
        picture for us now, Malcolm,
      

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.070

        and look really mean.


01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:26.320

        Oh, yes.


01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:36.330



01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:40.650

        Iris, you're very brave to have
        offered yourself for this
      

01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:44.210

        task, this process.


01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:46.520

        Yes.


01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:48.010

        [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


01:26:48.010 --> 01:26:51.410

        Now, underneath that, just
        because with age you do get
      

01:26:51.410 --> 01:26:54.820

        the eyes is hollowing out--


01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:58.050

        I'm going to just come around
        here and demonstrate with a
      

01:26:58.050 --> 01:27:04.370

        bit of dark brown and end
        up circling the eye.
      

01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:10.060

        And going deep into the side
        of the eye there, to socket
      

01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.720

        it, because you're hitting all
        the areas we she would
      

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.090

        naturally age.


01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.670

        Sag.


01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:16.430

        Sorry.


01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:17.320

        No, that's OK.


01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.580

        The important one is going from
        the nose to the mouth
      

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:24.460

        line, and then from there,
        hitting the corners of the
      

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:27.820

        mouth because they
        tend to go down.
      

01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:29.170

        It is naturally on the face.


01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:33.380

        And then highlight it to
        make it stand out more.
      

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:36.420



01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:39.560

        Now to help on this side--


01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.250

        again, taking it around, under
        the eye, and pushing it in.
      

01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:46.790



01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:51.530

        And highlighting just in
        that area for bagging
      

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:52.780

        that you have there.


01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.610



01:27:56.610 --> 01:28:01.450

        And that gives a puffiness
        underneath the eye, with the
      

01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:03.360

        darkening there.


01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.050

        And then here at the side--


01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:08.700

        if you pull in your
        cheeks for me.
      

01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.000

        You just hit up--


01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.420

        I've got the wig
        on there, now--
      

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:16.300

        but you can do just by the
        cheekbone and under the
      

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:29.380

        cheekbone from the side, And
        again, lifting up with the
      

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.510

        highlighting on the cheekbone.


01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:37.070

        Now, for stage, you're not
        blending as much, because of
      

01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:39.260

        the fact of it reading
        from a long distance.
      

01:28:39.260 --> 01:28:42.890

        But you can just blend in--


01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:48.330

        just for the purposes of showing
        you here, for camera--
      

01:28:48.330 --> 01:28:52.600

        those effects so that they
        shadow the face.
      

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.810

        Now the other thing to
        concentrate on with aging, is
      

01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.820

        to make sure that you don't
        forget to do the
      

01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:02.040

        neck and age the neck.


01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.110

        And as I've done here, is to
        make the lips smaller and
      

01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:10.450

        thinner, because they do tend
        to lose their size.
      

01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:15.170

        And finish by blending and
        a touch of powder.
      

01:29:15.170 --> 01:29:16.420

        There we go.


01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:19.080



01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.470

        Just break that down.


01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:22.990

        There we are.


01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:26.020

        Iris, go on your pension.


01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:28.300

        How do you feel?


01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:29.550

        Old.


01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:31.670



01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:33.730

        Can you say that would
        really help you in
      

01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:35.170

        constructing your character?


01:29:35.170 --> 01:29:37.760

        I mean, if he went on
        stage with that?
      

01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.570

        Knowing that you
        look like that?
      

01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:39.910

        Oh, yes.


01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:40.850

        Definitely.


01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:42.000

        That would assist you.


01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:42.230

        Yes.


01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:45.900

        Always, I think, if you've
        got makeup like this.
      

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.680

        Let's see what happens when it
        all comes off, shall we?
      

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.440

        That would be nice.


01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.950

        We'll start with the wig.


01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:53.370

        All right.


01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:55.510

        We've got all of the-- you want
        to give me a hand just so
      

01:29:55.510 --> 01:29:56.290

        I don't pull.


01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:57.570

        There we go.


01:29:57.570 --> 01:29:59.020

        Right then, [? Iris, ?]
        we'll get this all
      

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:02.000

        off quickly for you.


01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.600

        You usually use cream.


01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:04.370

        What are you using?


01:30:04.370 --> 01:30:07.620

        I'm using baby wipes, would you
        believe, because it is one
      

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.880

        of the fastest, most effective
        ways of getting
      

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.480

        off the makeup quickly.


01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.050

        I'd never have thought
        of that.
      

01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:14.890

        Back to normal again.


01:30:14.890 --> 01:30:17.350

        Nice to have you back.


01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:19.500

        Thank you.


01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.750

        That's better.


01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:31.740



01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.930

        Now we come to, arguably, the
        favorite character in
      

01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:35.540

        pantomime--


01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:36.330

        the dame.


01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:37.520

        The dame.


01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:39.140

        You can have fun today, Derry.


01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.410

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:42.360

        What have you done so far?


01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:46.520

        So far, I've actually just put
        on a base, some powder, and
      

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.170

        some general rouging to bring
        up the colorful tone.
      

01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:50.320

        Right.


01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.230

        So it's quite pink.


01:30:51.230 --> 01:30:52.880

        It's quite pink, yes it is.


01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.850

        And you're going to
        go on next to?
      

01:30:54.850 --> 01:30:55.760

        The eyes.


01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.930

        I'm going to start
        to do those.
      

01:30:57.930 --> 01:31:04.340

        And we'll go on to what you call
        a very bright turquoise,
      

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.860

        to go with the pink wig.


01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.300

        Ever so fetching.


01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:13.430

        They should be the new
        colors for next year.
      

01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:16.380

        Now, if you don't have any
        lashes to hand-- and the
      

01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:18.600

        bigger and the sillier they are,
        the better they are for
      

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:19.370

        the dames--


01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:27.840

        then you can just do strokes of
        eyelashes onto an eye line
      

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.500

        to create the lash effect.


01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.630

        Is that blue or black?


01:31:32.630 --> 01:31:35.680

        This is black.


01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:37.640

        And doing small ones
        in between to
      

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:40.200

        fill spaces up there.


01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.660

        And it tickles.


01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:42.910

        And it tickles, does it?


01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:47.770



01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:50.500

        But then it takes
        up that space.
      

01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:51.760

        And then open your eyes.


01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.060

        And there we have
        some eyelashes.
      

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:59.030

        And now onto the big cheeks.


01:31:59.030 --> 01:32:01.240

        They're always essential.


01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.440

        Can you pull your cheeks
        in for me?
      

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.740

        That's it.


01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:09.110

        And taking them out and up.


01:32:09.110 --> 01:32:12.000

        Dick, you've played dame
        often, haven't you?
      

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.180

        Yes, indeed.


01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:16.870

        How does Derry's makeup on you
        today relate to what you
      

01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:18.240

        normally do?


01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:21.480

        Well, I'm very pleased to see
        she's got some thinner brushes
      

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.550

        than we're used to.


01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:25.000

        Because the the ones in the
        village usually have creosoted
      

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.380

        the odd bomb before we
        get down to this.
      

01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:31.070



01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:33.870

        Now on to the lips.


01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:37.410

        Over the top, pantomime lips.


01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:40.640



01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.020

        This is where I need
        the concentration.
      

01:32:42.020 --> 01:32:48.130



01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:50.890

        And of course, then we have
        the wig for the final bit.
      

01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:53.280

        Would you like to hold the front
        of that for me, as we
      

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.220

        just pull it down, being
        sure to just get it
      

01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.740

        over your ears there.


01:32:57.740 --> 01:32:59.190

        And again, on this side, there.


01:32:59.190 --> 01:32:59.960

        That's it.


01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:00.920

        OK.


01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:02.170

        And that's it, dear.


01:33:02.170 --> 01:33:14.220



01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:18.240

        And this is Lana, and Derry
        has a completely different
      

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.230

        exercise today.


01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:24.380

        You're going to turn her, not
        into a human being, but into--
      

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:25.110

        An animal.


01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:26.400

        --an animal.


01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.670

        And I'm not going to tell
        you which animal.
      

01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:28.920

        You have to guess that.


01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.790

        OK.


01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:35.010

        First we're going to have to
        take your hair up and away.
      

01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:38.480



01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.820

        And I'll just continue putting
        in the pink, and if you lift
      

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:44.390

        your head ever so slightly
        for me, Lana.
      

01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:46.030

        That's it.


01:33:46.030 --> 01:33:51.010

        And keep on tilting your head
        back and close your eyes.
      

01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:54.960

        And I can fill in this whole
        area, here, and match the
      

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.400

        other side.


01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.230

        Now the thing that has to be
        paid attention to here, is the
      

01:34:00.230 --> 01:34:04.150

        length of time it takes to
        block out the eyebrows,
      

01:34:04.150 --> 01:34:07.320

        because without them having been
        soaped, it does take a
      

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:12.590

        little time just to make them
        disappear entirely.
      

01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:16.660

        And now, the final bit here, on
        the eyes, is to just take
      

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:24.440

        the line underneath and across
        and out there before coming
      

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.690

        down onto the lips.


01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:29.570



01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:31.420

        And filling those in.


01:34:31.420 --> 01:34:33.260

        It's very sweet.


01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.860

        Have you used blue for
        a particular reason?
      

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:39.890

        It's actually a purply-blue, but
        the blue colors do tend to
      

01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:42.430

        read well on stage.


01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:44.800

        Would you not use black, ever?


01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.520

        You could use black and gray,
        and those would also read.
      

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.810

        But it's just I thought it was
        prettier to have pink.
      

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.420

        Yeah.


01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:55.120

        Like that.


01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.520

        And then going on to the pink.


01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:00.620

        Whiskers.


01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:03.490

        I think you might just
        have given us a
      

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:04.740

        rather large clue, there.


01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:07.680



01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.260

        Even if they are blue.


01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:12.080

        Even with the dots here.


01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.330

        What we're going for.


01:35:13.330 --> 01:35:15.160



01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.080

        One, two.


01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:20.150



01:35:20.150 --> 01:35:20.660

        There we are.


01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:23.100

        Now all we need are the ears.


01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.730



01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:29.450

        And secured into place.


01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.610

        And there you are.


01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:31.740

        Oh, yes.


01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.190

        Sweet.


01:35:32.190 --> 01:35:34.440

        I think I knew it was going
        to be a rabbit, but not a
      

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.690

        lop-eared bunny.


01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:46.180



01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:48.960

        Derry, that is some wig.


01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.020

        What are we doing here?


01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:54.950

        We're into the restoration
        period now, and so, basically,
      

01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:58.440

        because the ladies at that time
        made their faces pale to
      

01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.580

        be aristocratic, is the best
        way of putting it.
      

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:06.060

        And when they added all the
        hearts and the dots on their
      

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.830

        face, it was to give signals of
        whether they were free, or
      

01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:13.760

        what political party
        they belonged to.
      

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.910

        It was really quite interesting


01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:16.390

        makeup at the time.


01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:17.290

        Is that white?


01:36:17.290 --> 01:36:20.680

        This is a mixture of white and
        cream together, and applied
      

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.750

        with a sponge.


01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:23.150

        And water-based?


01:36:23.150 --> 01:36:24.790

        Yes it is.


01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:26.280

        Just for ease of application.


01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:29.010



01:36:29.010 --> 01:36:31.460

        And then what I do need to do
        is just go up to the wig
      

01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:34.140

        there, just make sure that--


01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:36.320

        quite often, as I said, it is
        unusual to put the wig on
      

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.450

        first, but as long as you make
        sure that you literally get
      

01:36:42.450 --> 01:36:45.260

        the makeup base right up to
        the edges there where the
      

01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:48.530

        hairline is, you
        should be fine.
      

01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:52.660

        And then again, down on the
        neck, to make sure that it
      

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.730

        goes to balance wherever
        the costume goes.
      

01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:57.250

        Right.


01:36:57.250 --> 01:37:01.280

        Now we're using the blue
        eyeshadow that they used
      

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.570

        during this renaissance time.


01:37:02.570 --> 01:37:05.480

        And this time it went
        right the way up
      

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.820

        to the eyebrow level.


01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:15.370

        So that is just applied right
        from the corner of the inside
      

01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:18.380

        of the eye and blended out.


01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:21.670

        Derry, do you know what they
        would have used in those days
      

01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:22.300

        for eyeshadow?


01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:24.940

        What it would have
        been made of?
      

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:25.920

        Or makeup at all?


01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.360

        Well, a lot of the makeup that
        they used-- they enameled
      

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:32.380

        their faces, and a lot of it
        contained lead, and it caused
      

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:35.020

        serious problems. But their
        vanity seemed to override it
      

01:37:35.020 --> 01:37:35.690

        at that time.


01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:37.270

        Enamel?


01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:39.540

        Yes, and they apparently
        went to Paris.
      

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:40.880

        But their skin couldn't
        breathe.
      

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.210

        Not, it couldn't, and that's why
        it was a rather fatal way
      

01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:46.180

        of looking beautiful.


01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:51.020

        Now, with the eyebrows, they
        were pretty exaggerated in
      

01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:55.240

        terms of the time of the
        restoration era.
      

01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:02.240

        Very dramatic, so we'll start
        off and build these into
      

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.340

        something quite substantial
        here, as Pauline's own
      

01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:11.650

        eyebrows are quite slim there.


01:38:11.650 --> 01:38:15.250

        Now just take another brush
        just to blend that
      

01:38:15.250 --> 01:38:16.880

        in and shape it.


01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:19.800



01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.950

        The strength of this was to go
        with the beauty spots and
      

01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:25.240

        everything's painted black.


01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.720

        Now, the men wore makeup,
        too, didn't they?
      

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.710

        Yes, but it was powder
        that they used.
      

01:38:29.710 --> 01:38:30.480

        Just powder?


01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:35.290

        Just powder, as opposed
        to the makeup that
      

01:38:35.290 --> 01:38:36.540

        the women were using.


01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.320



01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.900

        Using a powder puff on to the
        cheek sometimes really helps,
      

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.280

        because otherwise you're taking
        off makeup as you're
      

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.150

        putting it on your face.


01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:52.640

        So having that powder puff that
        you use yourself, to even
      

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.470

        put things on.


01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:55.000

        Whatever makeup you're doing.


01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.080

        Yes, whatever makeup you're
        doing, it does stop--
      

01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:01.720

        OK, now I'm just going to do a
        little heart, here, on your
      

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.490

        cheek, which they used
        to do, as I said,
      

01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:07.500

        to signal were free.


01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.640

        And just fill that in.


01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.600

        When you say free, do
        you mean available?
      

01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.850

        Available is the word, yes.


01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:17.690

        So just see how much of a
        shape I can get there.
      

01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:19.070

        There we go.


01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:23.380

        There's a whole subtext going
        on with these characters,
      

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:23.650

        isn't there?


01:39:23.650 --> 01:39:26.150

        What with what the
        face is saying
      

01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:28.310

        and they're fan language.


01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:29.880

        All of that that they had--


01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.780

        a very interesting period.


01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.630

        Just there on the point.


01:39:34.630 --> 01:39:37.240

        It's quite outrageous,
        as you would say.
      

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.750

        And this is just finishing off
        the lips with this cupid
      

01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:44.720

        shape, with the lips
        close together.
      

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.970

        And then, you are done.


01:39:47.970 --> 01:39:51.160

        Now that is a restoration
        lady for the stage.
      

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.550

        Oh, yes.


01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:55.150

        All ready for a romantic night
        in with the Scarlet Pimpernel.
      

01:39:55.150 --> 01:40:06.470



01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:09.770

        Now Derry, we're getting into
        heavy character makeup here,
      

01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:10.800

        by the look of it.


01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.040

        You're whitewashing Helen.


01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:13.390

        What exactly are you doing?


01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:15.900

        I'm turning Helen into
        a Geisha girl.
      

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:16.750

        A geisha girl.


01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:17.630

        Yeah, a geisha girl.


01:40:17.630 --> 01:40:18.050

        Oh, wonderful.


01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:21.530

        A traditional, Japanese
        Mikado lady.
      

01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:22.490

        Absolutely.


01:40:22.490 --> 01:40:25.170

        So we're starting off with
        the completely and
      

01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:26.860

        utterly white face.


01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.170

        Right.


01:40:27.170 --> 01:40:28.770

        Is that the best way to cover?


01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:30.400

        With a great brush like that?


01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.670

        Well, it's the fastest
        way of covering, yes.
      

01:40:32.670 --> 01:40:37.170

        And you can get a, hopefully,
        very even finish as a result
      

01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:42.990

        of using it with a brush and
        adding water to the pancake.
      

01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.430

        Wonderful.


01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:45.840

        Have you done anything to
        her eyebrows, other
      

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:46.630

        than paint them out?


01:40:46.630 --> 01:40:46.810

        No.


01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:48.980

        At the moment all I've
        done is just go over
      

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:50.270

        them with the white.


01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:52.900

        And what I must remember
        to do is the is the
      

01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:54.560

        ears and the neck.


01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:56.220

        That's a water-based makeup
        you're using, isnt it?
      

01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.700

        Yes, this particular
        one is water-based.
      

01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.720

        Does it go stiff
        when it dries?
      

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.700

        No, it doesn't, actually.


01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:04.090

        They seem to have perfected
        them, so it just
      

01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:06.290

        gives perfect coverage.


01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:08.570

        I guess it being water-based,
        the skin can still
      

01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:10.740

        breathe, can't it?


01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:12.180

        So she shouldn't get too
        hot under there.
      

01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:15.600

        No, she won't get hot, and
        it does stay well.
      

01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.620

        But you do have to get it on
        quite quickly, so that
      

01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:21.460

        it all evens out.


01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:23.450

        Now, is this traditional
        makeup?
      

01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:26.580

        Is this how the Japanese would
        do it when they're dressing up
      

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.850

        as Kabuki women?


01:41:28.850 --> 01:41:32.100

        Yes, this is taken from the
        actual, authentic, style of
      

01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:34.400

        the geisha girl.


01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.110

        Now, Derry, what's
        all the pink for?
      

01:41:37.110 --> 01:41:38.220

        What does that signify?


01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:40.590

        That signifies a high-class
        geisha.
      

01:41:40.590 --> 01:41:41.980

        Oh, really?


01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.390

        So lower class doesn't
        have pink.
      

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.760

        Right.


01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.510

        So it would just be
        completely white.
      

01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:47.470

        Yes.


01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:51.400

        But this is to suggest the
        high-class geisha, on either
      

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:52.970

        side of the nose.


01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:55.410

        In terms of doing
        the eyebrows--
      

01:41:55.410 --> 01:41:58.150

        this is coming from the research
        one has done to look
      

01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:01.440

        at how the geisha girls make
        themselves up and to
      

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.160

        authenticate it, in terms of
        reproducing the makeup.
      

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:04.830

        Yes.


01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:08.130

        Gosh, doesn't that make a
        difference straight away?
      

01:42:08.130 --> 01:42:09.350

        And that short?


01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:11.450

        Yes.


01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:15.320

        And then we'll balance it up
        on the other side, here.
      

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.820

        And now the special
        geisha lips, which
      

01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:21.190

        are very cupid like.


01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:24.260

        So therefore, I'm going
        from the inside
      

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:27.560

        of Helen's lip shape.


01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:34.100

        And filling in with lipstick
        color, which is an extremely
      

01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:36.440

        bright red.


01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:38.470

        Which makes a very
        dramatic look.
      

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:40.010

        That's beautiful.


01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:42.340

        She looks rather like
        a doll, now.
      

01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:42.610

        Yes.


01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:44.330

        I think, absolutely, that's why
        they've always felt the
      

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:49.990

        geisha's very doll-like.


01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:54.170

        And I think then, once we put
        the wig on, you really see.
      

01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:56.890

        It helps, too, with Helen having
        dark eyes, doesn't it?
      

01:42:56.890 --> 01:43:00.100

        Yes, and do you see how it
        centerizes the mouth to be so
      

01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.330

        small there?


01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:04.480

        And then, even without putting
        the wig on, if you hold, you
      

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:05.780

        can start to see how--


01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:09.710

        if I took the face-- if you just
        turn that way, and then
      

01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:11.360

        you can see.


01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.390

        OK, now put the wig on,
        just as the final bit.
      

01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:16.730

        So if you'd like to hold the
        front of the wig, there, for
      

01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:19.680

        me, and pull it down
        at the front, as I
      

01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.620

        pull down at the back.


01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:21.850

        That's it.


01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:22.870

        And then--


01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:27.440

        OK, relax your hands as I adjust
        you ears into that, and
      

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:28.400

        pull it out.


01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:31.040

        And then the other side out.


01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:36.280

        And pull this back,
        to get the shape.
      

01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:38.150

        And then you start to get
        the whole feeling.
      

01:43:38.150 --> 01:43:40.520

        Now, what they would
        have is lots of
      

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.370

        decoration within the hair.


01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:44.340

        So I'll put those in
        here in the back.
      

01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.360

        Oh, that's wonderful.


01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.480

        And what she's got in
        her hair? are they--
      

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:49.290

        [INTERPOSING VOICES]


01:43:49.290 --> 01:43:52.170

        No, they're a couple of pencils
        used to look like
      

01:43:52.170 --> 01:43:55.270

        chopsticks, just as you have
        some kind of dressing.
      

01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:57.700

        But as, indeed, when you mix
        with the wardrobe, then you've
      

01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:00.930

        got all the various finishing
        bits to add to that wig.
      

01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:01.280

        Wonderful.


01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.530

        There you go.


01:44:02.530 --> 01:44:12.860



01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:17.620

        If you just put some wax through
        your hair, just to be
      

01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:19.410

        able to start getting
        the period hairdo
      

01:44:19.410 --> 01:44:20.960

        for a leading man.


01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:22.760

        And which period are
        you doing, Derry?
      

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:23.660

        What are you going to create?


01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:25.390

        An Edwardian man.


01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:26.030

        Oh, wonderful.


01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:27.490

        An Edwardian leading man.


01:44:27.490 --> 01:44:32.150

        So what we need to do here, is
        to just get a middle parting.
      

01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:35.020

        So if we take it from the top
        of the nose and go right the
      

01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:39.570

        way through, then hopefully,
        we will be able to
      

01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:41.380

        separate that out.


01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:44.480

        And do the other side, here.


01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:46.310

        And have a starting point.


01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:49.740



01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:53.810

        And then we can sort of roll it
        a bit to see if we can get
      

01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:58.950

        it to stay flatter, just by
        pushing with the hands.
      

01:44:58.950 --> 01:45:00.370

        That's better.


01:45:00.370 --> 01:45:02.640

        He's looking nice
        and glowy now.
      

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:03.110

        Yes.


01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:06.790

        But this does hold very well for
        the length and duration of
      

01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:08.310

        the performance.


01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:10.710

        And again, this is just taking--
        as with all makeups--
      

01:45:10.710 --> 01:45:15.410

        down the neck, and just
        blend it away.
      

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:17.930

        And again, across the ears.


01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:19.200

        It looks quite healthy.


01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:20.090

        Tan, isn't is?


01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.500

        It is.


01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:22.300

        Will it look like
        that on stage?
      

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:23.430

        No.


01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:26.610

        It will look like a natural
        color on stage.
      

01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:29.770

        But that is, it's quite
        warm there.
      

01:45:29.770 --> 01:45:32.720

        It looks like the sort of makeup
        that you might have
      

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.420

        footlights for, for melodrama.


01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:35.810

        Yes.


01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:37.070

        Would that be right?


01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:39.240

        Yes.


01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:44.300

        And also, as I said, you'd be
        able to register this right
      

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:47.000

        from the back of the audience,
        with all that.
      

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.400

        What I've done just now, is to
        add some more water, so that I
      

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:52.210

        can put it on to this man.


01:45:52.210 --> 01:45:53.300

        Just gently close your eyes.


01:45:53.300 --> 01:45:54.600

        That's it.


01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:55.440

        That's it.


01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:59.710

        So that he can literally
        be able to blend it
      

01:45:59.710 --> 01:46:01.280

        right into the skin.


01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:03.870

        That's taken off some of the
        heaviness, hasn't it?
      

01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:05.400

        It has.


01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.050

        When you literally have been
        heavy-handed, the way to do
      

01:46:10.050 --> 01:46:13.320

        it, is to just add more water
        onto the sponge and blend.
      

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.770

        Now, normally, one does wear
        protection when you're putting
      

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.680

        on spirit gum, so that
        it doesn't go
      

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:19.980

        all over your clothes.


01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:24.210

        But a very good way for it to be
        a preparation for applying
      

01:46:24.210 --> 01:46:29.710

        the mustache, is to apply one
        layer of the spirit gum to the
      

01:46:29.710 --> 01:46:31.290

        top of the upper lip.


01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:35.110

        And then, with your finger,
        literally break up the spirit
      

01:46:35.110 --> 01:46:38.090

        gum so it gets very,
        very tack.
      

01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:41.040

        And it's extremely
        tacky, and you're
      

01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:43.630

        pulling away, like that.


01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:46.600

        You know that the spirit gum
        is then ready for the
      

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.560

        application of putting
        on the mustache.
      

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.590

        And it also takes off the amount
        of shine, as well as
      

01:46:54.590 --> 01:46:56.830

        anchors it.


01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:59.740

        And it really does stick.


01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.220

        OK.


01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.190

        Oh, yes.


01:47:03.190 --> 01:47:05.180

        I say, that's a good mustache.


01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:06.410

        A little party.


01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:07.660

        [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:09.870



01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:11.080

        All right.


01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.320

        Instant character.


01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:13.570

        An instant character.


01:47:13.570 --> 01:47:23.530



01:47:23.530 --> 01:47:26.050

        Your special task, this morning,
        I understand, is to
      

01:47:26.050 --> 01:47:27.820

        turn Kate into a wicked witch.


01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:28.490

        It is, indeed.


01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:31.420

        And I'm going to start by
        putting a black cape around
      

01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:34.590

        Kate to get her into the mood.


01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:35.840

        And just put a clip
        in the back, here.
      

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.500



01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:43.220

        And start off by taking the
        corner of her eyebrow away,
      

01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:47.240

        just here, and soaping
        it away.
      

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.340

        That's a bar of soap, is it?


01:47:48.340 --> 01:47:51.690

        It's a bar of soap, and it's
        been sitting in water to
      

01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:55.860

        moisten it up, and this way you
        can take away the latter
      

01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:58.500

        eyebrows to be able to
        get a sharper line.
      

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.270

        And you can make up over
        that, can you?
      

01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:01.090

        I can, indeed.


01:48:01.090 --> 01:48:03.650

        You just have to allow
        that to dry.
      

01:48:03.650 --> 01:48:03.980

        OK.


01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:09.830

        And now we go on to applying
        the green.
      

01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:12.250

        The whole process of turning
        into a wicked witch.
      

01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:14.600

        And that's on a sponge,
        and that's
      

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:16.030

        water-based makeup, is it?


01:48:16.030 --> 01:48:18.770

        No, this is a grease
        that I'm using.
      

01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:21.460

        So just to give variety
        withing the different
      

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.580

        demonstrations of makeup, this
        is a palette of grease.
      

01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:30.930

        And just a mixture of green and
        white together, just to
      

01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:39.690

        get more subtle shades, which
        will be the foundation to
      

01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:42.410

        apply to the whole
        of the face.
      

01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:44.810

        A little bit more
        coverage, there.
      

01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:46.800

        Why green, I wonder?


01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.300

        I don't know why it's always
        been associated, but you never
      

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:52.690

        do seem to see witches as any
        other color other than green.
      

01:48:52.690 --> 01:48:55.400

        And the black wigs, and
        the black peaked hats.
      

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.910

        Perhaps they're very
        jealous people.
      

01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:59.170

        Yes, I think they
        must be that.
      

01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:01.040

        Definitely.


01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:07.950

        Again, as with every makeup,
        ears and neck are important.
      

01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:09.490

        Yeah, we always forget
        our ears.
      

01:49:09.490 --> 01:49:11.110

        You always forget?


01:49:11.110 --> 01:49:13.400

        They are part of the face, and
        it's just one of these things
      

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.580

        that often on stage what
        you go get is a
      

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:19.000

        reddening that occurs.


01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.660

        If you don't put the makeup on,
        they will stand out more.
      

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:28.440

        And also just on the
        inside, there.
      

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:31.760

        One thing about doing eyebrows,
        is that with the
      

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:33.790

        wicked witch, they are evil.


01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:39.780

        And so you get that whole
        feeling of going up and across
      

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.100

        there, to give that evil,
        menacing look.
      

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:52.020

        And just going and strengthening
        that line.
      

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:54.200

        There we are.


01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:55.960

        Just in the evilness of it.


01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.390

        Oh, a nasty woman.


01:49:59.390 --> 01:50:04.420

        Now, by closing your eyes, we'll
        then go onto the eyes.
      

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:10.040

        And get an evilness again, by
        taking them out and being very
      

01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.280

        dramatic there.


01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:18.000

        And it's just taking all the
        lines out and above, and
      

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.260

        filling that in with dark.


01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.390

        It's like a bat wing.


01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:24.680

        It is like a bat wing.


01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:30.330

        I think it's just that whole
        idea of being evil .
      

01:50:30.330 --> 01:50:33.750

        And the most important thing is
        that having added the red
      

01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:36.030

        underneath, which again
        gives that really
      

01:50:36.030 --> 01:50:37.440

        evil note about it.


01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:41.490



01:50:41.490 --> 01:50:44.470

        Now, can you smile for me?


01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:45.790

        No.


01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:48.570

        Because then you can take
        that line, and follow
      

01:50:48.570 --> 01:50:50.540

        that line out to there.


01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.350

        And just tip it down
        at the edges,
      

01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:56.690

        because it makes it meaner.


01:50:56.690 --> 01:50:57.750

        All right?


01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:59.840

        And then start in the
        middle of the bottom
      

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:02.140

        lip and work outwardly.


01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:05.770

        And again, you can take
        that line and go down.
      

01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:09.160

        And you can add a touch of
        carmine to that, as well, so
      

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.860

        it gives it a stronger tone.


01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:18.580

        You can see how that dark mixed
        with the black really
      

01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.470

        makes it more hag-like.


01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:24.660

        There are loads of areas you
        can fill in, in terms of
      

01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:27.270

        witches, if you want to-- which
        is nose to mouth and
      

01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:28.310

        even further down.


01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:32.200

        But in a way, the simpler you
        make it, the better and more
      

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:33.510

        striking it'll be.


01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:35.730

        And pull in even tighter.


01:51:35.730 --> 01:51:40.770

        You can make that really
        quite a strong line.
      

01:51:40.770 --> 01:51:42.220

        OK.


01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:45.450

        And for the stage, you've
        centered it and
      

01:51:45.450 --> 01:51:47.470

        narrowed your face.


01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:50.300

        Again, pulling for the side--


01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:51.980

        and take it even into there.


01:51:51.980 --> 01:51:56.060

        With a wig, you should have
        quite a wicked witch.
      

01:51:56.060 --> 01:52:00.070

        Now finally, you just ad that
        line for stage, underneath the
      

01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:01.920

        eye, there.


01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:04.230

        With a wig on, you
        are the witch.
      

01:52:04.230 --> 01:52:06.270

        Do you feel evil enough?


01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:07.520

        Very evil.


01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:17.390



01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:21.070

        Derry, our subject today
        is illness, and
      

01:52:21.070 --> 01:52:21.990

        your victim is Warrick.


01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.500

        It is.


01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:22.690

        Right.


01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:24.840

        Looking very well, I must say.


01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:28.180

        He is, indeed, but
        not for long.
      

01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:29.430

        What are you planning
        to do to him?
      

01:52:29.430 --> 01:52:32.770

        Well, basically, to bring about
        illness, you need to
      

01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:36.030

        make sure that a person's pallor
        does go really quite
      

01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:37.950

        sallow and quite pale.


01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:41.810

        And so the first thing with
        making somebody look unwell,
      

01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:43.210

        is to get that pallor.


01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:44.940

        And is this for all
        kinds of illness?
      

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.260

        It is, actually, because
        in most situations--
      

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:50.530

        most, I will say--


01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:53.110

        you've got the pallor
        having lost color.
      

01:52:53.110 --> 01:52:54.800

        There are a few conditions
        where it
      

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.350

        would do the opposite.


01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:59.070

        But when you've got to get
        specific about illness, it's
      

01:52:59.070 --> 01:53:02.110

        very good to go and make sure
        you've done your research with
      

01:53:02.110 --> 01:53:04.580

        those illnesses on
        the first place.
      

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:08.170

        But for general unwell, then
        you are dealing with pale.
      

01:53:08.170 --> 01:53:08.580

        Right.


01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:09.890

        So what are you putting
        on him now?
      

01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:17.050

        I'm putting up a bluey-gray
        pancake, with a very soft,
      

01:53:17.050 --> 01:53:21.360

        creamy color, as well, just
        to bring his tone down.
      

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.750

        And as you can see, it's already
        making him really
      

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:25.800

        quite pale.


01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:29.820

        Now, so, we'll just finish off
        this bit here, having gone
      

01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:32.300

        over your ears and your neck.


01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:35.990

        And then we move on to the next
        stage of putting in some
      

01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:38.410

        darkening under your eyes.


01:53:38.410 --> 01:53:44.420

        So you start-- and you go quite
        low down, just to socket
      

01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:47.610

        them and blend that away.


01:53:47.610 --> 01:53:52.920

        Then you come over to the other
        eye, and do the same, by
      

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:57.110

        going deeply into the socket
        line underneath the eye.
      

01:53:57.110 --> 01:54:01.010

        And again, on the side of
        the bridge of the nose.
      

01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:04.950

        I do quite a lot of darkening in
        that area, just to make the
      

01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:09.370

        eyes recess and to feel tired.


01:54:09.370 --> 01:54:10.620

        There we go.


01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:15.820



01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:20.280

        Now at that particular stage,
        you add in more of a common
      

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.020

        color for the slight swollenness
        of eyes.
      

01:54:24.020 --> 01:54:25.240

        Looking right up for me.


01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:30.700

        And you take that right into the
        lashes, which also defines
      

01:54:30.700 --> 01:54:35.730

        the eyes, and you take that down
        and add that color in.
      

01:54:35.730 --> 01:54:39.900

        Again, mixing colors is
        a good idea, here.
      

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:43.010

        And definitely gives that
        sign of not being well.
      

01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:46.880



01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:48.440

        Now we're coming to
        the other side.
      

01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:49.520

        What we've been doing--


01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.610

        is if you look--


01:54:50.610 --> 01:54:56.210

        is bringing your face, in a very
        slim way, down this side.
      

01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:58.410

        And the other side of your face,
        at the moment, is very
      

01:54:58.410 --> 01:54:59.620

        much wider.


01:54:59.620 --> 01:55:02.040

        So if you turn you
        head, there.
      

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:05.050

        So the whole idea is
        to slim down the
      

01:55:05.050 --> 01:55:06.370

        face, in terms of illness.


01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:08.130

        To make it look drawn,
        to make it look
      

01:55:08.130 --> 01:55:09.960

        tired, so it registers.


01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:12.810

        Well-being is far wider.


01:55:12.810 --> 01:55:13.660

        OK.


01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.730

        So then, we will match this
        side to that effect.
      

01:55:17.730 --> 01:55:20.170

        Warrick, do you want
        to lie down?
      

01:55:20.170 --> 01:55:20.890

        How do you feel?


01:55:20.890 --> 01:55:24.240

        How does it make you feel,
        looking like you do?
      

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.030

        Actually, it makes me
        feel quite ill.
      

01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:27.150

        It really helps, then?


01:55:27.150 --> 01:55:30.230

        Yes, it does.


01:55:30.230 --> 01:55:33.770

        And would you say that was
        general for makeup, when
      

01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:36.620

        you've made up in the past
        for productions?
      

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:39.030

        Is that all part of your
        character going on?
      

01:55:39.030 --> 01:55:40.080

        Yes.


01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:43.480

        It makes up about 30% of
        the character, I feel.
      

01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:44.300

        Really?


01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:46.610

        So it's quite important
        that you get it right.
      

01:55:46.610 --> 01:55:47.860

        Yes.


01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:57.840



01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:02.090

        Now, for horror makeup, is there
        any makeup basic that
      

01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:03.660

        you would do for
        all characters?
      

01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:07.630

        So for the horror, you have a
        pale base, angled face, and
      

01:56:07.630 --> 01:56:09.980

        those tend to work in
        most instances.
      

01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:13.080

        So you're using sharp
        features.
      

01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:16.110

        Just as I have done here, in
        demonstrating for Dracula, in
      

01:56:16.110 --> 01:56:18.920

        doing the widow's peak
        and joining it in.
      

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:22.020

        Now, I've already gelled his
        hair, darkened the top of it
      

01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:25.590

        with some pancake, because of
        it being available, and then
      

01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:28.760

        use the same thing for doing
        the widow's peak.
      

01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:31.830

        Now I'm going to move
        on and do the sides.
      

01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:34.850

        So that you, again,
        do sharp lines.
      

01:56:34.850 --> 01:56:36.310

        Give him a sense of meanness.


01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:37.710

        And a sense of meanness.


01:56:37.710 --> 01:56:38.550

        Absolutely right.


01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:42.550

        So that it's exaggerated
        and brought out.
      

01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:44.460

        And then blend it back
        in to the hair.
      

01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:48.040

        But it's very simple, and
        it's very effective.
      

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:51.000

        So you really don't have to
        spend a lot of money.
      

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.900

        The pancake has been
        able to darken the
      

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:54.830

        hair at the same time.


01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:56.420

        But you can use black sprays.


01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:59.970

        That also is quite easy to do.


01:56:59.970 --> 01:57:02.710

        OK, and I'm demonstrating the
        eyebrow, and this one you
      

01:57:02.710 --> 01:57:06.280

        really can be quite dramatic by
        making an absolute peak up
      

01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:08.640

        here, as well, and filling in.


01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:12.050



01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:16.000

        And taking them out to the
        outside, and exaggerating it.
      

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.560



01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:25.540

        Now again, for Dracula, doing
        some carmine inside the eye
      

01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:30.260

        makes it extremely evil.


01:57:30.260 --> 01:57:34.010

        And that can just be painted
        very gently.
      

01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:38.200

        And because it's grease, it
        won't do any harm, but it
      

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.920

        certainly makes the
        eyes bloodshot.
      

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:43.750

        So it's a deep red grease
        you've got there.
      

01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:44.870

        It's a deep red grease.


01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:45.750

        There we are.


01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:47.340

        Ooh, yes.


01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.730

        And it's mean.


01:57:49.730 --> 01:57:50.730

        OK.


01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:55.120

        Now we then move on to
        using gray around the
      

01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:57.150

        eye, socketing it.


01:57:57.150 --> 01:58:02.140

        Just use it inside and blend,
        leaving quite a lot of the
      

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:06.820

        white to give you that depth.


01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:08.800

        Because again, this
        is a pale makeup.
      

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:11.610

        Derry, would you encourage
        people to--
      

01:58:11.610 --> 01:58:12.400

        Close your eyes.


01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:15.290

        --invest in decent brushes
        for this kind of work?
      

01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:17.130

        You don't have to spend a
        great deal of money, but
      

01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:19.380

        definitely do invest
        in brushes.
      

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:22.600

        Because they can help speed
        up things in terms of your
      

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:23.740

        ability to apply it.


01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:28.620

        And this just creates
        a moody look.
      

01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:34.190

        You can add even darker, so that
        it really registers, but
      

01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:37.020

        you can get the whole mood
        and sense of it.
      

01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:40.700

        You can also carry that down
        the side of the nose, just
      

01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:42.360

        gently and shadowing.


01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:44.580

        That will elongate his
        nose, won't it?
      

01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:45.870

        Yes.


01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:50.480

        Again, it just defines the
        features of the face when
      

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:55.280

        you're on stage, to be able
        to see it from a distance.
      

01:58:55.280 --> 01:59:00.140

        You can use that quite strongly,
        there, and then
      

01:59:00.140 --> 01:59:02.730

        blend it down the side.


01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:04.300

        There we are.


01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:07.660

        Now we're going to go on to the
        lips, and these I'm going
      

01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:13.320

        to define in a dark gray, and
        make it really quite sharp
      

01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:18.900

        again, to pick up all the points
        that I have with the
      

01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.620

        rest of the makeup.


01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:23.360

        And actually, I think I'm going
        to add a touch of black
      

01:59:23.360 --> 01:59:26.440

        into to that, as well, just
        to strengthen that up.
      

01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:31.570

        And again, the points
        do make it mean.
      

01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:36.580



01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:43.400

        And start again from the middle,
        and carry it around
      

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:45.420

        the side, there, and
        then fill in.
      

01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:57.710



01:59:57.710 --> 02:00:00.400

        That has a stunning effect,
        doesn't it?
      

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:04.580

        It is a very sharp look,
        and powerful, in terms
      

02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.280

        of being able to--


02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:08.390

        the mouth is actually,
        at the moment,
      

02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:09.850

        looking still quite happy.


02:00:09.850 --> 02:00:14.900

        You could probably, with just a
        few strokes, take it out, so
      

02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:19.880

        that it became slightly more
        sinister on its edges.
      

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:24.070

        And perhaps just straighten that
        line to there to make it
      

02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:25.400

        slightly meaner.


02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:28.220

        Jonathan, do you recognize
        yourself?
      

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:28.910

        No.

        trickle of blood.

        And there you have a Dracula.

        Ahh.


02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.770

        Brilliant.


02:00:37.770 --> 02:00:47.830



02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:49.610

        Well, no prizes for
        guessing your
      

02:00:49.610 --> 02:00:51.530

        subject matter this morning.


02:00:51.530 --> 02:00:53.060

        We're doing clowns, aren't we?


02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:56.500

        And I see you've started much
        the same way you began with
      

02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:58.740

        the geisha girl and
        the restoration--

        with a white face.


02:01:01.190 --> 02:01:03.730

        And was that the same
        technique--
      

02:01:03.730 --> 02:01:08.020

        the water-based white makeup
        put on with a sponge?
      

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:08.700

        Is that right?


02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:11.260

        Yes, I've put it on
        with a sponge.
      

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:13.570

        And you can have a great deal
        of fun, I should think, with
      

02:01:13.570 --> 02:01:15.080

        colors and designs.


02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.100

        Well, this one is.


02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:19.160

        This is definitely where
        you can really play.
      

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:19.530

        Lovely.


02:01:19.530 --> 02:01:22.400

        Add just add in whatever
        colors you like.
      

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.570

        I like the way you've
        done the eyes.
      

02:01:23.570 --> 02:01:26.710

        Is it like two windows
        there, with shutters?
      

02:01:26.710 --> 02:01:26.920

        Yes.


02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:29.000

        And I just thought, because it's
        a bright red wig that's
      

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.650

        going on, that we needed to add
        in as many bright colors
      

02:01:31.650 --> 02:01:33.030

        as we could.


02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.860

        Lovely.


02:01:33.860 --> 02:01:35.410

        Is this going to be a happy
        clown or a sad clown?
      

02:01:35.410 --> 02:01:38.740

        This is, indeed, going
        to be a happy clown.
      

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:42.200

        Now just filling in
        with the yellow.
      

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:44.170

        Did you soap out the eyebrows
        first one this one?
      

02:01:44.170 --> 02:01:45.250

        No, I didn't.


02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:46.820

        We were doing this one
        quite quickly.
      

02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.880

        What you should do is soap out
        the eyebrows entirely.
      

02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:51.870

        And this is the difference,
        because otherwise they will
      

02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:52.310

        read through.


02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:55.890

        But if you use the soap, they
        disappear entirely.
      

02:01:55.890 --> 02:01:58.420

        But Sarah's don't seem to be
        particularly dark, so it's
      

02:01:58.420 --> 02:01:59.300

        working well.


02:01:59.300 --> 02:01:59.600

        Yeah.


02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.990

        But the thicker the eyebrows,
        the more important it is to
      

02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:03.530

        soap them, definitely.


02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:05.760

        Now, let's see.


02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:09.770

        Just take that across,
        and fill that in.
      

02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:10.940

        Now you just put--


02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:14.110

        a line --you've made the mark of
        where the nose will go, you
      

02:02:14.110 --> 02:02:18.200

        put the touch of the glue.


02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:19.510

        Is that spirit gum again?


02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:20.650

        That's spirit gum.


02:02:20.650 --> 02:02:26.380

        You can actually use eyelash
        glue, Copydex--
      

02:02:26.380 --> 02:02:26.940

        Copydex?


02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:27.470

        Yes.


02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:28.740

        Yes, you can actually.


02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.860

        The all-purpose glue.


02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:33.900

        But in this case, we're just
        going to use the spirit gum.
      

02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:36.830

        And then again, just allow that
        to dry that little bit so
      

02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:38.060

        it's slightly tacky.


02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:40.270

        And in this case, I'm waving
        it rather than interfering
      

02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:42.610

        with the white makeup.


02:02:42.610 --> 02:02:49.240

        And then just presenting it
        carefully, so that it goes on
      

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:52.210

        in that space.


02:02:52.210 --> 02:02:53.650

        And then with a--

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:58.920

        -- just while we're allowing
        that to dry.
      

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:01.310

        And you can then go over it
        with some red around it.
      

02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:05.650

        And here I'll use a pencil
        to get the shape.
      

02:03:05.650 --> 02:03:07.390

        We could be happy.


02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:12.950

        So I'm going to go
        really quite out.
      

02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:15.050

        That's quite high
        up, isn't it?
      

02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:19.240

        Yes, definitely going up the
        sides here to get that happy--
      

02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.800

        Is that just a lip pencil?


02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:22.330

        Yes.


02:03:22.330 --> 02:03:27.680

        Just to give yourself the shape,
        and then you fill in.
      

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:28.430

        Here we go.


02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:29.160

        Then we'll fill that in.


02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.950

        Sarah, what's it like breathing
        through that nose?
      

02:03:30.950 --> 02:03:33.590

        It's quite difficult
        and rather odd.
      

02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:35.620

        You've got a little bit there.


02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:37.780

        OK.


02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:40.690

        Now we just finish completing
        the mouth.
      

02:03:40.690 --> 02:03:44.260

        You can get more complex and
        add in loads more color.
      

02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:49.440

        You can take a turquoise line
        around the mouth, but I think
      

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.540

        this still would suffice
        and work on stage.
      

02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:55.480

        Just keeping it simple.


02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.420

        There we go.


02:03:57.420 --> 02:03:59.770

        Wonderful.


02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:04.500

        The last thing to go on
        is, indeed, the wig.
      

02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:07.540

        Now in this case, it's probably
        worth putting on a
      

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.540

        stocking top, because you
        lose all of your hair

        underneath that, OK?


02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:12.940

        But just because of speed and
        everything else, we're putting

        it on quickly.


02:04:13.690 --> 02:04:15.690

        head back.

        Hold the wig at the
        front for me.
      

02:04:18.760 --> 02:04:22.140

        And then we can pull it
        on over your ears.

        Yes, I do.
