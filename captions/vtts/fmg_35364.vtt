00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
MARCH 8th, 2005.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'M CHRIS BURY.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
THIS IS "NIGHTLINE."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
TONIGHT, WE ENTER THE WORLD OF

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.000
BLOGS.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
THEY UNDERCUT DAN RATHER'S

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
REPORTING AT CBS NEWS.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
CBS NEWS DEEPLY REGRETS IT.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
CAUSED A SENIOR NEWS

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
EXECUTIVE TO RESIGN.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
ON THE RECORD, OFF THE

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
RECORD.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
IT'S NOT A RULE.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
IT'S A COURTESY YOU EXTEND.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
AND EXPOSED A RIGHT WING

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
IMPOSTER IN THE WHITE HOUSE

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.000
PRESS CORPS.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO WORK

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIVORCED

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
THEMSELVES FROM REALITY?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
WHO ARE THEY?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
WHERE DO THEY GET THEIR CLOUT?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
THE 24-HOUR NEWS CYCLE ISN'T

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
WALTER CRONKITE ANYMORE.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
IT'S A BRAWL.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
IF YOU'RE GOING TO ENTER THE

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
BRAWL, YOU BLOODY MY NOSE, I'M

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
GOING TO BLOODY YOURS.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
NEW RULES OR NO RULES?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
LIKE ADOLESCENTS EVERYWHERE,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
FLEDGLING FORMS OF THE MEDIA

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
MUST UNDERGO CERTAIN RITES OF

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
PASSAGE BEFORE THEY'RE TAKEN

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.000
SERIOUSLY.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
BANNED TELEVISION CAMERAS FROM

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
PRESS CONFERENCES, UNTIL

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
PRESIDENT EISENHOWER RELENTED IN

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.000
1955.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
THAT, OF COURSE, TURNED OUT TO

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
BE A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR THE NEW

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
MEDIUM THAT WOULD FUNDAMENTALLY

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
CHANGE AMERICAN POLITICS.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
THIS WEEK, THE WHITE HOUSE

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
MARKED ANOTHER RITE OF PASSAGE

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
FOR THE NEWEST MEDIA KIDS ON THE

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
BLOCK.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
A YOUNG MAN RECEIVED THE FIRST

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
WHITE HOUSE CREDENTIAL FOR THE

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF WRITING A

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
BLOG, SHORT FOR WEB LOG, OFTEN A

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
RUNNING COMMENTARY ON ONE TOPIC

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
OR ANOTHER.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
BLOGGERS WERE FIRST GAD FLIES

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
WHO TYPED AWAY IN THEIR PAJAMAS.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
BUT NOW THEY HAVE MADE A SPLASH

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
AND EARNED SOME RESPECT BY

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
IMMEDIATING THE ESTABLISHED

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
MEDIA TO THE PUNCH ON SEVERAL

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.000
NEWS STORIES.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
AND THEIR REACH IS GROWING FAST.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
32 MILLION AMERICANS READ BLOGS.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
A JUMP OF NEARLY 60% IN 2004.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
BUT WHAT TO MAKE OF THEM

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
EXACTLY?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
ARE THEY EXPERTS?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.000
JOURNALISTS?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
SPIN DOCTORS?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
ELECTRONIC LYNCH MOBS?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
OR ALL OF THE ABOVE?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
WE ASKED "NIGHTLINE"

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
CORRESPONDENT, JOHN DONVAN, TO

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
EXPLORE WHAT SOME CALL THE BLOG

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.000
SPHERE.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Reporter: CAMBRIDGE,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
MASSACHUSETTS.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT, BLOGGERS

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
GATHER HERE IN A VINTAGE,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
VICTORIAN HOUSE.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
AND THEY BLOG.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
ACTUALLY, THEY TALK.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
EVERYONE WHO WRITES A BLOG,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
IS PUTTING, YOU KNOW, OTHER

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
PEOPLE -- MAYBE WITHOUT THEM

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
KNOWING, INTO A PUBLIC RECORD.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Reporter: THEY TALK ABOUT

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.000
BLOGGING.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
LET'S KEEP THIS INTO

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.000
PERSPECTIVE.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
ONLY ONE-THIRD OF THE AMERICAN

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
PUBLIC KNOW WHAT A BLOG IS.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I'VE PROBABLY BEEN FIRED FROM

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
FOUR JOBS I HAVEN'T APPLIED FOR

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
YET.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Reporter: A COUPLE OF THEM

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
BLOG.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
A ROUGH VERSION OF WHAT'S GOING

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
ON RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
AND HEY, THERE ARE PEOPLE FROM

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"NIGHTLINE" IN THE ROOM.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
ARE YOU GOING TO BLOG OUR

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000
PRESENCE HERE?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
OH, YEAH.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Reporter: IT'S A BIZARRE

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
EXPERIENCE, BLOGGED BLOGGER,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
DAVID WINEBERGER.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
THE CAMERA GETS POINTED AROUND

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
TO THE PERSON WHO IS SPEAKING,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
CHANGING EVERYTHING.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
FALLS CHURCH, VIRGINIA.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN WE

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
INTERVIEWED A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.000
TEACHER.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
WE NEEDED PICTURES OF HER

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
BLOGGING.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
SHE BLOGGED REAL-TIME, ONTO THE

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
INTERNET.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I'M TYPING RIGHT NOW, AS THEY

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.000
FILM ME TYPING.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I FEEL PRETTY STUPID DOING THIS.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
JOHN DONVAN IS PRETTY NICE.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
JOHN DONVAN, EQUALS ME.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
THE GUY WHO IS TALKING RIGHT

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.000
NOW.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
IT WAS NICE TO HEAR NICE.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
ONE OF THE CAMBRIDGE BLOGGERS

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
SAID, THE "NIGHTLINE" GUY STRUCK

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
ME AS INCURRIOUS AND POMPOUS.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
THAT WAS ALSO VIDEOTAPED BY A

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.000
BLOGGER.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
WHO HAS PICTURES OF OUR CREW

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
GETTING PICTURES OF HIM.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
OUR SELF-PROTECTION FOR

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.000
BLOGGERS.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Reporter: THIS IS A WEIRD

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
DANCE.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
BLOGGERS WATCHING JOURNALISTS,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
WATCHING BLOGGERS, WATCHING

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
JOURNALISTS.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
MAYBE OUR OWN EXPERIENCE TO THIS

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
DIDN'T ADD UP TO MUCH IN ITSELF.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
BUT BLOGS KEEP BUSTING INTO THE

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
NEWS BECAUSE A FEW TIMES, NOW,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
THEY'VE DANCED SOME JOURNALISTS'

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
CAREERS RIGHT OFF A CLIFF.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I WANT TO SAY PERSONALLY AND

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
DIRECTLY, I'M SORRY.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Reporter: IT WAS BLOGGERS WHO

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
FIRST SNIFFED OUT SOMETHING

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
WRONG IN DAN RATHER'S REPORT ON

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
THE PRESIDENT'S MILITARY CAREER.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
BLOGGERS SAID THAT EASON JORDAN

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
GAVE A TALK IN WHICH SOME

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
THOUGHT HE ACCUSED THE U.S.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
MILITARY OF KILLING REPORTERS ON

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.000
PURPOSE.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
AND BLOGGERS WHO HEARD A

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
REPORTER, NAMED JEFF GANNON, LOB

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
A BIG, FAT SOFTBALL TO GEORGE

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.000
BUSH.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO WORK

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
WITH PEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO HAVE

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
DIVORCED THEMSELVES FROM

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
REALITY?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Reporter: AND THEN DISCOVERED

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
THAT JEFF GANNON IS ACTUALLY

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
JIM.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
AND FOUND NAKED PICTURES OF HIM

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.000
ON THE INTERNET.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
AND NOW, NONE OF THEM HAVE THEIR

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
OLD JOBS ANYMORE.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
THAT'S BEEN A BIG STORY LINE

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
BLOGGERS WRECKING JOURNALISTS'

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
REPUTATIONS.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
THE BLOGGERS SAY, KEEPING

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
JOURNALISM HONEST.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
BUT BLOGGERS SAY THAT STORY

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
MISSES WHAT BLOGGING REALLY

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
REPRESENTS -- A QUANTUM LEAP IN

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
THE WAY PEOPLE CONNECT.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
EMPOWERING THE INDIVIDUAL.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
EMPOWERING IS A FAVORITE

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
THINKING BLOGGERS' WORD, LIKE NO

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
OTHER TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IT.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
ACTIVIST GROUPS.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
STARTING TO USE BLOGS AS A WAY

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
TO DEVELOP COMMUNITIES.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT YOUR

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
PRESENCE OUT THERE ON THE WEB.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
AND PEOPLE CAN FIND YOU THAT YOU

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.000
DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Reporter: CONSIDER THE

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
TIME-HONORED NEWSSTAND.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
A DISPLAY OF PURE PUBLISHING

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
POWER.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.000
IDEAS.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
MAYBE TRUTH.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
BUT TO GET SPACE IN THIS SPACE,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
YOU NEED A PRINTING PRESS,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
EMPLOYEES, A HEALTH PLAN.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
IN SHORT, A LOT OF MONEY.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
NOW, LOOK AT TWO COMPUTER

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
MONITORS ON A TABLE.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
ONE SHOWS "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
WEBSITE.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
THE OTHER, A BLOG.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
WE CHOSE AT RONALD M, CALLED

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
BURNNY'S JUNK YARD SPORTS.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
ABOUT HOW TO BE THRIFTY.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
"THE TIMES" IS RICH.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
BERNIE IS NOT.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
BUT HIS POWER TO PUBLISH ON THE

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
INTERNET, IS EQUAL TO "THE

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.000
TIMES."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
SPACE IN THIS SPACE, IS A

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.000
COMPUTER SCREEN.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
AND A SCREEN IS A SCREEN IS A

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
SCREEN.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
BLOGGING'S VERY SOCIAL.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I THINK -- I MEAN, SURE, THERE'S

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
THE STEREOTYPE OF THE GUYS IN

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
THEIR PAJAMAS, IN THEIR BASEMENT

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
NEVER GOING OUT AND JUST TALKING

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
TO THE WORLD ON THEIR COMPUTERS.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY SOCIAL

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
ACTIVITY.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AND BLOGGERS ACTUALLY REALLY

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
LOVE TO MEET UP WITH ONE

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
ANOTHER.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
IT'S TAKING PLACE ONLINE AND

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO FIND EACH

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
OTHER IN WAYS THAT THEY MIGHT

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
NOT EVER FIND, IF THE INTERNET

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.000
DIDN'T EXIST.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Reporter: AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
OF ANOTHER CRITICAL PIECE OF

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
INTERNET TECHNOLOGY CALLED

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
LINKING.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
IMAGINE YOU'RE IN A BOOKSTORE,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
LOOKING THROUGH A BOOK YOU LIKE.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
AND EVERY FEW PAGES, A DOOR

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.000
APPEARS.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
AND WHEN YOU OPEN THAT DOOR,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
YOU'RE TAKEN TO ANOTHER BOOK.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
SAY, A NOVEL.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
AND WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH THAT

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
BOOK, EVERY FEW PAGES, THERE ARE

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
MORE DOORS.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
AND YOU'RE TAKEN TO OTHER BOOKS.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
SO ON AND SO ON.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THE NUMBER OF PATHWAYS YOU COULD

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
FOLLOW AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
YOU COULD MEET ARE ALMOST

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
INFINITE.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
BLOGS ARE FULL OF THE LITTLE

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
DOORS.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
CLICK ON A BLUE WORD IN A SEA OF

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
TEXT, AND IT TAKES YOU AWAY TO

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
ANOTHER BLOG PLACE.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
ANOTHER SET OF PEOPLE AND IDEAS.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
ANOTHER SET OF BLOGS.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
WHILE IT MAY SEEM FRAGMENTED.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THERE ARE BLOGS ABOUT COOKING

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
AND FISHING, AND CATS.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
THE POWER COMES FROM OPENING THE

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
DOORS.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
WHEN THE PEOPLE OCCUPYING THE

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
FRAGMENTED WORLDS HOOK UP AND

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
DISCOVER WHAT THEY HAVE IN

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
COMMON.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
OR AS MORA KUEHNE PUT IT --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
WITH BLOGGING, YOU CAN

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
INTERACT WITH THE INFORMATION

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
YOU'RE GIVEN.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
SO, THE AUDIENCE IS ACTUALLY

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
PART OF THE STORY BECAUSE THEY

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
CAN FACT-CHECK WHILE THEY'RE

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
READING.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
THEY CAN WRITE BACK TO THE

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
PERSON WHO'S WRITING AND BECOME

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
PART OF THE STORY.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
THEY CAN ADD TO THE STORY IN

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
THAT WAY.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Reporter: AND THAT, AS SHE

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
DISCOVERED FIRST-HAND, CAN BE

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
VERY POWERFUL.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
WHEN WE COME BACK --

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
THE SCHOOLTEACHER AND THE

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
LEGISLATOR.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I WROTE AN E-MAIL TO THE

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.000
LEGISLATOR HIMSELF.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
AND I ASKED HIM -- I'M TRYING TO

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.000
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I REALLY HADN'T HAD ANY IDEA

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
LOTS OF AUTHORITIES,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
INCLUDING SOME GENUINE

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
DICTIONARY WRITERS, HAVE TAKEN A

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
CRACK AT DEFINING THE WORD

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"BLOGGING."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
NONE OF THE DEFINITIONS IS

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
SATISFYING.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
USUALLY THEY SAY BLOG IS SHORT

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
HAND FOR WEB LOG.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
IT'S AN ONLINE DIARY.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
FREQUENTLY UPDATED.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
WITH LINKS TO OTHER BLOGS OR

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
ARTICLES.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
BUT THAT'S A LITTLE LIKE

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
EXPLAINING A FORMULA ONE RACER,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
AS A LONG, METAL OBJECT WITH

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
WHEELS, ENGINE AND STRIPES ON

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
THE SIDE.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
YOU NEED TO SEE ONE IN ACTION TO

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
GET WHAT IT CAN REALLY DO.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
AND SO, THE STORY OF MORA

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:55.000
KUEHNE.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
THAT'S HOWARD DEAN.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
BUT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM, IS KUEHNE

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
WHO WAS A VOLUNTEER FOR DEAN AND

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
BELIEVES IN HIM, STILL.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
LATELY, SHE'S PUT TEACHING ON

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
HOLD TO CARE FOR HER AILING

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
FATHER.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
BUT NOT THE POLITICS.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
SHE AND A GROUP OF OTHER LIBERAL

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
DEMOCRATS BEGAN A JOINT PROJECT.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
TO DROP IN ON THE GOINGS ON OF

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
WE DECIDED TO READ EVERY BILL

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
THAT HAD BEEN PREFILED.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Reporter: EVERY BILL?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
YEAH.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
AND IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT'S NOT

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.000
THAT MUCH WORK.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
MOST BILLS ARE JUST A FEW

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.000
PARAGRAPHS LONG.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
YOU CAN SKIM THROUGH PRETTY

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
QUICKLY.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
AND NOTICE THE BILLS THAT ARE OF

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.000
INTEREST.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Reporter: BY THIS TIME, A

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
REPUBLICAN LEGISLATOR HAD

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
PROPOSED A LAW INTENDED, HE

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
EXPLAINS, TO ADDRESS AN AWFUL

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
KIND OF CRIME THAT HAD BEEN

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
KPLITED AT LEAST TWICE IN AND

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
NEAR HIS PART OF VIRGINIA.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
WOMEN GIVING BIRTH AND THEN

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000
ABANDONING THEIR CHILDREN TO

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
DIE.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
THESE BABIES WERE FULL-TERM.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000
THEY WERE JUST LEFT TO DIE.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
THE INTENT OF THE BILL WAS TO

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
REQUIRE ANY PERSON WHO HAD A

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
BABY OR STILL BORN TO HAVE TO

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
NOTIFY AUTHORITIES.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Reporter: YOU WERE LOOKING

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
THROUGH HUNDREDS OF BILLS?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.000
YEAH.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Reporter: BILLS THAT WERE

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
GOING TO BE PROPOSED.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
RIGHT.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Reporter: AND CAME ACROSS

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
THIS ONE.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.000
RIGHT.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I CAN SEE FROM THE TITLE --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
FETAL DEATH, REPORT BY MOTHER,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.000
PENALTY.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE ALARM

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.000
BELLS WENT OFF.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Reporter: KUEHNE REALIZED

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
THAT IT WAS PROPOSING WHAT SHE

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
CONSIDERED A BIZARRE LEGAL

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
REQUIREMENT FOR WOMEN WHO LOSE A

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
FETUS WITHOUT A MEDICAL

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.000
PROFESSIONAL PRESENT.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
SO, JUST WENT INTO THE CODE

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
OF VIRGINIA.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
AND I TYPED IN THE PHRASE FETAL

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
DEATH.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THIS DELEGATE -- IT MEANS A

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
MISCARRIAGE.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
ANYTIME DURING PREGNANCY, IF A

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
WOMAN LOST A PREGNANCY EARLY IN

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
PREGNANCY, SHE'D HAVE TO CALL A

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.000
POLICE.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Reporter: WITH JAIL TIME IF

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THE CALL IS NOT MADE WITHIN 12

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
HOURS.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
IT WAS, NOT WHAT HE MEANT AT

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
ALL.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
NOW, GRANTED, THE BILL WAS

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
TOO BROADLY WRITTEN.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
BUT WE WOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THAT, IN THE COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
DURING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
SESSION.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
SO, AFTER I DID, I'D SAY,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.000
MAYBE TWO DAYS OF RESEARCH ON

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
THIS, I WROTE AN E-MAIL TO THE

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
LEGISLATOR HIMSELF.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
AND I ASKED HIM -- I'M TRYING TO

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
UNDERSTAND THIS BILL.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
AND I WAS ACTUALLY IN

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
ANNAPOLIS ON A CHESAPEAKE BAY

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.000
MEETING.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Reporter: WHAT ANSWER DID YOU

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
GET?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD SENT AN

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
E-MAIL.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I GOT NO ANSWER.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Reporter: AND SO, KUEHNE, WHO

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
LIKES TO BLOG, BLOGGED.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
SHE LAID THE WHOLE THING OUT ON

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
TWO LIBERAL BLOGS.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
WITH LINKS TO THE BILL.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
AND TO THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
FETAL DEATH.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
AND BEING A GOOD DEMOCRAT, SHE

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
ADDED SOME EDITORIAL FLOURISH.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
IF YOU LIVE IN OR NEAR THIS

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
DISTRICT, PLEASE TRY TO FIND

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
SOMEONE TO STAND AGAINST HIM

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
THIS YEAR.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
AND THEN, CAME THE FORMULA ONE

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
MOMENT.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
ANOTHER BLOG LINKED TO KUEHNE'S

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.000
ACCOUNT.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
ONE WITH NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.000
POLITICS.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
BUT FOCUSED ON HELPING WOMEN GET

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.000
PREGNANT.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
AND IT WAS OFF TO THE RACES.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
LINKS STARTED POPPING UP ON

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
BLOGS ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
FROM HO LISTIC WISDOM, TO

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
BLOGGING BABY.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
IT WAS THOSE DOORS OPENING.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
AND PEOPLE CROSSING IN THE

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:16.000
CORRIDORS.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
THAT'S ONE OF THE THING ABOUT

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
THE BLOGSPHERE.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
IT'S NOT ONE-DIMENSIONAL.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
OTHER PEOPLE LINK TO ME.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
AND THEY ADD THEIR OWN

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
INFORMATION TO ME.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Reporter: AND IF YOU'RE JOHN

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
COSGROVE AT ONE POINT, YOU

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
NOTICE SOMETHING.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
BASICALLY, I STARTED GETTING

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
A LOT OF E-MAILS IN RELATION

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000
RELATION TO THE BILL I'D BEEN

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
CARRYING.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA THAT

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS GOING TO

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
HAPPEN.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Reporter: MORE THAN 500

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
E-MAILS CONVERGED ON VIRGINIA'S

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
STATE CAPITOL, FROM WOMEN ACROSS

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
THE COUNTRY, OUTRAGED AT WHAT

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
THIS PROPOSED LAW COULD LEAD TO.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
AS THE HEADLINES NEXT

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
REPORTED -- COSGROVE WITHDREW

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.000
THE BILL.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
A FACT CELEBRATED IN A

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
KUEHNE-WRITTEN BLOG.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT HE HAD

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
WITHDRAWN THE BILL --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I WAS DELIGHTED.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
IT WAS GREAT.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I MEAN, I THINK -- IT WAS PROOF

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
THAT ORDINARY CITIZENS CAN

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
OUR LEGISLATORS DO.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
BUT I GOT HUNDREDS OF E-MAILS

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
FROM WOMEN WHO HAD NEVER BEEN

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
INVOLVED IN POLITICS.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
WHO HAD NEVER WRITTEN TO A

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
LEGISLATOR BEFORE.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
WHO HAD NEVER WRITTEN A LETTER

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
BEFORE.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
WHO SAID, WE DID IT.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
OH, MY GOD.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
WE MADE THIS HAPPEN.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Reporter: THAT WAS IN

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
JANUARY.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
AND IT HELPED MAKE MORA KUEHNE

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
SOMETHING OF A CELEBRITY IN

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
LIBERAL BLOGGING CIRCLES.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
ALSO DEMONSTRATING THE

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
UNDERREPORTED STORY OUR

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
CAMBRIDGE FRIENDS KEPT

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
EMPHASIZING, THE POWER OF

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
BLOGGING TO INFORM, TO MOTIVATE,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
TO ORGANIZE, SCATTERED

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
INDIVIDUALS WHO THEN DO SOME

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.000
GOOD.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
BUT AS WE WOULD SEE, IN THIS

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
STORY, WHAT'S GOOD, AS EVER, IS

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000
WHEN WE COME BACK --

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
WHO MAKES THE RULES IN THE

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
BLOGSPHERE.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I WAS DEALING WITH A PERSON

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
WHO HAS AN AUDIENCE.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I'M POSTING MY CONCERNS.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW THERE

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:16.000
ARE A MILLION PEOPLE

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
THOSE TWO COMPUTER MONITORS

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
ON A TABLE AGAIN.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
THE ONE ON THE LEFT IS "THE NEW

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
YORK TIMES."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT THIS TIME,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
IS MORA KUEHNE'S BLOG.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
THE BLOGG THAT CREATED A MOVEMENT

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
THAT STOPPED WHAT SHE CONSIDERED

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
A VERY BAD IDEA.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
MEDIA ON THE LEFT.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
AND ON THE RIGHT -- ALSO MEDIA?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
TO JOHN COSGROVE, THAT'S EXACTLY

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
WHAT MORA KUEHNE IS, BECAUSE SHE

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
WROTE ABOUT HIM IN A PUBLIC

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.000
PLACE.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I WAS DEALING WITH A PERSON

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
WHO HAS AN AUDIENCE.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Reporter: THAT PLACES HER IN

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
THE MEDIA.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
AND THE MEDIA HAS OBLIGATIONS.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
THE BIG PROBLEM I HAVE WITH

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
WHAT HAPPENED THERE -- AND IT'S

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
THAT THAT PERSON, AGAIN, NEVER

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:53.000
CONTACTED ME.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I DON'T THINK THAT ANY

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
CITIZEN SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
A LEGISLATOR'S PERMISSION TO

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
SHARE HER CONCERNS ABOUT

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
LEGISLATION.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I MEAN, ONCE YOU INTRODUCE A

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
BILL INTO THE PUBLIC RECORD,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
IT'S PUBLIC RECORD.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I'VE DEALT WITH TELEVISION

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.000
MEDIA.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
AND I HAVE YET TO HAVE ONE

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
REPORTER RUN A STORY WITHOUT

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
RUNNING IT BY ME.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I TAKE IT FROM AN EDITORIAL

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
POSITION THAN I EXPECT ANY

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
REPORTER TO DO BECAUSE I'M AN

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.000
ACTIVIST.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Reporter: WELL, KUEHNE DID

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
SEND COSGROVE ONE E-MAIL.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
THE ONE HE DIDN'T SEE FOR

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
SEVERAL DAYS.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
BUT BEYOND THAT, THERE IS AN

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
ETHICAL QUESTION.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
KUEHNE IS, AS SHE SAYS, A

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.000
PRIVATE CITIZEN.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
WHOSE BLOG NEVER ATTRACTED MORE

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
THAN A FEW HUNDRED READERS ON A

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
REGULAR BASIS.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
BUT IF SHE HAS THE POWER TO BE

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
READ AROUND THE WORLD, AS

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
EPISODE PROVES SHE HAS, IS SHE

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000
JUST A PRIVATE CITIZEN?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
DOES SHE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
TELL SOMEONE SHE'S WRITING ABOUT

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
THAT SHE HAS AN AUDIENCE?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I DON'T THIN SO.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Reporter: BECAUSE?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
WE'RE NOT IN A SEPARATE

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
CATEGORY OF HUMAN BEINGS.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
WE'RE JUST CITIZENS WITH OUR

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.000
CONCERN.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
FRANKLY, MY WEBSITE GOT, MAYBE,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
YOU KNOW, A FEW HUNDRED, AT MOST

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
HITS A DAY, BEFORE THIS

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
HAPPENED.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Reporter: FOR THE RECORD,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
KUEHNE WAS SKRUB LOUSELY

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
ACCURATE, LINKING TO THE

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
ORIGINAL TEXT OF COSGROVE'S

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.000
BILL.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
BUT AS HER STORY SPREAD, AT

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
INTERNET SPEED AND OTHERS ADDED

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
COMMENTARIES, INACCURACIES CREPT

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
IN.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
IT BECOMES A GAME OF

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
TELEPHONE THAT YOU PLAYED IN THE

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.000
THIRD GRADE.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
BY THE TIME THE 15th PERSON GETS

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
THE STORY.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
THERE WERE WEBSITES THAT LINKED

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
TO MINE THAT DIDN'T GET THE

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.000
WHOLE STORY.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
THEY GOT IT WRONG.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Reporter: AND THAT ACCOUNTS

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
FOR SOME OF WHAT COSGROVE

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
EXPERIENCED.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
THE TONE OF THE E-MAILS WAS

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
EXTRAORDINARILY NASTY.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
VERY VULGAR.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.000
DISGUSTING LANGUAGE.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
AND REALLY A TRUE

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
DISAPPOINTMENT.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY THAR WERE

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
GETTING IT FOURTH-HAND OR

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.000
FIFTH-HAND.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
MOST OF THEM HAD NO IDEA WHAT

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
THE BILL STATED OR HOW IT WAS

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.000
WRITTEN.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
CERTAINLY, THEY WERE GETTING IT

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
FROM WEBSITES THAT HAD A

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
POLITICAL ISSUE OR A POLITICAL

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
AX TO GRIND.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Reporter: OF COURSE, PEOPLE

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
MANGLE THINGS THEY HEAR ON TV OR

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
READ IN THE NEWSPAPERS ALSO.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
AND THAT'S NOT KUEHNE'S FAULT.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
BUT ALL THESE ISSUES ARE THE

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
KINDS OF THINGS THE CAMBRIDGE

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
BLOGGERS SAY THE BLOGGING WORLD

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
STILL NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT FOR

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.000
ITSELF.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
ONE MEMBER OF THE GROUP, A

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
MOTHER WHO BLOGS ABOUT BEING A

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
MOTHER, PUT IT THIS WAY --

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
THROUGH IS A TYPE OF MEDIA

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.000
ADOLESCENCE.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I'M HOPING THE NEW TRANSPARENCY

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
BRINGS A NEW MATURITY.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
EVEN GOSSIP COLUMNISTS HAVE

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
STANDARDS.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
BLOGGERS -- WE'RE MAKING IT UP

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
AS WE GO ALONG.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Reporter: AND SO, THEY BLOG.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
AND EVEN NOW, AS THIS

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
"NIGHTLINE" REPORT COMES TO A

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
CLOSE, BLOGGERS ARE BLOGGING

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
ABOUT IT.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
AND DOORS ARE OPENING, WHO KNOWS

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
WHERE?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
I'M JOHN DONVAN, FOR

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
"NIGHTLINE," IN WASHINGTON.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
WHEN WE COME BACK --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
WHAT THE BLOGGERS HAV

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
IN THE BLOGGING WORLD, AS

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
JOHN DONVAN REPORTED, THE

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
AUDIENCE IS OFTEN PART OF THE

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
PROCESS.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
INDEED, THROUGHOUT TONIGHT'S

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
BROADCAST, SOME BLOGGERS WERE

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
DISCUSSING IT, ONLINE, IN

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
REAL-TIME.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
EVEN AS THE IMAGES FLICKERED ON

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
THEIR TV SCREENS.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
HERE'S A SAMPLE OF WHAT SOME OF

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THEM HAD TO SAY -- "THEY WANT TO

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
REGULATE," SAID ONE WITH AN

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
EXCLAMATION POINT.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
"SO FAR, PRETTY POSITIVE, EH?"

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
WROTE ANOTHER.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:50.000
{00:19:52}{00:19:54}AND THIS, FROM THE
SCHOOLTEACHER

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
FEATURED IN TONIGHT'S REPORT --

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
AND ONE BLOGGER SEEMED TO THINK

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
THEY WERE ALL IN ON A SECRET.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
YES, WE DID.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
TO THEIR CREDIT, THEY'VE GIVEN

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
US, IN THE TRADITIONAL NEWS

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
BUSINESS, A SWIFT KICK IN THE

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
PANTS.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
THIS FORCES ALL OF US TO BE MORE

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
CAREFUL, ACCURATE AND THOREAU.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
IT'S TRUE THAT THE COLLECTIVE

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
EFFORT AND EXPERTISE OF THE

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
BLOGGING COMMUNITY IS INVALUABLE

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
TO BRING NEW INFORMATION TO

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
LIGHT ON ALMOST ANY SUBJECT.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000
WITH THAT SAID, THE BLINDING

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
SPEED OF THE BLOGGING WORLD AND

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
THE TENDENCY OF SOME BLOGGERS TO

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
SHOOT FIRST AND ASK QUESTIONS

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
LATER, SHOULD RAISE A YELLOW

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
FLAG.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
YOU'D JOURNALISM, IS TEDIOUS.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE BIG

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
MISTAKES THAT THE BLOGGERS HAVE

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
EXPOSED.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
OVER TIME, SUCH WORK IS THE

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
PRICE OF CREDIBILITY.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
AND THE NEW MEDIA KIDS ON THE

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
BLOCK NOW

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
SPECIAL AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
NATIONS FOR REFUGEES, TAKING HER

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
CAUSE TO CAPITOL HILL.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.000
AND THAT'S OUR REPORT

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
FOR TONIGHT.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I'M CHRIS BURY IN WASHINGTON.
