00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630


2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.670
Haste you to Lord Timon;

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.900
Importune him for mymoneys;

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.130
be not ceased by slightdenial,

5
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.170
nor then silenced when

6
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.830
"Commend me to yourmaster,"

7
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.270
and the cap plays in theright hand, thus.

8
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.030
But tell him, my uses cryto me,

9
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.870
I must serve my turn outof mine own.

10
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.400
His days and times arepast

11
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.100
and my reliance on hisfracted dates

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.770
have smit my credit:

13
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.030
I love and honor him,

14
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.770
but I must not break myback to heal his finger.

15
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.070
Immediate are my needs,

16
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.130
and my relief must not betossed and turned to mein words,

17
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.970
but find supply immediate.

18
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.570
Get you gone.

19
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.570
Put on a most importunateaspect,

20
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.730
a visage of demand, for, Ido fear,

21
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.800
when every feather sticksin his own wing,

22
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.700
Lord Timon will be left anaked gull,

23
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.800
which flashes now aphoenix.

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.800
Get you gone.

25
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.800
I go, sir.

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.930
Take the bonds along withyou,

27
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.930
I will, sir.

28
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.300
Have the dates incontempt.

29
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.030
Go.

30
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.070
No care, no stop!

31
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.200
So senseless of expense,

32
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.970
that he will neither knowhow to maintain it,

33
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.670
nor cease his flow ofriot.

34
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.330
Takes no account howthings go from him,

35
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.670
nor resumes no care ofwhat is to continue.

36
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.230
Never mind was to be sounwise, to be so kind.

37
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.570
Oh, what shall be done?

38
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870
He will not hear, tillfeel.

39
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.630
I must be round with him,now he comes from hunting.

40
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.800
Fie, fie, fie!

41
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.870
Good even.

42
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.870
What, you come for money?

43
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.500
Is it your business too?

44
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.670
'Tis, and yours?

45
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.670
Would we were alldischarged!

46
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.670
I fear it.

47
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.970
Here comes the lord.

48
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.570
So soon as dinner's done,

49
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.870
we'll forth again, myAlcibiades.

50
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:31.870
With me?

51
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.030
What is your will?

52
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.730
My lord, here is a note ofcertain dues.

53
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.970
Dues?

54
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.170
Whence are you?

55
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.400
Of Athens here, my lord.

56
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.570
Go to my steward.

57
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.670
Please it, Your Lordship,

58
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.900
he has put me out to thesuccession

59
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.400
of new days this month.

60
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.630
My master is awaked togreat occasion

61
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.000
to call upon his own,

62
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.100
and humbly prays you that,with your other noble parts,

63
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.830
you'll suit in giving himhis right.

64
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.230
Mine honest friend, Iprithee, but repair to menext morning.

65
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.230
Nay, good my lord!

66
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.700
Contain thyself, goodfriend.

67
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.700
One Varro's servant, mygood

68
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.700
From Isidore;

69
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.200
he humbly prays yourspeedy payment.

70
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.670
If you did know, my lord,my master's wants

71
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.200
'Twas due on forfeiture, mylord, six weeks and past.

72
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.500
Give me breath!

73
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.000
My lords, I beseech you,keep on;

74
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.570
I'll wait upon youinstantly.

75
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.700
Come hither, I pray you.

76
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.930
I beseech you, how goesthe world

77
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.000
that I am thus encounteredwith clamorous demands

78
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.070
of debt, broken bonds,

79
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.230
and the detention oflong-since-due debtsagainst my honor?

80
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.370
Please you, gentlemen,

81
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.830
the time is unagreeable tothis business.

82
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.900
Your importunacy ceasetill after dinner,

83
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.270
that I may make HisLordship understand

84
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.730
wherefore you are notpaid.

85
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.030
Do so, my friends.

86
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.070
Pray, you're welcome here.

87
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.270
I'll speak with you anon.

88
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.630
You make me marvel.

89
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.770
Wherefore ere this time

90
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.370
you had not fully laid mystate before me,

91
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.930
that I might so have ratedmy expense,

92
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.230
as I had leave of means?

93
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.800
You would not hear me; atmany leisures, I proposed.

94
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.470
Go to!

95
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.300
Perchance some singlevantages you took

96
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.430
when my indisposition putyou back,

97
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.170
and that unaptness madeyour minister,

98
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.730
thus to excuse yourself.

99
00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.170
Oh, my good lord, at many timesI brought in my accounts,

100
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.470
laid them before you.

101
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.530
You would throw them off

102
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.800
and say you found them inmine honesty.

103
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.870
When, for some triflingpresent, you have bid mereturn so much,

104
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.830
I have shook my head andwept;

105
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.270
Yea, against the authorityof manners,

106
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.500
prayed you to hold yourhand more close.

107
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.800
I have endured not seldom,nor no slight checks,

108
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.630
when I have prompted youin the ebb of your estate

109
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.370
and your great flow ofdebts.

110
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.000
My loved lord, though youhear now too late

111
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.500
yet now's a time

112
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.700
the greatest of yourhaving lacks a half

113
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.000
to pay your present debts.

114
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.870
Let all my lands be sold.

115
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.470
'tis all engaged, someforfeited and gone;

116
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.200
and what remains willhardly stop the mouth ofpresent dues.

117
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.270
The future comes apace.

118
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.430
What shall defend theinterim?

119
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.530
And at length, how goesour reckoning?

120
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.600
To Lacedaemon did my landextend.

121
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.200
O my good lord, the worldis but a word.

122
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.900
Were it all yours to giveit in a breath,

123
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.000
how quickly were it gone!

124
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.130
You tell me true?

125
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.470
If you suspect myhusbandry or falsehood,

126
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.930
call me before theexactest auditors

127
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.200
and set me on the proof.

128
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.830
So the gods bless me,

129
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.370
when all our offices havebeen oppressed withriotous feeders,

130
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.530
when our vaults have weptwith drunken spilth of wine,

131
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.330
when every room was blazedwith lights

132
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.170
and brayed withminstrelsy,

133
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.800
I have retired me to awasteful cock

134
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.800
and set mine eyes at flow.

135
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.970
Prithee, no more.

136
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.200
Heavens, have I said, thebounty of this lord!

137
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.500
How many prodigal bitshave slaves and peasants

138
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.570
this night englutted!

139
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.230
Who is not Timon's?

140
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.700
What heart, head, sword, force,means, but is Lord Timon's?

141
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.730
Great Timon, noble,worthy, royal Timon!

142
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.300
Ah, when the means aregone that buy this praise,

143
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.900
the breath is gone whereofthis praise is made.

144
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.830
Feast-won, fast-lost;

145
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.100
one cloud of winter showers,these flies are couched.

146
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.600
Come, sermon me nofurther.

147
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.070
No villainous bounty yethath passed my heart;

148
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.770
unwisely, not ignobly,have I given.

149
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.470
Why dost thou weep?

150
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.370
Has thou the conscience lackto think I shall lack friends?

151
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.070
Secure thy heart;

152
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.200
if I would broach thevessels of my love,

153
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.630
and try the arguments ofhearts by borrowing,

154
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.530
men and men's fortunescould I frankly use

155
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.170
as I can bid thee speak.

156
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.370
Assurance bless yourthoughts!

157
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.570
And, in some sort, thesewants of mine are crowned,

158
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.900
that I account themblessings;

159
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.470
for by these shall I tryfriends.

160
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.300
You shall see how youmistake my fortunes;

161
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.430
I am wealthy in myfriends.

162
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.630
Within there!

163
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.630
Flaminius!

164
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.700
My lord?

165
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.700
Servilius!

166
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:45.730
My lord?

167
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.130
I will dispatch youseverally;

168
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.100
To Lord Lucius, you;

169
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.900
to Lord Lucullus, you.

170
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.270
I hunted with His Honortoday.

171
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.630
To Sempronius, you.

172
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.370
Commend me to their loves,and, I am proud, say,

173
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.900
that my occasions havefound time to use 'em

174
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.670
toward a supply of money.

175
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.370
Let the request be...fifty talents?

176
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.630
As you have said, my lord.

177
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.030
Lord Lucius and Lucullus,hmm?

178
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.430
And go you, sir, to thesenators

179
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.600
of whom, even to thestate's best health,

180
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.300
I have deserved thishearing

181
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.900
bid 'em send of the instanta thousand talents to me.

182
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.130
I have been bold

183
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.870
for that I knew it themost general way

184
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.170
to them to use your signetand your name;

185
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.430
but they do shake theirheads,

186
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.700
and I am here no richer inreturn.

187
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.530
It is true?

188
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.130
Can it be?

189
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.100
They answer, in a jointand corporate voice,

190
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.200
that now they are at fall,want treasure,

191
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200
cannot do what they would;

192
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.200
are sorry you arehonorable

193
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.470
but yet they could havewished

194
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.530
they know not somethinghath been amiss

195
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.800
a noble nature may catch awrench

196
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.030
would all were well  'tispity;

197
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.800
and so, intending otherserious matters,

198
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.830
after distasteful looksand these hard fractions,

199
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.330
with certain half-caps andcold-moving nods

200
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.700
they froze me intosilence.

201
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.500
You gods, reward them!

202
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.170
Prithee, man, lookcheerly.

203
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.670
These old fellows have theiringratitude in them hereditary.

204
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.130
Their blood is caked, 'tiscold, it seldom flows;

205
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.130
'tis lack of kindly warmththey are not kind;

206
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.530
and nature, as it growsagain toward earth,

207
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.930
is fashioned for thejourney, dull and heavy.

208
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.370
Go to Ventidius.

209
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.730
Prithee, be not sad.

210
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.930
Ingeniously I speak.

211
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.100
No blame belongs to thee.

212
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.900
Ventidius lately buriedhis father,

213
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.830
by whose death he's steppedinto a great estate.

214
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.170
When he was poor, imprisoned,and in scarcity of friends,

215
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.030
I cleared him with fivetalents.

216
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.600
Greet him from me;

217
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.830
bid him suppose some goodnecessity touches his friend,

218
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.300
which craves to be rememberedwith those five talents.

219
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.130
That had, give it these fellowsto whom 'tis instant due.

220
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.330
Ne'er speak, or think,that Timon's fortunes

221
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.970
amongst his friends can sink.

222
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.600
I would I could not think it.

223
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.230
That thought isbounty's foe;

224
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.130
being free itself, itthinks all others so.

225
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.730
