00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.960
NARRATOR:
The brain is wider than the sky,
for put them side by side,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.430
The one the other will contain
with ease, and you beside.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.000
(<i> grunts</i> )

(<i> murmurs</i> )

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.300
The brain is deeper
than the sea,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.160
For hold them, blue to blue,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.930
The one the other will absorb,
as sponges, buckets do.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.500
The brain is just
the weight of God,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.660
For heft them, pound for pound,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.460
And they will differ,
if they do,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.160
As syllable from sound.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.730
A baby's brain--

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.230
less than one pound
of gelatinous tissue

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.660
and within its milky,
convoluted folds,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.330
a universe of meaning.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.460
Emotions, ideas,
memories, dreams--

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.360
all will somehow
find a home here

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.900
evolving and changing
over a lifetime.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.960
and the ultimate source
of everything.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.100
We understand the world
the way we do

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.930
because of the brains we have.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.530
We will understand the brain
itself the way we will

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.730
because of the brains we have.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.900
NARRATOR:
The brain is the most complex
thing on Earth.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.730
Even the brain of a baby
is wildly complicated.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.930
WOMAN:
A piece of a brain the size
of a grain of rice

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.630
contains about
10,000 nerve cells

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.830
just in that little piece.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.030
And you can just imagine

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.900
how many pieces
you have in your head.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.200
Within that 10,000 nerve cells,
each nerve cell can make

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.460
anywhere between one
to 10,000 connections

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.300
with other nerve cells.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.930
So there are something like
a trillion connections.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.760
WOMAN:
It's almost overwhelming
to think about the whole thing.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.500
If you think about
how the whole brain

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.030
and nervous system
gets assembled

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.200
you know, you just want
to throw up your hands

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.900
and say, "It's way
too complicated.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.860
We're never going
to understand it."

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.430
The brain is the seat of our
consciousness, of who we are

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.500
and in understanding
where it comes from

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.030
we understand
where we come from.

NARRATOR:
Elizabeth Traphagen was born
less than two weeks ago

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.930
three months
before she was expected;

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.000
three months before she was
ready to meet the world.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.530
(<i> Elizabeth squeals</i> )

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.860
WOMAN:
She was 28 weeks and six days;

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.730
she weighed three pounds
and she was 14 inches long.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.900
It was somewhat frightening

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.500
not knowing what a premie
would look like.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.330
(<i> whispering</i> ):
There we go.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.230
There we go.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.100
WOMAN:
It's something you don't expect.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.830
You're suddenly
in this medical world

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.100
rather than the world
of taking your baby home

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.200
and trying to figure out how to
dress it and change its diaper.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.930
(<i> monitor beeping regularly</i> )

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.600
NARRATOR:
Elizabeth is a healthy
premature baby--

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.300
her lungs actively
suck in the air;

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.460
her heart beats on its own.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.800
But the one organ central
to all the others

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.430
is not fully prepared--
her brain.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.960
The miracle technologies
of modern medicine

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.930
can help keep Elizabeth alive

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.900
but 12 critical weeks
of brain development

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.260
must now continue outside the
protective walls of the womb.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.830
WOMAN:
When the baby comes out of
the womb, everything changes--

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.560
suddenly light,
suddenly sharp sounds.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.230
The brain reacts
to the stimulation.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.060
It can't filter, it can't stop,
it can't shut it out.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.160
They survive
and make the best of it.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Yet what's the cost?

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.400
NARRATOR:
The brain of a baby born three
months premature is vulnerable.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.960
Many precious weeks
of development still remain.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.600
Billions of brain cells
are not done forging links

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.960
with billions
of other brain cells.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.830
Eventually, there will be
trillions and trillions

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.730
of connections between cells

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.760
charged with electrical pulses

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.700
rippling like lightning storms
across the hills and valleys

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.230
of the brain's
deeply furrowed tissue.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.400
Every cell in its place,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.230
every link between cells
carefully organized--

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.760
nothing random,
nothing arbitrary.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.360
WOMAN:
What we would really love
to understand

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.230
is how the brain,
during development,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.460
generates millions and millions
of neurons,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.930
sends them to the right position
in the brain,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:22.600
and then somehow instructs each
of those individual nerve cells

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.760
to form very, very specific
connections with one another.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.630
You can think about development
like a play--

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.460
a play that follows a script

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.030
that is written down
by the genetic code

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.030
but it has no director,
it has no producer

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.100
and it has a bunch of actors

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.130
that have never spoken
their lines before.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.000
Despite all this,
you pull the play off.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.800
To me, that's a miracle.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.560
NARRATOR:
Egg and sperm-- their union
forms a single cell

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.660
which will divide, and divide,
and divide again.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.400
Within three weeks,
the multiplying cells

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.130
have curled into
a quivering oval ball.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.700
Inside lies a cluster of cells

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.360
that have begun
to fold themselves

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.230
into the shape of a garden hose,
the neural tube.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.660
From the bottom will come
the spinal cord;

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.360
from the top, the brain.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.160
Here lies
the primitive beginning

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.000
of all our thoughts
and feelings.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.700
By four weeks, just as a woman
is discovering she is pregnant

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.230
the first brain cells,
the neurons,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.660
are already forming
at an astonishing rate--

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.100
500,000 neurons every minute--

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.630
neurons that will never
reproduce themselves

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.500
and rarely be replaced.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.430
McCONNELL:
And that's amazing,
because if you think about it

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.330
most cells in your body
turn over.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.160
If you think about your skin,
you're constantly...

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.630
it's sort of disgusting--

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.300
you're constantly sloughing off
dead skin cells.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.360
And someone calculated once

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.730
that if you look at the turnover
of skin across a lifetime

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.630
you're probably generating
and shedding

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.500
about 90 pounds of skin.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.760
So, most cells in the body
do their thing

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.000
and then they die,
and they're replaced.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.330
Neurons are born in fetal life

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.230
and then those very cells
are the ones

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.260
that are still functioning
all the way into old age.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.360
NARRATOR:
As the tiny fetus grows

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.430
the neurons make their way out
from inside the neural tube

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.100
to build the brain, layer
upon layer, like an onion.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.060
The neurons follow
a cellular pathway

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:07.030
as if they were traveling
down a highway.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.700
They just grab hold of
supporting cells called "glia"

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.930
and propel themselves along.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.600
WOMAN:
They put their nucleus
in the back of the cell

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.660
which makes them sort of fat
in the back

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.700
and then they hold on to the
guide wire, this glial fiber.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.930
So, it's kind of like an
inchworm as it moves along.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.460
And each little cell
goes all by itself

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.060
in what is a very,
very vulnerable process.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.500
No other kind of cell
has to do that

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.700
and it's just an amazing thing.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.660
NARRATOR:
Neurons travel in waves--

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.960
millions every day embarking
on a daunting expedition

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.560
that scientists call migration.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.230
WOMAN:
It's an amazing phenomenon

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.000
because it's as if they are
going across the country.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.730
I mean, in terms of the
distances relative to their size

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.430
they're... they're making
a huge odyssey

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.030
through all kinds
of foreign territory.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.730
And the most amazing thing
about this migration

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.400
is that they generally do it
without mistakes.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.400
They're following cues
along the way

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.760
that are telling them
exactly where to go.

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.960
NARRATOR:
For years, scientists wondered

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.630
how the migrating neurons
find their place in the brain.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.200
Do the neurons simply travel
in herds

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.160
gliding down a glial highway

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.260
which takes them
to their final destination?

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.260
Or do neurons
do their own driving,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.230
each neuron
genetically programmed

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:39.800
to fulfill its own
predetermined purpose?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.530
McCONNELL:
We used to think that migration

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.830
was just like delivering cells
out a conveyor belt

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.830
and we just dump out the cells
at the end.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.430
But now we know
that's not the case.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.130
There is evidence that shows
that young neurons

00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.700
have an idea about
where they're migrating to

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.530
and that they can recognize
their position within the brain.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.360
NARRATOR:
In her laboratory
at Stanford University

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.500
neurobiologist Susan McConnell
devised a series of experiments

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.360
to track the destiny
of a migrating neuron.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.260
Neurons are born from
the division of stem cells

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.760
the seeds from which
the tissues of the body grow.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.560
Some stem cells
can transform themselves

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.230
into any kind of cell--

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.960
blood, skin, heart, bone...
or brain cell.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.400
McConnell took a descendant
of a stem cell

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.360
and before it morphed
into a neuron

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.000
transplanted it
into a developing brain;

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.360
then, watched it migrate.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.460
She found that the fate
of the soon-to-become neuron

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.100
was determined by the neurons
that were its neighbors.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:06.100
It traveled beside them and took
on the same function they did.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.800
McCONNELL:
That cell is plastic;

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.460
it's still listening to signals
from the outside.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.030
It gets the instructions
from the new neighbors

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.330
and it resets its fate.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.600
It says, "Yeah, sure,
I can do that, too."

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.160
NARRATOR:
But when McConnell
transplanted a neuron

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.630
it was true to
its own genetic destiny--

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.430
it followed its own path

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.560
and took on an entirely
different function

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.860
from the cells surrounding it.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.530
McCONNELL:
What this result tells us

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:37.700
is that by the time a young
neuron begins its migration

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.460
it has already
received instructions

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.160
about what to become;

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.230
it knows.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.760
It goes into a new environment

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.060
and even though everyone else
in the brain...

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.800
All these other young neurons
are going to position A

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.330
it says, "No, no, I'm supposed
to go to position B"

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.000
and that's exactly what it does.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.530
(<i> fetus's heart beating</i> )

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.900
NARRATOR:
By 24 weeks, the vital organs
of the fetus are well formed;

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.600
the primitive heart
can beat on its own,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.860
the once powerless lungs

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.100
are now prepared
to fill with air

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.100
and the brain has
nearly its full compliment

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.500
of billions and billions
of neurons

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.600
reaching out to each other,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.060
building connections
with mind-boggling speed,

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.430
nearly two million
every second,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.300
until the brain has become
a tightly packed network

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.960
of trillions
of crisscrossing wires

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.330
with more connections
than stars in the sky.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:42.000
SHATZ:
You can imagine the size
of the wiring problem.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.400
So, how's that problem solved?

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.500
How is that achieved
during development?

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.130
How is that each one of those
trillion connections

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.760
is made appropriately?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.260
You might think,
"Oh, what a mess.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.730
It's just going to be a jumble
of connections and wires

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.230
all over the place."

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.930
But in fact, the nervous system
seems to have a strategy.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.430
NARRATOR:
The strategy is in the genes.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.900
The brain begins to wire itself

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:12.100
by following a precisely
specified genetic blueprint.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.000
SHATZ:
The connections are following
very defined rules.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.630
You know, "Go out of the eye,
turn right at the optic chiasm,

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:26.300
cross the chiasm, head toward
the lateral geniculate nucleus,

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.500
grow into
the lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.000
Don't grow into the medial
geniculate nucleus

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.060
because that's
an auditory structure.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.900
So you can imagine the first
stage of brain wiring

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.900
is kind of like solving
the problem

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.930
of connecting phones in New York
to phones in Boston;

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:43.560
making sure that
you're making connections

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.600
between Boston and New York and
not Boston and Washington, D.C.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.960
And that's all specified
genetically.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.530
Now then, there's a second phase
of brain wiring.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.800
Let's say you want
to place a phone call

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.560
to your grandmother in New York,
and you want<i> that</i> phone to ring,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.260
you know, on Park Avenue
and 47th, or wherever,

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.700
and you don't want the phone to
ring up at the Waldorf Astoria.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.100
Okay, how do you get
that precise phone to ring?

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.960
That's the second phase
of brain wiring.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.730
If you place a phone call
to your grandmother

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.800
early in development...

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.260
Her phone will ring...

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.330
But so will
a lot of other phones.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.400
So there are a lot of
connections that are made.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.360
If the connections are correct
and being used,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.460
they get strengthened.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.430
If they're not being used

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.130
or if they're only being used
occasionally, they're lost.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.860
We could call it
"use it or lose it."

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.260
So the fetal brain is really
a dynamic structure

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.700
that's constantly changing
in response to this process

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.330
of strengthening
appropriate connections

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.930
and pruning
inappropriate connections.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.460
Getting the circuits
all tuned up takes a long time

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.060
so it can't happen overnight

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.800
because you have literally
billions of connections
to check.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.800
(<i> fetus's heart beating</i> )

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.500
When a child
is born prematurely,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.960
the process is only partly over.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.330
So a huge amount of brain wiring

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:45.130
is having to happen
in the nursery.

So, it's dynamic,
it's biological.

It's not like the hardware in
your computer that you put in,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.500
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Yeah, it's bright in here
for you, I know.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.630
We may be able
to do something about that.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.200
NARRATOR:
Elizabeth doesn't know it yet,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.530
but Heideleise Als has now
become part of her life.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.760
ALS:
The brain is faced
with more challenges

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.000
than the brain
would be faced in the womb.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.130
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Yes, you like
to be upright, yes.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:52.300
ALS:
In the womb, she doesn't get
food directly into her stomach.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:58.000
She gets food via the digestive
system of the mother.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.400
And she isn't lying in a bed.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.800
She has all that support.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.000
And she doesn't have
to breathe on her own.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.030
The mother's whole body
takes care of it.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.160
The pre-terms can see...
they hear,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.260
yet they can't manage themselves

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.430
in the same way
that a full-term child does.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.360
(<i> quietly</i> ):
And if I move you
a little bit

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.300
you won't like that
so much.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.960
ALS:
They will be much more
hypersensitive

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.560
more easily overstimulated.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.730
Few impressions
can be managed easily.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.430
They all go in and flood, yeah.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:43.230
So you have these
big overreactive responses

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.000
that cost the baby tremendously.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.830
So then you say, "Well,
can I do something about it?"

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.530
WOMAN (<i> quietly</i> ):
I think I can't really see
where you are.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:55.660
How you doing there?

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.460
I can't see her face,
can you see her face?

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.800
Mm-hmm, she looks okay.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.130
All right

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.200
Her nose isn't
covered up or 
anything, so...

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.030
There, make you
warm again, okay?

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.660
NARRATOR:
Als has demonstrated that a
carefully controlled environment

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.160
tuned to a premie's
special needs

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.530
will help them better manage the
world around them as they grow.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.900
Elizabeth has spent
her short life

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.400
in an intensive care unit
specially designed by Als.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.500
MOTHER:
Everything is gentle and slow,

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.900
trying to be quiet
with the baby...

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.600
(<i> squealing</i> )

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.030
(<i> mother shushing quietly</i> )

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.660
Trying to emulate the womb

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.700
where she would hear muffled
sounds, and it'd be dark.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.000
And then,
the skin-to-skin contact.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.760
She can hear my heart.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.960
And that she's close to me,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.930
and, and it's nice
because she does...

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.060
does seem to recognize me.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.160
She settles down and finds
her spot and settles in,

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.130
and, and that's a great feeling.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:03.860
When you're leaving her care

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.260
up to people
who are much more qualified

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.830
for most of her daily life,

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.330
it's nice to know
that she knows who mom is.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:14.960
(<i> Elizabeth fusses briefly</i> )

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.160
Okay...

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:23.800
ALS:
The mother or father
can do so much better

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.860
in helping her be relaxed.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.100
(<i> quietly</i> ):
Okay, got your fingers now,
good girl.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.100
ALS:
The mother has the baby
on the breast.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:37.000
That's what the brain, that's
what the body of the baby--

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.200
the nervous system-- has been
promised: the womb, the breast,

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.530
the closeness of holding,
the body of the parent,

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.800
and the family, the social group

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.660
that makes
that family feel confident.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.360
Somebody's got
to open up the car.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.100
I will.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.700
NARRATOR:
Elizabeth was strong enough
to go home

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.200
when she was six weeks old.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.700
Now, it's up to her parents
to continue the gentle care

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.860
begun in the hospital.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:30.130
(<i> Elizabeth fussing quietly</i> )

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.360
(<i> quietly</i> ):
All right,  
it's all right...

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.230
(<i> quietly shushing</i> )

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.230
Welcome home.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:39.930
(<i> continuing to shush</i> )

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.360
NARRATOR:
She'll be going back
to see Dr. Als in two months...

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.800
Just after she was supposed
to have been born.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.430
Als wants to compare
Elizabeth's brain

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.360
to the brains
of other premature babies,

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.930
premies who spent
the first days of their lives

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.100
in a standard hospital
intensive care unit.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.560
Will the special treatment
Elizabeth received

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.000
make a difference?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.460
How much influence
does the world around us have

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.230
on the developing brain?

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.760
To help answer that question,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.860
neuroscientists turned
to a small animal

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.430
immortalized in a portrait
by Leonardo Da Vinci

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.730
over 500 years ago...
the ferret.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.830
MAN:
The most fundamental question

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.100
in understanding
how the brain develops

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.260
has to be the interaction
between nature and nurture.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.430
We know that
the brain has different areas

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.860
that do different things,

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:08.800
such as the visual cortex
at the back of the brain...

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.000
or the auditory cortex
in the middle of the brain.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.060
How do these areas
get to be where they are

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:20.030
and how do they do what
they end up doing in the adult?

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:26.300
NARRATOR:
How plastic is the brain,
how flexible?

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.260
Can nurture trump
what nature intended?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.330
In a series
of elegant experiments,

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.560
neuroscientist Mriganka Sur

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.500
restructured the brains
of newborn ferrets.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.430
In the normal ferret,

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.860
light striking the eye
creates electrical waves

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.260
that travel
to the visual cortex.

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.830
Sur rewired the ferret's brain,

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.360
hooking up the eyes
to the auditory cortex,

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.230
showering the hearing parts
of the brain

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.300
with electric waves
generated by the light.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.100
SUR:
We reasoned that if we can make
visual inputs from the eye

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:15.530
go to the auditory cortex
that normally processes hearing,

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:20.060
would the hearing cortex
now become like a visual cortex

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.600
or a seeing cortex

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.830
if it grew up with vision
rather than with audition?

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.630
Would the hearing cortex
now come to have

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.860
the same circuits
and connections

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.860
that mark the visual cortex?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.900
If it doesn't, then nature,
or the genetic endowment,

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.900
is of the essence.

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.100
If it does, then
the inputs are important,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.930
or nurture is important,
and the animal would see.

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.530
NARRATOR:
By recording a series of images

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:55.600
directly from the brains
of his rewired ferrets,

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.000
Sur provided evidence
that the ferrets could see.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.160
With normal ferrets,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.400
the activity of the neurons
in the visual cortex

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.160
takes on a characteristic
pinwheel shape.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.300
With the rewired ferrets,

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.930
the auditory cortex describes
a similar pinwheel design.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.000
The brain has been transformed,
but not entirely.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.400
SUR:
Instead of 20/20 vision,

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.860
they will have, let's say,
20/60 vision,

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.900
meaning that they see at 20 feet

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.500
what a normal ferret
would see at 60 feet.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.630
NARRATOR:
The characteristic pinwheel
is still there

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.100
but it is less orderly.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.730
Slurred.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.060
Environment shapes the brain

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.160
but can't completely change
genetic destiny.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:54.030
SUR:
Our experiments demonstrate
beautifully, I think,

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.830
the interaction of nature
and nurture.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:02.600
I believe that the environment
writes on a developing brain

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.060
but does not write
on a blank slate.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.030
There is a structure
that comes about due to genes

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:14.100
which then is influenced further
by the environment

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.730
that the brain is developing in.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.630
Our experiments provide
very clear evidence

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.460
of the remarkable plasticity
of the brain.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.730
NARRATOR:
Three weeks after the day she
was supposed to have been born,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.930
Elizabeth's parents brought
her back to see Heidelise Als

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.760
at Children's Hospital
in Boston.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.000
Does the brain's
remarkable plasticity

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.200
make preemies like Elizabeth
especially vulnerable?

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.400
Does an intensive care unit
that mimics the womb

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.160
have a demonstrable effect
on the brain?

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:15.430
(<i> beads rattling</i> )

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.160
NARRATOR:
Once again, Als observed
Elizabeth carefully.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.060
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.300
ALS:
How are you doing,
Elizabeth?

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.060
Hi, beautiful girl?

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.230
Did we wake you up
out of your sleep?

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:39.030
(<i> chimes ringing</i> )

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.660
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.830
That was great.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.030
That was great.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:51.500
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:32:51.500 --> 00:33:02.060
(<i> chimes ringing</i> )

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:07.030
ALS:
The toy really captured
her attention.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:11.460
(<i> chimes ringing</i> )

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.760
And she just brightened
right up to it

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.030
and had her eyebrows up
and her eyes curious

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.560
and her face shaped forward

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.760
and she followed very smoothly
in all directions

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.630
and up and to the side
and in the full arc.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.600
So that's wonderful

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.760
for just about three weeks
after due date

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:38.660
and she did very nicely
with the light

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.560
so although
that kept coming,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.800
she shut it out

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.630
with just a little bit
of breathing adjustment

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.260
on her part.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.760
Uh, in terms
of her strength

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.430
and all her
reflex repertoire,

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.230
she's symmetrical,
she's strong

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.560
and she came
to alertness.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.230
I mean, she's really
come together.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.500
That's very impressive,
yeah.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.330
So overall, you've done
a remarkable job

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.200
in supporting her,
yeah.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:13.830
It's not trivial,
a little baby, yeah.

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.700
NARRATOR:
Elizabeth appeared
to be doing well.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.330
But she was enlisted
in another round of tests

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:31.460
to learn if her behavior
corresponded

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.060
to measurable changes
in her brain.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:45.100
DUFFY:
No one has really
done this before.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.700
It's only been recently
that we've had the experience

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.000
to say, "Is it possible

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.600
"that our intervention
may actually be visible

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.100
"in terms of a change
in physical development

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.330
of brain parameters?"

00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:01.600
Can we actually see it
in the brain?"

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.730
NARRATOR:
It's still too early
to draw conclusions.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:10.430
But we do know something
about Elizabeth.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:15.030
Pictures from the MRI
reveal normal brain maturation.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.160
And as for the results
of her EEG:

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.830
DUFFY:
Oh, she's surpassed.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:23.700
Caught up, and surpassed
what I would expect.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.900
It's a very nice, normal,
exemplary full-term EEG

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.660
that I could put in a textbook
as an example.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.730
"To what can we attribute this?"

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:39.430
This will be the result
of our study.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:43.000
As scientists, we have
to be very cautious

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.330
not to overinterpret
individual cases.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:49.460
Uh, it's entirely possible
that her improvement

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.000
was through her own
internal fortitude

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.900
and that we were bit players
in this... in this great game

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.830
of growing up.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.430
On the other hand,
we might have been very crucial.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.260
And we'll never know, because
we can't wind the clock back

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.000
and not do the intervention
on her.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.700
So what we have to do
is have a population

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:11.760
where there is no intervention,
population with an intervention

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.630
and compare them as a group.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.500
There will always be a star
in the nonintervened group

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.430
who comes through well,
and there will always be someone

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.360
that we...
we just couldn't help, uh,

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.700
but on the average
is what we're looking for

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.430
and that's what the scientific
method is all about.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.600
Elizabeth.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.060
NARRATOR:
Whatever the reason, Elizabeth
is improving every day.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.230
Hi...

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.960
How's my girl?

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.400
NARRATOR:
And for her parents,
that's enough.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.600
MOTHER:
There's a great possibility

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.030
for Elizabeth to have, uh,
normal brain development.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.960
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.630
And that's just such
a huge gift.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:53.460
My hope when she was born was

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.960
that by the time she reached
kindergarten age, people...

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.630
she would just blend in
with her class, um,

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.200
but there seems to be
a very good chance

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.900
that on her first birthday,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.760
she will be starting
to toddle

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.400
like any other
one-year-old

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.400
and that...
that would be great.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:25.900
NARRATOR:
Premature or full-term,

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.400
every baby is faced
with the same challenge.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:36.030
(<i> baby cooing</i> )

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.500
Awash in novel sights
and sounds,

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.500
babies must begin to learn

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.830
how to navigate
a roiling sea of sensations.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.300
WOMAN:
There's a huge task
in organizing the world

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:53.160
that must be difficult,
but the babies seem to do it.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.930
They act like little scientists.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:38:01.360
They actively explore and
construct a view of the world

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.860
and in that sense,
they are parallel

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.300
to what we as scientists, uh,
do our entire lives

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.130
and what, uh, all of us do

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:12.430
as we try to negotiate
a very complicated world

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.660
that's constantly under change.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.830
NARRATOR:
Babies are
exquisitely sensitive.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.330
A newborn can identify
his mother's whispered coos,

00:38:29.330 --> 00:38:31.860
respond to the fragrance
of her body

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.230
and the sweet taste
of her milk...

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:40.630
Even recognize her face.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.600
WOMAN:
When you're holding your baby
and rocking him in your arms

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.130
and peering down at him,

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.930
your face happens
to be the distance

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.100
that babies like
to look at most of all.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.860
And in fact,
even by two days of age,

00:38:55.860 --> 00:39:01.830
a newborn baby can recognize
his mother from sight alone.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.230
Now, that's quite
a remarkable ability

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.930
for a baby that has
a poorly developed eye

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:10.100
and for a baby that has
a poorly developed brain.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.600
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.530
NARRATOR:
Vision is the last
of the senses to develop.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.300
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.560
With an immature eye
sending wobbly signals

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.000
to a still developing brain,
it's no surprise

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.360
that a baby looks out on
a different world than an adult.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.100
LEWIS:
What the baby is seeing then,

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.530
we think looks something
like a faded photograph.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:41.930
If you take a photograph

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.900
and sort of fade it out
so that it's all washed out

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.430
and if you're looking at the
faded photograph through a tube,

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.930
then that is what
the world would look like

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.600
to a newborn baby.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:57.500
The fact that the baby
doesn't see very well

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.800
in a sense is very good
for an immature brain

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.600
and that's because
this immature brain

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.030
cannot handle
excess stimulation.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.730
So what the eye is doing

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:10.830
is dampening down
that external stimulation,

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:14.960
making it something that the
brain can handle much better.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.430
But it's also important
to remember

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:21.160
that no matter how dampened down
that stimulation is

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.230
that's going into
this very immature brain,

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.360
that stimulation is critical.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.260
NARRATOR:
What happens
if the brain doesn't get

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.030
the stimulation it needs?

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.200
What if light falls
upon the eye

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.530
but never reaches
its destination?

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.260
Holly McMillan
is just five weeks old.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.060
A healthy, normal baby.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.700
But her right eye
is clouded by a faulty lens--

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:51.560
a cataract
that must be removed at once

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.700
or she will never see
like a normal child.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.900
WOMAN:
On the day that she was born,

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.430
we noticed that her eye--
her right eye--

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:06.930
didn't open as wide
as, uh, her left eye.

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.730
But in my family,

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:11.030
I have a sister and my father
that have an eye

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.400
that's a little bit--
just a little bit smaller

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.300
than the other, so we didn't
really think anything of it.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.800
But we were informed

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.600
that we would have to have
surgery to remove the lens.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.830
From what we hear, the sooner
the better for the surgery,

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:28.160
so hopefully it's soon enough.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:33.130
Basically this is...
after all our discussions

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.130
that we had before,
this is the final form

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.030
that just gives
me permission
to go ahead

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.530
and do the right eye,
all right?

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:39.700
Mm-hmm.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.800
That way
I won't forget.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.960
MAN:
For a baby, it's really urgent
that we get in there

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.600
because if a baby
has a cataract, uh,

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.960
the images that are supposed
to be getting in--

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.600
those images which are critical

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.100
for the brain to be able
to develop its vision--

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.030
uh, those images
aren't getting there

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.100
and as a result, the brain
is not getting the opportunity

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.430
to experience vision

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.630
and go through its normal
visual development

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:06.400
which allows it
to eventually create

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.630
the healthy, normal vision
that we all know.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.330
When Grandma has a cataract,

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:13.500
all of her connections
between eye and brain

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.460
have been formed years ago

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.930
and they remain stable
over time

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:21.700
so even if they're not used,
they don't go away.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:24.260
But when your child
has a cataract,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.100
it's the "use it or lose it"
game

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.300
that's being played
during development.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.430
It's still a period
of decision-making

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.000
and pruning of connections.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.030
In fact, even just one
or two months

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.360
of missing visual experience
from birth

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.900
can have permanent consequences
on the way that brain

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:47.260
is wired up and on what
that brain can do later on.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.060
She'll do fine.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.760
Okay, cutie pie.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:06.000
Thank you.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
All right, you'll see
her soon, okay?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Okay, thanks.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.160
We'll take good care
of her.

Okay, so there's the cataract
right there inside the eye.

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.060
(<i> monitors beeping</i> )

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.130
I've just got a little bit
of a piece left here

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.330
that I need to get rid of.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.260
Thank you.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.800
She's still
sound asleep.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.900
MOTHER:
Oh, what
a sweetie.

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.660
Now we're just going
to slip this in.

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.600
In the old days,
we used to do this under
general anesthesia,

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.230
but the nice thing
about this lens

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.960
is it allows us
to do it this way.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.360
NARRATOR:
Within a week of the operation,
Holly's eye has healed

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:31.300
and Dr. Levin inserts
a contact lens

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.160
which Holly will need
for the rest of her life.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.660
For the first time,

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.600
Holly's right eye is sending
clear images to her brain.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:44.160
The key is if you just put
your hand right underneath

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.930
so you can feel the eyeball
underneath, you'll be fine.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.730
All of a sudden it's as if
the eye was open to the brain.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.560
It's the same
as if the baby came out

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.960
of that dark, jet-black womb

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.800
and all of a sudden
opened their eyes

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.260
in a delivery room somewhere.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.630
NARRATOR:
But Holly's vision
is still in danger.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.160
For at least five years,

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.360
until her visual development
stabilizes,

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.400
she will have to wear a patch
for most of her waking hours

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.130
over her good left eye,

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.030
or else her brain
will never learn

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.660
to use the right eye to see.

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.360
LEWIS:
If the good eye was not patched,

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.200
there is no point
in having the surgery at all.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.800
There's no point
in having the contact lens.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.130
You have this weak eye

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:27.030
that has to fight
for cortical connections

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:30.260
with a totally normal,
strong, good eye.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.730
And that totally normal,
strong, good eye, if allowed,

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.060
will take over
all the brain space,

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.100
leave nothing
for the deprived eye,

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.000
and the deprived eye
will get weaker and weaker.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.960
Sounds a little
counterintuitive.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.930
Patching the good eye
should cause the same problem

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.400
that the cataract did.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.700
But, in fact, it doesn't,

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.060
and we really don't understand
why that is.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.960
And you can patch
that good eye intensely

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.430
and virtually never see
any adverse effect of that.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.100
That's one of our mysteries.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.960
LEWIS:
Now, Daddy, if you'll
just shut your eyes

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.300
as I show you
each one of these cards.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.330
NARRATOR:
Holly's cataract
has been removed.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:08.930
(<i> whistles</i> )

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.260
NARRATOR:
But how well can Holly see?

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.030
Okay, we got
one beautiful look
over there.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:18.000
NARRATOR:
Just minutes after Holly
receives her contact lens,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.700
psychologist Terri Lewis
examines her vision

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.330
by watching whether a finely
calibrated series of patterns

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.830
captures her attention.

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.630
You can't
play the game with
your eyes closed.

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:31.100
No, you can't.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.500
LEWIS:
We find that even
within ten minutes

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.560
of first being able to see...

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.060
(<i> whistles</i> )

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.030
the baby can see
as well as a normal newborn.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:44.630
That tells us that the brain
can mature up to some point

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.600
without any visual experience--

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.060
up to the newborn levels,

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.130
because certainly,
there's no visual experience

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:51.700
while the baby's in utero.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.560
NARRATOR:
Although cataract babies
like Holly

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.130
see as well as newborn babies,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.200
they don't see as well
as babies their own age.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.160
(<i> whistles</i> ):
Here we go, Holly.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.330
NARRATOR:
But they catch up quickly.

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.460
LEWIS:
It's shocking
how quickly vision improves

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.830
after that contact lens
is put in.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.030
We found that within one hour,

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.130
we have
a significant improvement

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:16.730
in how well the babies can see.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.960
Now, why this is so exciting is
because it tells us

00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.600
that although the brain
is no better

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.460
than that of a normal newborn

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.600
in the absence
of visual experience,

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.900
once it gets
that visual experience,

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.500
it's ready to go.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.560
It's champing at the bit,
because that first little bit,

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:37.530
even that first hour
of visual experience,

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:41.200
is going to send
that brain into action faster

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.500
than it would
in normal development.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.460
NARRATOR:
In a series of carefully
controlled studies

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.160
comparing normal babies
to cataract babies,

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.560
Lewis has found that,
as cataract babies grow,

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.200
their vision continues
to improve

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.700
until they reach
their first birthday.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.260
LEWIS:
The children do begin
falling behind after a year,

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.560
but, on average,
with early treatment

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.130
and complying
with doctor's instructions,

00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:27.800
the eye can end up being
a totally good, functioning eye.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.200
(<i> giggles</i> )

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:43.400
NARRATOR:
It has been seven months
since Holly's surgery,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.330
and her parents have been
diligently patching

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:47.960
her good eye.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.660
Holly.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:57.130
Here we go.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.130
(<i> blows

00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:59.130
Are you ready?

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.260
Looking at me.

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:02.860
That's a good girl.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.830
That was a nice
good look for me.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.760
NARRATOR:
Holly's vision is improving.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.160
Her cataract was removed early,

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.660
in time for her developing brain
to learn to see.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:18.030
The visual tapestry of the world
will be fully hers

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:19.660
for the rest of her life.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:22.660

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.530
Oh, good girl.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.700
Yes! That was really
good looking.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.500
(<i> cooing</i> )

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.460
NARRATOR:
When we are babies,
our brains are more open

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.900
to the shaping hand
of experience

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:43.200
than any time in our lives.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.000
In response to the demands
of the world,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.900
the baby's brain sculpts itself.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.860
(<i> giggling</i> )

00:49:55.730 --> 00:50:00.660
MCCONNELL:
I think the brain of a baby
is like a work in progress.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.830
We're not really building
circuits from scratch anymore.

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:07.630
But now a baby's experience
with the environment

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.430
can refine the circuit

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:13.200
and influence which connections
are stabilized

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.600
and which connections are lost.

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.900
SHATZ:
We really think of brain
development as a continuum.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:27.460
Although large sections
of wiring are permanent,

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:28.960
development doesn't stop.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.330
It's not over-- it keeps on
going as we grow older.

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.630
It doesn't ever stop,

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:37.560
and, in fact,
at the end of this program,

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.200
your brain is going
to be different

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.960
from the way it was
in the beginning,

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.530
because you've learned something

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.260
and remembered something,
hopefully,

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.430
or you've forgotten.

00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:46.730
But whatever you've done,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.530
it's different
from the way it was before.

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.560
NARRATOR:
Our brains are plastic.

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.660
As babies grow and develop,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.900
their brains adapt to the world
with a flexibility

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.800
that is the hallmark
of being human.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.300
SHATZ:
There's great mystery left.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.930
Our memories and our hopes
and our aspirations

and who we love, and all of that

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:19.060
is in there,
encoded in the circuits.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.000
And we only have the barest
beginnings of an understanding

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.860
about how all of these things
really work.
