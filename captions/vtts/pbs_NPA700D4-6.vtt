MAN: I think wolves are
probably the perfect

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.530
symbol of that earlier time before
we human beings set out to

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.930
conquer nature.

[Howling]

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.560
They're sort of the resistance
movement to everything that

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.300
we represent.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.900
The brothers and sisters of
the wolves' ancestors are

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.000
the ones who came over to the
campfire to join our ancestors

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and become our
most loyal pets.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.060
The wolves' ancestors are the
ones who refused to come into

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.060
the campfire, and we've never
really forgiven them for that.

[Howling]

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:10.300
They remained free, wild,
undomesticated, dangerous.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.730
And long after they no longer
posed a real threat to us

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.500
and our survival, I think we
still held it against them

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.900
that they were out there,
free and wild and dangerous,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.230
and went out to do as good
a job as we could of getting

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.930
rid of them.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.860
MAN: It is a better world
with some buffalo left in it.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.060
A richer world with some
gorgeous canyons unmarred by

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.300
sign boards or superhighways,
undrowned by power or

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.860
irrigation reservoirs.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.660
If we preserved as parks only
those places that have no

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.200
economic possibilities,
we would have no parks.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.430
And in the decades to come,
it will not be only

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.500
the buffalo and the trumpeter
swan who need sanctuaries.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.060
Our own species is going
to need them, too.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.200

Wallace Stegner.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.760
PETER COYOTE: Since its
beginnings in the mid-19th

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.160
century, the national park
idea had embraced two equally

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.360
important, yet apparently
contradictory thoughts--that

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.700
the park should preserve
America's special places

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.530
in their natural conditions
forever and that they should

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.560
be open and accessible for the
enjoyment of all Americans.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.830
Early park leaders had glossed
over any paradox, arguing that

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.230
the best way to protect the
parks was to build public

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.860
support for them by
encouraging more

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.860
and more visitors.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.060
But with the end of World War
II, as the parks neared their

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.660
100th birthday and an
increasingly affluent

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.500
and mobile nation placed
demands on them as never

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.000
before, the balancing act
between preservation and use

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.060
would be severely tested.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.130
MAN: It's hard to imagine
these places existing without

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.560
those tensions.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.760
They are precisely the right
tensions that a democratic

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.300
nation should have as it tries
to figure out how to protect

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.700
lands that are there
for all the people.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.630
COYOTE: The very definition
of what constituted a national

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.430
park would be challenged and
then broadened, and just when

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.900
it seemed as if there were no
pristine places left to set

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.630
aside as national parks,
a new one would be created

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.930
in the backyard of
one of the nation's

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.230
fastest growing cities.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.400
While far to the north, in
the nation's last frontier,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.260
the basic principles of
the park idea would be

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.630
reinvigorated for
a new generation.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.100

works this way, but we seem to

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.830
put our highest ideals in
our national parks.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.260
They're like, um, homes
for our finest dreams,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.660
and therefore they function
like consciences.

MAN: When you're standing
there silently in the presence

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.500
of the giant sequoias,
you can't help but recognize

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.200
that you're a part of
something that is way beyond

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.130
whatever it is that you
envision this world might be.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.900
You can't stand there all
alone without understanding

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.400
that there's a power in the
world that is far greater than

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.330
anything that you've ever
experienced and that you're

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.960
connected to that power just
as that sequoia is connected

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.400
to that power.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.730
It permeates all of us.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.660
And when you understand that,
it improves your relationship

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.400
with your fellow man because
you realize that he has

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.130
the same capacity.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.500
He has the same access.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.000

189,000 to 807,000.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.100

Everyone was tired of the war.

Everyone wanted recreation.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.030
Everybody flocked to
Yellowstone in their own cars.

There weren't

There weren't

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.760
There weren't enough anything,
and the buildings had had 4 or

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.800
5 years to deteriorate, so
the park facilities were

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.100
in bad shape.

States, the same thing was

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:02.800
happening in other parks,
straining the entire system.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.330
Nationwide, annual attendance
would climb from a wartime low

happened in the 1950s with the

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.430
explosion of families in cars
taking their kids on the road

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.060
to visit the national parks
was that more and more

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.300
American children grew up
with the national parks as

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.200
a formative part of their
childhood, and I think we

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.100
often forget that in fact one
of the aspects of the national

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.000
parks that is most important
to our American-ness, to our

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.860
patriotism, is the fact that
they are landscapes of origin

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.000
and of childhood for
so many Americans.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.700
They are the places
where we grew up.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.560
They are the places where
we experienced our families

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.800
in some of their most intimate
locations and where our

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.700
families and our childhoods
connected to what it meant to

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.860
be an American.

In those days,
there was no road.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.630
The park was all a blessed
wilderness, and I have often

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.900
thought since, what a
wonderful people we would have

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.730

to keep it that way.

Adolph Murie.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.860
COYOTE: Back in the summer of
1922, a college student from

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.700
Moorhead, Minnesota, named
Adolph Murie arrived in

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:56.430
Mt. McKinley National
Park in Alaska.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.930
The park had been established
5 years earlier, but Congress

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.600
had only recently appropriated
any money for its protection

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.130
and development--$8,000 used
to hire a superintendent

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.330
and one assistant, who were
instructed to patrol 2,200

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:19.530
square miles, an area
half the size of Connecticut.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.230
They were also expected to
keep poachers away from the

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.430
wildlife and prepare the park
for the tourists promoters

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.760
hoped would soon be coming
to see the highest mountain

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.160
in North America.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.200
That year, a total of
7 showed up.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.430
One of them was Adolph Murie,
who was there to help his

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.300
older brother Olaus,
a biologist, conduct a study

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.030
of caribou migrations.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.630
Murie was 22 years old.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.530
It was his first time
away from Minnesota.

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.030
MAN: Ade Murie was
not an imposing

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.230
or intimidating-looking
kind of a man.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:06.530
He kind of had a Minnesota
farmer's look about him,

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.860
and I don't mean that as
an insult, but he was not

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.760
an overwhelming
person by looks.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.700
He was,
however, in terms of character

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:25.160
and intelligence and durability
and stick-to-it-iveness,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.960
a man to be reckoned with.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.700
COYOTE: For 5 weeks, Murie and
his brother tramped for miles

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.300
across the tundra, following
game trails and the braided

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.800
gravel beds of glacial rivers,
exulting in the notion that

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.960
they seemingly had the park
entirely to themselves.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.330
One day he came across
the lone footprint of

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.230
a grizzly bear.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.100
MAN AS ADOLPH MURIE: In
innocent wonder, I gazed

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.560
at the imprint.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:02.960
It was a symbol more poetic
than seeing the bear himself,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.600
a delicate and profound
approach to the spirit

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.260
of the Alaska wilderness.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.460
We come here to catch a
glimpse of the primeval.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.460
We come close to the
tundra flowers, the lichens,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.060
and the animal life.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.660
Each of us will take
some inspiration home.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.700
A touch of tundra will enter
our lives and deep inside make

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:35.160
of us all poets and
kindred spirits.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.630
COYOTE: Adolph Murie's trip
to Alaska inspired him to get

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.630
a doctoral degree in biology,
and George Melendez Wright

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.730
recruited him for the Park
Service's newly formed

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.760
Wildlife Division.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.600
By the late 1940s, Murie had
made a name for himself as

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.900
a top-rate field biologist and
as an iconoclast whose views

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.000
on the direction of park
policies often got him

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.560
in trouble with his superiors.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.760

where wolves had been hunted

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.700
to extinction years earlier,
he called for

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.960
their reintroduction.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.400
No one listened.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.800
At Isle Royale in Lake
Superior, the moose population

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.800
had grown so plentiful
because of a lack of natural

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.900
predators, he wrote, that
the park looked "like

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.500
"a prosperous barnyard."

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.400
And at Yellowstone, Murie
objected to plans to build

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.260
a golf course and opposed a
proposal to drain a wetlands

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.960
around the Old Faithful Lodge
in order to reduce the number

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:44.700
of mosquitoes bothering
the tourists there.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.560
MAN AS ADOLPH MURIE: Let us
leave a few wilderness shrines.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.960
Let there be a few outstanding
scenes which can be viewed

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:58.130
without the attendant
chatter of the idly curious.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.660
MAN: The heart of the
legislation that established

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.160
Yellowstone and the other
parks is to preserve

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.900
the environment.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:15.000
It's as simple as that, and if
you're going to preserve

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.160
the environment, you have to
preserve the creatures,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.860
the critters, that live there.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.330
COYOTE: Like his mentor
George Melendez Wright, Murie

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.800
believed many long-held
assumptions about predators

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.200
needed to be scientifically
tested, and he spent two years

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.060
studying what to do about
Yellowstone's coyotes.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.960
The answer, he concluded,
was not killing the hated

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.060
predators but changing
park policies.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.860
SCHULLERY: When he produced
his study of the coyotes

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.030
in Yellowstone and
demonstrated that they weren't

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.830
this--this scourge on the
landscape and how they

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:01.860
actually functioned compared
to how people thought they

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.500
functioned, that they weren't
turning Yellowstone into

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.930
a reservoir of evil that
produced countless coyotes

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.100
that went out and killed off
ranchers' livestock, it took

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.530
a long time for that
lesson to soak in.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.760
COYOTE: Yellowstone's
superintendent was so upset,

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.400
he shelved the report and
nearly got Murie fired.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.600
Now one of only 3 biologists
left in the Wildlife Division,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.130
Murie was dispatched to the
nation's most remote and least

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:38.700
visited national park--Mt.
McKinley in Alaska, the park

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.660
that had made such a profound
impression on him years

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.830
earlier, and once again
he would find himself

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:49.460
on the unpopular side of a
raging controversy when he

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:55.300
embarked on the first in-depth
study ever undertaken of wolves.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:06.500
MAN: The wolf is the master
killer of all wildlife,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.160
the villain in Alaska's
pageant of wildlife,

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.760
and the worst natural enemy
of sheep, moose, and caribou.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.200
Alaska Game Commission.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.100
BROWN: Wolves represented
death and destruction.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.700
That bloodthirsty, ravening
wolf was viewed as a kind

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.030
of an interloper.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.360
I mean, you had
the nice animals.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:40.860
You had caribou and deer and
sheep, and here were these

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.630
wolves who would tear them
apart and eat them in full

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.630
view of visitors, and
that was anathema.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.860
I mean, extinction
was the word.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.530
COYOTE: Americans had been
killing wolves for centuries.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:05.000
Despite a Park Service policy
against the extermination

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.400
of any animal species,
they had been systematically

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.800
eliminated at Grand Canyon,
Crater Lake, Death Valley,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.930
Grand Tetons, Mt. Rainier,
Olympic, Rocky Mountain,

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.760
and after the death of two
wolf pups in 1926, Yellowstone

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.030
National Park.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.800
Alaska was now virtually the
only place left in the United

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.430
States where wolves
still existed.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.900
WOMAN: At one time, the Park
Service was ordered to shoot

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.760
every wolf they saw.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.930
They figured that anything
a wolf gets, the hunter

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.500
doesn't get.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:54.230
But just to shoot wolves to
say they shot a wolf--let's--

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:57.060
let's shoot Democrats.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.660
Let's shoot Republicans.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.060
I mean, it made
that much sense.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:04.530
COYOTE: During his first
season back in Alaska,

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.430
Murie walked more than
1,700 miles, crisscrossing

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.400
the park, gathering data and
whenever possible taking

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.300
photographs and home movies
to augment his extensive

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.000
field notes.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.760
He analyzed more than 1,000
samples of wolf droppings

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:27.200
to determine their eating
habits, collected 829 skulls

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.400
of Dall's sheep to study their
teeth and understand the age

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.730
and health of the
animals when they died.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:41.460
His second year,
he discovered a wolf den.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.460
MAN AS ADOLPH MURIE: On
a ridge across the river

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:46.060
from the den,
about a half mile or less

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.500
away, there were excellent
locations for watching

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.660
the wolves without
disturbing them.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.200
I spent about 195
hours observing them.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:03.800
The longest continuous vigil
was 33 hours, and twice I

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.100
observed all night.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.260
MARTIN MURIE: Well, you've got
to have patience. Oh, yeah.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.160
You have to be devoted.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.360
If you have to climb a tree
in 30 below and sit there

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.600
for an hour shivering,
you do it.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.260
Every day you're out there.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.460
Doesn't matter
what the weather.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.360
He was that type.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.760
COYOTE: He would be at it for
nearly a decade, even moved

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.700
his wife and children to
a remote cabin in the park

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.560
and temporarily adopted a wolf
pup he named Wags so he could

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.930
study its development as it grew
from a nursling to full size.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.160
Over time, Murie would get to
know wolves better than any

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.060
scientist ever had, and the
report he produced would

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:05.860
become a landmark in
understanding the species.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.430
WOMAN: I often think if
we were to send

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.830
for a representative of our
species to meet with the

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.960
animals, we would send Ade
because he's a man who knows

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.330
how to listen.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.060
He was a man who
understood stillness.

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:25.360
And more than anything,
his curiosity and his

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.960
extraordinary sense of science
opened up the landscape

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.500
in a new way for all of us.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.930
He saw the land as a set
of relationships, nothing

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:41.430
in isolation,
everything connected.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.160
COYOTE: Murie's conclusions
that wolves actually

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.530
strengthened the sheep and
caribou herds by culling out

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.660
the sick and the weak were
denounced by hunting groups

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.500
across the country as a piece
of pro-wolf propaganda from

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.430
start to finish.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.700
As private bounty hunters
and federal Fish and Wildlife

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.560
Service officers initiated
a campaign of poisoning

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.160
and shooting wolves throughout
the rest of Alaska, pressure

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.960
mounted for the park
to eradicate its wolves, too.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.630
In response, the Park Service
agreed to a limited wolf

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.560
control program, but the
person they selected to

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.860
oversee it was none other than
Adolph Murie, who kept the

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.860
number of kills to the barest
minimum, thinning out only

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:37.860
elderly wolves near the end
of their natural lives.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.200
And when the sheep herd grew,
just as Murie had predicted,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.300
the Park Service quietly
instituted a permanent ban

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.500
on all wolf killings.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.200
It was the first time in
history that the species

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.230
nearly everyone seemed to
hate found protection from any

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.460
government agency.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:06.460
McKinley's wolves
had survived.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.460
MAN AS ADOLPH MURIE: Our
generosity to all creatures

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.230
in the national parks,
this reverence for life,

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.530
is a basic tradition and is
fundamental to the survival

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.630
of park idealism.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.160
The goal is to have the
minimum of manipulation

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.160
in our parks.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.360
Let us be guardians
rather than gardeners.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.730
Adolph Murie.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.500
MAN: With so many friends,
it is difficult to understand

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.730
why parks are so bedeviled by
threats and seem always to be

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:07.230
fighting for their
very existence.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.360
The story is an old one.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.300
There are frequent occasions
when people see nothing wrong

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:17.360
with harming, hurting,
marring, or spoiling when

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.430
there are valuable resources
of water, power, timber, oil,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:28.100
or minerals to be exploited
within park boundaries.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.030
Greatest of all threats to the
parks today is the pressure to

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.700
build dams.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.930
Alfred A. Knopf.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.430
COYOTE: By 1950, Americans who
needed dams for irrigation,

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.560
city water supplies,
and hydropower had been

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.400
in conflict for half a century
with other Americans who

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.930
wanted national parks kept off
limits from any development.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.600
John Muir had fought and lost
the first battle when the city

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.860
of San Francisco used its
political muscle to win

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.500
federal approval for building
a dam in the beautiful Hetch

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.830
Hetchy Valley within
the boundaries

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.500
of Yosemite National Park.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.730
The defeat had galvanized the
nascent conservation movement

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.000
into pushing for creation
of the National Park Service

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.830
in 1916 to make sure nothing
like Hetch Hetchy would ever

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:27.660
happen again.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.960
Now in the aftermath
of World War II,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.230
as the populations of states
in the arid west began to

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:42.530
skyrocket, pressure for
more dams only intensified.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.860
With the enthusiastic backing
of virtually every elected

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.000
official in the region,
plans were drawn up for

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.260
9 billion dollars' worth of
dam projects, including two

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.660
in a remote corner of Utah
and Colorado where the Green

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.600
and Yampa Rivers converge in
the midst of winding sandstone

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.630
canyons, a place
known as Echo Park.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.460
But Echo Park was also the
site of Dinosaur National

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:20.330
Monument, first set aside in
1915 to safeguard an important

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:25.800
discovery of prehistoric bones
and then expanded in the 1930s

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.060
to include the dramatic
canyonlands upstream.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.330
Few people had ever visited
the monument or paddled

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.230
through its network of
canyons, but the handful who

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.860
had considered
it almost sacred.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.660
MAN AS WALLACE STEGNER:
This is a country as grand

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.430
and beautiful as any
America can boast.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:58.060
A 325-square-mile preserve
that is part schoolroom

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.330
and part playground and part--
the best part--sanctuary from

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:10.060
a world paved with concrete,
a world mass-produced

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.100
with interchangeable parts,
and with every natural,

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:19.230
beautiful thing endangered
by the raw engineering power

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.260
of the 20th century.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.260
Wallace Stegner.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.200
COYOTE: Even though the Park
Service opposed the dams,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.760
President Harry Truman and
his Secretary of the Interior

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.860
supported them.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.160
It was Hetch Hetchy
all over again.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.660
It was exactly the same battle,
but the world had changed.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.900
There were now many more
people prepared to say that,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.600
wait a second.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.530
The national parks are not
supposed to be breached

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.530
in this way.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.800
We are not meant to
do this kind of work.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:02.800
COYOTE: In 1952, with 2 of
his 7 sons and their families,

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.360
a 73-year-old retired
chemistry professor named

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.860
Harold Bradley made a week-
long trip down the Yampa

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.860
River, snapping photographs
and taking home movies as

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.000
they traveled.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.000
They had imagined that a
desert region named Dinosaur

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.830
would be little more than
an arid, desolate boneyard,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.500
one son remembered.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.160
Instead, they found a world
of stunning beauty.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.030
MAN: My dad knew that there
were plans on the drawing

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.400
board for dams in Grand Canyon
and dams that would affect

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.360
Glacier Park and
other parks, too.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.930
If Echo Park Dam could be
built, I think a dam could

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.660
have been built anywhere in
the national park system,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.300
and they'd say, "Well, you
let us do it at Echo Park.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.260
"Why not do it here
in Grand Canyon?"

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.200
COYOTE: Back home in
California, Bradley embarked

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.860
on what he called "a one-man
crusade to save Echo Park" by

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.430
showing his home movie to
anyone who would watch it.

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.130
Among those who saw it
was David Brower, the new

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.700
Executive Director of the
Sierra Club--young and brash

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.930
with a flair for
public relations.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.160
MAN: When I was 8 years old
and when my brother was 6,

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.830
we went down the Yampa and
Green Rivers, and it was part

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:05.560
of my father's campaign to
stop dams in Dinosaur National

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.460
Monument, and it--you know,
I look back on it now and I

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.960
realize what a piece
of history it was.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.930
Many people see it as the
beginning of the modern

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.660
environmental movement.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:20.230
My father used film,
used books, used trips like

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.830
this down the river.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.500
He was building a constituency
of people to appreciate

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.160
this landscape.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.960
COYOTE: Brower organized
Sierra Club outings through

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.060
Dinosaur's canyons and invited
influential Easterners to

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.930
join them.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.830
Alfred A. Knopf, the New York
publisher, emerged from one

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:44.530
trip so impressed that he
commissioned a handsome book

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.130
of photographs and essays,
edited by the novelist

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.830
and historian Wallace Stegner.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.100
Knopf himself wrote one of
the book's essays and made

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.660
sure every member of
Congress received a copy.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.130
Other organizations sprang
into action, hoping to

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.730
mobilize public opinion and
kill the project in Congress,

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.560
where approval of the dam
seemed almost certain.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.260
Harold Bradley helped persuade
the Garden Club of America to

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:24.460
oppose the dam and mail
leaflets to its members

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.360
encouraging them to write
their Congressmen about it.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.730
The General Federation
of Women's Clubs did

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:32.760
the same thing.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.200
My brother Steve was the
one that got Pop interested,

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.330
and Pop was the one who got
Dave Brower interested,

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:42.260
and Dave Brower, once he was
interested, kind of galvanized

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.360
the entire conservation
community, and Echo Park

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.730
really kind of put
conservation on the front page

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.700
for the first time instead
of something back

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.230
with the obituaries.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.230
COYOTE: When mail began
pouring into Congress

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.630
at a ratio of 80:1 against the
Echo Park dam, the Speaker

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.960
of the House reluctantly
delayed consideration

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.130
of its approval.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.800
Authorization for the larger
string of dams and reclamation

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.930
projects would eventually
pass, but without the ones

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.060
in Dinosaur National Monument.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.930
Public opinion had been felt.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.360
A new national environmental
movement had been born

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.700
and immediately began battling
against any other attempts to

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:37.130
despoil the parks and
America's wild places.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:41.730
DUNCAN: You can save a place,
but it's never really safe.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:44.500
It always takes people caring.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.900
It always takes vigilance.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:52.700
It always takes effort to keep
those forces at bay that want

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.430
to crowd in, want to
change it, want to

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:57.430
over-commercialize it.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:01.160
Once it's ruined, it's ruined,
but once it's saved,

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:04.830
each generation has its
duty to keep it saved.

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.930
MAN AS WALLACE STEGNER:
Sometimes we have withheld our

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.400
power to destroy and have left
a threatened species like

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.200
the buffalo, a threatened
beauty spot like Yosemite or

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:24.900
Yellowstone or Dinosaur
scrupulously alone.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:29.330
We are the most dangerous
species of life on the planet,

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:33.330
and every other species,
even the earth itself,

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.960
has cause to fear our
power to exterminate.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:42.560
But we are also the only
species which, when it chooses

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.100
to do so, will go to great
effort to save what it

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.860
might destroy.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.300
Wallace Stegner.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:22.060
MAN: Charles Stevenson,
"Reader's Digest."

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.160
Drive to Yellowstone, as
my wife and I did late last

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.460
summer, and the moment you
enter, you are in a big city

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.160
traffic jam.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.900
Pause to look at sights you've
come thousands of miles to

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.960
see, and cars pile up bumper
to bumper a quarter of a mile

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.030
behind you.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.430
COYOTE: The 32 million
Americans who had crowded into

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:48.360
their national parks each
year as the fifties began had

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.430
suddenly become nearly 62
million before the decade was

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.060
even halfway through.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.560
98% arrived by car.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.430
The parks weren't
ready for them.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.860
MAN AS CHARLES STEVENSON:
Yosemite Valley proper has

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:17.630
become a city festering with
commercialism and ugliness.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:21.200
This spot, which Theodore
Roosevelt once called the most

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.830
beautiful in the world,
now boasts 3 acres

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:28.130
of burning dump.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:32.330
Lovely meadows have been paved
to provide parking space.

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:36.500
Warehouses and stores
obstruct famous views.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:42.230
The campgrounds pack in
about 97 persons to the acre.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.100
Campers line up 15
deep for the toilets.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.760
[Car horn honking]

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.030
COYOTE: "The people," a park
official said, "are wearing out

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.300
"the scenery."

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.730
The situation was the
same in every park.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.930
To make matters worse,
staff levels and budgets were

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.000
no bigger, and sometimes
smaller, than they had

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.200
been during the Depression.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.630
Meanwhile President Dwight D.
Eisenhower was pushing through

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:15.960
Congress the biggest public
works program in history--an

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.000
interstate highway system.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.930
Conrad Wirth, the new Park
Service director, proposed

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.300
a similar 10-year plan for the
parks, timing its completion

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:33.960
with the agency's upcoming
50th anniversary in 1966.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.130
He named the ambitious
project Mission 66.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:42.630
"The national parks," Wirth
said, "are in danger of being

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:48.760
"loved to death," and he called
for spending $787 million,

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.100
more than half for new
construction, and the rest

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.160
for repairs, better
maintenance, and more staff.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.900
The president enthusiastically
agreed.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.330
Work began almost immediately--
fixing roads, modernizing

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.400
water and sewer systems,
improving campgrounds

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:16.000
and adding new ones, doubling
the park's lodging capacity.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.600
Museums, rest rooms,
and information offices were

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.430
consolidated into a single
modern structure strategically

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.330
located to intercept large
numbers of people arriving by

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.060
car, prepare them for their
park experience through

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:35.560
a series of displays and
presentations, and send them

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.430
on their way.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.430
Wirth called them
visitor centers.

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:47.830
Before Mission 66 was through,
110 of them would be built.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.830
But as the work continued,
many of the park's oldest

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:56.500
allies became Mission
66's harshest critics.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.700
They hated the
increased development

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:02.000
and the architectural
choices being made.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.030
They thought the new
buildings were ugly.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.860
The loudest complaints
came from David Brower

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.730
and the Sierra Club
and focused on highway

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:16.630
construction, particularly a
plan to bulldoze and pave the

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.200
Old Tioga Road across a long
granite escarpment, skirting

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.860
the shores of beautiful Tenaya
Lake in the high country

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:27.830
of Yosemite.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:29.560
KENNETH BROWER: We went as
kids with my father because he

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.060
was photographing it, and we
were outraged because we had

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.760
the religion, and while my
father was photographing,

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.760
my brother and I said, "Well,
let's get to it," and we

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.360
started taking the
survey stakes out.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.200
And we had gotten quite a
few of them out before my

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.860
father noticed.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.760
It wasn't my father's style,
and he said no, we'd better

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.400
put them back.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.400
COYOTE: In the end,
the road got built.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:59.100
Some Sierra Club members now
questioned the entire premise

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.060
of helping more
people visit the parks.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.400
MAN: I think the battle about
that road was the first moment

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.430
when the Sierra Club began
to realize that Muir's notion

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.630
that you had to bring people
to the parks to make them

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:20.300
value them and save them was
a two-edged sword--that if you

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.600
brought too many people to the
parks, you could ruin them,

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.200
even if the people
who came loved them.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.100
COYOTE: The controversy
would forever tarnish some

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.660
of the real accomplishments
of Mission 66.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.560
But the American people,
mostly unaware of the debate,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:40.660
continued to flock to
their national parks.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.500
Going to the parks was
becoming an American rite

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.360
of passage--journeys creating
memories that would last

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.600
a lifetime.

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.200
MAN: In 1959, my mother
took my brother and me from

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.960
Binghamton, New York,
across the west.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:06.630
My father had died in 1958,
and we did the grand circuit

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.830
of the national parks.

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:19.400
My mother made us navigate.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.960
She gave us the road maps,
and we picked the routes.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.430
We chose the camp sites.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.330
We had been to
Yellowstone for 3 days,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.530
seen all the wonders, and then
dropped down into the Tetons

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.900
and Jackson Hole,
and I was hooked.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.160
I was a lover and defender
of the national parks

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.860
for the rest of my life.

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:44.760
MAN: 1955 in the summer,
my wife and I and my little

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.100
boy spent the night in
Yosemite National Park.

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.160
My little boy had heard about
what you could see in national

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.230
parks, and he was particularly
interested in the bears.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.500
He'd never seen a
bear in the wild.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.000
At night, after we'd turn
out the lights, we heard the

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:15.060
garbage pails outside being
handled by some force, and he

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.530
said, "Dad, is
that the bears?"

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.400
I said, "I think so."

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.630
He said, "Let's
go out and see."

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:24.900
I said, "No. You can't
go out and see the bears.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.960
"Just hope that they
will not bother us."

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.900
And I know that when I took
my son to a national park

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:39.930
for the first time that I was
planting in him the seed that

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.960
would cause him to want
to take his family to

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.100
a national park.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.200
CRONON: I think for me,
the moment that the national

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.300
parks really changed my life
was when I was in fifth grade.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.530
My parents put my brother and
me into the back of a Ford

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:01.200
station wagon, and we left
Madison, Wisconsin, and spent

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.600
6 weeks circumnavigating the
entire American west, but what

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:07.960
we were really doing was going
from national park to national

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.300
park to national park to
national park, and it was

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.700
so overwhelming, it moved
me so deeply, that it

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.430
changed my life.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:20.360
I would not now do what I
do in my life were it not

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.260
for that experience.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:28.930
Part of it was the vistas,
but what I most remember was

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.760
opening the door of that car
and getting out and walking to

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.760
some site with my parents,
and my father in particular,

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.130
who's a wonderful storyteller
and, like me, is a historian,

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:44.560
always having some story to
tell about the place that we

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.130
were in that carried me back
into layers of the past that

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:53.430
were also in the place that
we were in in the present.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.230
And in that reconnection of
past and present, discovering

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:00.230
that there was far more to see
in the place I was in than I

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.700
ever would have imagined
without the stories that he

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.360
shared with me in that place.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.260
DUNCAN: I grew up in
a little town in Iowa.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.000
Both of my parents worked,
so we didn't take very

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.300
many vacations.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.000
My dad would paint the house
during his vacation, or maybe

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.730
we'd go fishing in a lake in
Minnesota, but we never went

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.360
on real trips.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.500
And when I was just
about to turn 10,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.460
we decided, this year
we're going to do it.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:39.700
We packed up borrowed camping
equipment from people we knew,

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:44.060
borrowed my grandmother's car,
and headed west.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.400
Um, it was a great experience.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.600
We went to the Badlands.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.630
I had never seen
something like that.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:59.600
Playing and running around
on that denuded,

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.160
bizarre landscape.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.760
We went to Custer Battlefield,
as it was called then--the

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.200
Little Big Horn.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.500
I found an arrowhead that I
was pretty sure probably was

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.760
Crazy Horse's.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.500
It wasn't until I was a father
myself that my dad revealed

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.030
that he had bought that
arrowhead in the gift shop

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:22.960
and dropped it right
underneath me.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.760
And then we came
to Yellowstone.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:36.400
We arrived two days after
the great earthquake of 1959.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.860
We lived through 3
or 4 tremors.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.160
The earth was
shaking underneath me.

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.300
The forces that had created
Yellowstone were reawakening.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.930
Half of the park was closed.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.500
When we went to the geysers,
the rangers talking would say,

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.060
"Well, this geyser used to go
off about every two months.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.360
"Whoop! There it is now."

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:02.600
Or "this one," you know, "hasn't
gone off since the earthquake."

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.230
The earth was in motion there.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:11.300
We went to the bottom of the
waterfalls, and I thought,

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.000
"Boy, I am not
in Iowa anymore."

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.630
MAN: I'm probably the last
Secretary of Interior--this

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.930
was 42 years ago--who will
be flying along in a plane

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:49.930
and look off and say,
"Goodness, that ought to be

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:54.100
a national park" and seeing
it become a national park.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:58.630
So it was a wonderful period
of expansion and of new ideas

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:02.430
in terms of what the Park
Service should be doing.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.260
SINGERS: All the
leaves are brown

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.500
All the leaves are brown

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.660
And the sky is gray

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:18.600
And the sky is gray

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.030
I've been for a walk

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.230
On a winter's day

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.130
On a winter's day...

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:30.930
COYOTE: Throughout the 1960s,
Stewart Udall would serve as

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.600
Secretary of the Interior
to presidents John Kennedy

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.700
and Lyndon Johnson, overseeing
the most ambitious program

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.460
of creating new parks
since the time

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.930
of Franklin Roosevelt.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.060
The pace of population growth
and development in the west

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.600
gave Udall, a former
Arizona Congressman, a sense

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.730
of urgency.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:58.400
"What we save now," he said,
"may be all we save."

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.960
He joined forces with
the Sierra Club to push

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.330
for creation of Redwood
National Park along the

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.130
northern coast of California,
home to the tallest trees

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.730
in the world, which over
a lifetime spanning two

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.360
millennia, can grow 300 feet
high, requiring an environment

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.200
of rainfall, fog, and soil
found only in a narrow band

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.600
of land a few
hundred miles long.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.560
By the 1960s, logging had
cleared 85% of the original

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.100
redwood forest.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:43.830
The national park saved
half of what remained.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.900
In west Texas, Guadalupe
Mountains National Park,

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.800
the ancient remains of
an ocean reef rising out

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.600
of the desert, had once been
the home of grizzly bears,

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:59.460
wolves, and buffalo, as well
as the Mescalero Apaches,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.860
who used the mountain oasis
as a refuge until they, too,

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.200
were driven out.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.060
"My Lord," Udall said when he
first saw it, "what a paradise

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.500
"that place is."

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:17.530
He also supported North
Cascades National Park,

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:20.400
a roadless wilderness on
the border of Washington

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.030
and Canada, containing
318 glaciers in its jumble

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:29.300
of mountains, nearly 1/3 of
all the remaining glaciers

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:33.200
in the lower 48 states.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.230
And in the stark desert of
eastern Utah, where the Green

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.700
River meets the Colorado
amidst a seemingly endless

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:44.130
maze of meandering canyons,
is a place John Wesley Powell

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:49.260
had first described in 1869
as a "wilderness of rocks

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.460
"and a world of grandeur."

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.760
Powell had given the features
he saw names like Cataract

00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:01.160
Canyon, the Dirty Devil,
the Labyrinth.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.530
A hundred years later,
Udall helped give it all

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:10.330
another name--Canyonlands
National Park.

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:14.930
UDALL: I remember a
night when I woke up.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:20.800
We were camping up on the high
cliffs, and I looked off into

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.760
what is the Doll's House
and the Maze, and the moon

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.500
came through.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:33.300
It was like I was
transported into anther world.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:38.630
There was a few minutes where
I just felt that I was having

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.330
an experience that I
would never have again.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.660
COYOTE: Udall also helped
persuade Congress to set aside

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:53.200
other parts of the American
landscape and place them under

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.360
Park Service protection.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.760
National seashores from Cape
Cod in Massachusetts to Padre

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.700
Island in Texas to Point
Reyes in California.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.200
National lake shores like
Indiana Dunes and Picture

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.300
Rocks in the Great Lakes.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.760
The Ozark National Scenic
Riverway in Southwestern

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.200
Missouri, the first in a
string of rivers that would

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:22.760
have portions kept in
their free-flowing,

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.900
natural conditions.

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:29.660
National trails like the
Appalachian Trail, extending

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:34.960
2,100 miles from
Georgia to Maine.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.300
And national recreation areas,
often reservoirs behind

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:44.630
the dams being built
all over the west.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:48.760
To help him, Udall named
George Hartzog the new Park

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.560
Service director, who brought
to the job the same energy

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.730
and back-slapping political
skills Stephen Mather had used

00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:00.960
so successfully
50 years earlier.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:03.900
Hartzog would push the Park
Service to have a greater

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.700
presence in urban areas,
to serve minority populations

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.160
that did not yet have a
relationship with the parks,

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.830
and to increase the number of
historic and cultural sites.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:20.230
To him,
the park system's role

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:23.730
in preserving and interpreting
American history was just as

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.630
crucial as protecting
the large natural parks.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:35.500
HARTZOG: My father,
from South Carolina, only made

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.130
one trip out of that state
during his lifetime, and that

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:44.400
was to visit our family
here in Washington.

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:53.430
And he said, "I want to
see the Lincoln Memorial."

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.000
Abraham Lincoln was not a
favorite historical personage

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.630
in the low country of South
Carolina when I was a boy

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:09.560
growing up, and neither was he
in my family and in our home,

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:14.400
and I was surprised that the
only thing he wanted to see

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:19.600
in Washington D.C. was
the Lincoln Memorial.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:23.130
I started to get out of the
car, and he said, "No, I want

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:26.860
"to go alone," and I sat there
and watched him walk those

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:32.930
steps, and he got there and
stopped and faced Lincoln

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:38.060
and turned to the right and
went around that memorial

00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:43.260
and read every saying of
Lincoln's and came back

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.300
and got in the car.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:48.500
Tears were welling in his
eyes, although they were not

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:55.530
running, and he said to me,
"I'm now ready to go home."

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.160
That's what they mean.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.860
CROWD SINGING:
We shall overcome...

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:19.200
COYOTE: On August 28, 1963,
Hartzog witnessed a much

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:22.560
larger crowd at the Lincoln
Memorial when a quarter

00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.530
of a million people converged
on the National Mall as part

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:30.460
of the March on Washington to
protest the Jim Crow laws that

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.960
still discriminated against
African Americans in the south

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.400
and to call on Congress to
pass a civil rights bill to

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.060
bring them to an end.

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.060
There, a young minister
named Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.960
who had recently been jailed
in Birmingham, Alabama,

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.460
who the director of the
FBI considered a Communist

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.030
sympathizer and whose life was
in constant danger from people

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.200
who hated the color of his
skin and everything he stood

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.530
for, gave a speech that would
be considered a turning point

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:07.460
in American history.

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:15.060
KING: I have a dream that my
4 little children will one day

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.960
live in a nation where they
will not be judged by the

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.630
color of their skin but by the
content of their character.

00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:23.200
I have a dream today!

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.660
[Cheering and applause]

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:35.300
This will be the day when all
of God's children will be able

00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:40.360
to sing with new meaning "My
country 'tis of thee, sweet

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.730
"land of liberty,
of thee I sing.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:48.330
"Land where my fathers died,
land of the pilgrims' pride,

00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:52.260
"from every mountainside,
let freedom ring."

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.360
And if America is to be
a great nation, this must

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.760
become true.

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.400
[Cheering and applause]

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:04.430
And when this happens, we will
be able to speed up that day

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.860
when all of God's children--
black men and white men,

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.960
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants
and Catholics--will be able to

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:15.530
join hands and sing in the
words of the old negro

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:20.160
spiritual, "Free at last,
free at least, thank God

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.700
"Almighty, we're free at last!"

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:25.500
[Cheering and applause]

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.200
HARTZOG: What higher
purpose can a national park

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:38.100
serve than to be responsive
to the crisis in our society,

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:42.600
to the voice of the
underprivileged, to the voice

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:48.030
of the protester who's
objecting to the institutional

00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:56.630
status quo, who is seeing a
need beyond where we are?

00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:00.330
It was of the same dimension
as the first time I stood

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:03.960
on the south rim of the Grand
Canyon and looked at that

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:07.560
magnificent canyon
in front of me.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:11.500
These are everlasting
moments that stay with you

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.860
and influence your
life all your life.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:21.460
FRANKLIN: The idea of the
national parks certainly was

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:27.960
appreciated by Abraham
Lincoln in the 1860s.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:33.360
A century later, here is
Martin Luther King giving his

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:39.660
great speech "I Have a Dream"
before a vast audience, before

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:45.260
Abraham Lincoln, and with a
park ranger standing by him.

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:47.660
You have this
sweep of history.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:50.300
You have these dramatic turns.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:57.500
You have these marvelous
coincidences and ramifications

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:03.230
that extend from Lincoln
to King, from the idea

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:08.530
of the national park to the
Park Service officer standing

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:14.500
by King when he gives his
"I Have a Dream" speech.

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:20.300
The parallels of history
are infinite and limitless.

00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:22.830
COYOTE: 5 years later,
Dr. King would

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.030
be assassinated.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.830
12 years after that,
his birthplace in Atlanta,

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:34.130
Georgia, would be dedicated
as a historic site, part

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.800
of the national park system.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:45.400
[Wolf howls]

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:53.660
MAN AS ADOLPH MURIE: We were
approaching our cabin one

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.560
stormy night.

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.500
It was snowing and getting
dark, and out of the storm

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:05.630
came music, the long, drawn,
mournful call of a wolf.

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.160
It started low, moved
slowly up the scale

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.400
with increased volume.

00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:16.400
At the high point, a slight
break in the voice, then

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:20.130
a deepening of the tone as it
became a little more throaty

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:24.530
and gradually descended the
scale, and the soft voice

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:29.830
trailed off to blend
with the storm.

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:33.500
We waited to hear again
the voice of wilderness,

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:37.200
but the performer, with
artistic restraint,

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.730
was silent.

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.230
Adolph Murie.

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:48.930
I think we all pick up certain
sounds or sights that are sort

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:53.730
of symbolic, and I think
that for Adolph, the sound

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:59.660
of the wolf meant wild,
nature, untamed but also

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:06.230
a part of the planet, a part
that we just can't do without.

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.060
[Wolf howls]

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:14.100
He felt very much like Thoreau
felt, I think, about wildness.

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:18.160
We got to have it.

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:21.230
COYOTE: When the Mission
66 plans had been unveiled

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:25.060
for Mt. McKinley National
Park, they called for widening

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:29.430
and paving the 90-mile rough
and narrow gravel road that

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:34.100
provided the only access
into the park's interior.

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.530
The road would permit a
showcase hotel near beautiful

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:41.230
and quiet Wonder Lake,
expanded campgrounds,

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:45.460
gas stations, and
a visitor center.

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:49.060
No one was surprised when
Adolph Murie came out against

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:52.730
it and submitted a detailed
analysis to the park

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:58.030
superintendent
outlining his concerns.

00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.000
MARTIN MURIE: Adolph was just
passionately determined to

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.530
stop that road, and he was a
very stubborn person for what

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:11.760
he believed in, and we
need stubborn people.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:18.630
He became more accepting,
more diplomatic as

00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:20.030
time went on.

00:59:20.030 --> 00:59:26.200
He became more forgiving,
but he knew how to draw a line

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:32.030
in the sand, and when it come
to things like that, Wonder

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:35.300
Park Road, he'd say no.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.630
No.

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:41.230
BROWN: He was the
conscience of the park.

00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:46.260
He stood like a rock on
these matters of principle.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:52.530
He was not unduly cantankerous
or aggressive.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:54.360
He just lasted.

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:59.460
He just wore away at them like
water on a granite boulder.

00:59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.730
COYOTE: "My efforts were not
appreciated," Murie said,

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:06.260
and for the next two years,
he was reassigned to Grand

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:10.830
Teton National
Park in Wyoming.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:14.060
When he was finally allowed to
return to Alaska to continue

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:19.000
his research, Murie was
dismayed at what he found.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.660
The first 13 miles of park
road had been excavated

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:27.930
and paved, and at mile 65,
a visitor center was being

01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:30.300
constructed that
looked, he said,

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:33.400
"like a Dairy Queen."

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.300
To stop further construction,
he turned to his brother

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:42.400
Olaus, now the director of the
Wilderness Society, for help.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.100
MARTIN MURIE: He kept telling
Olaus, "Now, you got to write

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.330
"about this road."

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:53.200
He'd feed Olaus the data
about the road and say,

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.960
"Write about it.
You write beautifully.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:01:00.360
"I can't do it.
You can do it."

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.930
COYOTE: Olaus Murie was
the perfect person to help.

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:06.860
He was accustomed to
waging public campaigns

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.960
and in a position to openly
challenge the Park Service.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.630
This time, the Park
Service director listened.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.800
That was the last frontier.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:22.330
This is your last opportunity
to save virgin America is

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:26.260
Alaska, and it's enormous.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.230
COYOTE: Hartzog stopped the
roadwork where it was--13

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:36.200
miles widened and paved,
another 17 widened

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:42.030
but unpaved, and the remaining
60 miles to be kept in more or

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:47.630
less the condition Adolph Murie
had suggested--a narrow

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:52.100
gravel pathway where, he said,
"the feeling one gets is that

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.800
"the road passes through a
wilderness that comes up to

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.530
"the road."

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:02.760
It is still that way today.

01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:08.400
MAN AS ADOLPH MURIE:
Freedom prevails.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:13.530
Even the bad wolf seeks an
honest living as of yore.

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:16.960
He is a respected citizen,
morally on a par

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.200
with everyone else.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:30.000
In our thinking of McKinley,
let us not have puny thoughts.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.430
Let us think on
a greater scale.

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:39.460
Let us not have those of the
future decry our smallness

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:44.200
of concept and
lack of foresight.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.300
Adolph Murie.

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.700
RUNTE: By the 1960s, if
you stood on Glacier Point

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.360
and looked down at Yosemite
Valley, you saw lights.

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.300
You saw fires.
You saw cars everywhere.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:04.200
You looked down at that valley
and you said to yourself,

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.730
"This looks more like a city
than it does a national park."

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.300
COYOTE: For nearly a hundred
years, one of the biggest

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.800
attractions in Yosemite
Valley had been

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.500
the dramatic firefall.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.660
Every evening in the summer
season, as throngs gathered to

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:27.130
watch, a huge bonfire would
be built on Glacier Point,

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:30.360
then pushed over the edge
to cascade down toward

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.830
the valley floor.

01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:36.560
In 1968,
Hartzog said no

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.930
and ordered a stop to it.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:43.560
HARTZOG: The firefall
in that magnificent valley was

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.800
about as appropriate as horns
on a rabbit, and it should

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:50.330
not be there.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:54.000
It was an absolutely
spectacular sight, but it was

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.160
inappropriate for the silent
tranquility and beauty of that

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.000
great valley.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.100
COYOTE: At Yellowstone,
Hartzog also enforced what

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.730
George Melendez Wright,
Adolph Murie, and many other

01:04:08.730 --> 01:04:12.960
biologists had advocated years
earlier--not just a paper

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.830
policy against feeding the
bears, which tourists and park

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:20.400
officials had routinely
ignored, but a concerted

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:24.130
effort at weaning the bears
from human food along the

01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:27.800
roadside or at garbage dumps.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:33.600
SCHULLERY: They saw it as
beneath the dignity

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:36.600
of a national park--

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.930
that these bears should in
some sense have a right to

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:44.960
a more natural life and that
people should be experiencing

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.860
them in a more natural way.

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.830
COYOTE: New park policies now
recommended placing scientific

01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:58.200
research as the basis
for management decisions,

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.030
emphasizing that the complex
ecology of each park be

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:05.460
restored to what it had
once been and stating that

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:09.030
a national park should
represent a vignette

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:13.360
of primitive America.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.200
Slowly, in the tension between
preservation and use, parks as

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.960
nature's sanctuaries and parks
as tourist resorts, things had

01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:28.730
begun to shift a little,
back in nature's direction.

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:32.560
George Melendez Wright's
old vision was finally being

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.160
taken seriously.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.600
MAN: I like the
quiet out here.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:56.430
I'm not pestered or
bothered by a lot of people.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:06:02.060
I am alone, but I
am not lonely.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.100
When you have plenty of
interests, like the water

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.660
and the woods, the birds
and the fish, you don't

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.530
get lonely.

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:15.430
Lancelot Jones.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:19.560
COYOTE: By the 1960s, no one
knew Biscayne Bay, off the

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:25.900
southeastern tip of Florida,
better than Lancelot Jones.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:30.500
He had been born in the bottom
of a small boat there in 1898

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.730
while his father was
frantically sailing his

01:06:32.730 --> 01:06:36.730
pregnant mother toward
a hospital in Miami.

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:41.500
From that time on, the
bay had been his home.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:45.300
His father, Israel Lafayette
Jones, had risen up from

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:49.330
slavery in North Carolina,
migrated to Florida after

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:53.500
the Civil War, and steadily
improved life for himself

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.760
and his Bahamian wife.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.100
Eventually, he had managed
to buy 3 of the small,

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:04.100
uninhabited islands that
separate Biscayne Bay from the

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.830
Atlantic Ocean and began a
profitable business growing

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.530
key limes.

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:13.030
In honor of his favorite
story, "The Knights

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:17.100
"of the Round Table," he had
proudly named his two sons

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.860
King Arthur Jones and Sir
Lancelot Jones, hoping,

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:26.400
perhaps, Lancelot said later,
that by giving us great names,

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.100
we would become great men.

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:37.330
But 3 years after his father's
death, the Hurricane of 1935

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:41.260
had laid waste to the family's
lime crops and forced Lancelot

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:44.800
into a new line of work as
a fishing guide for wealthy

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.060
visitors to Biscayne Bay.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:57.800
By the 1960s, there were
plenty to go around.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:01.200
Just across a small channel
from Jones' modest home

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:06.300
on Porgy Key was the Cocolobo
Club, an exclusive retreat

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.960
for some of the
multimillionaires who wintered

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:14.400
at Miami Beach, men with
names like Firestone, Maytag,

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:17.260
Honeywell, and Hertz.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.900
They had this exclusive
club down there, and it was

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:24.060
nice for them.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.830
COYOTE: Lancelot Jones became
the favorite fishing guide

01:08:26.830 --> 01:08:28.930
for them and for
their politically

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:31.730
well-connected friends.

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:34.900
GREENE: He was a tall,
lanky kind of guy and very

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:40.200
hospitable, and he seemed like
a perfectly happy guy living

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.060
out there by himself.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.260
He knew a lot of people.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.900
A lot of important people
would stop by and visit him

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.400
when they went down there,
including all these big shots

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.960
that belonged to
that private club.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.900
He knew where all the fish
were and where everything else

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.930
was, too, down there.

01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:05.700
COYOTE: But other millionaires
had other plans for the bay

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.760
and its chain of more than
3 dozen pristine islands.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.060
In 1961, a shipping tycoon
announced he intended to

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.960
construct a deep-water port,
an oil refinery, and

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.000
an industrial complex once
he dredged a deeper channel

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.900
through the shallow bay 8
miles out to the ocean.

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:33.660
At the same time, a group of
developers proposed a bridge

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:37.000
linking the mainland to the
islands to do with them what

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.130
had already happened at Miami
Beach and Key Biscayne--a

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:45.300
series of high-rise hotels,
retail shopping centers,

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:49.230
and private
beachfront properties.

01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:52.730
The organizers convinced
authorities to create the city

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:57.430
of Islandia and ferried a
voting machine to Elliott Key,

01:09:57.430 --> 01:10:01.430
where they staged an election
attended by 14 of the 18

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:06.500
registered voters, all of them
absentee landowners hoping to

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:10.930
cash in on the
anticipated real estate boom.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.960
Lancelot Jones, one of only
two full-time residents

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:21.360
of the new Islandia,
was not among them.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.160
He was against their plans and
had also turned down offers

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:30.900
from the refinery
developer to buy Porgy Key.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.260
MAN AS LANCELOT JONES: I never
thought commercialization

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.560
of this land was right.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.800
I always felt this land was
not right for development,

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.760
that it should stay as it is.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.230
COYOTE: Meanwhile, a small
group had formed to fight

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:49.560
both proposals.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.360
Lloyd Miller, an avid
fisherman, believed the

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.130
refinery and seaport would
turn one of Florida's most

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:59.830
fertile fish-breeding grounds
into a stagnant pool

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:02.460
of oily water.

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.630
Juanita Greene,
an enterprising young writer

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:07.700
for the "Miami Herald,"
worried that

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.330
the considerable financial
interests behind both

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:13.500
developments were
steamrolling the plans toward

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.430
hasty approval.

01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:18.960
Her own newspaper
supported the refinery.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.660
She thought the public was
not only being shut out

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.560
of the decision but would also
be denied access to precious

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.230
waterfront once everything
was completed.

01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:35.830
It would become, she warned,
"a rich man's paradise."

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:39.060
GREENE: I could see that for
the average Joe who wanted to

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:42.600
go to the beach on Sunday
afternoon, there were fewer

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.260
and fewer places to go.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:50.000
I didn't think that that was
fair that only people who

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.330
could live in the fancy hotels
or the condominiums had access

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:58.100
to the beach.

01:11:58.100 --> 01:12:02.130
I objected mightily to it and
wrote a story in which I said

01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:07.930
"This is a freak city with
lots of power and no people."

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:10.930
And it was true.

01:12:10.930 --> 01:12:14.030
COYOTE: At a meeting held
around her dining room table,

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.100
Greene, Lloyd Miller,
and another friend,

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:20.800
Art Marshall, decided that
the only way to stop the

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.560
development of the islands was
to make it a national park.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.830
Greene persuaded her newspaper
to at least cover the budding

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:33.330
opposition movement and to
allow her to write occasional

01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:38.330
opinion pieces advocating
her point of view.

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:41.460
As the public leader of the
opposition, Miller found his

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.900
car sprayed with paint.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:47.130
People urged his
employer to fire him.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:51.300
An anonymous caller
threatened his family.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.860
GREENE: And somebody
poisoned his dog.

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:58.460
So Lloyd had to put up with a
lot, but he was a determined

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:05.100
man, and he was not gonna
be run out of this.

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.500
COYOTE: Slowly their
movement gained strength.

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:11.630
A slate of anti-refinery
candidates was elected to

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:14.230
the county commission.

01:13:14.230 --> 01:13:16.930
Local political leaders
withdrew their support

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:20.500
for a bridge to the islands.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.860
And after visiting the bay,
Stewart Udall came out

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:26.660
in favor of protecting it.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.560
In October of 1968, Lloyd
Miller was peering over

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:37.760
the shoulder of President
Johnson as he created Biscayne

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:44.900
National Monument, saving
173,000 acres of the bay,

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.000
coral reefs, and islands.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:55.600

MAN SINGING: Sitting
in the mornin' sun...

01:13:57.230 --> 01:13:59.830
COYOTE: The first private
landowner to sell his land to

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:03.260
the federal government for
the new national monument was

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:09.760
Lancelot Jones--277 acres on 3
islands on the condition that

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.560
he be allowed to live out
his life in the family home

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.930
on Porgy Key.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.330
MAN SINGING: Sittin'
on the dock of the bay...

01:14:17.330 --> 01:14:19.300
GREENE: And that's the
kind of guy he was.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.660
MAN SINGING:
...tide roll away...

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:23.460
GREENE: He was not one of
these greedy people that was

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:26.530
waiting for the developers
to come pay him big bucks

01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:29.030
for his land.

01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:32.430
He just liked things the way
they were and was willing to

01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:36.800
help other people have
an opportunity to enjoy

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.430
the islands.

01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:42.660
COYOTE: His favorite pastime
was teaching small groups

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:46.260
of schoolchildren about
the bay's fish and sponges

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.500
whenever the Park Service
brought them to Porgy Key.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.760
The only compensation he
asked for was a key lime pie.

MAN SINGING: Watching
the tide roll away...

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.960
MAN AS LANCELOT JONES: I
like the name "monument."

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.930
It means that things here are
going to stay pretty much as

01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:11.730
they are today.

01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:13.300
Lancelot Jones.

[Singer whistling]

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:34.530
MAN AS WALLACE STEGNER: The
national park idea, the best

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:38.600
idea we ever had,
was inevitable as soon as

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.500
Americans learned to confront
the wild continent not

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:46.230
with fear and cupidity,
but with delight,

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:49.030
wonder, and awe.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:57.900
Once started, it grew like the
backfire it truly was, burning

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.230
backup wind against the
current of claim and grab

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:03.800
and raid...

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.660
proving that our rapacious
society could hold its hand,

01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:15.560
at least in the presence of
stupendous scenery, and learn

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.760
to respect the earth for
something besides its

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.030
economic value.

01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:24.430
Wallace Stegner.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:32.030
COYOTE: On March 1, 1972,
Yellowstone, the world's first

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:37.330
national park,
celebrated its centennial.

01:16:37.330 --> 01:16:40.600
During its 100 years of
existence, the park had seen

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.660
its wildlife wantonly
slaughtered by poachers

01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:47.830
and then protected by law.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.700
Yellowstone had been guarded
by cavalrymen and park

01:16:53.700 --> 01:17:00.200
rangers, defended by poets,
and studied by scientists.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:04.000
Endlessly painted and
photographed by artists

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.660
and amateurs alike, toured by
one American president after

01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:13.430
another, seeking everything
from exhilarating inspiration

01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:18.060
to simple relaxation.

01:17:18.060 --> 01:17:22.230
Yellowstone had been the site
of everything from Indian wars

01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.560
to bitter fights over
the limits of commercial

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.700
exploitation, battles over
the value of nature,

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.760
and a continuing argument over
how Americans could enjoy its

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.230
treasure house of wonders
without ruining it

01:17:36.230 --> 01:17:38.960
for the next generation.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.760
Along the way, Yellowstone
had become one of the most

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.700
recognizable symbols
of America itself.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:03.960
In 1972,
Old Faithful, still spouting

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:07.300
as regularly as it did when
it got its name a century

01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:13.300
earlier, would thrill
2.2 million people.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:17.800
But they would represent
a tiny fraction of the 165

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:22.330
million visitors who came that
year to a park system that now

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:26.700
had a presence in nearly
every state in the union--38

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:31.760
national parks and roughly
200 historic sites, national

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.800
monuments, and other places
Americans had set aside

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.800
for posterity.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.160
By the 1970s, the park idea
had spread from Yellowstone

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:48.030
all the way around the world,
ultimately becoming, like the

01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:53.600
idea of freedom itself, one of
America's greatest exports--

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.560
more than 4,000 parks
in nearly 200 nations.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.430
MAN SINGING: Light out singing

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:07.460
And walking in the morning
sunshine

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.200
Sunshine daydream

01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.730
COYOTE: But back in the United
States, in the farthest corner

01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:19.530
of the nation, the national
parks were about to experience

01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:23.160
their most dramatic expansion.

01:19:37.330 --> 01:19:40.730
WOOD: Most people ask,
"What brought you to Alaska?"

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:45.100
but the question to ask
is "What made you stay?"

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.360
We just fell in love
with the country.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.260
The country told us what
it should be and what it

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.500
shouldn't be.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:57.300
I think that being out there
was a little bit like Conrad

01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.230
said of the sea--it's not
for you or against you.

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:03.730
It's just very
unforgiving of errors.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:08.360
COYOTE: In the hundred years
since Secretary of State

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:13.530
William Seward had purchased
it from Russia in 1867, Alaska

01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:17.830
had had the nickname Seward's
Folly, especially by those who

01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:22.430
believed a territory so
remote and so far north was

01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:27.130
a colossal waste of the $7.2
million Seward had agreed to

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:32.930
pay, even if it was more than
twice the size of Texas.

01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:37.160
John Muir had a
different name for it.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.730
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: To the lover
of pure wildness, Alaska is

01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:45.530
one of the most wonderful
countries in the world.

01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:49.930
This is nature's own
reservation, and every lover

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:55.360
of wildness will rejoice with
me that by kindly frost it is

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.260
so well defended.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.360
MAN: Alaska was the last
chance to do it right.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.400
This is it. This is the
end of the line.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.360
So we buckled down, and it
became a very serious affair

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.900
about what to do with Alaska.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:23.030
COYOTE: After Alaska was
granted statehood in 1959,

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:26.630
a federal law was passed to
settle the claims of Alaska's

01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:31.160
native peoples, including
the Inupiaq and the Tlingit,

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:35.200
the Aleut and the Athabaskan.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.460
The land was to be divided up,
some for the new state to

01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.900
control and open for
development if it wished,

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:47.400
some for the tribes, and a
portion to be withheld forever

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:52.560
in the national interest
for all Americans.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.630
As the discovery of vast oil
deposits on the north slope

01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:59.230
and the construction of
the trans-Alaska pipeline

01:21:59.230 --> 01:22:04.430
demonstrated, the
stakes were enormous.

01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:08.060
The fight over what to do with
the federal land would consume

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.360
more than a decade and would
quickly become a national one,

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.730
waged in the halls of
Congress, involving commercial

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:19.430
and industrial groups
capable of spending millions

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:24.430
of dollars in advertising and
lobbying, versus the Alaska

01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:28.700
Coalition, a collection of 50
environmental groups which

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:32.730
quickly mushroomed to
1,500 organizations,

01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:36.560
representing 10 million
members, most of whom had

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:39.630
never set foot in Alaska.

01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:42.860
It was the largest
grassroots conservation effort

01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:45.200
in American history.

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.660
POPE: An entire generation
came along and said, "We want

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:52.160
"to be part of this," and for
them, the Alaska battle was

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:53.400
the culmination.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.260
We'd passed clean air
and clean water acts.

01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:57.060
We'd passed the
Wilderness Act.

01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:59.130
We'd set aside millions
of acres of wilderness

01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:04.160
in the 1970s, and suddenly we
had a landscape where we could

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.300
really save what
was best about it.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.130
People embraced it.
people rallied to it.

01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:12.960
It was the chance
to get it right.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.830
COYOTE: In the mid-1970s,
Congressman Morris Udall

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:22.360
of Arizona, the brother of
Stewart Udall, sponsored

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.500
a bill setting aside 110
million acres of federally

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.200
owned land in Alaska.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:34.630
In May of 1978, Udall's
bill passed overwhelmingly

01:23:34.630 --> 01:23:39.760
in the House--277 to 31.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.960
But in the Senate, even though
a clear majority favored

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.060
the legislation, a threatened
filibuster by Alaska Senator

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:51.000
Mike Gravel tied things up,
preventing a vote before

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.400
Congress adjourned.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:56.260
It appeared that the big
dreams for preserving large

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:01.100
sections of Alaska would
be for nothing.

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:04.930
Then, President Jimmy Carter,
acting on the recommendation

01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:08.860
of his Interior Secretary,
Cecil Andrus, decided to

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.560
bypass Congress and invoke
the Antiquities Act, a tool

01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:16.960
presidents have been using in
the name of conservation since

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:20.030
Theodore Roosevelt.

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:24.900
On December 1, 1978, Carter
took out his pen and signed

01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:29.460
executive orders creating 17
national monuments covering

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.630
56 million acres of the
most critical areas

01:24:33.630 --> 01:24:36.060
in Udall's bill.

01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:39.430
In Alaska, all
hell broke loose.

01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:53.360
MAN: I'd be in favor of
sending a contingent of state

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.930
troopers to Washington to
arrest President Carter

01:24:55.930 --> 01:24:59.600
and Andrus for conspiracy to
commit a felony, namely the

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:04.260
theft of millions of acres
of land in Alaska.

01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:05.900
DIFFERENT MAN: In a new
national monument near Mt.

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:09.030
McKinley, about 1,500 Alaskans
staged what they said was

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:10.330
a trespass.

01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:13.400
They ran races, shot guns,
claimed they had violated 27

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.400
laws, and dared park
rangers to arrest them.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.930
HEACOX: You have a frontier
mentality in Alaska.

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:25.030
"We want to do things our way."

01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:27.460
The opposition was intense.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.360
Park planes were burned.

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.060
President Carter was
burned in effigy.

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.330
People protested
in the streets.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.730
RUNTE: In New York City, 99%
of the people would be

01:25:37.730 --> 01:25:39.400
for the park.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.900
In Alaska itself, 99% of the
people in some of these towns

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.930
were against the parks because
they lived there, and they

01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:48.300
didn't see how the tourist
industry was going to benefit

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.760
them in any way.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:56.900
COYOTE: To handle the volatile
situation on the ground,

01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:00.830
the administration chose John
Cook, a westerner who had

01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:04.800
earned a reputation as
a tough problem-solver.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.860
The parks were in his blood.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.500
His father and his grandfather
had worked at the Grand

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.260
Canyon, and he joined the Park
Service the day he graduated

01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:18.930
from high school, steadily
working his way up the ladder.

01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:21.530
COOK: When I stepped off the
plane, I was the third least

01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:25.030
popular person in Alaska.

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:29.000
The least popular
was President Carter.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.460
Cecil Andrus was pretty
unpopular as well.

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.830
He was the number two man,
and then it was me.

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:38.530
We were told they would kill
the first Park Service person

01:26:38.530 --> 01:26:44.030
that set foot in Duffy's
Tavern in northeast Alaska.

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:47.630
4 days later, I walked into
Duffy's Tavern with a tape

01:26:47.630 --> 01:26:50.830
recorder and a roll of maps,
wearing Alaska clothes,

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:55.060
in the middle of winter flew
a ski plane in and sat there

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:59.000
with 200 people, half of them
getting pretty tanked up,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.500
and faced them all, talked to
them, told them what was gonna

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:06.660
happen and what
wasn't gonna happen.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:09.830
COYOTE: On the Kenai Peninsula
at the head of Resurrection

01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:14.500
Bay was the small town of
Seward, named for the

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.930
much-maligned politician who
had made Alaska part

01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:21.160
of the United States.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.200
Its economy revolved
around fish harvesting

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:28.260
and a commercial port that had
briefly boomed with activity

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.430
during the oil pipeline's
construction.

01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:36.600
Nearby was the Harding
Icefield, a sheet of ice 700

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.300
square miles wide and one mile
thick, spawning more than 30

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:45.800
glaciers, many of which
descend directly to sea level,

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:51.400
where they have carved a
series of deep coastal fjords.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:57.000
Their waters teem with
wildlife--whales, sea lions,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.200
and seals beyond number.

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:07.160
Carter's proclamation had
created a 570,000-acre Kenai

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:11.500
Fjords National Monument in
hopes it all would eventually

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.060
become a national park.

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:18.960
The sentiment in Seward
was dead-set against it.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.560
Twice, the city council
passed resolutions

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.900
condemning the idea.

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:28.460
MAN: Beverly Dunham.

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.100
DUNHAM: Alaskans are being
criticized for wanting as much

01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:33.860
of state lands under
Alaskan control as possible.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.400
We have been termed selfish
for wanting development...

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.960
DUNHAM, VOICE-OVER: I
was fearful of it.

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:40.360
I thought the same thing that
most people did, that it was

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.200
going to harm us.

01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.300
Any interference by the
federal government in any way

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:48.060
was offensive to Alaskans
in general and Sewardites

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.200
in particular.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:54.300
We were just fearful of
what would happen to us.

01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:00.360
COOK: I was sent up there to
make it work, and what I did

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.800
is I hand-picked people.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.930
I brought up a task
force the first year.

01:29:03.930 --> 01:29:07.830
I said, "Whatever
you do, never lie to the people.

01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:11.060
"Don't whitewash anything.
Go from town to town.

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.600
"Live in the towns.
Be truthful."

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.360
It's awfully hard to stay
angry at your neighbor if your

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.930
neighbor's a good neighbor.

01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:22.130
Governor Hammond and I came
up with a term that he used to

01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:25.600
help soften things, and that
was that the new national

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.460
monuments and tourism would
be Alaska's permanent pipeline

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:33.700
because we won't run out of
visitors but in a long time

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:37.030
run out of oil.

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:40.360
COYOTE: While John Cook tried
to dampen the local hostility

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:44.360
to Carter's proclamations,
the Alaska Coalition prepared

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.360
for another Congressional
battle to settle all

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:52.500
the Alaska land issues
once and for all.

01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:55.860
My friends, the vote you make
in just a few moments is the

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.200
one you've got to live with
and your grandchildren have to

01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.700
live with.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.500
There ought to be a few places
left in the world the way

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.360
the Almighty made them.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.860
We'll never see a buffalo
herd again, but if we're wise

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.330
today, your grandchildren
might be able to see

01:30:10.330 --> 01:30:12.830
a caribou herd.

01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:15.060
This is the test of
conservation in your

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.260
Congressional career.

01:30:16.260 --> 01:30:21.760
This will be the most
important vote you will cast.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.230
COYOTE: On December 2,
1980, after another year

01:30:25.230 --> 01:30:28.300
and a half of debate and
compromise, President

01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:32.030
Carter signed the Alaska
National Interest Lands

01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:35.100
Conservation Act into law.

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:41.030
It wasn't everything he and
the Alaska Coalition had once

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:45.430
hoped for, but it was still
the largest single expansion

01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:49.330
of protected conservation
lands in world history,

01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:53.900
creating 4 national forests,
10 national preserves,

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:57.900
16 national wildlife refuges.

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.260
The national park system,
with 47 million acres added to

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:06.760
its care, had suddenly
more than doubled in size.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:12.530
Within those additions were
7 brand-new national parks.

01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:09.800
WOMAN: I got a question which--
to write an article on why

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.060
we need national parks,
and the question struck me

01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.330
dumb for a minute.

01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:17.660
It was like saying, "Why
do we need air?"

01:32:17.660 --> 01:32:20.000
I mean,
we need to have these places,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.100
even if I never go--the
only place I've never been

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.300
is Alaska.

01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:30.460
Even if I never go to Alaska,
I need to know it's there.

01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:03.060
COYOTE: And at Seward,
the national monument at Kenai

01:33:03.060 --> 01:33:09.600
Fjords became the seventh
of the new national parks.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.700
5 years later, as the tourist
economy and Seward began to

01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:17.700
emerge as a crucial part
of the town's livelihood,

01:33:17.700 --> 01:33:22.560
the city council quietly but
officially rescinded its two

01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.830
previous resolutions
denouncing the park idea.

01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:31.100
Several years after that,
they asked that the national

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:36.030
park at their doorstep
be expanded.

01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:37.560
DUNHAM: I think it's great.

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.130
It has done a lot for Seward.

01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:43.130
As far as tourism is
concerned, it has made

01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:45.930
a vast difference.

01:33:45.930 --> 01:33:50.430
There are, I think, a thousand
seats on day cruisers that

01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:54.700
come in and take people
out to the fjords.

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:58.030
It has proven that it
hasn't hurt anything.

01:33:58.030 --> 01:34:00.700
If anything, it's enhanced it.

01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:07.060
COOK: And in Alaska,
man was acknowledged.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.630
The natives, who were a part
of that landscape long before

01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:15.430
European man came and called
it wilderness, were using it.

01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:18.700
They still get to use it
for subsistence purposes.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:22.160
It's still a part of their
culture, and they are a part

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.460
of the preservation.

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:27.060
And it's not preserving
museum Indians.

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:30.700
It's preserving a dynamic
culture that's within

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:34.760
a dynamic landscape
that's also changing.

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.560
COYOTE: Mt. McKinley
National Park, which had been

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:44.830
in existence since 1917,
was also affected by

01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:48.960
the Alaska Lands Act.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:54.330
Its area was nearly tripled in
size--2.4 million more acres

01:34:54.330 --> 01:34:59.400
to the park itself, plus an
additional 1.3 million acres

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.760
in two national preserves next
to it--a dramatically larger

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.330
expansion than even Adolph
Murie had proposed just before

01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:10.430
his retirement.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:16.460
The old park, surrounded by
the new additions, was now

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.100
officially designated a
wilderness, bringing with it

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.830
even greater protections to
the land and animals Murie

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:26.400
had championed.

01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:31.600
And as if to symbolize all
that had happened, the park's

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:36.630
name was changed to
reflect its deeper history.

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:39.760
It would revert to the
Athabaskan Indian name

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:44.860
for the tremendous mountain
at its core--Denali,

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:48.860
the high one.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:52.930
COOK: History will, of course,
view the creation of those

01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:57.530
national parks along with
Seward's purchase of Alaska.

01:35:57.530 --> 01:36:02.360
History will show that it
was the right thing to do.

01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:06.000
COYOTE: John Cook would soon
go back to the lower 48 to

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.430
become superintendent of Great
Smoky Mountains National Park.

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:15.360
As his father and his father's
father had done, he would pass

01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.760
on his love for the national
parks to his children,

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.900
including his daughter Kayci,
who would become the fourth

01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:28.000
generation of the Cook family
to serve in the Park Service.

01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:34.730
KAYCI COOK: At the end of
my father's career in 1999,

01:36:34.730 --> 01:36:38.060
I had become what I
always wanted to be,

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:44.960
a superintendent, and I used
my power in that position to

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.560
honor my father for his 43-
year career with the National

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:54.100
Park Service, and I invoked
the tradition of the military

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.760
tattoo at Fort McHenry
National Monument Historic

01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:01.300
Shrine, and I bestowed upon my
father the title of Honorary

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:05.030
Colonel of the
Fort McHenry Guard.

01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:10.330
I felt very proud doing that
for him, and as we stood up

01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:13.600
and saluted one another,
commander to commander, I felt

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.400
much more strongly that it was
a mantle that he was passing

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.930
to me much more than anything
that I was giving to him.

01:37:27.530 --> 01:37:30.930
I have a 4-year-old son,
Sean, and he has already

01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:35.330
expressed an interest in being
a ranger like his mommy.

01:37:35.330 --> 01:37:38.300
He sees me put this
uniform on every day.

01:37:38.300 --> 01:37:42.630
He loves to wear
my hat around.

01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:44.860
I think he's showing some
real promise in terms of being

01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:49.300
a fifth generation, and that
would not hurt my feelings.

MAN: When I was a child in
Detroit, national parks really

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:11.860
didn't exist.

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:15.760
There were no family trips to
national parks, so it really

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:19.100
didn't exist for me and
for my friends.

01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:22.230
We didn't sit around talking
about, "Boy, can't wait to get

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:23.930
"to the Grand Canyon,"
you know.

01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:26.700
That didn't come up as a topic
of conversation in Detroit

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:29.460
for me as a child.

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:33.730
But always, there was this
desire to see Yellowstone.

01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:39.560
There was a desire to see the
Grand Canyon, to see Yosemite.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:43.930
There was a desire to fully
invest my physical self and my

01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:47.600
spiritual self in America
because that's a part

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.230
of America that I didn't know,
and I wanted to become

01:38:49.230 --> 01:38:51.900
familiar with it.

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:55.530
COYOTE: In 1984, Shelton
Johnson became the first

01:38:55.530 --> 01:38:59.800
generation of his family to
visit a national park when he

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.500
stepped off a bus at the
entrance to Yellowstone

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:08.300
and immediately fell in love
with everything it offered.

01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:12.160
Johnson soon started a career
in the Park Service and by

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.260
the 1990s he was working in
Yosemite as an interpretive

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:19.860
ranger, proudly telling
visitors the little-known

01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:24.430
story of the African American
buffalo soldiers, the park's

01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:27.130
earliest protectors.

01:39:33.230 --> 01:39:36.400
In the last decades of the
20th century, the focus

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.160
of the Park Service shifted.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.030
More and more historic
sites were saved, including

01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:47.930
reminders of painful episodes
in American history, set aside

01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:51.200
on the belief that a
great nation could openly

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.100
acknowledge them.

01:40:01.930 --> 01:40:05.500

who made his comfortable

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.900
life possible.

in Little Rock, Arkansas,

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:15.800
where in 1957 federal troops
had to escort 9 African

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:20.430
American teenagers past
angry mobs to their classes,

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:25.630
crystallizing the crisis
of school desegregation.

01:40:25.630 --> 01:40:29.000
From Andersonville, a
deadly Civil War prison camp

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:35.330
in Georgia to a polished slab
of marble in Washington D.C.

01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:40.330
listing the names of 58,000
dead and missing soldiers

01:40:40.330 --> 01:40:45.100
who served their
country in Vietnam.

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:49.300
From Sand Creek and Washita on
the Great Plains, where Chief

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.360
Black Kettle's peaceful
Cheyenne villagers were

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.260
massacred by
American soldiers.

01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:00.360
To Manzanar in the high
desert of eastern California,

01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:03.860
where American citizens of
Japanese descent were kept

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:09.400
behind barbed wire
during World War II.

01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:14.460
From Oklahoma City, where
168 empty chairs now

commemorate the men,
women, and children killed

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:24.630
in a senseless act of
domestic terrorism in 1995.

01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:27.860
To a field near Shanksville,
Pennsylvania, that

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:32.030
immortalizes the sacrifices
made by passengers aboard

01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:38.230
United Flight 93 on
September 11, 2001.

01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:43.230
CRONON: When you're asked,
"Well, what is coherent

01:41:43.230 --> 01:41:45.800
"about a system that
contains natural wonders

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:48.860
"and birthplaces
of famous people?"

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:52.160
I think the answer you come to
is that they are all finally

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:56.730
about a vision of where the
United States comes from.

01:41:56.730 --> 01:42:00.460
We come from nature, but we
also come from our own past,

01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:03.730
and so the interpretation of
nature and history together is

01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:06.260
not a distraction
that the parks face.

01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:09.500
It is the very core
of the enterprise.

01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:13.130
They are all about
where we come from.

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:21.360
COYOTE: In the years to come,
Americans would continue

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:25.160
expanding the number of
national parks and continue

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:31.160
using them in ever-increasing
numbers, from 255 million

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:36.960
visitors in 1990, then closing
in on 300 million visitors

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:42.260
a decade later--each visit an
opportunity to forge a new

01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:49.330
relationship to their land,
their nation, and themselves.

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:52.800
MAN: We need national parks
to have people--especially our

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.000
kids--understand
what America is.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.230
America is not sidewalks.

01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:02.260
America is not stores.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.830
America is not video games.

01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:08.100
America is not restaurants.

01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:10.730
We need national parks so
people can go there and say,

01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:13.400
"Ah. This is America."

01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:24.130
DUNCAN: And then it was my
turn to take my family out to

01:43:24.130 --> 01:43:27.600
see the national parks.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:33.230
It was gonna be our own
epic journey as a family.

01:43:33.230 --> 01:43:35.830
If there's a national
park between Arizona

01:43:35.830 --> 01:43:38.030
and the Canadian border
along the spine of the Rocky

01:43:38.030 --> 01:43:42.830
Mountains, we went there.

01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:50.660
We broiled in the sun in
Arches and Canyonlands,

01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:57.500
went and visited Dinosaur as
I had when I was a small boy,

01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:02.830
hiked around Jenny Lake in the
Grand Tetons, then to wear

01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:05.130
bear bells, which was very
exciting for the kids

01:44:05.130 --> 01:44:10.830
because bears might be around.

01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:13.430
At Yellowstone, I got to
watch my children see their

01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:17.160
first bison.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.060
And then we came to Glacier
National Park, and it was

01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:23.400
something of a sentimental
return for Diane and me

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.460
because 13 years earlier,
when we were courting, we had

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.530
gone there.

01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:35.660
And as we went up Going to the
Sun Highway, I took a picture

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:40.530
of my daughter, about to
become a beautiful woman

01:44:40.530 --> 01:44:45.930
in the same place that her
beautiful mother had once sat

01:44:45.930 --> 01:44:52.160
for a photograph, and then we
got to Logan Pass, and my son

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:57.500
Will and I decided to go on
a buddy hike and headed up

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.630
toward Hidden Lake.

01:45:00.630 --> 01:45:04.360
And we came around a corner,
and coming toward us were

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:08.830
these mountain goats. And I
said, "Shh. Just be quiet.

01:45:08.830 --> 01:45:12.130
"Don't do anything to disturb
them, and maybe we'll get to

01:45:12.130 --> 01:45:14.400
"take a picture."

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.160
Well, we just stepped to
the side, and this family

01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:20.430
of mountain goats came right
down the trail within about 2

01:45:20.430 --> 01:45:25.830
or 3 feet of us, and I don't
know whose eyes were bigger,

01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:29.730
Will's or mine.

01:45:29.730 --> 01:45:33.560
I had asked everybody to
keep a diary during our trip,

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:40.860
and that night in his diary,
Will wrote, "This was the most

01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:46.830
"exciting day of my life."

01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:51.530
And so it was the most
exciting day of my life, too.

01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:03.960
COYOTE: In January of 1995,
a convoy of trucks entered

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:07.930
Yellowstone National Park
at its northern gate, where

01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:11.930
a stone arch dedicated by
Theodore Roosevelt proclaims

01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:16.030
the park's purpose--"for
the benefit and enjoyment

01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:18.730
"of the people."

01:46:18.730 --> 01:46:24.030
Riding in cages in the trucks
were 14 gray wolves recently

01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:29.530
captured in western Canada.

01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:33.160
Two months later, after
being kept in small pens to

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:36.930
acclimate them to their new
surroundings, the wolves were

01:46:36.930 --> 01:46:41.330
set free, part of a long-range
plan to reestablish

01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:45.360
the predators in their former
habitat and make the world's

01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:49.860
first national park a little
more representative of what it

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.860
had once been.

01:46:55.460 --> 01:47:01.100
I keep imagining that first
wolf coming out of its cage,

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:04.460
and I think of Adolph being
there, and he probably would

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.100
have cried.

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:12.460
Just think--we now have
wolves in Yellowstone.

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:18.500
COYOTE: Within only a few
years, the wolves were

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:22.730
thriving--part, once more,
of the entire

01:47:22.730 --> 01:47:25.660
Yellowstone ecosystem.

01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:32.030
WHITTLESEY: I was in the back
country with one of my good

01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:36.000
friends, and we're standing
out there in the dark, and we

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.860
hear this long, low, throaty
howl, and I'd never heard that

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:44.300
sound before.

[Wolves howling]

01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.730
And I knew immediately what it
was, and I remember standing

01:47:50.730 --> 01:47:52.760
there thinking...

01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:58.830
"I am so lucky
to get to hear that

01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:02.730
"sound that has not been
heard in the back country

01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:08.630
"of Yellowstone for
60-some years."

01:48:13.230 --> 01:48:15.760
WILLIAMS: I think our
challenge as lovers of our

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.630
national parks in the 21st
century will be the challenge

01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:20.860
of restoration.

01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:26.160
I think that's the story
that's yet to be told,

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:28.530
the story of restoration.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.200
And not only are our national
parks a gift, I think they're

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.300
a covenant.

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:41.760
They're a covenant with the
future, saying, "This is

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.230
"where we were.

01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:47.960
"This is what we loved...

01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:50.560
"and now it's in your hands."

MAN: One learns that the

yet being made, that this is
still the morning of creation.

01:49:11.500 --> 01:49:17.630
This grand show is eternal.

01:49:17.630 --> 01:49:23.030
It is always
sunrise somewhere.

01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:28.630
The dew is never
all dried at once.

01:49:28.630 --> 01:49:32.800
A shower is forever falling.
