00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.930


2
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.230
Mislike me not for my complexion,

3
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.470
the shadowed livery of the burnished sun

4
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.530
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

5
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.500
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.800
where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles.

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.670
And let us make incision for your love,

8
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.000
to prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.070
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine hath feared the valiant.

10
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.670
By my love, I swear the best-regarded virgins

11
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.900
of our clime have loved it too.

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.970
I would not change this hue,

13
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.330
except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.400
In terms of choice, I am not solely led

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.700
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes.

16
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Besides, the lottery of my destiny

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.530
bars me the right of voluntary choosing.

18
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.530
But if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit,

19
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.170
to yield myself his wife

20
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.430
who wins me by that means I told you,

21
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.200
yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair

22
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.070
as any comer I have looked on yet for my affection.

23
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.630
Even for that, I thank you.

24
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.930
Therefore, I pray you,

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.330
lead me to the caskets to try my fortune.

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.470
AAGGHH!

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.400
By this scimitar that slew the Sophy

28
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.430
and a Persian prince that won three fields of Sultan Solyman,

29
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.130
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,

30
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.100
outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,

31
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.770
pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,

32
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.870
yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey to win thee, lady.

33
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.270
But, alas the while.

34
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.600
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice which is the better man,

35
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.700
the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand.

36
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.170
So is Alcides beaten by his page.

37
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.830
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,

38
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.870
miss that which one unworthier may attain

39
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.600
and die with grieving.

40
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.230
You must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all

41
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.230
or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong,

42
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.470
never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage.

43
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.930
Therefore, be advised.

44
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.730
Nor will not.

45
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.600
Come, bring me unto my chance.

46
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.700
First, forward to the temple.

47
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.170
After dinner, your hazard shall be made.

48
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.330
Good fortune then

49
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.000
to make me blessed or cursedest among men.

50
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.800
Certainly my conscience will serve me

51
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.370
to run from this Jew, my master.

52
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.500
But the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me,

53
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.700
"Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,"

54
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.430
or "good Gobbo,"

55
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.570
or "good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs.

56
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.730
Take the start; run away."

57
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.570
My conscience says,

58
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.700
"No, take heed, honest Launcelot.

59
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.300
"Take heed, honest Gobbo," or, as aforesaid,

60
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.600
"Honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run.

61
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.330
Scorn running with thy heels"

62
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.730
Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack.

63
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.570
"Via," says the fiend.

64
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.200
"Away," says the fiend.

65
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.970
"For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind," says the fiend,

66
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.030
"and run."

67
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.470
Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart,

68
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.800
says very wisely to me,

69
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.400
"My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son"--

70
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.830
or rather an honest woman's son, for, indeed,

71
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.100
my father did something smack, something grow to,

72
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.530
he had a kind of taste.

73
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.000
Well, my conscience says "Launcelot, budge not."

74
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.100
"Budge," says the fiend.

75
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.430
"Budge not," says my conscience.

76
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.730
"Conscience," say I, "you counsel well."

77
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.730
"Fiend," say I, "you counsel well."

78
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.200
To be ruled by my conscience,

79
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.670
I should stay with the Jew, my master,

80
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.670
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil.

81
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.900
And, to run away from the Jew,

82
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.470
I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence,

83
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.030
is the devil himself.

84
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.270
Certainly, the Jew is the very devil incarnation.

85
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.170
And, in my conscience,

86
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.530
my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience

87
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.670
to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew.

88
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.370
The fiend gives more friendly counsel.

89
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.570
I will run, fiend.

90
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.930
My heels are at your commandment.

91
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.400
I will run.

92
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.870
Master, young man, you, I pray you,

93
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.530
which is the way to master Jew's?

94
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.270
Oh, heavens, this is my true-begotten father,

95
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.500
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.

96
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.870
I will try confusions with him.

97
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.570
Master, young gentleman, I pray you,

98
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.970
which is the way to master Jew's?

99
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.000
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning,

100
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.200
but, at the next turning of all, on your left.

101
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.130
Marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand,

102
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.770
but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.

103
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.300
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit.

104
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.000
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot

105
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.270
that dwells with him dwell with him or no?

106
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.430
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

107
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.570
Mark me now.

108
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.070
Now I will raise the waters.

109
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.770
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

110
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.930
No master, but a poor man's son.

111
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.630
His father, though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man

112
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.430
and, God be thanked, well to live.

113
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.400
Well, let his father be what a' will.

114
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.400
We talk of young Master Launcelot.

115
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.100
Your worship's friend and Launcelot.

116
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.100
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,

117
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.930
talk you of young Master Launcelot?

118
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.330
Of Launcelot, sir, an't please your mastership.

119
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.170
Ergo, Master Launcelot!

120
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.930
Talk not of Master Launcelot, father,

121
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.200
for that gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies

122
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.100
and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three

123
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.230
and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased,

124
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.470
or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.

125
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.770
Marry, God forbid.

126
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.800
The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.

127
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.500
Do I look like a hovel-post, a cudgel, a staff or a prop?

128
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.530
Do you know me, father?

129
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.430
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.

130
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.030
But, I pray you, tell me,

131
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.670
is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?

132
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.630
Do you not know me, father?

133
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.470
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind.

134
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.670
I know you not.

135
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.370
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes,

136
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.900
you might fail of knowing me.

137
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.200
It is a wise father that knows his own child.

138
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.700
Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son.

139
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.870
Give me your blessing.

140
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.230
Truth will come to light.

141
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.670
Murder cannot be hid long.

142
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.900
A man's son maybe, but, in the end, truth will out.

143
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.270
Pray you, sir, stand up.

144
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.500
I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.

145
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.900
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it,

146
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.570
but give me your blessing.

147
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.070
I am Launcelot, your boy that was,

148
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.430
your son that is, your child that shall be.

149
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.100
I cannot think you are my son.

150
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.530
I know not what I shall think of that,

151
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.570
but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man,

152
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.730
and I am sure Margery, your wife, is my mother.

153
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.470
Her name is Margery, indeed.

154
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.570
I'll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot,

155
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:02.030
thou art my own flesh and blood.

156
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.730
Lord worshipped might he be.

157
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.100
What a beard hast thou got.

158
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.130
Thou hast more hair on thy chin

159
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.570
than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

160
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.900
It should seem, then, Dobbin's tail grows backward.

161
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.370
I am sure he had more hair of his tail

162
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.300
than I of my face when I last saw him.

163
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.130
Lord, how art thou changed.

164
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.630
How dost thou and thy master agree?

165
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.530
I have brought him a present.

166
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.070
How 'gree thee now?

167
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.370
Well, well.

168
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.030
But, for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away,

169
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.430
so I will not rest till I have run some ground.

170
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.770
My master's a very Jew.

171
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.100
Give him a present?

172
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.200
Give him a halter.

173
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.370
I am famished in his service.

174
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.730
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.

175
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.400
Father, I am glad you are come.

176
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.570
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio,

177
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.370
who, indeed, gives rare new liveries,

178
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.570
If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground.

179
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.700
Oh, rare fortune.

180
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.970
Here comes the man.

181
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.000
To him, father, for I am a Jew if I serve a Jew any longer.

182
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.170
You may do so, but let it be so hasted

183
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.000
that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.

184
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.200
See these letters delivered.

185
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.830
Put the liveries to making,

186
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:24.170
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

187
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.370
To him, father.

188
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.100
God bless your worship.

189
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.430
Gramercy.

190
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.830
Wouldst thou aught with me?

191
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.270
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy.

192
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.430
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man

193
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.470
that would, sir, as my father shall specify--

194
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.570
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--

195
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.930
Indeed, sir, the short and long is, I serve the Jew,

196
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.200
and have a desire, as my father should specify--

197
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.500
He and his master, sir, saving your worship's reverence,

198
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.330
are scarce cater-cousins--

199
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.500
To be very brief, sir,

200
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.230
the truth is the Jew, having done me wrong,

201
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.930
doth cause me, as my father, being,

202
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.400
I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--

203
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.770
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow on your worship,

204
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.070
and my suit is--

205
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.830
To be very brief, sir, the suit is impertinent to myself,

206
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.100
as your worship shall know by this honest old man.

207
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.630
And, though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.

208
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.330
One speak for both.

209
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.100
What would you?

210
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.000
Serve you, sir.

211
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.730
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

212
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:30.330
I know thee well; thou hast obtained thy suit.

213
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.430
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day

214
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.670
and hath preferred thee,

215
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.170
if it be preferment to leave a rich Jew's service

216
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.030
to become the follower of so poor a gentleman.

217
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.500
The old proverb is well parted

218
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.570
between my master Shylock and you, sir.

219
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:49.500
You have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough.

220
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500
Thou speak'st it well.

221
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.730
Go, father, with thy son.

222
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.400
Take leave of thy old master and inquire my lodging out.

223
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.900
Give him a livery more guarded than his fellows'.

224
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.330
See it done.

225
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.800
Father, in.

226
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.800
I cannot get a service, no.

227
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.070
I have ne'er a tongue in my head.

228
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.130
Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table

229
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.930
which doth offer to swear upon a book,

230
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.100
I shall have good fortune.

231
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.730
Go to, here's a simple line of life.

232
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.300
Here's a small trifle of wives.

233
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.530
Alas, fifteen wives is nothing.

234
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.170
Eleven widows and nine maids

235
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.200
is a simple coming-in for one man.

236
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.370
And then to 'scape drowning thrice,

237
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.600
and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed.

238
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.400
Here are simple 'scapes.

239
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.200
Well, if Fortune be a woman,

240
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.200
she's a good wench for this gear.

241
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.400
Father, come.

242
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.300
I'll take my leave of the Jew in a twinkling.

243
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.230
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.

244
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.600
These things being bought and orderly bestowed,

245
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.400
return in haste, for I do feast to-night

246
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.800
my best-esteemed acquaintance.

247
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.770
Hie thee, go.

248
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.400
My best endeavours shall be done herein.

249
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.070
Where is your master?

250
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:08.270
Yonder, sir, he walks.

251
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.500
Signior Bassanio!

252
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.600
Gratiano!

253
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.830
I have a suit to you.

254
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.030
You have obtained it.

255
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.230
You must not deny me.

256
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.700
I must go with you to Belmont.

257
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.030
Why then, you must.

258
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.270
But hear thee, Gratiano.

259
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:26.830
Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice.

260
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.670
Parts which become thee happily enough

261
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:30.930
and in such eyes as ours appear not faults.

262
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.330
But where thou art not known,

263
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.500
why, there they show something too liberal.

264
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.970
Pray thee, take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty

265
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.000
thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior,

266
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.370
I be misconstrued in the place I go to and lose my hopes.

267
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.270
Signior Bassanio, hear me.

268
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.330
If I do not put on a sober habit,

269
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.500
talk with respect, and swear but now and then,

270
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.730
wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, nay more,

271
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.900
while grace is saying, hood mine eyes thus with my hat,

272
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.900
and sigh and say "amen,"

273
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.170
use all the observance of civility

274
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.170
like one well studied in a sad ostent

275
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.400
to please his grandam, never trust me more.

276
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.800
Well, we shall see your bearing.

277
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.000
Nay, but I bar tonight.

278
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.170
You shall not gauge me by what we do tonight.

279
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.630
No, that were pity.

280
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.770
I would entreat you rather

281
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.470
to put on your boldest suit of mirth,

282
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.270
for we have friends that purpose merriment.

283
00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.400
But fare thee well.

284
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.630
I have some business.

285
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.030
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest,

286
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.700
but we will visit you at supper time.

287
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.670
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.

288
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.770
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,

289
00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.400
didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.

290
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.470
But fare thee well.

291
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.770
There is a ducat for thee.

292
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:54.300
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo,

293
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.470
who is thy new master's guest.

294
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.570
Give him this letter.

295
00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.100
Do it secretly.

296
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.930
And so farewell.

297
00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.070
I would not have my father see me in talk with thee.

298
00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.200
Adieu.

299
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.770
Tears exhibit my tongue.

300
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.300
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew.

301
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.330
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee,

302
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.600
I am much deceived.

303
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.630
But, adieu.

304
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:20.730
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.

305
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.530
Adieu.

306
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.530
Farewell, good Launcelot.

307
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.600
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me

308
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.800
to be ashamed to be my father's child?

309
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.270
But though I am a daughter to his blood,

310
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:54.570
I am not to his manners.

311
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:59.170
Oh, Lorenzo, if thou keep promise,

312
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:00.670
I shall end this strife,

313
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.600
become a Christian and thy loving wife.

314
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.800
Nay, we will slink away in supper time,

315
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.930
disguise us at my lodging, and return, all in an hour.

316
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.370
We have not made good preparation.

317
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.170
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

318
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.970
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered

319
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.970
and better, in my mind, not undertook.

320
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.370
'Tis now but four o'clock.

321
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.400
We have two hours to furnish us.

322
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.070
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

323
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.970
An it shall please you to break up this.

324
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.570
It shall seem to signify.

325
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.400
Mm-hmm.

326
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.030
I know the hand.

327
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.330
In faith, 'tis a fair hand.

328
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.930
And whiter than the paper it writ on

329
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.170
is the fair hand that writ.

330
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:36.330
Love news, in faith.

331
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.530
By your leave, sir.

332
00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:38.730
Whither goest thou?

333
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.300
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew

334
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.070
to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.

335
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.900
Hold, here, take this.

336
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.270
Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her.

337
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.430
Speak it privately.

338
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.870
Go, gentlemen.

339
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.000
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?

340
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.030
I am provided of a torch-bearer.

341
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.730
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

342
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.970
And so will I.

343
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.930
Meet me and Gratiano at Gratiano's lodging

344
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.470
some hour hence.

345
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:04.670
'Tis good we do so.

346
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.700
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

347
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.430
I must needs tell thee all.

348
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.770
She hath directed

349
00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.630
how I shall take her from her father's house,

350
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.100
what gold and jewels she is furnished with,

351
00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.700
what page's suit she hath in readiness.

352
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.500
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,

353
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.700
it will be for his gentle daughter's sake.

354
00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.700
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,

355
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.370
unless she do it under this excuse,

356
00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:29.400
that she is issue to a faithless Jew.

357
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.630
Come, go with me.

358
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.930
Peruse this as thou goest.

359
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.030
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

360
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:40.270
Well, thou shalt see.

361
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.530
Thy eyes shall be thy judge

362
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.370
the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.

363
00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.570
What, Jessica.

364
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:54.800
Thou shalt not gormandize as thou hast done with me.

365
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.700
What, Jessica.

366
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.470
Nor sleep and snore and rend apparel out.

367
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.770
Why, Jessica, I say!

368
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.870
Why, Jessica!

369
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.070
Who bids thee call?

370
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.670
I do not bid thee call.

371
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.430
Your worship was wont to tell me

372
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.170
I could do nothing without bidding.

373
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.400
Call you?

374
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.600
What is your will?

375
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.000
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

376
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.330
There are my keys.

377
00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.230
But wherefore should I go?

378
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.270
I am not bid for love.

379
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.230
They flatter me.

380
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:28.570
But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon the prodigal Christian.

381
00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:32.200
Jessica, my girl, look to my house.

382
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.530
I am right loath to go.

383
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:40.400
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,

384
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.300
for I did dream of moneybags tonight.

385
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.030
I beseech you, sir, go.

386
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.800
My young master doth expect your reproach.

387
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.670
So do I his.

388
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.270
An they have conspired together.

389
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.300
I will not say you shall see a masque,

390
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.170
but if you do, then it was not for nothing

391
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:02.630
that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last

392
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.200
at 6:00 i' the morning, falling out that year

393
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.700
on Ash Wednesday was four year, in the afternoon.

394
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.830
What, are there masques?

395
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.370
Hear you me, Jessica.

396
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.500
Lock up my doors.

397
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.000
And when you hear the drum

398
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.230
and the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife,

399
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.200
clamber not you up to the casements then,

400
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.000
nor thrust your head into the public street

401
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.130
to gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces,

402
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:24.870
but stop my house's ears.

403
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.100
I mean my casements.

404
00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.870
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter my sober house.

405
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.870
By Jacob's staff, I swear,

406
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:39.870
I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.

407
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.100
But I will go.

408
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.570
Go you before me, sirrah.

409
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.800
Say I will come.

410
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.270
I will go before you, sir.

411
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.400
Mistress, look out the window for all this.

412
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.370
There will come a Christian by, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

413
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.630
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, huh?

414
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.600
His words were "Farewell mistress."

415
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.630
Nothing else.

416
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:11.900
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder.

417
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.770
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day

418
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.930
more than the wildcat.

419
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.970
Drones hive not with me.

420
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.700
Therefore I part with him,

421
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.000
and part with him to one that I would have him help

422
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.330
to waste his borrowed purse.

423
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.070
Well, Jessica, go in.

424
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.770
Perhaps I will return immediately.

425
00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.100
Do as I bid you.

426
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.200
Shut doors after you.

427
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.930
Fast bind, fast find.

428
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:41.930
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

429
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.000
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crossed,

430
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.770
I have a father, you a daughter lost.

431
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:20.230
This is the penthouse

432
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.600
under which Lorenzo desired us to make stand.

433
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.930
His hour is almost past.

434
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.970
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,

435
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.870
for lovers ever run before the clock.

436
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.870
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly

437
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.070
to seal love's bonds new-made

438
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.700
than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited.

439
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.070
That ever holds.

440
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.530
Who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite

441
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.900
that he sits down?

442
00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.530
Where is the horse that doth untread again

443
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.970
his tedious measures with the unbated fire

444
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.930
that he did pace them first?

445
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:54.030
All things that are, are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.

446
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.270
How like a younker or a prodigal

447
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.600
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay,

448
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.500
hugged and embraced by the strumpet wind.

449
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.600
How like a prodigal doth she return

450
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.570
with over-weathered ribs and ragged sails,

451
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.100
lean, rent and beggared by the strumpet wind.

452
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.470
Here comes Lorenzo.

453
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.830
More of this hereafter.

454
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:18.330
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.

455
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.070
Not I, but my affairs have made you wait.

456
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.970
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,

457
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.670
I'll watch as long for you then.

458
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:30.430
Approach, here dwells my father Jew.

459
00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.270
Ho!

460
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.430
Sshh.

461
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.400
Who's within?

462
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.400
Who are you?

463
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.730
Tell me, for more certainty,

464
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.800
albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

465
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.430
Lorenzo, and thy love.

466
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.970
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed, for who love I so much?

467
00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.070
And now who knows but you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

468
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.430
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

469
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.100
Here, catch this casket.

470
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.970
It is worth the pains.

471
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.270
I am glad 'tis night.

472
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:09.700
You do not look on me,

473
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.170
For I am much ashamed of my exchange.

474
00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.700
But love is blind and lovers cannot see

475
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.870
the pretty follies that themselves commit,

476
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.570
for if they could, Cupid himself would blush

477
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.830
to see me thus transformed to a boy.

478
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.270
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

479
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.670
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?

480
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.130
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.

481
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.330
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love.

482
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.500
And I should be obscured.

483
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.970
So are you, sweet, even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

484
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.200
But come at once.

485
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.430
For the close night doth play the runaway,

486
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.730
and we are stayed for at Bassanio's feast.

487
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.870
I will make fast the doors

488
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.700
and gild myself with some more ducats

489
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.730
and be with you straight.

490
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.070
By my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

491
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:55.430
Beshrew me but I love her heartily.

492
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.700
For she is wise, if I can judge of her.

493
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.370
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.

494
00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.670
And true she is, as she hath proved herself.

495
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.870
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,

496
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:09.930
shall she be placed in my constant soul.

497
00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:11.270
What, art thou come?

498
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.470
On, gentlemen; away.

499
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.600
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

500
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.670
Who's there?

501
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.530
Signior Antonio.

502
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.030
Fie, fie, Gratiano.

503
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.400
Where are all the rest?

504
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.670
'Tis nine o'clock.

505
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:25.970
Our friends all stay for you.

506
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:27.270
No masque tonight.

507
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.500
The wind is come about.

508
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.300
Bassanio presently will go aboard.

509
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.970
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

510
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.330
I am glad on't.

511
00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.200
I desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight.

512
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.570
Go draw aside the curtains

513
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.970
and discover the several caskets to this noble prince.

514
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.970
Now make your choice.

515
00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.470
The first, of gold,

516
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:17.130
who this inscription bears:

517
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:22.600
"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

518
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.000
The second, silver,

519
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.500
which this promise carries:

520
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.100
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

521
00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:42.130
This third, dull lead,

522
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:43.870
with warning all as blunt.

523
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.830
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."

524
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.500
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

525
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.400
The one of them contains my picture, prince.

526
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.530
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

527
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.130
Some god, direct my judgment.

528
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.530
Let me see.

529
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:16.800
I will survey the inscriptions back again.

530
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.700
What says the leaden casket?

531
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.300
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."

532
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.000
"Must give"?

533
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.470
For what?

534
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.930
For lead?

535
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.430
Hazard for lead?

536
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.170
This casket threatens.

537
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.770
Men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages.

538
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.700
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.

539
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.430
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.

540
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:49.300
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

541
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:54.800
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

542
00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.770
"As much as he deserves"?

543
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.900
Pause there, Morocco, and weigh thy value with an even hand.

544
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.370
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation

545
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:06.570
Thou dost deserve enough.

546
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:10.470
And yet enough may not extend so far as to the lady.

547
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:14.470
And yet to be afeard of my deserving

548
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.500
were but a weak disabling of myself.

549
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.770
"As much as I deserve"?

550
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:19.930
Why, that's the lady.

551
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.930
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, in graces,

552
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.370
and in qualities of breeding.

553
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:31.270
But more than these, in love I do deserve.

554
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:37.670
What if I strayed no farther, but chose here?

555
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.870
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold.

556
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:53.070
"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

557
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.100
Why, that's the lady.

558
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.300
All the world desires her.

559
00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.800
From the four corners of the earth,

560
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.530
they come to kiss this shrine, this mortal, breathing saint.

561
00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:07.630
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide Arabia

562
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:11.070
are as throughfares now for princes to come view fair Portia.

563
00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:12.470
The watery kingdom

564
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.970
whose ambitious head spits in the face of heaven

565
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.830
is no bar to stop the foreign spirits,

566
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:21.270
but they come as o'er a brook to see fair Portia.

567
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.500
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.

568
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.700
Is it like that lead contains her?

569
00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.000
'Twere damnation to think so base a thought.

570
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.700
It were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.

571
00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:48.930
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,

572
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:57.270
being ten times undervalued to tried gold?

573
00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.070
Oh, sinful thought.

574
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:02.300
Never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold.

575
00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.900
They have in England a coin

576
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:07.170
that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold

577
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.970
but that's insculped upon.

578
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:21.070
But here, an angel in a golden bed lies all within.

579
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.700
Deliver me the key.

580
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.730
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.

581
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.230
There, take it, prince.

582
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:38.370
And if my form lie there, then I am yours.

583
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.130
Oh, hell.

584
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:52.700
What have we here?

585
00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.370
A carrion death

586
00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:01.870
within whose empty eye there is a written scroll.

587
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.970
I'll read the writing.

588
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:13.870
"All that glisters is not gold.

589
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.300
"Often have you heard that told.

590
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.400
"Many a man his life hath sold, but my outside to behold.

591
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.300
"Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

592
00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.470
"Had you been as wise as bold,

593
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.300
"young in limbs, in judgment old,

594
00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.170
"your answer had not been inscrolled.

595
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:40.570
Fare you well, your suit is cold."

596
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.070
Cold indeed, and labor lost.

597
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:59.070
Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.

598
00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.770
Portia, adieu.

599
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.530
I have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave.

600
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:13.670
Thus losers part.

601
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:24.070
A gentle riddance.

602
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.130
Draw the curtains, go.

603
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.600
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

604
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.100
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail!

605
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.130
With him is Gratiano gone along

606
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.170
and in their ship, I am sure Lorenzo is not.

607
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.530
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke,

608
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.430
who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

609
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.770
He came too late.

610
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.000
The ship was under sail.

611
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.330
But there the Duke was given to understand

612
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.200
that in a gondola were seen together

613
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.430
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.

614
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.270
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke

615
00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.230
they were not with Bassanio in his ship.

616
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.100
I never heard a passion so confused,

617
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.900
so strange, outrageous, and so variable

618
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.130
as the dog Jew did utter in the streets.

619
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:14.670
"My daughter.

620
00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:17.300
"Oh, my ducats.

621
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.970
"Oh, my daughter fled with a Christian.

622
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.200
"Oh, my Christian ducats!

623
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.170
"Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter.

624
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.830
"A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,

625
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.770
"of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter.

626
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:39.730
"And Jewels, oh, two stones, two rich and precious stones

627
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.800
"stolen by my daughter.

628
00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.230
"Justice, find the girl.

629
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.470
She hath the stones upon her and the ducats."

630
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.730
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him

631
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.630
crying "his stones, his daughter,

632
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.630
and his ducats!"

633
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.330
Let good Antonio look he keep his day

634
00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:03.330
or he shall pay for this.

635
00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.500
Marry, well remembered.

636
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.970
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday

637
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.730
who told me, in the narrow seas

638
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.100
that part the French and English

639
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.530
there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught.

640
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.230
I thought upon Antonio when he told me

641
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.230
and wished in silence that it were not his.

642
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.000
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,

643
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.270
yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

644
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:29.270
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.

645
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.270
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.

646
00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.270
Bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return.

647
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.170
He answered, "Do not so.

648
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.500
"Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,

649
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.970
"but stay the very ripening of the time.

650
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.600
"And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,

651
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.170
"let it not enter in your mind of love.

652
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.030
"Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship

653
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.030
"and such fair ostents of love

654
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.870
as shall conveniently become you there."

655
00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.830
And even there, his eye being big with tears,

656
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.670
turning his face, he put his hand behind him,

657
00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.700
and with affection wondrous sensible,

658
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.970
he wrung Bassanio's hand.

659
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:10.830
And so they parted.

660
00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:14.200
I think he only loves the world for him.

661
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.370
I pray thee, let us go and find him out

662
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:20.130
and quicken his embraced heaviness

663
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:21.900
with some delight or other.

664
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.330
Do we so!

665
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.570
Quick, I pray thee, draw the curtains straight.

666
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.630
The Prince of Aragon hath ta'en his oath

667
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.430
and comes to his election presently.

668
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:36.000
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince.

669
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.100
If you choose that wherein I am contained,

670
00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.830
straight shall our nuptial rights be solemnized.

671
00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.070
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,

672
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.970
you must be gone from hence immediately.

673
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:53.030
I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:

674
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:59.700
first, never to unfold to anyone which casket 'twas I chose;

675
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:04.070
next, if I fail of the right casket,

676
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:08.670
never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage;

677
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.970
lastly, if I do fail in fortune of my choice,

678
00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.770
immediately to leave you and be gone.

679
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.030
To these injunctions everyone doth swear

680
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.170
that comes to hazard for my worthless self.

681
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.330
And so have I addressed me.

682
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.970
Fortune now to my heart's hope.

683
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.470
Gold.

684
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.770
Silver.

685
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.030
And base lead?

686
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:59.870
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."

687
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:04.600
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.

688
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.770
What says the golden chest, huh?

689
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.200
Let me see.

690
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:15.670
"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

691
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.470
"What many men desire."

692
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.430
That "many" may be meant by the fool multitude

693
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.530
that choose by show,

694
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.200
not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,

695
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:30.200
which pries not to the interior,

696
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.870
but like the martlet,

697
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.170
builds in the weather on the outward wall

698
00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.770
even in the force and the road of casualty.

699
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:42.170
Hmm, I will not choose what many men desire,

700
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.430
because I will not jump with common spirits

701
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:47.170
and rank me with the barbarous multitudes.

702
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:51.930
Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.

703
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.230
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.

704
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:58.570
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

705
00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.900
And well said too.

706
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:07.870
For who shall go about to cozen fortune

707
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:11.130
and be honorable without the stamp of merit?

708
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.030
Hmm?

709
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:18.570
Let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity.

710
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:22.970
Oh, that estates, degrees, and offices

711
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.570
were not derived corruptly,

712
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.600
and that clear honor were purchased

713
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.700
by the merit of the wearer.

714
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.700
How many then should cover that stand bare?

715
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.370
How many be commanded that command?

716
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.800
How much low peasantry

717
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.170
would then be gleaned from the true seed of honor?

718
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.630
And how much honor picked from the chaff

719
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.670
and ruin of the times to be new varnished?

720
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.630
Well, but to my choice.

721
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.830
Uh-huh.

722
00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:01.970
Hmm.

723
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.670
Hmm.

724
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.270
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

725
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.170
I will assume desert.

726
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.770
Give me a key for this

727
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.530
and instantly unlock my fortunes here.

728
00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.070
Too long a pause for that which you find there.

729
00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.530
What's here?

730
00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:50.930
The portrait of a blinking idiot presenting me a schedule?

731
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:55.970
I will read it.

732
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.870
How much unlike art thou to Portia.

733
00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.400
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings.

734
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.070
"Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves."

735
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.200
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

736
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.530
Is that my prize?

737
00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.230
Are my deserts no better?

738
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.700
To offend and judge are distinct offices

739
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.500
and of opposed natures.

740
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.100
What's here?

741
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.730
"The fire seven times tried this,

742
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:31.130
"seven times tried that judgment is that it never choose amiss.

743
00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.400
"Some there be that shadows kiss.

744
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.030
"Such have but a shadow's bliss.

745
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:44.730
"There be fools alive, I wis, silvered o'er, and so was this.

746
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.970
"Take what wife you will to bed.

747
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.030
"I will ever be your head.

748
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:54.470
So be gone, you are sped."

749
00:39:54.470 --> 00:40:00.470
Still more fool I shall appear by the time I linger here.

750
00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:07.200
With one fool's head I came to woo,

751
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.400
but I go away with two.

752
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.630
Sweet, adieu.

753
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:22.430
I'll keep my oath, patiently to bear my wroth.

754
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.570
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.

755
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.270
Oh, these deliberate fools.

756
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.870
When they do choose,

757
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.570
they have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

758
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.570
The ancient saying is no heresy:

759
00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:01.130
"Hanging and wiving go by destiny."

760
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.430
Come draw the curtain, Nerissa.

761
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:04.700
Where is my lady?

762
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.930
Here.

763
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.200
What would my lord?

764
00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.630
Madam, there is alighted at your gate a young Venetian,

765
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.470
one that comes before to signify the approaching of his lord

766
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.830
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets,

767
00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:21.170
to wit, besides commends and courteous breath,

768
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:23.130
gifts of rich value.

769
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:26.500
Yet I have not seen so likely an ambassador of love.

770
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.730
A day in April never came so sweet

771
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.370
to show how costly summer was at hand

772
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.300
as this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

773
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.630
No more, I pray thee.

774
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.470
I'm half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee

775
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.630
thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.

776
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.730
Come, come, Nerissa,

777
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:44.300
for I long to see quick Cupid's post

778
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.770
that comes so mannerly.

779
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:51.870
Bassanio lord, love, if thy will it be.

780
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.870
