00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600


2
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.200
The ides of March are come.

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.530
Ay, Caesar, but not gone.

4
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.270
Hail, Caesar!

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.670
Read this schedule.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.830
Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read, at your best leisure,

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.200
this his most humble suit.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.430
O Caesar, read mine first,

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.970
for mine's a suit that touches Caesar nearer.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.170
Read it, great Caesar.

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.870
What touches us ourself shall be last served.

12
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.830
Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.000
What, is the fellow mad?

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800
Sirrah, give place!

15
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.830
What, urge you your petitions in the street?

16
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.270
Come to the Capitol.

17
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.770
I wish your enterprise today may thrive.

18
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.570
What enterprise, Popilius?

19
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.400
Fare you well.

20
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.970
What said Popilius Lena?

21
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.300
He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.

22
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.030
I fear our purpose is discovered.

23
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.830
Look how he makes to Caesar; mark him.

24
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.530
Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.

25
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.230
Brutus, what shall be done?

26
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.030
If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.270
for I will slay myself.

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.030
Cassius, be constant.

29
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.200
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;

30
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.830
for, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

31
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.700
Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,

32
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.400
he draws Mark Antony out of the way.

33
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.730
Where is Metellus Cimber?

34
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.070
Let him go and presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

35
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.770
He is address'd; press near and second him.

36
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.600
Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

37
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.330
What is now amiss that Caesar and his Senate must redress?

38
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.700
Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,

39
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.170
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart.

40
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.630
I must prevent thee, Cimber.

41
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.030
These couchings and these lowly courtesies

42
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.700
might fire the blood of ordinary men

43
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.630
and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children.

44
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.900
Be not fond to think that Caesar bears such rebel blood

45
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.600
that will be thaw'd from the true quality

46
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.230
with that which melteth fools.

47
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.330
I mean sweet words, low-crooked court'sies,

48
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.470
and base spaniel-fawning.

49
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.870
Thy brother by decree is banished.

50
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.170
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,

51
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.600
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.

52
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.070
Know, Caesar doth not wrong,

53
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.370
nor without cause will he be satisfied.

54
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.330
Is there no voice more worthy than my own,

55
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.800
to sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear

56
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.770
for the repealing of my banish'd brother?

57
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.230
I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,

58
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.830
desiring thee that Publius Cimber

59
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.200
may have an immediate freedom of repeal.

60
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.400
What, Brutus?

61
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.600
Pardon, Caesar!

62
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.730
Caesar, pardon!

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.770
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall

64
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.030
to beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

65
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.530
I could be well moved, if I were as you;

66
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.330
if I could pray to move, then prayers would move me;

67
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.700
but I am constant as the northern star,

68
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.770
of whose true-fix'd and resting quality

69
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.770
there is no fellow in the firmament.

70
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.200
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;

71
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.430
they are all fire and every one doth shine;

72
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.170
but there's but one in all doth hold his place.

73
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.170
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,

74
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.300
and men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;

75
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.300
yet in the number I do know but one

76
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.500
that unassailable holds on his rank, unshaked of motion;

77
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.330
and that I am he, let me a little show it, even in this;

78
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.100
that I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,

79
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.270
and constant do remain to keep him so.

80
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.430
O Caesar--

81
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.330
Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?

82
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.500
Great Caesar--

83
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.930
Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

84
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.000
Speak, hands, for me!

85
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.900
Et tu, Brute?

86
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.870
Then fall, Caesar.

87
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.030
Liberty!

88
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.230
Freedom!

89
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.770
Tyranny is dead!

90
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.770
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets!

91
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.130
Some to the common pulpits,

92
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.700
cry out, "Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"

93
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.400
People and senators, be not affrighted,

94
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.730
fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.

95
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.070
Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

96
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.300
And Cassius too.

97
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.430
Where's Publius?

98
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.700
Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

99
00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.470
Stand fast together, lest some friend--

100
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.900
Talk not of standing.

101
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.270
Publius, good cheer, there is no harm intended to your person,

102
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.500
nor to no Roman else.

103
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.830
So tell them, Publius.

104
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.300
And leave us, Publius, lest the people rushing on us

105
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.700
should do your age some mischief.

106
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.130
Do so, and let no man abide this deed but we the doers.

107
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.730
Where is Antony?

108
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.570
Fled to his house amazed.

109
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.300
Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run

110
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.470
as it were doomsday.

111
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.100
Fates, we will know your pleasures.

112
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.730
That we shall die, we know;

113
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.600
'tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon.

114
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.630
Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life

115
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.300
cuts off so many years of fearing death.

116
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.330
Grant that, and then is death a benefit;

117
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.670
so are we Caesar's friends

118
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.770
that have abridged his time of fearing death.

119
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.870
Stoop, Romans, stoop,

120
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.030
and let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood

121
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.330
up to the elbows, and besmear our swords.

122
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.830
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,

123
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.530
and waving our red weapons o'er our heads,

124
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:57.030
Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"

125
00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.070
Stoop then, and wash.

126
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.170
How many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over

127
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.070
in states unborn and accents yet unknown!

128
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.300
How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,

129
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:21.070
that now on Pompey's basis lies along no worthier than the dust.

130
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.070
So oft as that shall be,

131
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.370
so often shall the knot of us be call'd

132
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.470
the men that gave their country liberty.

133
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.000
What, shall we forth?

134
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.670
Ay, every man away.

135
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.700
Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels

136
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.430
with the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

137
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.600
Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,

138
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.870
thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,

139
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.600
and, being prostrate,thus he bade me say:

140
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.600
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;

141
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.570
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.

142
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.930
Say I love Brutus and I honor him;

143
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:23.270
say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.

144
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.070
If Brutus will vouchsafe

145
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.330
that Antony may safely come to him

146
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.030
and be resolved how Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,

147
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.630
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead

148
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.730
so well as Brutus living,

149
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.630
but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus

150
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.670
thorough the hazards of this untrod state

151
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.400
with all true faith.

152
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.800
So says my master Antony.

153
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.230
Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;

154
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.030
I never thought him worse.

155
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.300
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,

156
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.300
he shall be satisfied and, by my honor, depart untouch'd.

157
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.930
I'll fetch him presently.

158
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.770
I know that we shall have him well to friend.

159
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:16.030
I wish we may, but yet have I a mind that fears him much,

160
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.130
and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose.

161
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.230
Welcome, Mark Antony.

162
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.900
O mighty Caesar.

163
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:13.770
Dost thou lie so low?

164
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.370
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,

165
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.800
shrunk to this little measure?

166
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.430
Fare thee well.

167
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.470
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,

168
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.600
who else must be let blood, who else is rank.

169
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.970
If I myself, there is no hour so fit as Caesar's death's hour,

170
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.030
nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords,

171
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.930
made rich with the most noble blood of all this world.

172
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:02.570
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,

173
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.500
now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,

174
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.600
fulfill your pleasure.

175
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.900
Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die;

176
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.570
no place will please me so, no means of death,

177
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:21.130
as here by Caesar, and by you cut off,

178
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:27.370
the choice and master spirits of this age.

179
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.970
O Antony, beg not your death of us.

180
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.100
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,

181
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.530
as, by our hands and this our present act you see we do,

182
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.070
yet see you but our hands

183
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.070
and this the bleeding business they have done.

184
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.430
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;

185
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.330
and pity to the general wrong of Rome--

186
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.770
as fire drives out fire, so pity pity--

187
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.370
Hath done this deed on Caesar.

188
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.970
For your part, to you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;

189
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.970
our arms in strength of malice,

190
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.230
and our hearts of brothers' temper,

191
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.900
do receive you in with all kind love,

192
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.400
good thoughts, and reverence.

193
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.530
Your voice shall be as strong as any man's

194
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.900
in the disposing of new dignities.

195
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.270
Only be patient till we have appeased the multitude,

196
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.930
beside themselves with fear,

197
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.430
and then we will deliver you the cause why I,

198
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.770
that did love Caesar when I struck him,

199
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.300
have thus proceeded.

200
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.800
I doubt not of your wisdom.

201
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.330
Let each man render me his bloody hand.

202
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:43.130
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;

203
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:52.670
next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;

204
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.600
now, Decius Brutus, yours;

205
00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:01.000
yours, good Metellus; yours, Cinna;

206
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.230
and, my valiant Casca, yours;

207
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:11.270
though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.

208
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:21.630
Gentlemen all.

209
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.500
Alas, what shall I say?

210
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.930
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,

211
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.770
that one of two bad ways you must conceit me,

212
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:34.470
either a coward or a flatterer.

213
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.630
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true.

214
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.770
If then thy spirit look upon us now,

215
00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.970
shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death

216
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.470
to see thy Antony making his peace,

217
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.270
shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, most noble,

218
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.330
in the presence of thy course?

219
00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.030
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,

220
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.230
weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,

221
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.630
it would become me better

222
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.400
than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies.

223
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.400
Pardon me, Julius.

224
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.430
Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,

225
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:22.730
here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,

226
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:34.230
sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.

227
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.670
and this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.

228
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:45.430
How like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie.

229
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.570
Mark Antony--

230
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.000
Pardon me, Caius Cassius.

231
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.230
The enemies of Caesar shall say this:

232
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.270
then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

233
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.570
I blame you not for praising Caesar so;

234
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.630
but what compact mean you to have with us?

235
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.800
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,

236
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.030
or shall we on, and not depend on you?

237
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:06.900
Therefore I took your hand,

238
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:12.070
but was indeed sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.

239
00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:18.270
Friends am I with you all and love you all,

240
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.800
upon this hope that you shall give me reasons

241
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.130
why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

242
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.730
Or else were this a savage spectacle.

243
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:31.830
Our reasons are so full of good regard that were you, Antony,

244
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.730
the son of Caesar, you should be satisfied.

245
00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:39.970
That's all I seek; and am moreover suitor

246
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.230
that I may produce his body to the marketplace,

247
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.470
and in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,

248
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:52.030
speak in the order of his funeral.

249
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.330
You shall, Mark Antony.

250
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.470
Brutus, a word with you.

251
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.470
You know not what you do.

252
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.300
Do not consent that Antony speak in his funeral.

253
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.030
Know you how much the people may be moved

254
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:10.370
by that he will utter?

255
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.270
By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first,

256
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.030
and show the reason of our Caesar's death.

257
00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.400
What Antony shall speak,

258
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.600
I will protest he speaks by leave and by permission,

259
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.900
and that we are contented Caesar shall have

260
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.030
all true rites and lawful ceremonies.

261
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.730
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

262
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.170
I know not what may fall; I like it not.

263
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.830
Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.

264
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.500
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,

265
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.700
but speak all good you can devise of Caesar,

266
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.630
and say you do't by our permission,

267
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.770
else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral.

268
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.930
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto I am going,

269
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.000
after my speech is ended.

270
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.400
Be it so, I do desire no more.

271
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.700
Prepare the body then, and follow us.

272
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.400
O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,

273
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.730
that I am meek and gentle with these butchers!

274
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.630
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man

275
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.830
that ever lived in the tide of times.

276
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.570
Woe to the hand that shed his costly blood.

277
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.500
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,

278
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.970
which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips

279
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.770
to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue.

280
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.230
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;

281
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:54.000
domestic fury and fierce civil strife

282
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.600
shall cumber all the parts of Italy;

283
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.330
blood and destruction shall be so in use,

284
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.570
and dreadful objects so familiar,

285
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.570
that mothers shall but smile

286
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.170
when they behold their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;

287
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.230
all pity choked with custom of fell deeds,

288
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.900
and Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,

289
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.170
with Ate by his side come hot from hell,

290
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:23.570
shall in these confines with a monarch's voice cry "havoc!"

291
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.700
And let slip the dogs of war,

292
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.630
that this foul deed shall smell above the earth

293
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.270
with carrion men, groaning for burial.

294
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.930
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?

295
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.670
I do, Mark Antony.

296
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.070
Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

297
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.030
He did receive his letters, and is coming,

298
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.500
and bid me say to you by word of mouth--

299
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.030
O Caesar!

300
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.370
Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.

301
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.570
Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,

302
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.600
seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, began to water.

303
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.170
Is thy master coming?

304
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.500
He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.

305
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.000
Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.

306
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.370
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,

307
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.200
no Rome of safety for Octavius yet;

308
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.470
hie hence, and tell him so.

309
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:44.230
Yet stay awhile, thou shalt not back

310
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.270
till I have borne this corpse into the marketplace.

311
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.470
There shall I try, in my oration,

312
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:56.030
how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men,

313
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.300
according to the which thou shalt discourse

314
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.470
to young Octavius of the state of things.

315
00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.500
Then follow me and give me audience, friends!

316
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.800
Cassius, go you into the other street and part the numbers.

317
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.600
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;

318
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.070
those that will follow Cassius, go with him;

319
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.570
and public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death.

320
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.600
Be patient till the last!

321
00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.500
Romans, countrymen, and lovers.

322
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:07.930
Hear me for my cause, and be silent, that you may hear.

323
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.870
Believe me for mine honor,

324
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:15.130
and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe.

325
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.730
Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses,

326
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.970
that you may the better judge.

327
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.400
If there be any in this assembly,

328
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.400
any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say

329
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:36.230
that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.

330
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:41.470
If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar,

331
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:47.770
this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less,

332
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:51.070
but that I loved Rome more.

333
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:59.330
Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,

334
00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:04.800
than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen?

335
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.930
As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;

336
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:12.030
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it;

337
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.100
as he was valiant, I honor him;

338
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:22.770
but as he was ambitious, I slew him!

339
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:30.270
There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune,

340
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.830
honor for his valor, and death for his ambition.

341
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:42.670
Who is here so base that would be a bondman?

342
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:46.870
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

343
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:52.070
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?

344
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:57.700
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

345
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:02.970
Who is here so vile that will not love his country?

346
00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:09.230
If any, speak, for him have I offended.

347
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:12.930
I pause for a reply.

348
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.170
None, Brutus, none.

349
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.000
Then none have I offended.

350
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.900
I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.

351
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.300
The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol,

352
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.470
his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy,

353
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.430
nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.

354
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.270
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony,

355
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.530
who, though he had no hand in his death,

356
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.030
shall receive the benefit of his dying,

357
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:57.900
a place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not?

358
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.170
With this I depart--

359
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:16.230
that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome,

360
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.500
I have the same dagger for myself,

361
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:24.870
when it shall please my country to need my death.

362
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.670
Live!

363
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.300
Good countrymen, let me depart alone,

364
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.070
and, for my sake, stay here with Antony.

365
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.770
Do grace to Caesar's corpse,

366
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:50.800
and grace his speech tending to Caesar's glories,

367
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.730
which Mark Antony, by our permission, is allow'd to make.

368
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:02.800
I do entreat you, not a man depart, save I alone,

369
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.030
till Antony have spoke.

370
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.470
Let him go in the public chair; we will hear him.

371
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.900
Noble Antony, go up.

372
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.700
For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.

373
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:21.900
What does he say of Brutus?

374
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.600
He says, for Brutus' sake,

375
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.730
he' beholding to us all.

376
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.000
'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.

377
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.800
This Caesar was a tyrant!

378
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.170
Nay, that's certain.

379
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.230
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.

380
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.600
Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.

381
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:42.430
You gentle Romans--

382
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.030
Peace, ho!

383
00:26:53.400 --> 00:27:01.300
Friends, Romans, countrymen...

384
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.830
lend me your ears!

385
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:09.830
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.

386
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.600
The evil that men do lives after them,

387
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.270
the good is oft interred with their bones;

388
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.500
so let it be with Caesar.

389
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:27.130
The noble Brutus hath told you Caesar was ambitious;

390
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.930
if it were so, it was a grievous fault,

391
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.000
and grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.

392
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.600
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--

393
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.970
for Brutus is an honorable man; so are they all,

394
00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:46.670
all honorable men.

395
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:52.000
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.

396
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.100
He was my friend, faithful and just to me;

397
00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.870
but Brutus says he was ambitious,

398
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.600
and Brutus is an honorable man!

399
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.570
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,

400
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:16.630
whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.

401
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:21.700
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?

402
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:26.700
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;

403
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.800
ambition should be made of sterner stuff:

404
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.270
yet Brutus says he was ambitious,

405
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.330
and Brutus is an honorable man.

406
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.200
You all did see

407
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.600
that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown,

408
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.870
which he did thrice refuse.

409
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.130
Was this ambition?

410
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.030
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,

411
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.300
and sure he is an honorable man.

412
00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.300
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,

413
00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:59.530
but here I am to speak what I do know.

414
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:06.330
You all did love him once, not without cause;

415
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:13.330
what cause withholds you then to mourn for him?

416
00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.770
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,

417
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.570
and men have lost their reason.

418
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.700
Bear with me; my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,

419
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.000
and I must pause till it come back to me.

420
00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:35.470
Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.

421
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:36.570
If thou consider rightly of the matter,

422
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:38.700
Caesar has had great wrong.

423
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.200
Has he, masters?

424
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.730
I fear there will a worse come in his place.

425
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.300
He would not take the crown;

426
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.830
therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.

427
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:54.570
If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

428
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.430
Ah, poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

429
00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:00.770
There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

430
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.330
Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

431
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.430
But yesterday the word of Caesar

432
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.200
might have stood against the world.

433
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:25.030
Now lies he there, and none so poor to do him reverence.

434
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.230
O masters!

435
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.730
If I were disposed

436
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.930
to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,

437
00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:34.630
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,

438
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.500
who, you all know, are honorable men.

439
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.200
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose to wrong the dead,

440
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:45.000
to wrong myself and you, than I will wrong such honorable men.

441
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:52.400
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;

442
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:59.200
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.

443
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.830
Let but the commons hear this testament--

444
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:04.200
which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--

445
00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.070
and they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds

446
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:11.430
and dip their napkins in his sacred blood,

447
00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.170
yea, beg a hair of him for memory, and, dying,

448
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.900
mention it within their wills,

449
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.130
bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue.

450
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.730
Will you be patient?

451
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.330
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;

452
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.930
it is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.

453
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:39.470
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;

454
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.670
and, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,

455
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.030
it will inflame you, it will make you mad.

456
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:49.800
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,

457
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.070
for if you should, O, what would come of it!

458
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.770
Will you be patient?

459
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.730
Will you stay awhile?

460
00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.530
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.

461
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.800
I fear I wrong the honorable men

462
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.570
whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

463
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.170
They were traitors! Honorable men?

464
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.570
The will! The will!

465
00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.230
The will! The will!

466
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.000
The will! The will!

467
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.630
The will! The will!

468
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.430
The will! The will!

469
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.200
The will! The will!

470
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200
The will!

471
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.770
You will compel me then to read the will?

472
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.570
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,

473
00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.900
that I may show you him that made the will.

474
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.570
Shall I descend, and will you give me leave?

475
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:20.500
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.

476
00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.570
You all do know this mantle.

477
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:26.270
I remember the first time ever Caesar put it on;

478
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.000
'twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,

479
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.930
that day he overcame the Nervii.

480
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:39.570
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;

481
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:44.000
see what a rent the envious Casca made;

482
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.630
through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;

483
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:53.700
and as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,

484
00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:56.930
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,

485
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:58.270
as rushing out of doors,

486
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.000
to be resolved if Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;

487
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.770
for Brutus, you all know, was Caesar's angel.

488
00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:10.970
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him.

489
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:16.500
This was the most unkindest cut of all;

490
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:23.100
for when the noble Caesar saw him stab, ingratitude,

491
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:29.570
more strong than traitors' arms, quite vanquish'd him.

492
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:31.600
Then burst his mighty heart,

493
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.530
and, in his mantle muffling up his face,

494
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.770
even at the base of Pompey's statue,

495
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:42.170
which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell!

496
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.300
What a fall was there, my countrymen.

497
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:56.200
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,

498
00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:01.070
whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.

499
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:08.600
O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel the dint of pity.

500
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:13.770
These are gracious drops.

501
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.100
Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold

502
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.270
our Caesar's vesture wounded?

503
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:21.070
Look you here, here is himself,

504
00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.770
marr'd, as you see, with traitors!

505
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:25.900
Oh!

506
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:29.870
- O piteous spectacle. - O noble Caesar.

507
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:31.070
Woeful day.

508
00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.530
Villains. Traitors.

509
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.900
O most bloody sight!

510
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.870
We will be revenged!

511
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.900
Good friends, sweet friends,

512
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.830
let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny.

513
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.130
They that have done this deed are honorable.

514
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.770
What private griefs they have,

515
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:59.100
alas, I know not, that made them do it,

516
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.770
but they are wise and honorable,

517
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:03.300
and will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.

518
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:06.830
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.

519
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.130
I am no orator, as Brutus is; but, as you know me all,

520
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:14.130
a plain blunt man, that loved my friend,

521
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.370
and that they know full well that gave me public leave

522
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.970
to speak of him.

523
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.270
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, action,

524
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:25.070
nor utterance, nor the power of speech, to stir men's blood.

525
00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.430
I only speak right on;

526
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.130
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;

527
00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:38.600
show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths,

528
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.330
and bid them speak for me!

529
00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:45.270
But were I Brutus, and Brutus Antony,

530
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.900
there were an Antony would ruffle up your spirits

531
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.130
and put a tongue in every wound of Caesar's

532
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:55.800
that should move the stones of Rome to rise and mutiny!

533
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:14.000
Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.

534
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.500
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?

535
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.530
Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.

536
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:29.530
You have forgot the will I told you of.

537
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.630
Here is the will, and under seal of Caesar.

538
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:56.270
To every Roman citizen...

539
00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:00.570
he gives seventy-five drachmas.

540
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:03.930
Hear me with patience.

541
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.970
Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, his private arbors,

542
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.930
and new-planted orchards, on this side Tiber;

543
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:15.000
he hath left them you, and to your heirs forever--

544
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.070
common pleasures, to walk abroad and recreate yourselves.

545
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.900
Here was a Caesar!

546
00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:27.100
When comes such another?

547
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.830
Never! Never!

548
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.100
Now let it work.

549
00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:52.830
Mischief, thou art afoot, take thou what course thou wilt.

550
00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.300
How now, fellow?

551
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:56.570
Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.

552
00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:57.670
Where is he?

553
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:59.030
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.

554
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.600
And thither will I straight to visit him.

555
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.030
He comes upon a wish.

556
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.570
Fortune is merry, and in this mood will give us anything.

557
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:08.030
I heard him say Brutus and Cassius

558
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.900
are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.

559
00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.500
Be like they had some notice of the people,

560
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.830
how I had moved them.

561
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.030
Come, bring me to Octavius.

562
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.970
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,

563
00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.530
and things unluckily charge my fantasy.

564
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.430
I have no will to wander forth of doors,

565
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.730
yet something leads me forth.

566
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:35.930
What is your name?

567
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.130
Whither are you going?

568
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.370
Where do you dwell?

569
00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:39.800
Are you a married man or a bachelor?

570
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.130
Answer every man directly.

571
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.230
Ay, and briefly.

572
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:43.400
Ay, and wisely.

573
00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.670
Ay, and truly, you were best.

574
00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.770
What is my name?

575
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:46.870
Whither am I going?

576
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.130
Where do I dwell?

577
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.470
Am I a married man or a bachelor?

578
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:55.300
Hmm, then, to answer every man directly and briefly,

579
00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:00.130
wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

580
00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.170
That's as much as to say they are fools that marry.

581
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.200
You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear.

582
00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.300
Proceed directly.

583
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.600
Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.

584
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.800
As a friend or an enemy?

585
00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.930
As a friend.

586
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:11.200
That matter is answered directly.

587
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.330
For your dwelling, briefly.

588
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:13.500
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

589
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:14.600
Your name, sir, truly.

590
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.800
Truly, my name is Cinna.

591
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.130
Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator!

592
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.930
I'm Cinna the poet! I'm Cinna the poet!

593
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.130
Tear him for his bad verses! Tear him for his bad verses!

594
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.400
I am not Cinna the conspirator!

595
00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.800
It is no matter, his name's Cinna.

596
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.530
Pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going.

597
00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.130
Tear him! Tear him!

598
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.900
Tear him!

599
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.500
