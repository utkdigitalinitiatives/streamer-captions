The teenage brain.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.100
By the second decade of life,
the human brain is full-size,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.660
its billions of neurons
all in place.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.630
But it is not yet finished.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.560
MAN:
The brain is a work in progress

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.660
and adolescence is
the last great time

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.560
of enormous brain change
and brain development.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.000
NARRATOR:
Now the drama
of brain development focuses

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.660
on the part of the brain
that makes us uniquely human:

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.300
the still-maturing
prefrontal cortex.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.730
MAN:
The prefrontal cortex is
a part of the brain

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.500
that allows us
to make future plans,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.300
and that's involved in
such highly abstract areas

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.930
as personal responsibility,
morality and self-control.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.160
This part of the brain
is undergoing

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.330
this major, major step in
maturation during adolescence.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.430
(<i> techno dance music playing</i> )

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.900
NARRATOR:
With the part of the brain
responsible for reason,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.100
judgment and self-discipline
still developing,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.660
it is no wonder

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.400
that the teenage years can be
a time of turmoil and confusion.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.360
WOMAN:
The adolescent's brain is clumsy

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.600
because all of a sudden there's
these new parts of their brain

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.530
that are on-line,
that are doing tasks

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.200
and they're getting used to it.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.260
They are trying to figure out

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.060
"Okay, I've got a frontal
cortex; what do I do with it?"

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.560
NARRATOR:
The developing teenage brain
is in flux,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.730
shaping personality, behavior,
even identity itself.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.100
As the brain matures,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.560
the teenager also faces
special risks

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.430
from addictive drugs and alcohol
that can hijack the brain

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.030
to the chaos of schizophrenia

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.960
that strikes most often
during adolescence.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.900
NARRATOR:
Sometimes the teenage brain
fails in ways

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.560
that challenge even our
most advanced understanding

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.660
of how it works.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.260
Two years ago Courtney Hale-Cook
was a senior in high school

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.200
when he was struck by
schizophrenia, a brain disease

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.830
to which adolescents
are particularly vulnerable.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.130
HALE-COOK:
You know, I spent...

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.860
up to that point I had spent
19 years, you know,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.730
with virtually
the same personality

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.030
and I was very accustomed to it,

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.530
and I liked it.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.230
I liked being me, you know?

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.400
And all of a sudden
it was taken away.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.360
He would come up to me
and he would say,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.760
"Mom, you look like
a really old lady today."

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.860
And he said... he would point
to my eyes and he'd say,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.200
"You have a black hole here
and a black hole there."

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.330
Or he would describe things
as going into tunnel vision

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.760
so that everything else is black

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.360
except what was in that
small tunnel at the end.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.360
When he would open his eyes
in the morning

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.930
he would see gnats,
he would see sparkles.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.460
Not even with the first
thought of the day,

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.900
just the minute
the eyes were open,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.130
he would have all these
visual disturbances.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.960
HALE-COOK:
They're... they're usually

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.000
in the very... center
of my vision.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.630
Uh... uh...

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.260
But it varies, uh...

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.030
Like... like now they're kind
of just wherever I see the sky.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.630
Uh... You know, they're...

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.730
They're still there.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.200
I think it took him
a number of weeks to come to me

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.900
and say, "You know, Mom,
I've seen this in psych class

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.830
"and, Mom, I'm really...
I'm really terrified.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.000
I'm really scared
that I have schizophrenia."

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.530
I felt like I was going crazy.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.260
And, uh... you know, I felt

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:37.230
like "I'm going to be crazy
for the rest of my life."

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.600
It's hard for me to imagine

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.560
a disease that is crueler
than schizophrenia.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.130
I mean, when does it begin?

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.400
You know, in late adolescence
and early 20s,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.060
just when a family and society
have their maximal investment

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.700
in a young person,
just when, you know,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.730
they're about to graduate
high school or college

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.930
and this child is lost
in the most awful way.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.100
NARRATOR:
At the University of Iowa,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.260
Courtney is part of a research
study that is investigating

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.960
how schizophrenic brains
function, and malfunction.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.900
We'll put
the bonnet on.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.600
There you go.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.900
NARRATOR:
Schizophrenia is as complex
as the brain itself,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:31.200
and clues to its biology have
been stubbornly elusive.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.200
MAN:
Well, schizophrenia is
definitely an enigma.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.200
It's never been possible
to identify

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.030
an obvious
disease-related feature

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:45.060
that distinguished schizophrenia
from all other conditions.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.260
You look at a brain
of a patient with schizophrenia

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.600
under a microscope,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.660
you don't see anything
that would make you say,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.630
"Aha, this is a disorder
of these cells or those cells."

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.830
NARRATOR:
What has gone wrong

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.130
inside the brain of someone
suffering from schizophrenia?

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.460
For centuries, the answer
has eluded researchers.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.930
But new imaging technologies
have revealed

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.360
how the brain fails
to function properly...

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.960
focusing attention on several
different brain regions

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.860
that are underperforming,
regions responsible

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.000
for thinking and reasoning,
memory and emotion.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.130
The fact that so many regions
are malfunctioning

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.000
has led researchers to
investigate a part of the brain

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.630
which coordinates
their operation:

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.760
the prefrontal cortex.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.630
WEINBERGER:
There's certainly
a lot of evidence

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:39.100
that the prefrontal
cortex functions

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.630
like the conductor
in an orchestra

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.030
and that it maintains

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.730
a harmony and it makes music

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.400
out of many, many disparate
elements of this orchestration

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.930
and that we think
that part of the problem

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.230
when the frontal cortex
is deficient--

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:58.200
as it may be in schizophrenia--

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.700
is that instead of music,
there's noise.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.230
One of the things
that happened to me was

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.860
that I was constantly,
like, stupefied and, uh...

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.000
I do have a little bit
of trouble, uh...

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.800
uh, staying coherent,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:23.630
uh, staying, uh... to one
particular subject, uh...

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.560
you know, because my mind is
somewhere else.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.830
WOMAN:
This time
I want you

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.360
to tell me the color
of the ink.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.160
Ignore what
the word says

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160
and tell me the ink--
red, blue, brown.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.200
Okay?
All right.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.260
As quickly as you can.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.230
Ready... go.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.560
Red, blue, brown, red, green,
blue, brown, brown...

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:52.660
NARRATOR:
A poorly functioning prefrontal
cortex makes thinking difficult.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.300
It is no surprise that many
people with schizophrenia

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.260
don't perform well on a series
of tests designed to measure

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.060
their ability
to think and reason clearly.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.530
Courtney was once
a good student,

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.500
but as the disease progressed,
his grades began to drop,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.800
and he finally had to
put off plans for college.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.460
WOMAN:
Schizophrenia is a disease

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.530
that affects the highest
human functions,

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.630
the parts of us that are
most evolutionarily advanced:

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.700
our ability to think
at high conceptual levels.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.600
NARRATOR:
Scientists had once hoped
that MRI images of the brain

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.260
would help solve
the mysteries of schizophrenia

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:42.160
by identifying damage
to specific brain structures.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.930
Instead, the images revealed
a new mystery.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.330
WEINBERGER:
We were surprised to see

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.260
that there was no obvious
"hole in the head."

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.530
But what there was, was that
the ventricles of the brain--

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.630
which are these centers
in the brain

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.500
that have spinal fluid, water
in them that are just cavities--

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.030
were slightly bigger
in patients with schizophrenia.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.260
NARRATOR:
Why were the ventricles--

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.660
reservoirs of fluid that cushion
the brain's delicate tissue--

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.500
larger in schizophrenia?

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.230
The oversized ventricles
proved to be evidence

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.930
that other areas of the brain
were smaller.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:25.130
WEINBERGER:
Your skull is made of hard bones
that does not expand.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.600
So if the ventricles--
these cavities-- got bigger,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.460
the only way all this
could stay inside your skull

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.430
was that something else
had to get smaller.

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.160
And there have been a lot
of studies subsequently

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.730
showing that there is
a slight, very slight, thinning

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.560
of the surface
of the brain, the cortex,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.160
probably that accounts for
these changes in the ventricles.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.500
NARRATOR:
Once again, evidence pointed
to a connection

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.160
between damage in the prefrontal
cortex and schizophrenia,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.900
which may help explain

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.230
why the disease appears
most often during adolescence.

NARRATOR:
Researchers are now looking
more closely

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.160
at developments in
the normal adolescent brain

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.360
for clues to what might trigger
the onset of schizophrenia.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.260
MAN:
The adolescent brain is far more
flexible, far more adaptable

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.760
than we had ever
realized before.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.760
There's enormous potential
for change,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.600
and not just change in sort
of psychological dimensions

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.030
but actually physical,
anatomical changes.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.830
NARRATOR:
At the beginning of adolescence,

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.900
the prefrontal cortex goes
through a burst of growth

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.030
as neurons reach out
to connect to other neurons,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.900
much as they do throughout the
brain during early childhood.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.300
And just as in children,

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.960
the connections between neurons
in the teenage brain

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.930
grow stronger, or they are
pruned back and wither away.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.500
GIEDD:
It's sort of nature's way
of making sure

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.900
that the connections that do
survive are hardy and robust.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.260
(<i> saxophone playing</i> )

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.200
One of the ways the brain
seems to try to figure out

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.700
which connections to keep

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.800
and which ones
to eliminate or prune

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.300
is based on the activities
of the teen.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:33.100
(<i> playing continues</i> )

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.960
The brain is searching for "What
am I going to need to be good at

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.900
to survive in this environment?"

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.760
And the way that it figures that
out is "What am I doing now?"

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.260
(<i> band playing jazz piece</i> )

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.830
(<i> techno dance music playing</i> )

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.260
WEINBERGER:
Adolescence
could be characterized

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.560
as a stressful time
for the brain.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.660
There are chemical changes,

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.760
hormonal changes,
anatomical changes,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.760
changes in the expression
of genes inside of cells.

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.730
It's a time
of great biological tumult.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.860
And the frontal lobe is fighting
to adapt to the environment,

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:17.300
to deal with all these
inner instinctual surges.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.830
It's difficult with
a frontal lobe that's normal

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.530
to make it through adolescence.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.060
But we believe that patients
with schizophrenia

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.560
don't have
a frontal lobe that's normal.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.900
We believe
it didn't develop normally

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.730
probably from early in life.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.560
NARRATOR:
Are there clues to schizophrenia
in childhood that may explain

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.330
the brain's later failure
during adolescence?

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.500
Can the child's brain
be hiding within it

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.530
the seeds of
its own later malfunction?

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.800
Psychologist Elaine Walker is
trying to answer those questions

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.760
by examining the home movies

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.760
of children who later
developed schizophrenia.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.330
WALKER:
We were looking for evidence

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.730
that there was some abnormality
in brain function

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.860
and of course one
of the best places

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.930
to look for that
in young children

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:10.800
is in their motor development.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.760
This child only uses one hand
to try to catch the ball.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.500
This child is showing

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.860
some unusual posturing
of his left hand,

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:28.560
hyperextension of his fingers.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.460
Normal children develop crawling
in a symmetric fashion.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.400
This is a very asymmetric
crawling pattern,

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.900
and that is another
characteristic that we observed

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.100
more often in the children who
later developed schizophrenia.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.930
NARRATOR:
Walker's observations cannot be
used to predict schizophrenia.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.130
Although
these eccentric movements

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.400
appear more frequently
in children

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.560
who eventually develop
the disease,

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.460
they can be found
in normal children as well.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.760
But Walker's study is consistent

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.860
with the theory
that schizophrenia is caused

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.400
by events
in early brain development

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.400
even perhaps
just months after conception.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.330
As neurons are born, take their
place in the developing brain

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.300
and then join one another

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.600
in an intricate network
of connections,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.260
scientists see
the possibility for error.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.030
The genetic make-up
of the brain itself,

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.830
poor nutrition during pregnancy,
or a viral infection

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.330
all may have
devastating effects.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.360
Whatever the cause,
scientists speculate

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.600
the damage lies dormant
until adolescence,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.300
when the prefrontal cortex goes
through its final maturation.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.000
HYMAN:
Schizophrenia could be
a disease in which

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.100
this last developmental stage
has run amok

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.330
and we end up literally with the
wrong connections in the brain.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.400
WOMAN:
Courtney, we're going to bring
a monitor over in front of you

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.430
that you'll be viewing
throughout the study.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.260
HALE-COOK:
Okay.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.330
NARRATOR:
Schizophrenia disrupts not only
the thinking parts of the brain

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.060
but it can also have a severe
impact on the emotions.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.500
WOMAN:
Courtney, next
you'll be viewing some slides

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.400
that most people find to be
pleasant or positive in content.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.060
Just relax and watch...

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.200
NARRATOR:
To probe the emotional regions
of the brain,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.200
researchers flash a series
of pictures on a screen

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.400
and use advanced
imaging technologies

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.230
to watch the brain's response.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.200
The normal brain responds
to these stimulating images

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.400
by activating regions of
the brain that process emotions.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.730
These same regions
respond poorly

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.900
in many people
with schizophrenia.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.530
ANDREASEN:
People with schizophrenia
will very often say,

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.460
"I've lost the capacity

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.160
"to feel related
to other people in the world

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.360
or even related
to the world at all."

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.730
It's both
an intellectual emptiness

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.530
and an emotional emptiness

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.930
and it's one of the factors that
drives people with schizophrenia

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.960
to feel like taking their lives,
to feel like committing suicide

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.600
because they... they feel as
if they've lost... themselves.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.360
HALE-COOK:
The thing that really crushed me
was the lack of motivation,

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.260
uh, the negative symptoms
of schizophrenia,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.160
uh, the flat affect, the, uh...

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.430
the emotionlessness, the apathy.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:39.160
Uh, those were the things
that really got to me.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.460
He would talk frequently about
not being able to feel anything.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.700
He could feel no sorrow.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.930
He could feel no joy.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:56.900
There was just nothing there--
no sorrow, just empty.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:05.200
That's what he would describe,
just... empty and black.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.860
HALE-COOK:
I, uh...

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:16.300
didn't want to live the life
that I'd been given anymore.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.900
It was so contrary
to what I wanted, uh...

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.300
that I didn't want it anymore.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.500
MAN:
When I heard that Courtney
had attempted suicide,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.600
I was not surprised.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.030
He had talked about it,
he has had ideas about suicide

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.200
and he's one of those
individuals that understands

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:42.330
he has an illness and
it's not likely to go away.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.100
That he hadn't succeeded

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.900
was perhaps
what surprised me the most,

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.330
because he succeeds
in most things

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.460
that he's done in life
up to the schizophrenia.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.500
HALE-COOK:
I wrote in my suicide note

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.860
that "Why take death seriously
if the quality of life is poor?"

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:06.000
And, uh... that thought really
stuck with me for a long time.

NARRATOR:
While schizophrenia has stolen
Courtney's emotional life,

from hallucinations as well,

YESKEL:
They were loud.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:59.960
The tone of voice was
a deep, heavy-set voice.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.630
They've said to kill yourself.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.630
They've said
I'm not worth living.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.060
NARRATOR:
Sabrina's mother rushed to camp,

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.930
but barely recognized
her daughter.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.230
MOTHER:
She started screaming, "Stop."

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.300
And I said, "What, Sabrina,
what's... what's going on?"

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.330
She said,
"He's trying to kill me."

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:22.630
So I pulled off the road

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:27.860
and tried to hold her and
tell her everything was okay.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.830
We made it home, but she came
in the house screaming.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.160
They were... the man was
following her everywhere

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.000
and he was still trying to...
he was trying to choke her.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.900
NARRATOR:
Sabrina was diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.000
Now 14, she has been struggling
for two years

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.130
to stay in touch with reality.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.530
She still hears
threatening voices,

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:54.400
and hallucinations haunt
her waking hours.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.260
WOMAN:
Sabrina often sees

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.700
a black-hooded-dressed figure

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.730
that sometimes
will just stare at her,

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.330
sometimes it talks to her,

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.000
sometimes it tries to touch her,
sometimes it tries to kill her.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.400
Sometimes when she's struggling
with this

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.530
they begin almost chanting,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.360
"Kill yourself,
do it, do it, do it."

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.400
Come on in.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.600
All right.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.100
Have a seat.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.030
NARRATOR:
At the University
of North Carolina,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.960
researchers are investigating

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.500
how hallucinations can overwhelm
the adolescent brain,

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.500
and they are testing new drugs

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.060
to help treat
these psychotic symptoms.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.430
Could you look right
at keyhole over there?

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.160
I'm going to check
your eyes out, 
if that's okay.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.800
NARRATOR:
Isaac Wallace began
to hear voices

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.900
when he first
went off to college.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.030
As the voices grew
more frightening

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.060
and his thoughts more paranoid,

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.230
he was finally hospitalized
for his own protection.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:06.460
WOMAN:
When Isaac walked
in the hospital,

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.700
he was completely wrapped up

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.230
in hallucinatory experiences
he was having,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.700
the voices he was hearing,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.100
the beliefs he had developed
to explain the voices.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.230
Whenever
I'd hear voices

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.030
I'd just completely,
like, block out

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.030
what was in the real
world and just think

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.030
about, like, what
the voices were saying

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.600
and, like, talk to them.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.800
NARRATOR:
The voices that Isaac heard
were disturbing

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.600
because they appeared so real,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.400
yet they were produced
by his own flawed brain.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.760
PERKINS:
When you see psychosis

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.960
you realize that
we don't hear with our ears;

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.560
we hear with our brain.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.300
We don't see with our eyes;
we see with our brain.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.600
And so when the brain misfires

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.260
you can have experiences
of hearing voices

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.060
that sound just like they're
coming from outside your head.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.260
NARRATOR:
In the normal brain, waves 
of sound falling on the ear

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.860
travel as electrical
and chemical pulses

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.330
to the hearing part of the
brain, the auditory cortex,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.360
generating a surge of signals

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.700
that travel to the thinking
regions of the brain

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.400
where they are interpreted.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.160
Scientists believe
that in psychosis

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.500
the thinking regions fail,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.600
neurons misfire in random
and chaotic ways,

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.160
creating sounds that have no
connection to the outside world.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:29.160
The result: a perception
of sounds that do not exist.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.530
PERKINS:
So when the brain misfires,

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:34.830
when the circuitry in your brain
is out of whack,

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:39.000
it'll be just as if
you're hearing the radio on.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.730
NARRATOR:
Scientists theorize that
psychosis is caused in part

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.360
by problems with a chemical
in the brain called dopamine,

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:50.730
one of the brain's
neurotransmitters,

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.330
molecules that send messages
from cell to cell

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.830
across a tiny gap, the synapse.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.130
In the normal brain,
dopamine acts

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:03.130
by stimulating receptors on
the neuron that is its target

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:04.600
setting off a cascade

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.130
of electrical
and chemical reactions.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.330
In the psychotic brain,

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.060
for reasons that scientists
are still trying to understand,

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.900
the levels of dopamine surge,
overstimulating the receptors,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.330
wreaking havoc
with the brain's ability

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.530
to send clear
and accurate signals.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.600
Since the 1950s,

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.030
antipsychotic medications
have been standard treatment

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.060
for relieving psychosis.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.330
For Isaac,
they have worked wonders.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.300
WALLACE:
I'd say within three weeks
the voices really, like,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.230
they dropped maybe in half

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.360
to maybe 75% less
than what I was hearing.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.000
Yeah, it has brought me out
of, like, my own little world

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.460
and, you know,
brought me back into reality.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.060
I can hold a job now, and...

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.130
I think I can go back
to school as well

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.800
because my memory's back
and my concentration is back.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.830
I think I might do better
than I did before.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.800
NARRATOR:
Antipsychotic medications
relieve psychosis

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.400
by reducing the impact
of dopamine on the neuron

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.460
by clogging
dopamine-sensitive receptors.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.660
With diminished
neuronal stimulation,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.700
psychotic symptoms lessen
and often disappear.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.930
PERKINS:
You know, we were lucky.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.530
We found the right medicine
for Isaac, and at this point

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.500
I think he's had
an almost-complete recovery.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.200
He's back to his old self,
his old Isaac.

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.960
NARRATOR:
Antipsychotic medications
don't cure schizophrenia,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.430
and Isaac will need to take them
for the rest of his life.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:53.630
But in some people,
the drugs don't work at all.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.530
Schizophrenia varies
from person to person,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:02.360
and Sabrina has a more resistant
form of the disease.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.360
MAN:
When Sabrina first became
seriously sick two years ago,

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.300
it seemed like we had a hundred
possible medicines to try

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.800
and certainly
one of them would work.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:16.330
And yet we discover
that they haven't worked,

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.000
and it's getting
very scary

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.200
because we don't
have many left.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.430
And as a parent,

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.060
it's incredibly difficult
to watch your child suffer.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.100
But it's also... I see
her courage, I really do.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.600
I see her fighting this
every day

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.800
and I'm incredibly
proud of her.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.260
I'll... I'll remember it later.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.230
That's who taught me,
it was my dad and...

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.760
NARRATOR:
For Courtney, medications
have helped him pull back

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.160
from the emotional void
he once faced.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.730
His thoughts of suicide
have passed.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.030
He still struggles
with his illness,

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.160
but he is going on with his life

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:57.300
and has recently
entered college.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.300
HALE-COOK:
I'd rather have lived
the life that I live right now,

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.330
as confusing and painful
as it has been,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.500
than to have never
been born at all.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.960
I think he has learned a lot
about how fragile life is.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:18.530
I think he has learned a lot
about what is really important.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:26.360
NARRATOR:
Every year 300,000 Americans are
diagnosed with schizophrenia.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:31.060
Most of them first developed
symptoms in their late teens.

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.760
But millions more teenagers are
vulnerable to another danger.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.860
CHORUS:
[music] We clap our hands
in the sanctuary... [music]

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.400
(<i> clapping</i> )

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.500
[music] We clap our hands
to give you the glory... [music]

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.200
(<i> clapping</i> )

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.500
NARRATOR:
Adolescence is a time
of growing independence.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.460
As the prefrontal cortex
matures,

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.000
teenagers are beginning to
explore the world on their own.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.500
CHORUS:
[music] And we will praise you
for the rest of our days... [music]

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:01.960
NARRATOR:
But their judgment and reasoning
are still not fully developed,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.400
which makes it especially risky

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:09.260
when they experiment with
addictive drugs and alcohol.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.900
12½ million American
teenagers suffer

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.360
from serious drug abuse problems
or addiction.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:17.960
HYMAN:
Adolescence is a time

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.600
when kids are exposed to all
kinds of influences in the world

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.700
some of them terribly negative,
like drugs of abuse.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.400
CHORUS:
[music] Jesus, we give you
the praise... [music]

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.400
HYMAN:
Addiction is a disease
of the brain

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.630
that affects thinking,
emotion and behavior.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.960
In that sense it's like many
other serious brain diseases,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.200
like depression,
like schizophrenia,

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.260
only here the pathogen are
the drugs of abuse themselves

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.800
acting on a vulnerable brain.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:59.530
YOUNG WOMAN:
I never thought
that I would become an addict

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.130
or even thought
about being an addict

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.460
until I really started
doing coke.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.730
And then it kind
of dawned on me,

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:10.160
"I'm doing cocaine now,
it's not just weed,

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.360
"it's not just alcohol,
you know.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.730
This... this is getting
worse and worse."

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:19.530
NARRATOR:
Jessie Galetar began
experimenting with alcohol

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.960
when she was 11.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.430
Marijuana followed
shortly after,

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.730
and then an array
of other addictive drugs.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.830
By 16, she was addicted
to cocaine.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:31.600
WOMAN:
She had to have it

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.500
to function, she had to have it
to get out of bed.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.630
She couldn't get out of bed
without doing cocaine first.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.500
She couldn't walk
into the school

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.500
without having done cocaine
in the parking lot.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.300
And it wasn't fun anymore.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.960
It was just...
she had to do it to live.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:52.200
I was just, like, "I've got
to do something right now

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.060
or I'm going to die"

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.060
because I couldn't live
like that anymore.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:02.000
NARRATOR:
By 17, caught
in a desperate obsession,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.460
Jessie checked into
the Caron Foundation

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.000
in eastern Pennsylvania,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.630
a residential drug rehab center.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.700
WOMAN:
Who else in here uses pot a lot?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.630
NARRATOR:
Here teenage addicts try to
regain control over their lives

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.300
that have been captured
by addiction.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.200
After a while it was like

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:23.930
instead of me having
the control over the drugs,

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:27.200
it was like the drugs
had control over me.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.430
If I was sick,
I was thinking about dope.

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.160
If I was on dope, I was thinking

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.160
about how I'm going
to get it again.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.660
And, like, that's all
I thought about all the time.

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:39.030
(<i> ball hits backboard;
 ball bouncing</i> )

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.560
YOUNG MAN:
One day I was sober--

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.930
I didn't have anything to drink
and nothing to smoke--

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:45.100
and I realized it was
the first day in a long time

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.560
that I had no chemicals
in my body

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.360
and it felt weird,
and I was irritated

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.360
and I... it was
the worst day of my life.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.430
You know, I've been here
about a week now,

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.760
I'm still not recovered.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.760
I still, every single day,
want to smoke.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.630
And it has been a part of my
life for so long, you know...

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.530
NARRATOR:
Addiction used to be viewed

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.430
as simply a moral failing,
a weakness of character.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.200
But scientists have begun
to investigate

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.130
how addictive substances
fundamentally change the brain,

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.800
gradually taking control
over motivation and desire.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.400
Addiction research has focused
on the neural circuitry

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.700
in the brain's
"rewards" pathway,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.030
the network of neurons
where our desires arise.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.860
Flowing along this network,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:32.430
continuously stimulating
our pleasures and appetites,

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.200
are the neurotransmitters

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.000
that one neuron uses
to talk to another.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.030
Addictive drugs work

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:43.830
by altering the level
of these neurotransmitters

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.900
and slyly capturing
the reward pathway.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:51.500
HYMAN:
All addictive drugs
are Trojan horses.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.960
Every single one of
the chemicals that are addictive

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.330
are mimics; that is, they look
like a neurotransmitter,

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:02.860
they look like one of the
chemicals that the brain uses

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.900
for nerve cells
to communicate with one another.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.630
NARRATOR:
Many addictive drugs mimic

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.830
one of the most powerful
neurotransmitters

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:14.300
in the reward pathway: dopamine.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:18.560
In the normal brain, dopamine
travels across the synapse,

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.700
stimulates receptors
on the target neuron,

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.160
and then it is
quickly reabsorbed

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.630
by tiny molecular
vacuum cleaners

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.660
called dopamine transporters.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.600
But when cocaine is abused,

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.500
trillions of cocaine molecules
surge into the synapses,

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:37.360
clogging the vacuum cleaners,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.000
artificially boosting the level
of dopamine in the brain,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.960
producing a cocaine high.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.800
Let's imagine a wonderful
natural reward--

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.400
you know,
I go to a restaurant

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.060
and have the best
ice cream sundae I've ever had.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.260
You know, I'd have
a certain amount of dopamine

00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.960
probably being released
in my brain.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:58.760
But cocaine,
which gets there chemically,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.000
gives your brain,
gives these synapses

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.630
more dopamine for
a longer amount of time

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.330
than it has ever
experienced before.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:13.560
Now, with the experience
of your first drug high,

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.930
particularly when
it's cocaine and heroin,

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.200
watch what happens.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.100
The dopamine levels ascend

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.230
above and beyond
those experienced with orgasm,

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:29.830
above and beyond the greatest
physiologic experience

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.500
we can have as men and women.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.960
I got so high, and I literally
thought I was floating.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.030
I was just, you know...

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.460
(<i> humming</i> )

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.330
you know,
going through, you know.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.660
You know, bumping into people
and making jokes and laughing,

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.960
and tears were rolling down
my face I was laughing so hard.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.500
JESSIE:
After doing like three or four,

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.160
I'd just kind of sit back
and light a cigarette

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.030
and it would just, like,
fill me, like, completely,

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.060
and like... it was like taking
me away from the world.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.760
INSTRUCTOR:
Once the drugs and the alcohol
are introduced

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.830
into the addicted brain,

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:13.460
the natural system is
what we call "down-regulated."

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.960
It means that the things
that are supposed to work

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.530
for exercise and food

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.530
and all the things that are
supposed to make us feel good,

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.600
they basically go
into hibernation.

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.330
MAN:
You have a feeling
of hopelessness,

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.360
such that the only thing
you can possibly do

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.760
to have any semblance
of pleasure in your life

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.930
is to readminister the drug.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.300
NARRATOR:
The first high
can be exhilarating,

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.300
but after repeated drug abuse,

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.700
the dark side to addiction
begins to take its toll.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.960
The brain responds
to the repeated use of cocaine

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.560
and the dopamine surging
in the synapse

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:55.160
by fighting back, cutting away
receptors on the neuron

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.300
that are the dopamine's target.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.960
Without the receptors, dopamine
can't stimulate the neuron,

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.260
and the drug high is reduced,

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.330
but so is enjoyment
of all normal pleasures as well.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:14.300
YOUNG MAN:
It tricks my brain, you know.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:17.800
Uh, it made me think that,
you know... that I was happy,

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.260
that I enjoyed my life,
when in fact I really didn't.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.600
When I wasn't high,
I hated my life.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.100
YOUNG WOMAN:
I remember writing diary entries
like "I was in pain,

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.260
but still I want to do more
and I can't stop."

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.630
And I just wanted
to die all the time.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.860
I didn't even want
to live anymore.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.560
HYMAN:
You know, none of these kids

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.700
sat down and said, "Hey,
I want to be a drug addict."

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:44.660
Actually what happened is,
like lots of other adolescents,

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.500
they played
what turned out for them

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.560
to be a game
of Russian roulette.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.630
There was something
about their genes,

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.060
something
about their temperament

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.860
that made them vulnerable,

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:58.300
so that when other kids
got away-- often scot-free--

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:59.730
they got hooked.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.300
There was something different
about their brains.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.330
MAN:
We got some alcohol in here

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.500
and our job now
is to help you

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.230
to consume
this beverage

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.330
in about
a ten-minute period.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:21.300
NARRATOR:
Like cocaine, alcohol is
dangerously addictive.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.830
By their senior year
in high school,

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.530
9½ million American teenagers
will have tried it.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.200
So, you've been watching
the sports?

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.230
NARRATOR:
At the San Diego
Veterans Hospital,

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.400
Marc Schuckit is trying
to understand

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.430
what makes some
of these teenagers

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:37.800
more vulnerable to alcohol
than others.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.200
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.400
Super, that's great.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.700
NARRATOR:
For volunteers
like 18-year-old Justin

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.100
and 21-year-old Elaca,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:49.660
Schuckit collapses one night
of drinking into ten minutes

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.500
and then records
the way their brains respond.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.400
SCHUCKIT:
Alcohol has a huge impact
on brain waves,

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.460
and it is indeed one of the ways
that one can measure

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.930
how the brain is changing

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.430
in the presence of alcohol
or other drugs.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.700
We gave them equivalent amounts
of alcohol per kilogram.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.360
The result of that was

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.500
that their blood-alcohol levels
were virtually identical.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.530
What the brain waves show us

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:24.900
is that Elaca is responding more
to the alcohol than Justin.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.630
Her brain waves are being
impacted by the alcohol

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:33.600
significantly more than Justin's
brain waves are being affected.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.730
SCHUCKIT:
So, on a zero-to-36 scale,
how high do you feel?

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:37.730
36.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:38.830
What do you think

00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:40.860
about the slurredness
of your speech?

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.460
Is your speech slurred?

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.160
Mmm... I don't think so,

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.560
(<i> slurring</i> ):
but it's... probably is,
it's probably like 20.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.560
Okay.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.430
And regarding
how drunk

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:53.060
or intoxicated
you feel overall?

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.000
36.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.760
SCHUCKIT:
She was having
difficulty concentrating,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.460
was having problems focusing

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.900
on exactly what it was
that we were talking about,

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.960
and she had some
pretty darn good insight

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.630
that she was
feeling pretty high.

00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.930
And on
a zero-to-36 scale,

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.860
how "high"-- using
that term generically,

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.130
feeling high or
intoxicated-- are you?

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.230
Nothing-- I don't feel
anything really,

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.230
like maybe a one.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.060
Okay, how about
how clumsy

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.700
you feel you might be?

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.830
Nah, zero.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:25.430
And, uh... problems

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.460
where you feel
like you're floating?

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.460
Zero.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.530
Got it.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.700
Justin had the same
blood-alcohol level

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.600
and when we asked him
how he felt,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.100
he was basically saying,
"I don't feel much."

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.000
It was almost close to zero,
very low on the scale.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.630
And all you had to do
was look at him

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.330
and you knew
that he was feeling less.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.260
JUSTIN:
Zero.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.260
NARRATOR:
The same blood-alcohol level,
very different reactions.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.800
JUSTIN:
Zero.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.730
SCHUCKIT:
The two people are starting out

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:54.060
their drinking evenings

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.530
with basically
different equipment onboard.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.530
Elaca, after one or two drinks,

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.130
is likely
to look around and say,

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:04.530
"I'm getting pretty high,
I'd better slow down."

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.560
Justin, we would guess,
when he goes to a party,

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.130
just having a couple of drinks,
he probably looks around

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.560
and says,
"Well, what's the big deal?"

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.530
And he's probably more likely
to go on to three, four or five.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.430
Yeah, zero, none.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.100
SCHUCKIT:
Justin gets drunk;

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:26.260
it just takes Justin a lot more
alcohol to get drunk than Elaca.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.700
NARRATOR:
Even though Justin's brain
responds more slowly to alcohol,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.000
he is more likely than Elaca
to become an alcoholic.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.530
Because he is less aware
of alcohol's powerful effect,

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.360
he may keep drinking
when Elaca might stop,

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.900
exposing his brain to
ever-higher levels of alcohol

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.800
and increasing the chance
that he will become addicted.

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.360
YOUNG MAN:
You know, I've talked
to kids my age, my size--

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:57.860
six beers
and they're passed out.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:00.430
For me, six beers, I'm just
starting to get warmed up.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.830
I can drink easily
almost a case of beer to myself.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.400
You know, I have
alcoholism in the
family, you know,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.560
going back generations, and I'm
sure that plays a major role.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.730
SCHUCKIT:
One of the major reasons

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:17.030
why alcohol dependence
is running in families

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.130
is because people inherit genes

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.860
that impact on
how their brains function.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.930
We found that
a low response to alcohol

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.560
is associated
with a high risk for alcoholism

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.560
regardless
of your family history.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.960
But if you have both,
a family history of alcoholism

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:37.160
and a low response to alcohol,
your risk is really quite large.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.830
YOUNG MAN:
Either three out of four

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.800
or all four of my grandparents
were alcoholics

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.330
which increases the probability
of being an alcoholic.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.360
It was just pretty much
people who looked at me

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.630
even from when I was little
could... would tell me,

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.460
you know, "You're going
to be an alcoholic

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.000
when you start drinking."

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.800
NARRATOR:
But once teenagers become hooked
by alcohol and drugs

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.360
why can't they stop?

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.630
How do drugs change the brain

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.560
to make recovery
so difficult for many

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.660
and impossible for others?

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.600
Edward Coleman began using
marijuana when he was 13

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.060
and quickly advanced
to abusing other drugs.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:24.600
By 19, he was a hardened cocaine
addict, living on the edge,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.730
hustling and scamming to feed
his all-consuming habit.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:31.230
COLEMAN:
I can remember days--

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:36.160
can't go to sleep from thinking
about trying to get high:

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.330
What can I do, or where
can I go, or who can I rob

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.930
to get money just to get high?

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.430
We just have to get
you positioned  
in the right way

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.700
so you can comfortably
get up on the table here.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.330
NARRATOR:
Dr. Anna Rose Childress has
been studying drug addiction

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:54.560
for over two decades.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.000
CHILDRESS:
You're going
to see some videos.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.500
They could be
nature videos

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.400
or scary, or sexy,
or drug-related.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.500
NARRATOR:
Researchers have long observed

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.730
that recovering addicts
relapse most often

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.200
when they return to their drug-
using neighborhoods and friends.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.660
Childress wondered
if it was these cues

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.800
that somehow triggered
an insatiable need for drugs

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.800
in a brain changed by addiction.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.100
HYMAN:
Just the reminder of drug use,

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.700
just seeing these friends,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.100
seeing a crack pipe,
smelling the smell,

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:29.500
creates this overwhelming sense
of need, of craving

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:32.400
that "The world is
completely out of balance

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.160
till I have some cocaine."

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:42.960
NARRATOR:
Childress devised
a simple experiment.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:47.260
She scanned the brains
of long-term cocaine addicts,

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.130
but only after they'd been
drug-free for two weeks.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.530
This would ensure

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.560
that the images she captured
were not cocaine's high

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.900
but more permanent changes
to the brain.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.860
ANNOUNCER (<i> in video</i> ):
For their size,
they burn energy...

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.700
NARRATOR:
She showed her subjects
a series of video images:

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.930
first nature scenes...

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.160
ANNOUNCER:
Darting from blossom to blossom,

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.560
their lives depend on flowers.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.230
MAN (<i> in second video</i> ):
I'll let you cook it up

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:13.100
because that way
you can see where...

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.330
NARRATOR:
Then images
of explicit drug use.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.260
(<i> man in video sniffing</i> )

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.800
MAN (<i> in video</i> ):
You can already smell it, man.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.100
(<i> man in video
 speaking unintelligibly</i> )

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:27.060
NARRATOR:
The two different videos
produced very different activity

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.500
in the addicts' brains.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.700
The scans during
the nature video revealed

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.100
very little brain activity.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.060
But when the videotape
switched to drug use,

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.230
the scans erupted in red,

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.230
indicating intense
brain activity.

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.760
CHILDRESS:
We could see that the brain
was doing something special

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:48.130
and something different when a
person was in a state of desire

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.430
than when they weren't.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.400
It was extremely exciting for us

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.800
because it was the first time
really in all of human history

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.230
that we'd been able to peek
inside the brain during desire.

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.200
And these are images
that were done in
the PET scanner.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.330
NARRATOR:
Childress had captured an image

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:05.830
of how the brain had been
fundamentally altered

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.730
to produce a driving hunger
for cocaine.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.960
CHILDRESS:
Well, our patients
describe craving

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.030
as the thing that can push them

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.900
to do things that they never
imagined that they would do--

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.730
to cross their own rules,
their own values,

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:23.560
to put their... not only
their relationships in jeopardy

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:27.500
or their possessions, or their
jobs, but their very lives.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:36.960
COLEMAN:
It's like being a victim
of a vicious pit bull attack.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.530
Once the dog attacks you
and locks onto you,

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:43.700
he's not letting go.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.500
The only way to get him off
is to kill him

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.700
and that's pretty much
how I was looking at it.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:54.330
The only way to get out
of drug addiction was to die.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.730
NARRATOR:
Despite the craving
carved into his brain,

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.360
Coleman was able
to beat his addiction

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.060
and he did it in a way
that has intrigued researchers.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.230
Coleman's legs were a casualty
of a stray bullet

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:11.260
in his drug-filled neighborhood.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:15.000
But this tragedy allowed him
to make a surprising discovery.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.130
He was still using cocaine,

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.630
but to calm his paralyzed
but trembling legs,

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.700
he began taking the common
muscle relaxant Baclofen.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.060
When he ran out of cocaine,

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:31.230
he was surprised to find
he no longer needed it.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:36.160
COLEMAN:
As long as I was taking
the Baclofen,

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.730
it was blocking my mind

00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:42.900
from thinking that
I needed the drugs.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:47.200
It was blocking that part of me

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.130
that thought about it
and wanted it.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.300
NARRATOR:
The Baclofen appeared

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.760
to be overriding the craving for
cocaine etched into his brain.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:02.530
When Coleman reported
his observations to Childress,

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.800
she was intrigued

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.660
by this homegrown
scientific experiment.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.330
CHILDRESS:
So we offered him a PET scan

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:12.460
and our usual hummingbird video,
cocaine video

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.530
with the bet that on Baclofen

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.730
that we wouldn't see the hot
spots lighting up in these areas

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.700
that are important
for anticipating reward.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.730
Sure enough.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:25.400
Look, there are
no hot spots.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.930
So for you, watching
the nature video,

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.060
your brain didn't
respond very much
differently

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.960
when you were watching
the cocaine video.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.300
CHILDRESS:
His two scans are identical.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.030
So the way that he looks
at the nature video,

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.660
the way he looks
during the cocaine video--

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:42.100
there are no hot spots.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.830
So it's really encouraging to us

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.860
that his description
of how he feels--

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.260
that he doesn't feel pulled
and that he feels

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:50.600
as though everything's
in a manageable range--

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.360
really matches up
with his brain.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:54.030
His brain agrees.

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:58.260
NARRATOR:
Baclofen may prove
to be the first medication

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.360
to actually curb the insatiable
desire for cocaine

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.660
and it is now in early testing
on addicts.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.060
But until medications are
available to fight addiction,

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.100
addicts will continue
to struggle

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.260
to overcome addiction
on their own.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.530
(<i> young women laughing
 and talking</i> )

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.700
NARRATOR:
Jessie and these other teenagers
will spend

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.730
anywhere from between
three weeks to three months

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:24.160
reclaiming their lives.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.530
And they have learned
important lessons

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.130
about how drugs
have changed their brains.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.260
I'm sitting here
and I'm really dwelling on...

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.760
(<i> sighs deeply</i> )

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.760
the fact that I'm an addict,
and I need... I need help

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.500
and I'm not going to be able
to do this by myself,

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.360
and I need to do all the things
that they teach me.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.960
And, um... and
it's really hard...

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.630
It's really hard, it's scary.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.760
NARRATOR:
The disheartening reality is

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.560
that eight out of ten addicts
who leave rehab relapse

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.200
and return to their addiction,

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.960
sometimes after months
and even years of sobriety.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.300
I'm still terrified
of, like, relapse

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:09.730
and just starting to use again.

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:12.560
And that's actually...
it's kind of good

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.260
because I'm less likely
to go back out

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.460
if I am scared to death of it.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.330
INSTRUCTOR:
You don't want it too tight.

00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.730
You just want it so
the helmet's not moving around.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:27.260
NARRATOR:
The last hurdle many of these
teenagers will face

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.330
before leaving rehab
will be an aerial ropes course.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.100
As you notice,
there's two cables,

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.830
one on each side, that suspend
the ladder, the rungs.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:36.830
Okay?

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:38.600
You can't hold on to those.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.200
The only thing
you can hold on to

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:43.830
are those rungs
and your partner.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:45.700
(<i> young women laughing</i> )

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.030
This is not as easy
as it looks.

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:50.960
NARRATOR:
This graduation exercise
symbolizes

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.230
the challenge
these teenagers face

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:55.130
in beating their addictions

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.360
after their brains
have been distorted by drugs.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.160
(<i> young women shouting
 encouragement</i> )

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.230
INSTRUCTOR:
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:03.230
You got it, ladies.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.400
Nice job, nice job.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.960
HYMAN:
A critical part of the brain

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.330
has literally been hijacked
by drugs of abuse.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:13.930
It's been rewired so that
behavior is now focused

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.030
on this life
of obtaining and using drugs.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.030
INSTRUCTOR:
Communication
is the key.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.930
HYMAN:
The behavior
has become automatic

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:25.400
and the trick for the person
who's recovering

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.200
is to stop these
automatic responses.

00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.330
INSTRUCTOR:
Look above you.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:30.330
What's above you?

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:31.800
There you go.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.600
BERMAN:
What we attempt to do here

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.600
is recruit other parts
of your brain

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.600
to diminish those
improper messages.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.160
(<i> young women laughing</i> )

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.200
Knowing we can't eradicate them,

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.700
we attempt to recruit
other soldiers, all right,

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:55.060
other parts of the brain
to help diminish those feelings.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.930
INSTRUCTOR:
Let go, let go of the rope.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.360
Use your partner to stand up.

00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.700
That's it.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.630
(<i> young women cheering
 and clapping</i> )

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.260
HYMAN:
If I had to guess,

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:06.600
what we have to shore up
is the prefrontal cortex--

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.700
the critical functions
of this prefrontal cortex,

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.700
what we call "executive
function": self-control,

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:16.300
the ability to literally
have responsibility for oneself.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:17.930
YOUNG WOMAN:
Come on, Liz!

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:21.260
HYMAN:
And we can do that
because their whole brain

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.100
has not been overthrown
by drugs of abuse.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.200
I really don't
want to do it.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.300
INSTRUCTOR:
Liz, all you've got to do
is reach up, okay?

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:32.530
Grab onto... Chrissie,
and she will help you up.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:33.730
Don't pull yet.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.260
YOUNG WOMEN:
Come on, Liz,
you can do it.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.600
INSTRUCTOR:
I've got you here
on the rope, too.

00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:39.100
I'll pull you off if I do that.

00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:40.460
I don't want to do that.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.060
(<i> young women shouting
 encouragement</i> )

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.630
No! Don't let go
of my hand, Chrissie!

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.060
INSTRUCTOR:
You got it.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.430
(<i> young women cheering
 and applauding</i> )

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.660
INSTRUCTOR:
All right! Yeah!

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.500
(<i> young women applauding</i> )

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.360
INSTRUCTOR:
Okay, I need you ladies to...

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.360
No! No! No!

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.500
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.500
(<i> young women laughing</i> )

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.900
Hurry up, please.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.330
LIZ:
My greatest fear,
which is climbing,

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.100
and I worked through
my greatest fear.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:05.600
I can do anything.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.600
(<i> clapping</i> )

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.360
I could do anything.

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.330
PERKINS:
Adolescence is one of probably

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.100
the most demanding times
in life.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.660
You're learning how to function
as a human in society;

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.300
you're beginning
to try and form partnerships

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.700
and long-lasting friendships;

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.360
you're becoming sexually aware.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.460
WEINBERGER:
And we know that leaving home,

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:39.660
becoming an adult, having
a family, requires a number

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:45.330
of much more complicated
mental, psychological abilities.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.930
HYMAN:
And the organ
of all of these changes

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:51.160
and the way people think
and emote and make judgments

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.930
is, after all, their brain.

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.830

<i>Emotions and the adult brain.</i>

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.030
MAN:
Why do we have these emotions?

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.930
What are they for?

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.960
WOMAN:
There's no empathy or sympathy.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.760
He just can't get that feeling.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.160
WOMAN 2:
Deadness, terror,
distorted time.
