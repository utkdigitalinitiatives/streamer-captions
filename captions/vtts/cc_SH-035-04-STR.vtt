2
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670
Come, FriarFrancis, be brief;

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.570
only to the plainform of marriage,

4
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.470
and you shall recount theirparticular duties afterwards.

5
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.170
You come hither, mylord, to marry this lady.

6
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.170
No.

7
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.470
To be marriedto her: friar,

8
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.270
you come to marry her.

9
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.400
Lady, you come hither tobe married to this count.

10
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.930
I do.

11
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.930
If either of you knowany inward impediment

12
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.200
why you should not beconjoined, charge you,

13
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.400
on your souls,to utter it.

14
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730
Know you any, Hero?

15
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.570
None, my lord.

16
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.830
Know you any, count?

17
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.500
I dare make hisanswer, none.

18
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.770
O, what men dare do!

19
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200
what men may do!

20
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.700
what men daily do, notknowing what they do!

21
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700
How now!

22
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.900
interjections?

23
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.770
Why, then, somebe of laughing,

24
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.630
Stand thee by, friar.

25
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.570
Father, by your leave:

26
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.000
Will you with free andunconstrained soul

27
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.030
Give me this maid,your daughter?

28
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.470
As freely, son, asGod did give her me.

29
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.670
And what have I togive you back,

30
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.530
whose worth May counterpoisethis rich and precious gift?

31
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.030
Nothing, unless yourender her again.

32
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.170
Sweet prince, you learnme noble thankfulness.

33
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.400
There, Leonato, takeher back again:

34
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
Give not this rottenorange to your friend;

35
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
She's but the sign andsemblance of her honour.

36
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.670
Behold how like amaid she blushes here!

37
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.100
O, what authorityand show of truth

38
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.700
Can cunning sin coveritself withal!

39
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.900
Comes not that bloodas modest evidence

40
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.800
To witness simple virtue?

41
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.770
Would you not swear,All you that see her,

42
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.130
that she were a maid,By these exterior shows?

43
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.300
But she is none: She knowsthe heat of a luxurious bed;

44
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.230
Her blush is guiltiness,not modesty.

45
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.900
What do you mean, my lord?

46
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.400
Not to be married, Not to knitmy soul to an approved wanton.

47
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.930
Dear my lord, ifyou, in your own proof,

48
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.100
Have vanquish'd theresistance of her youth,

49
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.270
And made defeatof her virginity,

50
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.700
- I know what you wouldsay: if I have known her,

51
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.700
You will say she didembrace me as a husband,

52
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.300
And so extenuatethe 'forehand sin:

53
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.100
No, Leonato, I never temptedher with word too large;

54
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.030
But, as abrother to his sister,

55
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.430
show'd Bashfulsincerity and comely love.

56
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.100
And seem'd I everotherwise to you?

57
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100
Out on thee! Seeming!

58
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.400
I will write against it:

59
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.700
You seem to me asDian in her orb,

60
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.530
As chaste as is thebud ere it be blown;

61
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.770
But you are moreintemperate in your blood

62
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.200
Than Venus, or thosepamper'd animals

63
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.730
That rage in savage sensuality.

64
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.070
Is my lord well, thathe doth speak so wide?

65
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.570
Sweet prince,why speak not you?

66
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.070
What should I speak?

67
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.270
I stand dishonour'd,that have gone about

68
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.500
To link my dear friendto a common stale.

69
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.570
Are these thingsspoken, or do I but dream?

70
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.930
Sir, they are spoken,and these things are true.

71
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.730
This looks notlike a nuptial.

72
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.300
True!

73
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.370
O God!

74
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.400
Leonato, stand I here?

75
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.700
Is this the prince?

76
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700
is this theprince's brother?

77
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.730
Is this face Hero's?

78
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.630
are our eyes our own?

79
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.070
All this is so: butwhat of this, my lord?

80
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.830
Let me but move onequestion to your daughter;

81
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.570
And, by that fatherlyand kindly power

82
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.670
That you have in her,bid her answer truly.

83
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.430
I charge thee do so,as thou art my child.

84
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.530
O, God defend me!

85
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.100
how am I beset!

86
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.200
What kind ofcatechising call you this?

87
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.270
To make you answertruly to your name.

88
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.500
Is it not Hero?

89
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.030
Who can blot that nameWith any just reproach?

90
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330
Marry, that can Hero;

91
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.570
Hero itself can blotout Hero's virtue.

92
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.730
What man was he talk'dwith you yesternight

93
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.670
Out at your windowbetwixt twelve and one?

94
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.000
Now, if you are amaid, answer to this.

95
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.100
I talk'd with no man atthat hour, my lord.

96
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.070
Why, then areyou no maiden.

97
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.700
Leonato, I am sorry you musthear: upon mine honour,

98
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.530
Myself, my brother andthis grieved count

99
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.800
Did see her, hear her,at that hour last night

100
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.400
Talk with a ruffian ather chamber-window

101
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.000
Who hath indeed, mostlike a liberal villain,

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.070
Confess'd the vileencounters they have had

103
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.900
A thousand times in secret.

104
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.400
Fie, fie! they are notto be named, my lord,

105
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.830
Not to be spoke of; There is notchastity enough in language

106
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.970
Without offence to utter them.

107
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.830
Thus, pretty lady, I am sorryfor thy much misgovernment.

108
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.170
O Hero, what aHero hadst thou been,

109
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.470
If half thy outwardgraces had been placed

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.870
About thy thoughts andcounsels of thy heart!

111
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:38.600
But fare thee well,most foul, most fair!

112
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.100
farewell, Thou pure impietyand impious purity!

113
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.230
For thee I'll lock upall the gates of love,

114
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.700
And on my eyelidsshall conjecture hang,

115
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.330
To turn all beautyinto thoughts of harm,

116
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.230
And never shall itmore be gracious.

117
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.770
Hath no man's daggerhere a point for me?

118
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.700
Why, how now, cousin!

119
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.070
wherefore sink you down?

120
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.970
Come, let us go.

121
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.500
These things,come thus to light,

122
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.800
Smother her spirits up.

123
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.930
How doth the lady?

124
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.400
Dead, I think.

125
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.500
Help, uncle!

126
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.600
Hero!

127
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.500
why, Hero!

128
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.430
Uncle!

129
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.270
Signior Benedick!

130
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.000
Friar!

131
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.100
O Fate!

132
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.300
take not awaythy heavy hand.

133
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.130
Death is the fairestcover for her shame

134
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.870
That may be wish'd for.

135
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.570
How now, cousin Hero!

136
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.500
Have comfort, lady.

137
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.770
Dost thou look up?

138
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.430
Yea, whereforeshould she not?

139
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.100
Wherefore!

140
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.330
Why, doth not everyearthly thing

141
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.430
Cry shame upon her?

142
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.400
Could she here deny The storythat is printed in her blood?

143
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.500
Do not live, Hero; donot ope thine eyes:

144
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.230
For, did I think thouwouldst not quickly die,

145
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.170
Thought I thy spirits werestronger than thy shames,

146
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.470
Myself would, on therearward of reproaches,

147
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.400
Strike at thy life.

148
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.930
Grieved I, I had but one?

149
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.400
Chid I for that atfrugal nature's frame?

150
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.970
O, one too much by thee!

151
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.600
Why had I one?

152
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.830
Why ever wast thoulovely in my eyes?

153
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.200
Why had I not withcharitable hand

154
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.530
Took up a beggar'sissue at my gates,

155
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.900
Who smirch'd thusand mired with infamy,

156
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.470
I might have said 'Nopart of it is mine;

157
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.030
This shame derives itselffrom unknown loins'?

158
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.170
But mine and mine I lovedand mine I praised

159
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.970
And mine that I wasproud on, mine so much

160
00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:00.130
That I myself was to myselfnot mine, Valuing of her,

161
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:07.630
-why, she, O, she isfallen Into a pit of ink,

162
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.200
that the wide sea Hath drops toofew to wash her clean again

163
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.700
And salt too littlewhich may season give

164
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.330
To her foul-tainted flesh!

165
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:21.830
Sir, sir, be patient.

166
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.030
For my part, I am soattired in wonder,

167
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.930
I know not what to say.

168
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.970
O, on my soul, mycousin is belied!

169
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.100
Lady, were you herbedfellow last night?

170
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.600
No, truly not; although,until last night,

171
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.930
I have this twelvemonthbeen her bedfellow.

172
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.000
Confirm'd, confirm'd!

173
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.770
O, that is stronger madeWhich was before barr'd up

174
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.900
with ribs of iron!

175
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.200
Would the two princeslie, and Claudio lie,

176
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.370
Who loved her so, that,speaking of her foulness,

177
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.470
Wash'd it with tears?

178
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.300
Hence from her!

179
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.400
let her die.

180
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.030
Hear me a little; For I haveonly been silent so long

181
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.730
And given way unto thiscourse of fortune.

182
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.330
By noting of thelady I have mark'd

183
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:15.230
A thousand blushing apparitionsTo start into her face,

184
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.170
a thousand innocent shamesIn angel whiteness

185
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.470
beat away those blushes;

186
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.300
And in her eye therehath appear'd a fire,

187
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.830
To burn the errors thatthese princes hold

188
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:34.070
Against her maiden truth.

189
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.370
Call me a fool; Trust not myreading nor my observations,

190
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.300
Which with experimentalseal doth warrant

191
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.700
The tenor of my book;

192
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.200
trust not my age,

193
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.670
My reverence, calling,nor divinity,

194
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.430
If this sweet lady lienot guiltless here

195
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.570
Under some biting error.

196
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.800
Friar, it cannot be.

197
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.170
Thou seest that all thegrace that she hath left

198
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.400
Is that she will notadd to her damnation

199
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.100
A sin of perjury;she not denies it:

200
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.530
Why seek'st thou thento cover with excuse

201
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.630
That which appears inproper nakedness?

202
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.200
Lady, what man is heyou are accused of?

203
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.930
They know thatdo accuse me;

204
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:20.170
I know none: If I knowmore of any man alive

205
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.870
Than that which maidenmodesty doth warrant,

206
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.970
Let all mysins lack mercy!

207
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.830
O my father, Prove you thatany man with me conversed

208
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.470
At hours unmeet, orthat I yesternight

209
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.470
Maintain'd the change ofwords with any creature,

210
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.770
Refuse me, hate me,torture me to death!

211
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.230
There is some strangemisprision in the princes.

212
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.670
Two of them have thevery bent of honour;

213
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.530
And if their wisdomsbe misled in this,

214
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.670
The practise of itlives in John the bastard,

215
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.030
Whose spirits toil inframe of villanies.

216
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.400
I know not.

217
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.000
If they speakbut truth of her,

218
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.470
These handsshall tear her;

219
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.200
if they wrong her honour,

220
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.470
The proudest of themshall well hear of it.

221
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.170
Time hath not yet sodried this blood of mine,

222
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.400
Nor age so eatup my invention,

223
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000
Nor fortune madesuch havoc of my means,

224
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.330
Nor my bad life reftme so much of friends,

225
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.970
But they shall find,awaked in such a kind,

226
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.830
Both strength of limband policy of mind,

227
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.370
Ability in means andchoice of friends,

228
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.570
To quit me ofthem throughly.

229
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.200
Pause awhile, And let mycounsel sway you in this case.

230
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.600
Your daughter here theprinces left for dead:

231
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.900
Let her awhile besecretly kept in,

232
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.230
And publish it thatshe is dead indeed;

233
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.730
Maintain a mourning ostentation

234
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.870
And on your family'sold monument

235
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.370
Hang mournful epitaphsand do all rites

236
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.400
That appertain unto a burial.

237
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.700
What shall become ofthis? what will this do?

238
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.730
Marry, this well carriedshall on her behalf

239
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:26.270
Change slander to remorse;that is some good:

240
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.170
But not for that dream Ion this strange course,

241
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.070
But on this travaillook for greater birth.

242
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.830
She dying, as itmust so be maintain'd,

243
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.700
Upon the instantthat she was accused,

244
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.430
Shall be lamented,pitied and excused

245
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.000
Of every hearer: forit so falls out

246
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.930
That what we have weprize not to the worth

247
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.170
Whiles we enjoy it, butbeing lack'd and lost,

248
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.670
Why, then we rack thevalue, then we find

249
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.070
The virtue that possessionwould not show us

250
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.970
Whiles it was ours.

251
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.670
So will it fare with Claudio:

252
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.800
When he shall hear shedied upon his words,

253
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.430
The idea of her life

254
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.170
shall sweetly creep Intohis study of imagination,

255
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.030
And every lovelyorgan of her life

256
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.230
Shall come apparell'd inmore precious habit,

257
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.230
More moving-delicateand full of life,

258
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.570
Into the eye andprospect of his soul,

259
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.600
Than when shelived indeed;

260
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.030
then shall he mourn, If everlove had interest in his liver,

261
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.770
And wish he had notso accused her,

262
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:43.230
No, though he thoughthis accusation true.

263
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.170
Let this be so, anddoubt not but success

264
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.300
Will fashion the eventin better shape

265
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.370
Than I can lay itdown in likelihood.

266
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.370
But if all aim butthis be levell'd false,

267
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.030
The supposition ofthe lady's death

268
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.170
Will quench the wonderof her infamy:

269
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.330
And if it sort not well,

270
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.970
you may conceal her, As bestbefits her wounded reputation,

271
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.970
In some reclusiveand religious life,

272
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:13.700
Out of all eyes, tongues,minds and injuries.

273
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:20.270
Signior Leonato, letthe friar advise you:

274
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.970
And though you knowmy inwardness

275
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.830
and love Is very much untothe prince and Claudio,

276
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.130
Yet, by mine honour,I will deal in this

277
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:32.500
As secretly and justly as yoursoul Should with your body.

278
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.370
Being that Iflow in grief,

279
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.830
The smallesttwine may lead me.

280
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:44.270
'Tis wellconsented: presently away;

281
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:52.070
For to strange sores strangelythey strain the cure.

282
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:57.870
Come, lady, die tolive: this wedding-day

283
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:06.230
Perhaps is but prolong'd:have patience and endure.

284
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.070
Lady Beatrice, haveyou wept all this while?

285
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.000
Yea, and I willweep a while longer.

286
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.130
I will not desire that.

287
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.230
You have noreason; I do it freely.

288
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.170
Surely I do believe yourfair cousin is wronged.

289
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:48.300
Ah, how much might theman deserve of me

290
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.800
that would right her!

291
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.500
Is there any way toshow such friendship?

292
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.530
A very even way,but no such friend.

293
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.600
May a man do it?

294
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:09.700
It is a man'soffice, but not yours.

295
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:17.400
I do love nothing in theworld so well as you:

296
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.200
is not that strange?

297
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:33.530
As strange as thething I know not.

298
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.970
It were as possiblefor me to say

299
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.430
I loved nothing so well asyou: but believe me not;

300
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.200
and yet I lie not;I confess nothing,

301
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.600
nor I deny nothing.

302
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.330
I am sorry for my cousin.

303
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.670
By my sword,Beatrice, thou lovest me.

304
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.170
Do not swear, and eat it.

305
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.670
I will swear by itthat you love me;

306
00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:00.130
and I will make him eat itthat says I love not you.

307
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.230
Will you noteat your word?

308
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.830
With no sauce thatcan be devised to it.

309
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:08.170
I protest I love thee.

310
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.400
Why, then, God forgive me!

311
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.870
What offence,sweet Beatrice?

312
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:11.900
You have stayed mein a happy hour:

313
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.100
I was about toprotest I loved you.

314
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.970
And do it withall thy heart.

315
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.000
I love you with somuch of my heart

316
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.770
that none is leftto protest.

317
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.170
Come, bid me doany thing for thee.

318
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:33.430
Kill Claudio.

319
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.400
Ha!

320
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.770
not for the wide world.

321
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.800
You kill me to deny it.

322
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.500
Farewell.

323
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.130
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

324
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.970
I am gone, though I am here:there is no love in you:

325
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.100
nay, I pray you, let me go.

326
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.070
Beatrice,-- Infaith, I will go.

327
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.330
We'll be friends first.

328
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.930
You dare easier be friends withme than fight with mine enemy.

329
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.400
Is Claudio thine enemy?

330
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.870
Is he not approved inthe height a villain,

331
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.770
that hathslandered, scorned,

332
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.400
dishonoured my kinswoman?

333
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.230
O that I were a man!

334
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.770
What, bear her in hand untilthey come to take hands;

335
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.730
and then, withpublic accusation,

336
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.930
uncovered slander,unmitigated rancour,

337
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.370
--O God, thatI were a man!

338
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.400
I would eat his heartin the market-place.

339
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.530
Hear me, Beatrice,--

340
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.200
Talk with a manout at a window!

341
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.030
A proper saying!

342
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.770
Nay, but,Beatrice,-- Sweet Hero!

343
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.530
She is wronged,she is slandered,

344
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.700
she is undone.

345
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.400
Beat--

346
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.200
Princes and counties!

347
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.400
Surely, aprincely testimony,

348
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.730
a goodly count,Count Comfect;

349
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.530
a sweet gallant, surely!

350
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.630
O that I were aman for his sake!

351
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:54.300
or that I had any friendwould be a man for my sake!

352
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.200
But manhood ismelted into courtesies,

353
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.970
valour into compliment, and menare only turned into tongue,

354
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:06.830
and trim ones too:

355
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.530
he is now as valiantas Hercules

356
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:17.470
that only tells alie and swears it.

357
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.930
I cannot be aman with wishing,

358
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.670
therefore I will die awoman with grieving.

359
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.800

This man said,sir, that Don John,

410
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.130
the prince'sbrother, was a villain.

411

Write down PrinceJohn a villain.

412
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.770
Why, this is flat perjury,

413
00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.400
to call a prince'sbrother villain.

414
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.030
Master constable,--

415
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.970
Pray thee, fellow, peace:

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.530
I do not like thylook, I promise thee.

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.970
What heard youhim say else?

418
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.630
Marry, that he hadreceived a thousand ducats

419
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:03.070
of Don John for accusingthe Lady Hero wrongfully.

420
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.500
Flat burglary asever was committed.

421
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.530
Yea, by mass, that it is.

422
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.170
What else, fellow?

423
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.000
And that CountClaudio did mean,

424
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.500
upon his words, to disgrace Herobefore the whole assembly.

425
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.230
and not marry her.

426
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.270
O villain! thouwilt be condemned

427
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.170

428
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.600
What else?

429
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.330
This is all.

430
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.430
And this is more, masters,than you can deny.

431
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.670
Prince John is this morningsecretly stolen away;

432
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.430
Hero was in thismanner accused,

433
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.900
in this verymanner refused,

434
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.070
and upon the grief ofthis suddenly died.

435
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.270
Master constable, letthese men be bound,

436
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.500

Off, coxcomb!

441

But, masters,remember that I am an ass;
