00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:47.730


2
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.670
Come, Friar Francis, be brief;

3
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.570
only to the plain form of marriage,

4
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.470
and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.

5
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.170
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.

6
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.170
No.

7
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.470
To be married to her: friar,

8
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.270
you come to marry her.

9
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.400
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.

10
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.930
I do.

11
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.930
If either of you know any inward impediment

12
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.200
why you should not be conjoined, charge you,

13
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.400
on your souls, to utter it.

14
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730
Know you any, Hero?

15
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.570
None, my lord.

16
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.830
Know you any, count?

17
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.500
I dare make his answer, none.

18
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.770
O, what men dare do!

19
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.200
what men may do!

20
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.700
what men daily do, not knowing what they do!

21
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700
How now!

22
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.900
interjections?

23
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.770
Why, then, some be of laughing,

24
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.630
Stand thee by, friar.

25
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.570
Father, by your leave:

26
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.000
Will you with free and unconstrained soul

27
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.030
Give me this maid, your daughter?

28
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.470
As freely, son, as God did give her me.

29
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.670
And what have I to give you back,

30
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.530
whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

31
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.030
Nothing, unless you render her again.

32
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.170
Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.

33
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.400
There, Leonato, take her back again:

34
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;

35
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.330
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.

36
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.670
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!

37
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.100
O, what authority and show of truth

38
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.700
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!

39
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.900
Comes not that blood as modest evidence

40
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.800
To witness simple virtue?

41
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.770
Would you not swear, All you that see her,

42
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.130
that she were a maid, By these exterior shows?

43
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.300
But she is none: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;

44
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.230
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

45
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.900
What do you mean, my lord?

46
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.400
Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

47
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.930
Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,

48
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.100
Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,

49
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.270
And made defeat of her virginity,

50
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.700
- I know what you would say: if I have known her,

51
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.700
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,

52
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.300
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:

53
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.100
No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large;

54
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.030
But, as a brother to his sister,

55
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.430
show'd Bashful sincerity and comely love.

56
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.100
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?

57
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100
Out on thee! Seeming!

58
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.400
I will write against it:

59
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.700
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,

60
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.530
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;

61
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.770
But you are more intemperate in your blood

62
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.200
Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals

63
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.730
That rage in savage sensuality.

64
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.070
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

65
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.570
Sweet prince, why speak not you?

66
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.070
What should I speak?

67
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.270
I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about

68
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.500
To link my dear friend to a common stale.

69
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.570
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?

70
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.930
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

71
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.730
This looks not like a nuptial.

72
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.300
True!

73
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.370
O God!

74
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.400
Leonato, stand I here?

75
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.700
Is this the prince?

76
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700
is this the prince's brother?

77
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.730
Is this face Hero's?

78
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.630
are our eyes our own?

79
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.070
All this is so: but what of this, my lord?

80
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.830
Let me but move one question to your daughter;

81
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.570
And, by that fatherly and kindly power

82
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.670
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

83
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.430
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.

84
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.530
O, God defend me!

85
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.100
how am I beset!

86
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.200
What kind of catechising call you this?

87
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.270
To make you answer truly to your name.

88
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.500
Is it not Hero?

89
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.030
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?

90
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.330
Marry, that can Hero;

91
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.570
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.

92
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.730
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight

93
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.670
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?

94
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.000
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

95
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.100
I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

96
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.070
Why, then are you no maiden.

97
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.700
Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,

98
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.530
Myself, my brother and this grieved count

99
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.800
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night

100
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.400
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window

101
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.000
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.070
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had

103
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.900
A thousand times in secret.

104
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.400
Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,

105
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.830
Not to be spoke of; There is not chastity enough in language

106
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.970
Without offence to utter them.

107
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.830
Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

108
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.170
O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,

109
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.470
If half thy outward graces had been placed

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.870
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!

111
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:38.600
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair!

112
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:44.100
farewell, Thou pure impiety and impious purity!

113
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.230
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,

114
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.700
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,

115
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.330
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,

116
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.230
And never shall it more be gracious.

117
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.770
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?

118
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.700
Why, how now, cousin!

119
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.070
wherefore sink you down?

120
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.970
Come, let us go.

121
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.500
These things, come thus to light,

122
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.800
Smother her spirits up.

123
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.930
How doth the lady?

124
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.400
Dead, I think.

125
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.500
Help, uncle!

126
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.600
Hero!

127
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.500
why, Hero!

128
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.430
Uncle!

129
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.270
Signior Benedick!

130
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.000
Friar!

131
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.100
O Fate!

132
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.300
take not away thy heavy hand.

133
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.130
Death is the fairest cover for her shame

134
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.870
That may be wish'd for.

135
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.570
How now, cousin Hero!

136
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.500
Have comfort, lady.

137
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.770
Dost thou look up?

138
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.430
Yea, wherefore should she not?

139
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.100
Wherefore!

140
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.330
Why, doth not every earthly thing

141
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.430
Cry shame upon her?

142
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.400
Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood?

143
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.500
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:

144
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.230
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,

145
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.170
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,

146
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.470
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,

147
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.400
Strike at thy life.

148
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.930
Grieved I, I had but one?

149
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.400
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?

150
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.970
O, one too much by thee!

151
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.600
Why had I one?

152
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.830
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?

153
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.200
Why had I not with charitable hand

154
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.530
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,

155
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.900
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,

156
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.470
I might have said 'No part of it is mine;

157
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.030
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?

158
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.170
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised

159
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:54.970
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much

160
00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:00.130
That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her,

161
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:07.630
-why, she, O, she is fallen Into a pit of ink,

162
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.200
that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again

163
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.700
And salt too little which may season give

164
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.330
To her foul-tainted flesh!

165
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:21.830
Sir, sir, be patient.

166
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.030
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,

167
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.930
I know not what to say.

168
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.970
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!

169
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.100
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

170
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.600
No, truly not; although, until last night,

171
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.930
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

172
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:43.000
Confirm'd, confirm'd!

173
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.770
O, that is stronger made Which was before barr'd up

174
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.900
with ribs of iron!

175
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.200
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,

176
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.370
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,

177
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.470
Wash'd it with tears?

178
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.300
Hence from her!

179
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.400
let her die.

180
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:03.030
Hear me a little; For I have only been silent so long

181
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.730
And given way unto this course of fortune.

182
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.330
By noting of the lady I have mark'd

183
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:15.230
A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face,

184
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.170
a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness

185
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.470
beat away those blushes;

186
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.300
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,

187
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.830
To burn the errors that these princes hold

188
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:34.070
Against her maiden truth.

189
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.370
Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations,

190
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.300
Which with experimental seal doth warrant

191
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.700
The tenor of my book;

192
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.200
trust not my age,

193
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.670
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,

194
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:49.430
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here

195
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.570
Under some biting error.

196
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.800
Friar, it cannot be.

197
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.170
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left

198
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.400
Is that she will not add to her damnation

199
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.100
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:

200
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.530
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse

201
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.630
That which appears in proper nakedness?

202
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.200
Lady, what man is he you are accused of?

203
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.930
They know that do accuse me;

204
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:20.170
I know none: If I know more of any man alive

205
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.870
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,

206
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.970
Let all my sins lack mercy!

207
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:31.830
O my father, Prove you that any man with me conversed

208
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.470
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight

209
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.470
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,

210
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.770
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

211
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.230
There is some strange misprision in the princes.

212
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.670
Two of them have the very bent of honour;

213
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.530
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,

214
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.670
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,

215
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.030
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.

216
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.400
I know not.

217
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.000
If they speak but truth of her,

218
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.470
These hands shall tear her;

219
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.200
if they wrong her honour,

220
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.470
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.

221
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.170
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,

222
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.400
Nor age so eat up my invention,

223
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.000
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,

224
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.330
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,

225
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.970
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,

226
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.830
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,

227
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.370
Ability in means and choice of friends,

228
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.570
To quit me of them throughly.

229
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.200
Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.

230
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.600
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:

231
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.900
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,

232
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.230
And publish it that she is dead indeed;

233
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:08.730
Maintain a mourning ostentation

234
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.870
And on your family's old monument

235
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.370
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites

236
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.400
That appertain unto a burial.

237
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.700
What shall become of this? what will this do?

238
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.730
Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf

239
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:26.270
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:

240
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:30.170
But not for that dream I on this strange course,

241
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.070
But on this travail look for greater birth.

242
00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.830
She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,

243
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.700
Upon the instant that she was accused,

244
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.430
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused

245
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.000
Of every hearer: for it so falls out

246
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.930
That what we have we prize not to the worth

247
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.170
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,

248
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.670
Why, then we rack the value, then we find

249
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.070
The virtue that possession would not show us

250
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.970
Whiles it was ours.

251
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.670
So will it fare with Claudio:

252
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.800
When he shall hear she died upon his words,

253
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.430
The idea of her life

254
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:14.170
shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination,

255
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.030
And every lovely organ of her life

256
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:19.230
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,

257
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.230
More moving-delicate and full of life,

258
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.570
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,

259
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:30.600
Than when she lived indeed;

260
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.030
then shall he mourn, If ever love had interest in his liver,

261
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.770
And wish he had not so accused her,

262
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:43.230
No, though he thought his accusation true.

263
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.170
Let this be so, and doubt not but success

264
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.300
Will fashion the event in better shape

265
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.370
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.

266
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.370
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,

267
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.030
The supposition of the lady's death

268
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.170
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:

269
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.330
And if it sort not well,

270
00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.970
you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation,

271
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.970
In some reclusive and religious life,

272
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:13.700
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

273
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:20.270
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:

274
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.970
And though you know my inwardness

275
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.830
and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,

276
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.130
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this

277
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:32.500
As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.

278
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.370
Being that I flow in grief,

279
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.830
The smallest twine may lead me.

280
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:44.270
'Tis well consented: presently away;

281
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:52.070
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.

282
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:57.870
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day

283
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:06.230
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

284
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.070
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?

285
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.000
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.

286
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.130
I will not desire that.

287
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.230
You have no reason; I do it freely.

288
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.170
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.

289
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:48.300
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me

290
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:51.800
that would right her!

291
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.500
Is there any way to show such friendship?

292
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:58.530
A very even way, but no such friend.

293
00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.600
May a man do it?

294
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:09.700
It is a man's office, but not yours.

295
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:17.400
I do love nothing in the world so well as you:

296
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.200
is not that strange?

297
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:33.530
As strange as the thing I know not.

298
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.970
It were as possible for me to say

299
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.430
I loved nothing so well as you: but believe me not;

300
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.200
and yet I lie not; I confess nothing,

301
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.600
nor I deny nothing.

302
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.330
I am sorry for my cousin.

303
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.670
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.

304
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.170
Do not swear, and eat it.

305
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.670
I will swear by it that you love me;

306
00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:00.130
and I will make him eat it that says I love not you.

307
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.230
Will you not eat your word?

308
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.830
With no sauce that can be devised to it.

309
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:08.170
I protest I love thee.

310
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.400
Why, then, God forgive me!

311
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.870
What offence, sweet Beatrice?

312
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:11.900
You have stayed me in a happy hour:

313
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:13.100
I was about to protest I loved you.

314
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.970
And do it with all thy heart.

315
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.000
I love you with so much of my heart

316
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.770
that none is left to protest.

317
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.170
Come, bid me do any thing for thee.

318
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:33.430
Kill Claudio.

319
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.400
Ha!

320
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.770
not for the wide world.

321
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.800
You kill me to deny it.

322
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.500
Farewell.

323
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.130
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

324
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.970
I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you:

325
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.100
nay, I pray you, let me go.

326
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.070
Beatrice,-- In faith, I will go.

327
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.330
We'll be friends first.

328
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.930
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.

329
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.400
Is Claudio thine enemy?

330
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.870
Is he not approved in the height a villain,

331
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.770
that hath slandered, scorned,

332
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.400
dishonoured my kinswoman?

333
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.230
O that I were a man!

334
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.770
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands;

335
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.730
and then, with public accusation,

336
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.930
uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,

337
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.370
--O God, that I were a man!

338
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.400
I would eat his heart in the market-place.

339
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.530
Hear me, Beatrice,--

340
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.200
Talk with a man out at a window!

341
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.030
A proper saying!

342
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.770
Nay, but, Beatrice,-- Sweet Hero!

343
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.530
She is wronged, she is slandered,

344
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:33.700
she is undone.

345
00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.400
Beat--

346
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.200
Princes and counties!

347
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.400
Surely, a princely testimony,

348
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.730
a goodly count, Count Comfect;

349
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.530
a sweet gallant, surely!

350
00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:47.630
O that I were a man for his sake!

351
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:54.300
or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!

352
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.200
But manhood is melted into courtesies,

353
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.970
valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue,

354
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:06.830
and trim ones too:

355
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.530
he is now as valiant as Hercules

356
00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:17.470
that only tells a lie and swears it.

357
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.930
I cannot be a man with wishing,

358
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.670
therefore I will die a woman with grieving.

359
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.800
Tarry, good Beatrice.

360
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.270
By this hand, I love thee.

361
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.500
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.

362
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.230
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

363
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:48.770
Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.

364
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:58.630
Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him.

365
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:04.030
I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you.

366
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:09.870
By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.

367
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.700
As you hear of me, so think of me.

368
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:18.070
Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead:

369
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:27.270
and so, farewell.

370
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:44.930


371
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.900
Is our whole dissembly appeared?

372
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.970
O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.

373
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.230
Which be the malefactors?

374
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:15.730
Marry, that am I and my partner.

375
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.470
Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.

376
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.430
But which are the offenders that are to be examined?

377
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.370
let them come before master constable.

378
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:29.230
Yea, marry, let them come before me.

379
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.930
What is your name, friend?

380
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:31.800
Borachio.

381
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.270
Pray, write down, Borachio.

382
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.400
Yours, sirrah?

383
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.270
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.

384
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.530
Write down, master gentleman Conrade.

385
00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.900
Masters, do you serve God?

386
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.430
Yea, sir, we hope.

387
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.930
Write down, that they hope they serve God:

388
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.070
and write God first;

389
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:52.400
for God forbid but God should go before such villains!

390
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.530
Masters, it is proved already

391
00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.070
that you are little better than false knaves;

392
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:01.500
and it will go near to be thought so shortly.

393
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.270
How answer you for yourselves?

394
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.030
Marry, sir, we say we are none.

395
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.630
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you:

396
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.470
but I will go about with him.

397
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.500
Come you, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir,

398
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.730
I say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.

399
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.670
Sir, I say to you we are none.

400
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.170
Well, stand aside.

401
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.730
'Fore God, they are both in a tale.

402
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.100
Have you writ down, that they are none?

403
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.230
Master constable, you go not the way to examine:

404
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.070
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.

405
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.000
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way.

406
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.030
Let the watch come forth.

407
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:36.930
Masters, I charge you, in the prince's name,

408
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.070
accuse these men.

409
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.370
This man said, sir, that Don John,

410
00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:45.130
the prince's brother, was a villain.

411
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.700
Write down Prince John a villain.

412
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.770
Why, this is flat perjury,

413
00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.400
to call a prince's brother villain.

414
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.030
Master constable,--

415
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.970
Pray thee, fellow, peace:

416
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.530
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.

417
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.970
What heard you him say else?

418
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.630
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats

419
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:03.070
of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.

420
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.500
Flat burglary as ever was committed.

421
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.530
Yea, by mass, that it is.

422
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.170
What else, fellow?

423
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.000
And that Count Claudio did mean,

424
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.500
upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly.

425
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.230
and not marry her.

426
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.270
O villain! thou wilt be condemned

427
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.170
into everlasting redemption for this.

428
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.600
What else?

429
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.330
This is all.

430
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.430
And this is more, masters, than you can deny.

431
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.670
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;

432
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.430
Hero was in this manner accused,

433
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.900
in this very manner refused,

434
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:43.070
and upon the grief of this suddenly died.

435
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.270
Master constable, let these men be bound,

436
00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:47.500
and brought to Leonato's: I will go before

437
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.500
and show him their examination.

438
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.900
Come, let them be opinioned.

439
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.930
Let them be in the hands--

440
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.400
Off, coxcomb!

441
00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.830
God's my life, where's the sexton?

442
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.270
let him write down the prince's officer coxcomb.

443
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.400
Bind them.

444
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.600
Thou naughty varlet!

445
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.500
Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.

446
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.170
Dost thou not suspect my place?

447
00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:13.630
dost thou not suspect my years?

448
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.500
O that he were here to write me down an ass!

449
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.730
But, masters, remember that I am an ass;

450
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.530
though it be not written down,

451
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:22.530
yet forget not that I am an ass.

452
00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.230
No, thou villain, thou art full of piety,

453
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.170
as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.

454
00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:31.830
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more,

455
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.900
an officer, and, which is more,

456
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.730
a householder, and, which is more,

457
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:39.630
as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina,

458
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.600
and one that knows the law, go to;

459
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.230
and a rich fellow enough, go to;

460
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.830
and a fellow that hath had losses,

461
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.930
and one that hath two gowns

462
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:50.230
and every thing handsome about him.

463
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.230
Bring him away.

464
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.430
O that I had been writ down an ass!

465
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.900
