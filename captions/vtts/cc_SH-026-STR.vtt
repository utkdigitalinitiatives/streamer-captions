WHEN THEY DID SAY"GOD BLESS US!"

753
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:06.400

01:36:43.630 --> 01:36:44.970
[baby crying]

1831
01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:47.570
WHEN OUR ACTIONS DO NOT,OUR FEARS DO MAKE US TRAITORS.

1832
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:50.230
YOU KNOW NOT WHETHER IT WASHIS WISDOM OR HIS FEAR.

1833
01:36:50.230 --> 01:36:51.770
WISDOM?

1834
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:53.070
TO LEAVE HIS WIFE,

1835
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:56.700
TO LEAVE HIS BABES,HIS MANSION, AND HIS TITLES

1836
01:36:56.700 --> 01:36:59.130
IN A PLACEFROM WHENCE HIMSELF DOES FLY?

1837
01:36:59.130 --> 01:37:04.270
HE LOVES US NOT;HE WANTS THE NATURAL TOUCH.

1838
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:09.130
FOR THE POOR WREN,THE MOST DIMINUTIVE OF BIRDS,

WILL FIGHT,HER YOUNG ONES IN HER NEST,

1840
01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:12.630
AGAINST THE OWL.

1841
01:37:12.630 --> 01:37:17.630
ALL IS THE FEAR,AND NOTHING IS THE LOVE!

1842
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:20.400
AS LITTLE IS THE WISDOM,

1843
01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:24.000
WHERE THE FLIGHT SO RUNSAGAINST ALL REASON.

1844
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.970

I DARE NOT SPEAKMUCH FURTHER.

1850
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:41.030
BUT CRUEL ARE THE TIMESWHEN WE ARE TRAITORS,

1851
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.400
AND DO NOTKNOW OURSELVES,

1852
01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.600
WHEN WE HOLD RUMORFROM WHAT WE FEAR,

1853
01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.500
YET KNOW NOTWHAT WE FEAR,

1854
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:49.970
BUT FLOAT UPON A WILDAND VIOLENT SEA EACH WAY,

1855
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:51.270
AND NONE.

1856
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:53.170

I AM SO MUCH A FOOL,SHOULD I STAY LONGER,

1863
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:17.170

01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:11.670
BUT I REMEMBER NOWI AM IN THIS EARTHLY WORLD--

1921
01:41:11.670 --> 01:41:14.800
WHERE TO DO HARMIS OFTEN LAUDABLE,

1922
01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:19.700
TO DO GOOD SOMETIME ACCOUNTEDDANGEROUS FOLLY.

1923
01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:23.800
WHY, THEN, ALAS, DO IPUT UP THAT WOMANLY DEFENSE,

1924
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.770
TO SAY I HAVE DONE NO HARM?

1925
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:58.830


1926
01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:00.570
WHAT ARE THESE FACES?

1927
01:42:00.570 --> 01:42:02.800
WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?

1928
01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:06.670
I HOPE IN NO PLACESO UNSANCTIFIED

1929
01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:10.070
WHERE SUCH AS THOUMAYST FIND HIM.

1930
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:11.070
HE'S A TRAITOR.

1931
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:13.230
THOU LIEST,THOU SHAG-EAR'D VILLAIN!

1932
01:42:13.230 --> 01:42:14.700
WHAT, YOU EGG?

1933
01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:15.700
[yelling]

1934
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:18.530
[yelling

1935
01:42:26.230 --> 01:42:36.230


1936
01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:37.230
[boy screaming]

1937
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:43.670
YOUNG FRY OF TREACHERY.

1938
01:42:47.070 --> 01:42:50.600
[muffled sobbing]

1939
01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.930
[Lady Macduff screaming]

1940
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:15.070


1941
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:16.900
LET US SEEK OUTSOME DESOLATE SHADE,

1942
01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.830
AND THERE WEEPOUR SAD BOSOMS EMPTY.

1943
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:23.830
LET US RATHER HOLD FASTTHE MORTAL SWORD,

1944
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:28.970
AND LIKE GOOD MEN BESTRIDEOUR DOWNFALL'N BIRTHDOM.

1945
01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:30.900
EACH NEW MORN

1946
01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:35.730
NEW WIDOWS HOWL,NEW ORPHANS CRY,

1947
01:43:35.730 --> 01:43:38.570
NEW SORROWS STRIKE HEAVENON THE FACE,

1948
01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:40.770
THAT IT RESOUNDSAS IF IT FELT WITH SCOTLAND

1949
01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:43.430
AND YELLED OUTLIKE SYLLABLE OF DOLOR.

1950
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:44.830
WHAT I BELIEVE,I'LL WAIL;

1951
01:43:44.830 --> 01:43:47.500
WHAT KNOW, BELIEVE.

1952
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.030
AND WHAT I CAN REDRESS,

1953
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:51.000
AS I SHALL FINDTHE TIME TO FRIEND, I WILL.

1954
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.600
WHAT YOU HAVE SPOKE,IT MAY BE SO PERCHANCE.

1955
01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.530
THIS TYRANT, WHOSE SOLE NAMEBLISTERS OUR TONGUES,

1956
01:43:58.530 --> 01:44:00.170
WAS ONCE THOUGHT HONEST.

1957
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:02.270
YOU HAVE LOVED HIM WELL.

1958
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:04.500
HE HATH NOTTOUCHED YOU YET.

1959
01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.500
I AM YOUNG,

1960
01:44:06.500 --> 01:44:08.700
BUT SOMETHING YOU MAY DESERVEOF HIM THROUGH ME,

1961
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:11.170
AND WISDOM TO OFFER UPA WEAK, POOR, INNOCENT LAMB

1962
01:44:11.170 --> 01:44:12.930
TO APPEASE AN ANGRY GOD.

1963
01:44:12.930 --> 01:44:14.270
I AM NOT TREACHEROUS.

1964
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:15.700
BUT MACBETH IS!

1965
01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:18.530
A GOOD AND VIRTUOUS NATURE MAYRECOIL AT AN IMPERIAL CHARGE.

1966
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:21.770
BUT I SHALL CRAVEYOUR PARDON.

1967
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:25.600
THAT WHICH YOU ARE,MY THOUGHTS CANNOT TRANSPOSE.

1968
01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:28.270
ANGELS ARE BRIGHT STILL,THOUGH THE BRIGHTEST FELL.

1969
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:31.270
THOUGH ALL THINGS FOULWOULD WEAR THE BROWS OF GRACE,

1970
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:33.630
YET GRACEMUST STILL LOOK SO.

1971
01:44:33.630 --> 01:44:34.970
I HAVE LOST MY HOPES.

1972
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:37.170
PERCHANCE EVEN THEREWHERE I DID FIND MY DOUBTS.

1973
01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:39.370
WHY IN THAT RAWNESSLEFT YOU WIFE AND CHILD,

1974
01:44:39.370 --> 01:44:41.130
THOSE PRECIOUS MOTIVES,

1975
01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:43.600
THOSE STRONG KNOTS OF LOVE,WITHOUT LEAVE-TAKING?

1976
01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:44.600
I PRAY YOU,

1977
01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.530
LET NOT MY JEALOUSIESBE YOUR DISHONORS,

1978
01:44:46.530 --> 01:44:47.930
BUT MINE OWN SAFETIES.

1979
01:44:47.930 --> 01:44:50.130
YOU MAY BE RIGHTLY JUST,WHATEVER I SHALL THINK.

1980
01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:58.070
BLEED, BLEED,POOR COUNTRY.

1981
01:44:58.070 --> 01:45:01.200
GREAT TYRANNY,LAY THOU THY BASIS SURE,

1982
01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:03.800
FOR GOODNESSDARE NOT CHECK THEE.

1983
01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:05.430
WEAR THOU THY WRONGS,

1984
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:10.800
THE TITLE...IS AFEARED.

1985
01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:12.330
FARE THEE WELL, LORD.

1986
01:45:12.330 --> 01:45:14.530
I WOULD NOT BE THE VILLAINTHAT THOU THINK'ST

1987
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:16.770
FOR THE WHOLE SPACETHAT'S IN THE TYRANT'S GRASP

1988
01:45:16.770 --> 01:45:18.370
AND THE RICH EAST TO BOOT.

1989
01:45:18.370 --> 01:45:19.770
BE NOT OFFENDED.

1990
01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:23.100
I SPEAK NOTAS IN ABSOLUTE FEAR OF YOU.

1991
01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.900
I THINK OUR COUNTRY SINKSBENEATH THE YOKE.

1992
01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:27.430
IT WEEPS.  IT BLEEDS.

1993
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:30.400
AND EACH NEW DAYA GASH IS ADDED TO HER WOUNDS.

1994
01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:31.630
I THINK WITHAL

1995
01:45:31.630 --> 01:45:33.970
THERE WOULD BE HANDS UPLIFTEDIN MY RIGHT.

1996
01:45:33.970 --> 01:45:35.330
AND HEREFROM GRACIOUS ENGLAND

1997
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:36.970
HAVE I OFFEROF GOODLY THOUSANDS.

1998
01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:40.100
BUT, FOR ALL THIS,

1999
01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.430
WHEN I SHALL TREADUPON THE TYRANT'S HEAD,

2000
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:43.770
OR WEAR IT ON MY SWORD,

2001
01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:46.830
YET MY POOR COUNTRYSHALL HAVE MORE VICES

2002
01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:48.930
THAN IT HAD BEFORE.

2003
01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:50.100
MORE SUFFER,

2004
01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:52.230
AND MORE SUNDRY WAYSTHAN EVER,

2005
01:45:52.230 --> 01:45:54.300
BY HIM THAT SHALL SUCCEED.

2006
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:55.930
WHAT SHOULD HE BE?

2007
01:45:55.930 --> 01:45:57.700
IT IS MYSELF I MEAN,

2008
01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:00.600
IN WHOM I KNOW ALLTHE PARTICULARS OF VICE

2009
01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.730
SO GRAFTED THATWHEN THEY SHALL BE OPENED,

2010
01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:07.030
BLACK MACBETH WILL SEEMAS PURE AS SNOW,

2011
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:10.130
AND THE POOR STATEESTEEM HIM AS A LAMB,

2012
01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.770
BEING COMPARED WITHMY CONFINELESS HARMS.

2013
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:15.800
NOT IN THE LEGIONSOF HORRID HELL

2014
01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:19.970
CAN COME A DEVIL MORE DAMN'DIN EVILS TO TOP MACBETH.

2015
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:23.030
I GRANT HIM BLOODY,LUXURIOUS, AVARICIOUS,

2016
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:25.070
FALSE, DECEITFUL,SUDDEN, MALICIOUS,

2017
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:27.330
SMACKING OF EVERY SINTHAT HAS A NAME.

2018
01:46:27.330 --> 01:46:32.370
BUT THERE'S NO BOTTOM, NONE,IN MY VOLUPTUOUSNESS.

2019
01:46:34.230 --> 01:46:37.270
YOUR WIVES, YOUR DAUGHTERS,YOUR MATRONS, AND YOUR MAIDS

2020
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:39.800
COULD NOT FILL UPTHE CISTERN OF MY LUST,

2021
01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.600
AND MY DESIREALL CONTINENT IMPEDIMENTS

2022
01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:45.330
WOULD O'ERBEARTHAT DID OPPOSE MY WILL.

2023
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:49.970
BETTER MACBETHTHAN SUCH AN ONE TO REIGN.

2024
01:46:52.830 --> 01:47:00.570
BOUNDLESS INTEMPERANCEIN NATURE IS A TYRANNY.

2025
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:04.070
IT HATH BEEN TH' UNTIMELYEMPTYING OF THE HAPPY THRONE,

2026
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:06.900
AND FALL OF MANY KINGS.

2027
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:12.700
BUT FEAR NOT YET

2028
01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.800
TO TAKE UPON YOUWHAT IS YOURS.

2029
01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.770
YOU MAY CONVEY YOUR PLEASURESIN A SPACIOUS PLENTY,

2030
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:23.730
AND YET SEEM COLD,THE TIME YOU MAY SO HOODWINK.

2031
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:26.870
WE HAVEWILLING DAMES ENOUGH.

2032
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:31.100
THERE CANNOT BE THAT VULTUREIN YOU TO DEVOUR SO MANY

2033
01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.800
AS WILL TO GREATNESSDEDICATE THEMSELVES,

2034
01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:35.700
FINDING IT SO INCLINED.

2035
01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.000
WITH THIS,

2036
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.330
THERE GROWS IN MY MOSTILL-COMPOSED AFFECTIONS

2037
01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:42.370
SUCH A STAUNCHLESS AVARICETHAT, WERE I KING,

2038
01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:44.600
I SHOULD CUT OFF THE NOBLESFOR THEIR LANDS,

2039
01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.270
DESIRE HIS JEWELS,THIS OTHER'S HOUSE,

2040
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:49.570
AND MY MORE-HAVINGWOULD BE AS A SAUCE

2041
01:47:49.570 --> 01:47:50.870
TO MAKE ME HUNGER MORE,

2042
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:52.570
THAT I SHOULD FORGEQUARRELS UNJUST

2043
01:47:52.570 --> 01:47:57.130
AGAINST THE GOOD AND LOYAL,DESTROYING THEM FOR WEALTH.

2044
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.170
THIS AVARICE STICKS DEEPER,

2045
01:48:07.170 --> 01:48:12.500
GROWS WITH MORE PERNICIOUS ROOTTHAN SUMMER-SEEMING LUST,

2046
01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:16.900
AND IT HATH BEEN THE SWORDOF OUR SLAIN KINGS.

2047
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:20.370
YET DO NOT FEAR.

2048
01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:22.630
SCOTLAND HATH FOISONSTO FILL UP YOUR WILL

2049
01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:23.930
OF YOUR MERE OWN.

2050
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:26.400
ALL THESE ARE PORTABLE,WITH OTHER GRACES WEIGHED.

2051
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.000
BUT I HAVE NONE.

2052
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.970
THE KING-BECOMING GRACES--AS JUSTICE, VERITY,

2053
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:35.030
TEMP'RANCE, STABLENESS,BOUNTY, PERSEVERANCE,

2054
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:39.170
MERCY, LOWLINESS, DEVOTION,PATIENCE, COURAGE, FORTITUDE--

2055
01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:40.570
I HAVE NO RELISH OF THEM,

2056
01:48:40.570 --> 01:48:43.770
BUT ABOUND IN THE DIVISIONOF EACH SEVERAL CRIME,

2057
01:48:43.770 --> 01:48:45.530
ACTING IT MANY WAYS.

2058
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:47.800
NAY, HAD I POWER,

2059
01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.900

UPROAR THE UNIVERSAL PEACE,CONFOUND ALL UNITY ON EARTH.

2061
01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.200
OH, SCOTLAND, SCOTLAND.

HAS SOUGHT TO WIN MEINTO HIS POWER,

2085

IS ONCE SEEN TO SMILE;

2120
01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:48.770
WHERE SIGHS, AND GROANSAND SHRIEKS THAT RENT THE AIR

WHAT'S THE NEWEST GRIEF?

2130

WHEN I CAME HITHERTO TRANSPORT THE TIDINGS,

2637

02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:25.900

WE'LL HAVE THEE,AS OUR RARER MONSTERS ARE,

2650
02:20:36.130 --> 02:20:39.130
PAINTED UPON A POLE, AND UNDERWRIT,

2651
02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:43.200
"HERE MAY YOU SEE THE TYRANT."

2652
02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:47.630
I WILL NOT YIELD

2653
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:51.730
TO KISS THE GROUNDBEFORE YOUNG MALCOLM'S FEET

2654
02:20:51.730 --> 02:20:54.330
AND TO BE BAITEDWITH THE RABBLE'S CURSE.

2655
02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:57.370
THOUGH BIRNAM WOODBE COME TO DUNSINANE,

2656
02:20:57.370 --> 02:21:01.170
AND THOU OPPOSED,BEING OF NO WOMAN BORN,

2657
02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:02.830
YET I WILL TRY THE LAST!

2658
02:21:04.530 --> 02:21:08.170
BEFORE MY BODYI THROW MY WARLIKE SHIELD.

2659
02:21:08.170 --> 02:21:11.230
LAY ON, MACDUFF,

2660
02:21:11.230 --> 02:21:13.700
AND DAMNED BE HIMTHAT FIRST CRIES,

2661
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:15.670
"HOLD, ENOUGH!"

2662
02:21:40.930 --> 02:21:50.930


2663
02:21:50.930 --> 02:21:53.100
THIS WAY, MY LORD.

2664
02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:55.670
THE CASTLE'S GENTLY RENDERED.

2665
02:21:55.670 --> 02:22:00.070
THE DAY ALMOST ITSELFPROFESSES YOURS,

2666
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:01.930
AND LITTLE IS TO DO.

2667
02:22:01.930 --> 02:22:04.130
I WOULD THE FRIENDS WE MISSWERE SAFE ARRIVED.

2668
02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:06.330
SOME MUST GO OFF.

2669
02:22:06.330 --> 02:22:08.470
AND YET, BY THESE I SEE,

2670
02:22:08.470 --> 02:22:11.330
SO GREAT A DAYAS THIS IS CHEAPLY BOUGHT.

2671
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:14.730
MACDUFF IS MISSING,AND YOUR NOBLE SON.

2672
02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:20.200
YOUR SON, MY LORD,HATH PAID A SOLDIER'S DEBT.

2673
02:22:20.200 --> 02:22:22.270
HE ONLY LIVEDBUT TILL HE WAS A MAN,

2674
02:22:22.270 --> 02:22:24.600
THE WHICH NO SOONERHAD HIS PROWESS CONFIRMED

2675
02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:26.530
IN THE UNSHRINKING STATIONWHERE HE FOUGHT

2676
02:22:26.530 --> 02:22:29.770
BUT LIKE A MAN HE DIED.

2677
02:22:29.770 --> 02:22:33.130
THEN HE IS DEAD.

2678
02:22:33.130 --> 02:22:35.830
YOUR CAUSE OF SORROW MUST NOTBE MEASURED BY HIS WORTH,

2679
02:22:35.830 --> 02:22:37.530
FOR THEN IT HATH NO END.

2680
02:22:37.530 --> 02:22:40.200
HAD HE HIS HURTS BEFORE?

2681
02:22:40.200 --> 02:22:42.330
AYE, ON THE FRONT.

2682
02:22:42.330 --> 02:22:46.330
WHY THEN,GOD'S SOLDIER BE HE.

2683
02:22:46.330 --> 02:22:49.830
HAD I AS MANY SONSAS I HAVE HAIRS,

2684
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:53.000
I WOULD NOT WISH THEMTO A FAIRER DEATH.

2685
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.870
AND SO HIS KNELL IS KNOLLED.

2686
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:59.600
(Malcolm)HE'S WORTH MORE SORROW,

2687
02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:02.000
AND THATI'LL SPEND FOR HIM.

2688
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.200
HE'S WORTH NO MORE.

2689
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:07.330
THEY SAY HE PARTED WELLAND PAID HIS SCORE.

2690
02:23:07.330 --> 02:23:11.900
AND SO GOD BE WITH HIM.

2691
02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:29.400


2692
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:35.870
