00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:42.470


2
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.770
(laughing)

3
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.130
If you shall chance, Camillo,

4
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.770
to visit Bohemia,

5
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.870
on the like occasion whereon my services

6
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.070
are now on foot,

7
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.230
you shall see, as I have said,

8
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.600
great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

9
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.700
I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia

10
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.630
means to pay Bohemia the visitation

11
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.730
which he justly owes him.

12
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.630
Wherein our entertainment shall shame us

13
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.470
we will be justified in our loves; for indeed--

14
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.770
Beseech you,--

15
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.830
Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:

16
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.730
we cannot with such magnificence--

17
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.530
in so rare--I know not what to say.

18
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.730
We will give you sleepy drinks,

19
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.630
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,

20
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.200
may, though they cannot praise us,

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.330
as little accuse us.

22
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.970
You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

23
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.800
Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.970
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

25
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.270
Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.

26
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.230
They were trained together in their childhoods;

27
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.100
and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,

28
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.330
which cannot choose but branch now.

29
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.870
Since their more mature dignities

30
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.030
and royal necessities

31
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.200
made separation of their society, their encounters,

32
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.130
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.000
with interchange of gifts, letters,

34
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.870
loving embassies; that they have seemed to be together,

35
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.070
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast,

36
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.200
and embraced, as it were,

37
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.730
from the ends of opposed winds.

38
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.930
The heavens continue their loves!

39
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.730
I think there is not in the world

40
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.570
either malice or matter to alter it.

41
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.970
You have an unspeakable comfort

42
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.730
of your young prince Mamillius:

43
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.900
it is a gentleman of the greatest promise

44
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.300
that ever came into my note.

45
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.670
I very well agree with you in the hopes of him:

46
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.230
it is a gallant child;

47
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.570
one that indeed physics the subject,

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.370
makes old hearts fresh:

49
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.370
they that went on crutches ere he was born

50
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.700
desire yet their life to see him a man.

51
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.170
Would they else be content to die?

52
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.200
Yes; if there were no other excuse

53
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.100
why they should desire to live.

54
00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.230
If the king had no son,

55
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.700
they would desire to live on crutches

56
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.100
till he had one.

57
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.200
Nine changes of the watery star hath been

58
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne

59
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.500
Without a burthen: time as long again my brother,

60
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.930
would be filled up with our thanks;

61
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.500
And yet we should, for perpetuity,

62
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.930
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,

63
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.870
Yet standing in rich place,

64
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.000
I multiply with one 'We thank you'

65
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.370
many thousands more that go before it.

66
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.630
Stay your thanks a while;

67
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.170
And pay them when you part.

68
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.170
Sir, that's to-morrow.

69
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.830
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance

70
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.000
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow

71
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.530
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say

72
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.800
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd

73
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.370
To tire your royalty.

74
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.530
We are tougher, brother,

75
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.700
Than you can put us to't.

76
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.570
No longer stay.

77
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.530
One seven-night longer.

78
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.200
Very sooth, to-morrow.

79
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.870
We'll part the time between's then;

80
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.800
and in that I'll no gainsaying.

81
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.800
Press me not, beseech you, so.

82
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.070
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,

83
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.600
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,

84
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600
Were there necessity in your request,

85
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.930
'Twere needful I denied it.

86
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.500
My affairs do even drag me homeward:

87
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.300
which to hinder were in your love a whip to me;

88
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.270
my stay to you a charge and trouble:

89
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.300
to save both, farewell, our brother.

90
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.670
Tongue-tied, our queen? speak you.

91
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.230
I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until

92
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.470
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay.

93
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.030
You, sir, Charge him too coldly.

94
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.800
Tell him, you are sure All in Bohemia's well;

95
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.430
this satisfaction the by-gone day proclaim'd:

96
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.330
say this to him, he's beat from his best ward.

97
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.070
Well said, Hermione.

98
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.200
To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:

99
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.730
But let him say so then, and let him go;

100
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.600
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,

101
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.830
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.

102
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.800
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure

103
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.700
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia

104
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.270
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission

105
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.370
To let him there a month behind the gest

106
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.230
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,

107
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.000
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind

108
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.170
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

109
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.630
No, madam.

110
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.870
Nay, but you will?

111
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.770
I may not, verily.

112
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.100
Verily!

113
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.000
You put me off with limber vows;

114
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.170
but I, Though you would seek to unsphere

115
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.430
the stars with oaths,

116
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.400
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.'

117
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.530
Verily, You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's

118
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.030
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?

119
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.800
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,

120
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.430
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees

121
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.100
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?

122
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.430
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'

123
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.870
One of them you shall be.

124
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.370
Your guest, then, madam:

125
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.400
To be your prisoner should import offending;

126
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.600
Which is for me less easy to commit

127
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.700
Than you to punish.

128
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.530
Not your gaoler, then,

129
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.430
But your kind hostess.

130
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.530
Come, I'll question you

131
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.070
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:

132
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.130
You were pretty lordings then?

133
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.130
We were, fair queen,

134
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.500
Two lads that thought there was no more behind

135
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.630
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,

136
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.230
And to be boy eternal.

137
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.030
Was not my lord

138
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.870
The verier wag o' the two?

139
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.400
We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,

140
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.330
And bleat the one at the other:

141
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.000
what we changed

142
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.500
Was innocence for innocence;

143
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.630
we knew not

144
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.130
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd that any did.

145
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.700
Had we pursued that life,

146
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.630
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd

147
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.870
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven

148
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.270
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd

149
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.630
Hereditary ours.

150
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.070
By this we gather

151
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.900
You have tripp'd since.

152
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.170
O my most sacred lady!

153
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.700
Temptations have since then been born to's;

154
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.470
for in those unfledged days was my wife a girl;

155
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.170
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes

156
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.670
Of my young play-fellow.

157
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.800
Grace to boot!

158
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say

159
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.000
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;

160
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.430
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,

161
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.930
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us

162
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.800
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd

163
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.570
not with any but with us.

164
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.770
Is he won yet?

165
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.770
He'll stay my lord.

166
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.700
At my request he would not.

167
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.700
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest

168
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.300
To better purpose.

169
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:51.930
Never?

170
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.200
Never, but once.

171
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.900
What! have I twice said well? when was't before?

172
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.300
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's

173
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.200
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless

174
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.000
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.

175
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.230
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's

176
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.770
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere

177
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.800
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:

178
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.800
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:

179
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.970
What was my first? it has an elder sister,

180
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.730
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!

181
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.830
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?

182
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.300
Nay, let me have't; I long.

183
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.400
Why, that was when

184
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.170
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,

185
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.930
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand

186
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.300
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter

187
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.670
'I am yours for ever.'

188
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.670
'Tis grace indeed.

189
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.470
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:

190
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.400
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;

191
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.600
The other for some while a friend.

192
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.130
Too hot, too hot!

193
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.400
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.

194
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;

195
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.930
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment

196
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.170
May a free face put on, derive a liberty

197
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.500
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,

198
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.130
And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;

199
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.530
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,

200
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.570
As now they are, and making practised smiles,

201
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.500
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere

202
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.070
The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment

203
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.400
My bosom likes not, nor my brows!

204
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.500
Mamillius, Art thou my boy?

205
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.430
Ay, my good lord.

206
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.930
I' fecks!

207
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.070
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast

208
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.430
smutch'd thy nose?

209
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.470
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,

210
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.730
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:

211
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.400
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf

212
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.430
Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling

213
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:39.930
Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!

214
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.170
Art thou my calf?

215
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.300
Yes, if you will, my lord.

216
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.300
Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,

217
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.070
To be full like me: yet they say we are

218
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.400
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,

219
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.800
That will say anything but were they false

220
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.570
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false

221
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.330
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes

222
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:01.400
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true

223
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.830
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,

224
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.830
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!

225
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:15.200
Most dear'st! my collop!

226
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.300
Can thy dam?--may't be?--

227
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.930
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:

228
00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.300
Thou dost make possible things not so held,

229
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.470
Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--

230
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.770
With what's unreal thou coactive art,

231
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.230
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent

232
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.600
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,

233
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.770
And that beyond commission, and I find it,

234
00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.630
And that to the infection of my brains

235
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.300
And hardening of my brows.

236
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.600
What means Sicilia?

237
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.170
He something seems unsettled.

238
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:53.070
How, my lord!

239
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.630
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

240
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.570
You look as if you held a brow of much distraction

241
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.670
Are you moved, my lord?

242
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.530
No, in good earnest.

243
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.400
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,

244
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.200
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime

245
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.800
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines

246
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.530
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil

247
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.770
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,

248
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.170
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,

249
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.070
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,

250
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:24.070
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:

251
00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.670
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,

252
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.530
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,

253
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.200
Will you take eggs for money?

254
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.030
No, my lord, I'll fight.

255
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:41.930
You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,

256
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.670
Are you so fond of your young prince

257
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.070
as we do seem to be of ours?

258
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.000
If at home, sir,

259
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.470
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,

260
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.870
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,

261
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.670
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:

262
00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.500
He makes a July's day short as December,

263
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.770
And with his varying childness cures in me

264
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:08.830
Thoughts that would thick my blood.

265
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.500
So stands this squire

266
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.230
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,

267
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.230
And leave you to your graver steps.

268
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.270
Hermione, How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;

269
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.830
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:

270
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.200
Next to thyself and my young rover,

271
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.100
he's apparent to my heart.

272
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.270
If you would seek us,

273
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.830
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

274
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.600
To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,

275
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.570
Be you beneath the sky.

276
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.500
I am angling now,

277
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.300
Though you perceive me not how I give line.

278
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.370
Go to, go to!

279
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.830
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!

280
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.670
And arms her with the boldness of a wife

281
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.170
To her allowing husband!

282
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.230
Gone already!

283
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.630
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head

284
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.300
and ears a fork'd one!

285
00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.930
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays,

286
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.900
and I play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue

287
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.370
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour

288
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.930
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.

289
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.870
There have been,

290
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.200
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;

291
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.670
And many a man there is, even at this present,

292
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.470
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,

293
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:29.830
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence

294
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.800
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour,

295
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.170
by Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't

296
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.230
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,

297
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.900
As mine, against their will. Should all despair

298
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.970
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind

299
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.870
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;

300
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike

301
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.830
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,

302
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:57.500
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,

303
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.870
No barricado for a belly; know't;

304
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.170
It will let in and out the enemy

305
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.900
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's

306
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:12.170
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

307
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.400
I am like you, they say.

308
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.800
Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

309
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.770
Ay, my good lord.

310
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.630
Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.

311
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.530
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

312
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.900
You had much ado to make his anchor hold:

313
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.070
When you cast out, it still came home.

314
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.300
Didst note it?

315
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.000
He would not stay at your petitions: made

316
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.670
His business more material.

317
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.200
Didst perceive it?

318
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.570
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding

319
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:46.130
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,

320
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:51.470
When I shall gust it last.

321
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.070
How came't, Camillo, That he did stay?

322
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.730
At the good queen's entreaty.

323
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.170
At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent

324
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.600
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken

325
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.670
By any understanding pate but thine?

326
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.600
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in

327
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.070
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,

328
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.700
But of the finer natures? by some severals

329
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.700
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes

330
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.430
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

331
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.400
Business, my lord! I think most understand

332
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.000
Bohemia stays here longer.

333
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Ha!

334
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.300
Stays here longer.

335
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.800
Ay, but why?

336
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.300
To satisfy your highness and the entreaties

337
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.630
Of our most gracious mistress.

338
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.770
Satisfy!

339
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.830
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!

340
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.100
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,

341
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.030
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well

342
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.200
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou

343
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.930
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed

344
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.000
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been

345
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived

346
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.970
In that which seems so.

347
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.300
Be it forbid, my lord!

348
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.170
To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,

349
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.070
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,

350
00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.030
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining

351
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.500
From course required; or else thou must be counted

352
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.830
A servant grafted in my serious trust

353
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.500
And therein negligent; or else a fool

354
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.030
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,

355
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.300
And takest it all for jest.

356
00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.230
My gracious lord,

357
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.070
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;

358
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.870
In every one of these no man is free,

359
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:22.770
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,

360
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.330
Among the infinite doings of the world,

361
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.470
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,

362
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.870
If ever I were wilful-negligent,

363
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.030
It was my folly; if industriously

364
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.830
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,

365
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.900
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful

366
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.930
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,

367
00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.900
Where of the execution did cry out

368
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.800
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear

369
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.600
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,

370
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.870
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty

371
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.500
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,

372
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.500
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass

373
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.330
By its own visage: if I then deny it,

374
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.570
'Tis none of mine.

375
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.200
Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--

376
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.870
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass

377
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.400
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--

378
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.000
For to a vision so apparent rumour

379
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.170
Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation

380
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.170
Resides not in that man that does not think,--

381
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:16.270
My wife is slippery?

382
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.230
If thou wilt confess,

383
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.930
Or else be impudently negative,

384
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.500
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say

385
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.330
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name

386
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.230
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to

387
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:33.230
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

388
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.800
I would not be a stander-by to hear

389
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.730
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without

390
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.530
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,

391
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.330
You never spoke what did become you less

392
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.030
Than this; which to reiterate were sin

393
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.500
As deep as that, though true.

394
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.270
Is whispering nothing?

395
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.470
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?

396
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.130
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career

397
00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.400
Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible

398
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.730
Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?

399
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.470
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?

400
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.000
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes

401
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.930
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,

402
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.130
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?

403
00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.230
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;

404
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:19.800
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;

405
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.300
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,

406
00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.470
If this be nothing.

407
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:24.530
Good my lord, be cured

408
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:26.130
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;

409
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.500
For 'tis most dangerous.

410
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.630
Say it be, 'tis true.

411
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.970
No, no, my lord.

412
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.800
It is; you lie, you lie:

413
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.200
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,

414
00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.930
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,

415
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.170
Or else a hovering temporizer, that

416
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.100
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,

417
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.600
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver

418
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.330
Infected as her life, she would not live

419
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.900
The running of one glass.

420
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.700
Who does infect her?

421
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.170
Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging

422
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.830
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I

423
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.230
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes

424
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.800
To see alike mine honour as their profits,

425
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.870
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that

426
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.830
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,

427
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.100
His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form

428
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.870
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see

429
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.630
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,

430
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.670
How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,

431
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.830
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;

432
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.400
Which draught to me were cordial.

433
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.730
Sir, my lord,

434
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:37.230
I could do this, but I cannot

435
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.330
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,

436
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.800
So sovereignly being honourable.

437
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.630
I have loved thee,--

438
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.470
Make that thy question, and go rot!

439
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.600
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,

440
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.300
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully

441
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.300
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,

442
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.670
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted

443
00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.300
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,

444
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.200
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,

445
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.900
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,

446
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.170
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?

447
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.100
Could man so blench?

448
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.570
I must believe you, sir:

449
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:24.270
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;

450
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.870
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness

451
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.470
Will take again your queen as yours at first,

452
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.870
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing

453
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.830
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms

454
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:36.530
Known and allied to yours.

455
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.670
Thou dost advise me

456
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.070
Even so as I mine own course have set down:

457
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.900
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

458
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.600
My lord,

459
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.770
Go then; and with a countenance as clear

460
00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.100
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia

461
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.970
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:

462
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.930
If from me he have wholesome beverage,

463
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.700
Account me not your servant.

464
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.570
This is all:

465
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.730
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;

466
00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.530
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

467
00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.070
I'll do't, my lord.

468
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:17.400
I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

469
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:32.700
O miserable lady! But, for me,

470
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.470
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner

471
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:39.400
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't

472
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.130
Is the obedience to a master, one

473
00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:42.870
Who in rebellion with himself will have

474
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.600
All that are his so too. To do this deed,

475
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.430
Promotion follows. If I could find example

476
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.470
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings

477
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.900
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since

478
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.170
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,

479
00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:06.430
Let villany itself forswear't. I must

480
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:10.500
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain

481
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:17.000
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!

482
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.730
Here comes Bohemia.

483
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.500
This is strange: methinks

484
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:28.570
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?

485
00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:29.870
Good day, Camillo.

486
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.430
Hail, most royal sir!

487
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.000
What is the news i' the court?

488
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.370
None rare, my lord.

489
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:36.300
The king hath on him such a countenance

490
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.230
As he had lost some province and a region

491
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:41.470
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him

492
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.970
With customary compliment; when he,

493
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.330
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling

494
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:48.570
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me

495
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.670
and so leaves me to consider what is breeding

496
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.970
That changeth thus his manners.

497
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.600
I dare not know, my lord.

498
00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.530
How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?

499
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.100
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;

500
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.870
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.

501
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:09.770
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,

502
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.270
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror

503
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.470
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be

504
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.300
A party in this alteration,

505
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.630
finding Myself thus alter'd with 't.

506
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.130
There is a sickness

507
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.770
Which puts some of us in distemper,

508
00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.770
but I cannot name the disease; and it is caught

509
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.230
Of you that yet are well.

510
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.900
How! caught of me!

511
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.630
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:

512
00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.070
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better

513
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.430
By my regard, but kill'd none so. -

514
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.670
I beseech you,

515
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.130
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge

516
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.030
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not

517
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.430
In ignorant concealment.

518
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.800
I may not answer.

519
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.600
A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!

520
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.330
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,

521
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:05.930
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man

522
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.230
Which honour does acknowledge,

523
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.230
whereof the least

524
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.630
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare

525
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:14.900
What incidency thou dost guess of harm

526
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:23.530
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;

527
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.730
Which way to be prevented, if to be;

528
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.530
If not, how best to bear it.

529
00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.300
Sir, I will tell you;

530
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.570
Since I am charged in honour and by him

531
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.470
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,

532
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.100
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd

533
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.330
as I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me

534
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.170
Cry lost, and so good night!

535
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.000
On, good Camillo.

536
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.930
I am appointed him to murder you.

537
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:47.370
By whom?

538
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.070
By the king.

539
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.070
For what?

540
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.730
He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,

541
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.600
As he had seen't or been an instrument

542
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.770
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen

543
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:57.700
Forbiddenly.

544
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.830
O, then my best blood turn

545
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.470
To an infected jelly and my name

546
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:07.630
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!

547
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.200
Turn then my freshest reputation

548
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.770
to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril

549
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:13.770
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,

550
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.930
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection

551
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.100
That e'er was heard or read!

552
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.970
Swear his thought over

553
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.400
By each particular star in heaven and

554
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.870
By all their influences, you may as well

555
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.130
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon

556
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.400
As or by oath remove or counsel shake

557
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.570
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation

558
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.900
Is piled upon his faith and will continue

559
00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:32.800
The standing of his body.

560
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.670
How should this grow?

561
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.270
I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer

562
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:39.370
to avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.

563
00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.070
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,

564
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.930
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you

565
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:45.300
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!

566
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.430
Your followers I will whisper to the business,

567
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.270
And will by twos and threes at several posterns

568
00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.830
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put

569
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.930
My fortunes to your service, which are here

570
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.570
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;

571
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:00.900
For, by the honour of my parents,

572
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.070
I have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,

573
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.200
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer

574
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.170
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth,

575
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.800
thereon his execution sworn.

576
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.800
I do believe thee:

577
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:19.530
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:

578
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.330
Be pilot to me and thy places shall

579
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.870
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready

580
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.630
and my people did expect my hence departure

581
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:30.100
Two days ago. This jealousy

582
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.270
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,

583
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.530
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,

584
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.730
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive

585
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.830
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever

586
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.500
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must

587
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.300
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:

588
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.470
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort

589
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.600
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing

590
00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.100
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;

591
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.630
I will respect thee as a father

592
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:07.600
if thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

593
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.170
It is in mine authority to command

594
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.970
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness

595
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.900
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

596
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.370
Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,

597
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:36.900
'Tis past enduring.

598
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.400
Come, my gracious lord,

599
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.270
Shall I be your playfellow?

600
00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:42.270
No, I'll none of you.

601
00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.270
You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as

602
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.800
if I were a baby still. I love you better.

603
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.400
And why so, my lord?

604
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.470
Not for because

605
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.900
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,

606
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.870
Become some women best, so that there be not

607
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:00.600
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle

608
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.170
Or a half-moon made with a pen.

609
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:04.530
Who taught you this?

610
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.970
I learnt it out of women's faces.

611
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.600
Pray now what colour are your eyebrows?

612
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.830
Blue, my lord.

613
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.030
Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose

614
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.600
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

615
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.730
Hark ye;

616
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.200
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall

617
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.100
Present our services to a fine new prince

618
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.370
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,

619
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:30.600
If we would have you.

620
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.730
She is spread of late

621
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.630
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

622
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:40.770
What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir,

623
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.330
now I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,

624
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.330
And tell 's a tale.

625
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.330
Merry or sad shall't be?

626
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.330
As merry as you will.

627
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:54.400
A sad tale's best for winter:

628
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.300
I have one of sprites and goblins.

629
00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.400
Let's have that, good sir.

630
00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.730
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best

631
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:06.930
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

632
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.600
There was a man--

633
00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:11.070
Nay, come, sit down; then on.

634
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:17.930
Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;

635
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.930
Yond crickets shall not hear it.

636
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:20.770
Come on, then,

637
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.570
And give't me in mine ear.

638
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.330
Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

639
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.270
Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never

640
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.600
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them

641
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.830
Even to their ships.

642
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.370
How blest am I

643
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.070
In my just censure, in my true opinion!

644
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.770
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed

645
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.000
In being so blest! There may be in the cup

646
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.930
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,

647
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.200
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge

648
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.430
Is not infected: but if one present

649
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.470
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known

650
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:55.970
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,

651
00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:00.330
With violent hefts. I have drunk,

652
00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:01.900
and seen the spider.

653
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.630
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:

654
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:08.130
There is a plot against my life, my crown;

655
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.570
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain

656
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:16.100
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:

657
00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.430
He has discover'd my design, and I

658
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.030
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick

659
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.930
For them to play at will.

660
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.930
How came the posterns So easily open?

661
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.330
By his great authority;

662
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.970
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so

663
00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.900
On your command.

664
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.330
I know't too well.

665
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.830
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:

666
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.600
Though he does bear some signs of me,

667
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.330
yet you have too much blood in him.

668
00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.770
What is this? sport?

669
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.430
Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;

670
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.170
Away with him! and let her sport herself

671
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.400
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes

672
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.070
Has made thee swell thus.

673
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.830
But I'ld say he had not,

674
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.670
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,

675
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:01.930
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

676
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.970
You, my lords,

677
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.530
Look on her, mark her well; be but about

678
00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.400
To say 'she is a goodly lady,'

679
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.230
and the justice of your bearts will thereto add

680
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:13.300
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'

681
00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.730
Praise her but for this her without-door form,

682
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.900
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight

683
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.400
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands

684
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.330
That calumny doth use--O, I am out--

685
00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.730
That mercy does, for calumny will sear

686
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.600
Virtue itself:

687
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.430
these shrugs, these hums and ha's,

688
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.330
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between

689
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.400
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,

690
00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.800
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,

691
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.200
She's an adulteress.

692
00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.870
Should a villain say so,

693
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.670
The most replenish'd villain in the world,

694
00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.700
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,

695
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.300
Do but mistake.

696
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.800
You have mistook, my lady,

697
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.730
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!

698
00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.000
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,

699
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.530
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,

700
00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:08.670
Should a like language use to all degrees

701
00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:10.200
And mannerly distinguishment leave out

702
00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.600
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said

703
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.930
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:

704
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.230
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is

705
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.430
A federary with her, and one that knows

706
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.170
What she should shame to know herself

707
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.330
But with her most vile principal, that she's

708
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.230
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those

709
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.870
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy

710
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.630
To this their late escape.

711
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.100
No, by my life.

712
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:40.330
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,

713
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.200
When you shall come to clearer knowledge,

714
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.270
that You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,

715
00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.330
You scarce can right me throughly then to say

716
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.570
You did mistake.

717
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:51.730
No; if I mistake

718
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.870
In those foundations which I build upon,

719
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.830
The centre is not big enough to bear

720
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.600
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!

721
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.870
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty

722
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.370
But that he speaks.

723
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.370
There's some ill planet reigns:

724
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.330
I must be patient till the heavens look

725
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.170
With an aspect more favourable.

726
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.000
Good my lords,

727
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.970
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex

728
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:24.870
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew

729
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:28.300
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have

730
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:31.230
That honourable grief lodged here which burns

731
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:35.300
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,

732
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.570
With thoughts so qualified as your charities

733
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.900
Shall best instruct you, measure me;

734
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.500
and so the king's will be perform'd!

735
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.670
Shall I be heard?

736
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.800
Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,

737
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.530
My women may be with me; for you see

738
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:58.430
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;

739
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.700
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress

740
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.600
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears

741
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.670
As I come out: this action I now go on

742
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:15.400
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:

743
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.430
I never wish'd to see you sorry;

744
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.430
now I trust I shall.

745
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.000
My women, come; you have leave.

746
00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:37.370
Go, do our bidding; hence!

747
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.530
Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

748
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.570
Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice

749
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:52.530
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,

750
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.600
Yourself, your queen, your son.

751
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:55.570
For her, my lord,

752
00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.070
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,

753
00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:00.270
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless

754
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.870
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,

755
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.600
In this which you accuse her.

756
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.530
If it prove she's otherwise,

757
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:09.630
I'll keep my stables

758
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.200
where I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;

759
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.770
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;

760
00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.600
For every inch of woman in the world,

761
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.830
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

762
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.170
Hold your peaces.

763
00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:22.770
Good my lord,--

764
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.000
It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:

765
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.330
You are abused and by some putter-on

766
00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.470
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,

767
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:35.630
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,

768
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.730
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven

769
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:43.400
The second and the third, nine, and some five;

770
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.170
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:

771
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.230
by mine honour,

772
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.830
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,

773
00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.600
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;

774
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.300
And I had rather glib myself than they

775
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:54.800
Should not produce fair issue.

776
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.130
Cease; no more.

777
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.270
You smell this business with a sense as cold

778
00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:04.470
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't

779
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:08.430
As you feel doing thus; and see withal

780
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.600
The instruments that feel.

781
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.870
If it be so,

782
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.630
We need no grave to bury honesty:

783
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.800
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten

784
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.400
Of the whole dungy earth.

785
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.070
What! lack I credit?

786
00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.370
I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,

787
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.300
Upon this ground; and more it would content me

788
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.200
To have her honour true than your suspicion,

789
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.430
Be blamed for't how you might.

790
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.900
Why, what need we

791
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:38.670
Commune with you of this, but rather follow

792
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.530
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative

793
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.770
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness

794
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.370
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied

795
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:49.930
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not

796
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.170
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves

797
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.830
We need no more of your advice: the matter,

798
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:58.500
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all

799
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.730
Properly ours.

800
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.830
And I wish, my liege,

801
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.200
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,

802
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.870
Without more overture.

803
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:07.800
How could that be?

804
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.430
Either thou art most ignorant by age,

805
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.830
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,

806
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.300
Added to their familiarity,

807
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.500
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,

808
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.530
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation

809
00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.730
But only seeing, all other circumstances

810
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:26.900
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:

811
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.600
Yet, for a greater confirmation,

812
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.100
For in an act of this importance 'twere

813
00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:36.170
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post

814
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.800
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,

815
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.830
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know

816
00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:43.630
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle

817
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.730
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,

818
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:51.500
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

819
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.030
Well done, my lord.

820
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.730
Though I am satisfied and need no more

821
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.600
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle

822
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.700
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he

823
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.600
Whose ignorant credulity will not

824
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.770
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good

825
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.570
From our free person she should be confined,

826
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.330
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence

827
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:18.900
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;

828
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.570
We are to speak in public; for this business

829
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:23.200
Will raise us all.

830
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.300
To laughter, as I take it,

831
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.300
If the good truth were known.

832
00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.270
The keeper of the prison, call to him;

833
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.770
let him have knowledge who I am.

834
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.030
Good lady,

835
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.370
No court in Europe is too good for thee;

836
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:44.770
What dost thou then in prison?

837
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:46.330
Now, good sir,

838
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:47.870
You know me, do you not?

839
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:48.570
For a worthy lady

840
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.870
And one whom much I honour.

841
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:50.470
Pray you then,

842
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.900
Conduct me to the queen.

843
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.330
I may not, madam:

844
00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:55.400
To the contrary I have express commandment.

845
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.330
Here's ado,

846
00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.470
To lock up honesty and honour

847
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:59.870
from the access of gentle visitors!

848
00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:00.770
Is't lawful, pray you,

849
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:05.470
To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

850
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.800
So please you, madam,

851
00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.200
To put apart these your attendants,

852
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.900
I shall bring Emilia forth.

853
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.270
I pray now, call her.

854
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.430
Withdraw yourselves.

855
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.530
And, madam,

856
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.770
I must be present at your conference.

857
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.600
Well, be't so, prithee.

858
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.830
Here's such ado to make no stain a stain

859
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.800
As passes colouring.

860
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:29.730
Dear gentlewoman,

861
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.370
How fares our gracious lady?

862
00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:33.030
As well as one so great and so forlorn

863
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.800
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,

864
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.930
Which never tender lady hath born greater,

865
00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.170
She is something before her time deliver'd.

866
00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.030
A boy?

867
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:42.570
A daughter, and a goodly babe,

868
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.870
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives

869
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.300
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,

870
00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:48.730
I am innocent as you.'

871
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:49.970
I dare be sworn

872
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.000
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,

873
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.270
beshrew them!

874
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.800
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office

875
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.370
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:

876
00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:01.030
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister

877
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.300
And never to my red-look'd anger be

878
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:05.070
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,

879
00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:07.470
Commend my best obedience to the queen:

880
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.600
If she dares trust me with her little babe,

881
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.300
I'll show't the king and undertake to be

882
00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.270
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know

883
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.730
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:

884
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.700
The silence often of pure innocence

885
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.730
Persuades when speaking fails.

886
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.730
Most worthy madam,

887
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.830
Your honour and your goodness is so evident

888
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:26.470
That your free undertaking cannot miss

889
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.770
A thriving issue: there is no lady living

890
00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.630
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship

891
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:33.430
To visit the next room, I'll presently

892
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.870
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;

893
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.330
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,

894
00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:40.370
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,

895
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:41.830
Lest she should be denied.

896
00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:42.870
Tell her, Emilia.

897
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.670
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't

898
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.830
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted

899
00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.030
I shall do good.

900
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.130
Now be you blest for it!

901
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:51.300
I'll to the queen: please you,

902
00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.300
come something nearer.

903
00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.400
Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,

904
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.700
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,

905
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.800
Having no warrant.

906
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.570
You need not fear it, sir:

907
00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:03.800
This child was prisoner to the womb and is

908
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.000
By law and process of great nature thence

909
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.100
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to

910
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:09.670
The anger of the king nor guilty of,

911
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:12.670
If any be, the trespass of the queen.

912
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.370
I do believe it.

913
00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:17.630
Do not you fear: upon mine honour,

914
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.570
I will stand betwixt you and danger.

915
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.330
Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness

916
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.200
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If

917
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.070
The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,

918
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.530
She the adulteress; for the harlot king

919
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.830
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank

920
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:52.030
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she

921
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:56.130
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,

922
00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:59.870
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest

923
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:03.770
Might come to me again. Who's there?

924
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.930
My lord?

925
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.330
How does the boy?

926
00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:08.870
He took good rest to-night;

927
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.900
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

928
00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.130
To see his nobleness!

929
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.270
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,

930
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.830
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,

931
00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:19.400
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,

932
00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.870
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,

933
00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:25.130
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,

934
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.800
See how he fares.

935
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.170
Fie, fie! no thought of him:

936
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.770
The thought of my revenges that way

937
00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:39.130
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,

938
00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.670
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be

939
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:46.500
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,

940
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.330
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes

941
00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.570
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:

942
00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:56.130
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor

943
00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.430
Shall she within my power.

944
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.600
You must not enter.

945
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.100
Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:

946
00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.470
Fear you his tyrannous passion

947
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.130
more, alas, than the queen's life?

948
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:06.530
a gracious innocent soul,

949
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:08.230
More free than he is jealous.

950
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.030
That's enough.

951
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.570
Madam, he hath not slept tonight;

952
00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:11.870
commanded none should come at him.

953
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:13.470
Not so hot, good sir:

954
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.000
I come to bring him sleep.

955
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:15.770
'Tis such as you,

956
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:17.370
That creep like shadows by him

957
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:19.530
and do sigh at each his needless heavings,

958
00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.170
such as you nourish the cause of his awaking:

959
00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.400
I do come with words as medicinal as true,

960
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.500
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour

961
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.100
That presses him from sleep.

962
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.470
What noise there, ho?

963
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.670
No noise, my lord; but needful conference

964
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.400
About some gossips for your highness.

965
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.570
How!

966
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.400
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,

967
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.970
I charged thee that she should not come about me:

968
00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:40.900
I knew she would.

969
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.330
I told her so, my lord,

970
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.030
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,

971
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.670
She should not visit you.

972
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.770
What, canst not rule her?

973
00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.930
From all dishonesty he can: in this,

974
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:51.600
Unless he take the course that you have done,

975
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.930
Commit me for committing honour,

976
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:53.630
trust it,

977
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.330
He shall not rule me.

978
00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.030
La you now, you hear:

979
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.030
When she will take the rein I let her run;

980
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.670
But she'll not stumble.

981
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.230
Good my liege, I come;

982
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:05.670
And, I beseech you, hear me,

983
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.130
who profess myself your loyal servant, your physician,

984
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.070
Your most obedient counsellor,

985
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:12.430
yet that dare less appear so in comforting your evils,

986
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.300
Than such as most seem yours:

987
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.070
I say, I come

988
00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:17.230
From your good queen.

989
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.000
Good queen!

990
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Good queen, my lord,

991
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.630
Good queen; I say good queen;

992
00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:23.130
And would by combat make her good,

993
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.830
so were I a man, the worst about you.

994
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:25.800
Force her hence.

995
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.230
Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes

996
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.830
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;

997
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.970
But first I'll do my errand.

998
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.270
The good queen,

999
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:48.900
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;

1000
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.300
Here 'tis;

1001
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.670
commends it to your blessing.

1002
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.670
Out!

1003
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.370
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:

1004
00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.270
A most intelligencing bawd!

1005
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.030
Not so:

1006
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:11.370
I am as ignorant in that as you

1007
00:46:11.370 --> 00:46:13.070
In so entitling me, and no less honest

1008
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:13.970
Than you are mad;

1009
00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.070
which is enough, I'll warrant,

1010
00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.700
As this world goes, to pass for honest.

1011
00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.130
Traitors!

1012
00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.030
Will you not push her out?

1013
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.630
Give her the bastard. Thou dotard!

1014
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:26.130
thou art woman-tired, unroosted thy dame Partlet here.

1015
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.170
Take up the bastard;

1016
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.430
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

1017
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:30.830
For ever unvenerable be thy hands,

1018
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:32.730
if thou takest up the princess by that forced baseness

1019
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:33.970
Which he has put upon't!

1020
00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:34.870
He dreads his wife.

1021
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:35.830
So I would you did;

1022
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:36.970
then 'twere past all doubt,

1023
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.500
you'ld call your children yours.

1024
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.100
A nest of traitors!

1025
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.930
I am none, by this good light.

1026
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.470
Nor I, nor any but one that's here,

1027
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.770
and that's himself, for he

1028
00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.130
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,

1029
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.800
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,

1030
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.630
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;

1031
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:52.600
and will not--

1032
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.700
For, as the case now stands,

1033
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:54.630
it is a curse

1034
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.430
He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove

1035
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.600
The root of his opinion, which is rotten

1036
00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.500
As ever oak or stone was sound.

1037
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.570
A callat

1038
00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.200
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband

1039
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.970
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;

1040
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.600
It is the issue of Polixenes:

1041
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.970
Hence with it, and together with the dam

1042
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.330
Commit them to the fire!

1043
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.800
It is yours;

1044
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.370
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,

1045
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.770
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,

1046
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:24.200
Although the print be little,

1047
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.170
the whole matter and copy of the father,

1048
00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.770
eye, nose, lip,

1049
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.670
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,

1050
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.630
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,

1051
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.070
His smiles,

1052
00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.670
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:

1053
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:39.070
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it

1054
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.270
So like to him

1055
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.430
that got it, if thou hast the ordering of the mind too,

1056
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:43.400
'mongst all colours

1057
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,

1058
00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.870
Her children not her husband's!

1059
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.370
A gross hag

1060
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.200
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,

1061
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.670
That wilt not stay her tongue.

1062
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:53.800
Hang all the husbands

1063
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.570
That cannot do that feat,

1064
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.830
you'll leave yourself hardly one subject.

1065
00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.700
Once more, take her hence.

1066
00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.530
A most unworthy and unnatural lord

1067
00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:02.530
Can do no more.

1068
00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.470
I'll ha' thee burnt.

1069
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.500
I care not:

1070
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.000
It is an heretic that makes the fire,

1071
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.570
Not she which burns in't.

1072
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.300
I'll not call you tyrant;

1073
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.370
But this most cruel usage of your queen,

1074
00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.330
Not able to produce more accusation

1075
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.170
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours

1076
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.330
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,

1077
00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.900
Yea, scandalous to the world.

1078
00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.200
On your allegiance,

1079
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.170
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,

1080
00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:28.470
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,

1081
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.030
If she did know me one. Away with her!

1082
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.700
I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.

1083
00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:39.330
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:

1084
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:40.370
Jove send her

1085
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:43.330
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?

1086
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.770
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,

1087
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:49.370
Will never do him good, not one of you.

1088
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:59.300
So, so: farewell; we are gone.

1089
00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:11.800
Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.

1090
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:15.530
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast

1091
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.800
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence

1092
00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.370
And see it instantly consumed with fire;

1093
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.170
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:

1094
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:25.830
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,

1095
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.270
And by good testimony,

1096
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:30.330
or I'll seize thy life, with what thou else call'st thine.

1097
00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:33.200
If thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath,

1098
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.730
say so;

1099
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.230
The bastard brains with these my proper hands

1100
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:40.200
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;

1101
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.970
For thou set'st on thy wife.

1102
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.430
I did not, sir:

1103
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.670
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,

1104
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:48.070
Can clear me in't.

1105
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:49.400
We can: my royal liege,

1106
00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.800
He is not guilty of her coming hither.

1107
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.030
You're liars all.

1108
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.270
Beseech your highness, give us better credit:

1109
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.900
We have always truly served you, and beseech

1110
00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:02.030
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,

1111
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.800
As recompense of our dear services

1112
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.000
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,

1113
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.330
Which being so horrible, so bloody,

1114
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:16.800
must lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

1115
00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:25.400
I am a feather for each wind that blows:

1116
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.030
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel

1117
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:31.500
And call me father? better burn it now

1118
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:38.730
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.

1119
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:43.630
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;

1120
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.030
You that have been so tenderly officious

1121
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.700
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,

1122
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.900
To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,

1123
00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.130
So sure as this beard's grey,

1124
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:53.870
--what will you adventure

1125
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.230
To save this brat's life?

1126
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.530
Any thing, my lord,

1127
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:59.070
That my ability may undergo

1128
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.730
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:

1129
00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.700
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left

1130
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:07.870
To save the innocent: any thing possible.

1131
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:14.300
It shall be possible. Swear by this sword

1132
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.270
Thou wilt perform my bidding.

1133
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.730
I will, my lord.

1134
00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.400
Mark and perform it, see'st thou!

1135
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.670
for the fail of any point in't

1136
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:25.500
shall not only be Ddeath to thyself

1137
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.770
but to thy lewd-tongued wife,

1138
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:32.000
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,

1139
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.400
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry

1140
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.270
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it

1141
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.100
To some remote and desert place quite out

1142
00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:41.230
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,

1143
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.330
Without more mercy, to its own protection

1144
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:47.130
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune

1145
00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:49.930
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,

1146
00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.700
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,

1147
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.270
That thou commend it strangely to some place

1148
00:51:55.270 --> 00:52:00.570
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

1149
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:03.630
I swear to do this,

1150
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:09.770
though a present death had been more merciful.

1151
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.770
Come on, poor babe:

1152
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:26.530
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens

1153
00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:30.700
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say

1154
00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.170
Casting their savageness aside have done

1155
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.170
Like offices of pity.

1156
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:40.000
Sir, be prosperous

1157
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.100
In more than this deed does require!

1158
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.700
And blessing against this cruelty fight on thy side,

1159
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.400
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

1160
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.600
No, I'll not rear

1161
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.870
Another's issue.

1162
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:03.900
Please your highness,

1163
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.300
posts from those you sent to the oracle

1164
00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:06.570
are come an hour since:

1165
00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:07.770
Cleomenes and Dion,

1166
00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.270
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,

1167
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:10.430
Hasting to the court.

1168
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:12.470
So please you, sir, their speed

1169
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:14.100
Hath been beyond account.

1170
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.630
Twenty-three days they have been absent:

1171
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.270
'tis good speed;

1172
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:18.400
foretells the great Apollo

1173
00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.800
suddenly will have the truth of this appear.

1174
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.730
Prepare you, lords; Summon a session,

1175
00:53:23.730 --> 00:53:26.900
that we may arraign our most disloyal lady,

1176
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:29.070
for, as she hath been publicly accused,

1177
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.270
so shall she have a just and open trial.

1178
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.070
While she lives

1179
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.370
My heart will be a burthen to me.

1180
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:42.400
Leave me, and think upon my bidding.

1181
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.270
The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,

1182
00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.700
Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing

1183
00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:03.730
The common praise it bears.

1184
00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:04.730
I shall report,

1185
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.070
For most it caught me, the celestial habits,

1186
00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.430
Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence

1187
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:13.070
Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!

1188
00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:14.930
How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly

1189
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:15.930
It was i' the offering!

1190
00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:17.170
But of all, the burst

1191
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.670
And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,

1192
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:22.600
Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.

1193
00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.900
That I was nothing.

1194
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:27.100
If the event o' the journey

1195
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:30.800
Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--

1196
00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.070
As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,

1197
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:35.600
The time is worth the use on't.

1198
00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:37.900
Great Apollo turn all to the best!

1199
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.000
These proclamations, so forcing faults upon Hermione,

1200
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.100
I little like.

1201
00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.170
The violent carriage of it

1202
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.730
Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,

1203
00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.700
Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,

1204
00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.700
Shall the contents discover, something rare

1205
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:56.000
Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!

1206
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.530
And gracious be the issue!

1207
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:10.730
(hammering sound)

1208
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:18.570
This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,

1209
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.370
Even pushes 'gainst our heart:

1210
00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.670
the party tried , The daughter of a king, our wife,

1211
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:28.600
and one of us too much beloved.

1212
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.770
Let us be clear'd of being tyrannous,

1213
00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:33.570
since we so openly proceed in justice,

1214
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.500
which shall have due course,

1215
00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.830
Even to the guilt or the purgation.

1216
00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:41.530
Produce the prisoner.

1217
00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:44.100
It is his highness' pleasure that the queen

1218
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.730
Appear in person here in court. Silence!

1219
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.770
Read the indictment.

1220
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:21.070
Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, king of Sicilia,

1221
00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.830
thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason,

1222
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:25.570
in committing adultery with Polixenes,

1223
00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:27.030
king of Bohemia,

1224
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:28.930
and conspiring with Camillo

1225
00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:30.400
to take away the life of our sovereign

1226
00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.970
lord the king, thy royal husband:

1227
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.230
the pretence whereof being

1228
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.670
by circumstances partly laid open,

1229
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.130
thou, Hermione,

1230
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:41.100
contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject,

1231
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.500
didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety,

1232
00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.270
to fly away by night.

1233
00:56:59.270 --> 00:57:02.000
Since what I am to say must be but that

1234
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.570
Which contradicts my accusation

1235
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:06.600
and the testimony on my part no other

1236
00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.500
But what comes from myself,

1237
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:09.600
it shall scarce boot me

1238
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.530
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity

1239
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.200
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,

1240
00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:21.100
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine

1241
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:24.170
Behold our human actions, as they do,

1242
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.400
I doubt not then but innocence shall make

1243
00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.630
False accusation blush and tyranny

1244
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:32.770
Tremble at patience.

1245
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:34.630
You, my lord, best know,

1246
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:40.400
Who least will seem to do so, my past life

1247
00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.570
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,

1248
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:46.670
As I am now unhappy;

1249
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:48.700
which is more than history can pattern,

1250
00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:53.300
though devised and play'd to take spectators.

1251
00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:56.730
For behold me a fellow of the royal bed, which owe

1252
00:57:56.730 --> 00:58:00.930
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,

1253
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:04.400
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing

1254
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.800
To prate and talk for life and honour

1255
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:11.570
'fore who please to come and hear.

1256
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:15.130
For life, I prize it as I weigh grief,

1257
00:58:15.130 --> 00:58:17.630
which I would spare:

1258
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:19.070
for honour,

1259
00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.230
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,

1260
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:25.330
And only that I stand for.

1261
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:28.430
I appeal to your own conscience, sir,

1262
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:30.600
before Polixenes came to your court,

1263
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.870
how I was in your grace,

1264
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.900
How merited to be so;

1265
00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.800
since he came,

1266
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.930
With what encounter so uncurrent

1267
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:43.530
I have strain'd to appear thus:

1268
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:45.870
if one jot beyond the bound of honour,

1269
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:47.570
or in act or will

1270
00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.830
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts

1271
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.930
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin

1272
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.900
Cry fie upon my grave!

1273
00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:54.930
I ne'er heard yet

1274
00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.630
That any of these bolder vices wanted

1275
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.100
Less impudence to gainsay what they did

1276
00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.930
Than to perform it first.

1277
00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:02.630
That's true enough;

1278
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.730
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

1279
00:59:04.730 --> 00:59:06.530
You will not own it.

1280
00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:07.930
More than mistress of

1281
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:09.930
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not

1282
00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:13.670
At all acknowledge.

1283
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:14.670
For Polixenes,

1284
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:16.500
With whom I am accused, I do confess

1285
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:20.270
I loved him as in honour he required,

1286
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.930
With such a kind of love as might become

1287
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:25.370
A lady like me, with a love even such,

1288
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:28.870
So and no other, as yourself commanded:

1289
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:30.800
Which not to have done I think had been in me

1290
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.930
Both disobedience and ingratitude

1291
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:35.530
To you and toward your friend,

1292
00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.670
whose love had spoke,

1293
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:39.330
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely

1294
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.330
That it was yours.

1295
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.730
Now, for conspiracy,

1296
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:50.200
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd

1297
00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.300
For me to try how: all I know of it

1298
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.970
Is that Camillo was an honest man;

1299
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:58.330
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,

1300
00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.930
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

1301
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.770
You knew of his departure, as you know

1302
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.270
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

1303
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.270
Sir,

1304
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:15.900
You speak a language that I understand not:

1305
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.700
My life stands in the level of your dreams,

1306
01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.830
Which I'll lay down.

1307
01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.070
Your actions are my dreams;

1308
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:27.900
You had a bastard by Polixenes,

1309
01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:32.230
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--

1310
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:35.170
Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:

1311
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:38.070
Which to deny concerns more than avails;

1312
01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:41.300
for as thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,

1313
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.330
No father owning it,--which is, indeed,

1314
01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:45.630
More criminal in thee than it,

1315
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.430
so thou Shalt feel our justice,

1316
01:00:48.430 --> 01:00:52.870
in whose easiest passage, look for no less than death.

1317
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:58.230
Sir, spare your threats

1318
01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:02.300
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.

1319
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.930
To me can life be no commodity:

1320
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:07.500
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,

1321
01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.900
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,

1322
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.470
But know not how it went.

1323
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:18.470
My second joy and first-fruits of my body,

1324
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:19.300
from his presence

1325
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.030
I am barr'd, like one infectious.

1326
01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:24.130
My third comfort starr'd most unluckily,

1327
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:25.670
is from my breast,

1328
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:27.970
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,

1329
01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:30.700
Haled out to murder:

1330
01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:31.870
myself on every post

1331
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.300
Proclaimed a strumpet:

1332
01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.030
with immodest hatred the child-bed privilege denied,

1333
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:42.000
which 'longs to women of all fashion;

1334
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.530
lastly, hurried here to this place, i' the open air,

1335
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:48.570
before I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,

1336
01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:51.230
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,

1337
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:54.000
That I should fear to die?

1338
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.300
Therefore proceed.

1339
01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:05.270
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,

1340
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:08.470
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,

1341
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:12.500
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd

1342
01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:14.170
Upon surmises,

1343
01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:18.770
all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake,

1344
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:22.070
I tell you 'Tis rigor and not law.

1345
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:22.770
Your honours all,

1346
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:25.530
I do refer me to the oracle:

1347
01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:28.400
Apollo be my judge!

1348
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.370
This your request

1349
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.400
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,

1350
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.630
And in Apollos name, his oracle.

1351
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.930
The Emperor of Russia was my father:

1352
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.570
O that he were alive,

1353
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.530
and here beholding his daughter's trial!

1354
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:55.670
that he did but see the flatness of my misery,

1355
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.330
yet with eyes of pity, not revenge!

1356
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:17.070
You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,

1357
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:18.300
That you, Cleomenes and Dion,

1358
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.070
have been both at Delphos,

1359
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:23.330
and from thence have brought the seal'd-up oracle,

1360
01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:25.900
by the hand deliver'd of great Apollo's priest;

1361
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.870
and that, since then,

1362
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.870
You have not dared to break the holy seal

1363
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:30.830
Nor read the secrets in't.

1364
01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:31.970
All this we swear.

1365
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.870
Break off the seals, and read!

1366
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:47.770
Hermione is chaste;

1367
01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:51.400
Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject;

1368
01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.200
Leontes a jealous tyrant;

1369
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.400
his innocent babe truly begotten;

1370
01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.670
and the king shall live without an heir,

1371
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.400
if that which is lost be not found.

1372
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.600
Now blessed be the great Apollo!

1373
01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.130
Praised!

1374
01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.700
Hast thou read truth?

1375
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.170
Ay, my lord;

1376
01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:09.570
even so as it is here set down.

1377
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.770
There is no truth at all i' the oracle:

1378
01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:19.070
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

1379
01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:20.930
My lord the king, the king!

1380
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.070
What is the business?

1381
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:25.100
O sir, I shall be hated to report it!

1382
01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.170
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear

1383
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:30.500
Of the queen's speed, is gone.

1384
01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:34.230
How! gone!

1385
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.730
Is dead.

1386
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.870
Apollo's angry;

1387
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:47.700
and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice.

1388
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.570
How now there!

1389
01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:56.130
This news is mortal to the queen:

1390
01:04:56.130 --> 01:04:59.770
look down and see what death is doing.

1391
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:10.000
Take her hence:

1392
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.530
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:

1393
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.170
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:

1394
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:25.870
Beseech you,

1395
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:29.300
tenderly apply to her some remedies for life.

1396
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:40.870
Apollo, pardon my great profaneness

1397
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:43.000
gainst thine oracle!

1398
01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.570
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,

1399
01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:52.530
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,

1400
01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.430
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;

1401
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:56.970
For, being transported by my jealousies

1402
01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:59.900
To bloody thoughts and to revenge,

1403
01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:02.800
I chose Camillo for the minister to poison

1404
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.830
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,

1405
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.730
But that the good mind of Camillo

1406
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:09.430
tardied my swift command,

1407
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:10.830
though I with death and with reward

1408
01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:12.500
did threaten and encourage him,

1409
01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.430
Not doing 't and being done:

1410
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:19.600
he, most humane and fill'd with honour,

1411
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.170
to my kingly guest Unclasp'd my practise,

1412
01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:24.400
quit his fortunes here,

1413
01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400
Which you knew great, and to the hazard

1414
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.130
Of all encertainties himself commended,

1415
01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:33.400
No richer than his honour:

1416
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.830
how he glisters thorough my rust!

1417
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:42.730
and how his pity does my deeds make the blacker!

1418
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:46.270
Woe the while!

1419
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:50.200
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,

1420
01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.570
Break too.

1421
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:54.530
What fit is this, good lady?

1422
01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:57.770
What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?

1423
01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:00.200
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?

1424
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:01.200
In leads or oils?

1425
01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.100
what old or newer torture m ust I receive,

1426
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:06.570
whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst?

1427
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:09.170
Thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies,

1428
01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:12.030
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle

1429
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.830
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done

1430
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.030
And then run mad indeed, stark mad!

1431
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:19.230
for all thy by-gone fooleries

1432
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:20.770
were but spices of it.

1433
01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:23.000
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;

1434
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.030
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant

1435
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.570
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,

1436
01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.630
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,

1437
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:32.700
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,

1438
01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.770
More monstrous standing by: whereof

1439
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:37.930
I reckon the casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter

1440
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:40.370
To be or none or little; though a devil

1441
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:43.030
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:

1442
01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.430
Nor is't directly laid to thee,

1443
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.970
the death of the young prince,

1444
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:47.170
whose honourable thoughts,

1445
01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:50.130
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart

1446
01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:52.870
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire

1447
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:56.270
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,

1448
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:59.600
Laid to thy answer: but the last,

1449
01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:02.700
--O lords, When I have said,

1450
01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:11.270
cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,

1451
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:15.670
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,

1452
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:19.330
and vengeance for't not dropp'd down yet.

1453
01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:21.070
The higher powers forbid!

1454
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:23.400
I say she's dead; I'll swear't.

1455
01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:25.670
If word nor oath prevail not, go and see:

1456
01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:28.230
if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,

1457
01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:30.100
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you

1458
01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.430
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!

1459
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:36.530
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier

1460
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:40.200
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee

1461
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.930
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees

1462
01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:47.670
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,

1463
01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:50.630
Upon a barren mountain and still winter

1464
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.970
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods

1465
01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:57.630
To look that way thou wert.

1466
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:59.600
Go on, go on

1467
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.900
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved

1468
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:05.430
All tongues to talk their bitterest.

1469
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:07.300
Say no more:

1470
01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.700
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault

1471
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.800
I' the boldness of your speech.

1472
01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.800
I am sorry for't:

1473
01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:17.670
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,

1474
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:23.130
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much

1475
01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:27.200
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd

1476
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:31.030
To the noble heart.

1477
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:36.170
What's gone and what's past help

1478
01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:40.000
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction

1479
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.530
At my petition; I beseech you, rather

1480
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:44.130
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you

1481
01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:46.600
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege

1482
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.970
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:

1483
01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:57.230
The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--

1484
01:09:57.230 --> 01:10:01.970
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;

1485
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:04.170
I'll not remember you of my own lord,

1486
01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:08.430
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,

1487
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:11.200
And I'll say nothing.

1488
01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:18.830
Thou didst speak but well when most the truth;

1489
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:23.830
which I receive much better Tthan to be pitied of thee.

1490
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:29.570
Prithee, bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son:

1491
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:32.170
One grave shall be for both:

1492
01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:34.630
upon them shall the causes of their death appear,

1493
01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:38.730
unto our shame perpetual.

1494
01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:41.770
Once a day I'll visit the chapel where they lie,

1495
01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:46.030
and tears shed there shall be my recreation:

1496
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:49.530
so long as nature will bear up with this exercise,

1497
01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:53.900
so long I daily vow to use it.

1498
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.770
Come and lead me unto these sorrows.

1499
01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:44.100
Thou art perfect then,

1500
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.900
our ship hath touch'd upon the deserts of Bohemia?

1501
01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.230
Ay, my lord: and fear

1502
01:11:48.230 --> 01:11:50.100
We have landed in ill time:

1503
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.400
the skies look grimly and threaten present blusters.

1504
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.900
In my conscience,

1505
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.930
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry

1506
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:58.130
And frown upon 's.

1507
01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:00.600
Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;

1508
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.530
Look to thy bark:

1509
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:03.100
I'll not be long before I call upon thee.

1510
01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:03.900
Make your best haste,

1511
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:05.700
and go not too far i' the land:

1512
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:07.000
'tis like to be loud weather;

1513
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.800
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures

1514
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.700
Of prey that keep upon't.

1515
01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:11.630
Go thou away:

1516
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:13.670
I'll follow instantly.

1517
01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:14.730
I am glad at heart

1518
01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:16.870
To be so rid o' the business.

1519
01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.300
Come, poor babe:

1520
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:56.930
I have heard, but not believed,

1521
01:12:56.930 --> 01:13:00.870
the spirits o' the dead may walk again:

1522
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:03.630
if such thing be,

1523
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.370
thy mother appear'd to me last night,

1524
01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:10.030
for ne'er was dream so like a waking.

1525
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:11.800
To me comes a creature,

1526
01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.770
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;

1527
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:18.470
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,

1528
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:23.070
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,

1529
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:25.130
Like very sanctity,

1530
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:27.070
she did approach my cabin where I lay;

1531
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.870
thrice bow'd before me,

1532
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:31.630
And gasping to begin some speech,

1533
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:37.100
her eyes became two spouts: the fury spent,

1534
01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:41.300
anon did this break-from her:

1535
01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.330
'Good Antigonus,

1536
01:13:43.330 --> 01:13:47.200
Since fate, against thy better disposition,

1537
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.330
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out

1538
01:13:49.330 --> 01:13:53.170
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,

1539
01:13:53.170 --> 01:13:57.200
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,

1540
01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.430
There weep and leave it crying;

1541
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:05.530
and, for the babe os counted lost for ever,

1542
01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:09.300
Perdita, I prithee, call't.

1543
01:14:09.300 --> 01:14:15.700
For this ungentle business put on thee by my lord,

1544
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.570
thou ne'er shalt see thy wife Paulina more.'

1545
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:28.700
And so, with shrieks she melted into air.

1546
01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:33.000
Affrighted much, I did in time collect myself

1547
01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.030
and thought this was so and no slumber.

1548
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:41.100
Dreams are toys:

1549
01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:45.730
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,

1550
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:49.730
I will be squared by this.

1551
01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:52.800
I do believe Hermione hath suffer'd death,

1552
01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.000
and that Apollo would, this being indeed

1553
01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.930
the issue of King Polixenes,

1554
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:00.430
it should here be laid,

1555
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:03.370
Either for life or death, upon the earth

1556
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:13.130
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!

1557
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:28.170
There lie, and there thy character: there these;

1558
01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:33.100
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,

1559
01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:36.870
And still rest thine.

1560
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:40.500
The storm begins; poor wretch,

1561
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.030
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed

1562
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:47.330
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,

1563
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:49.370
But my heart bleeds;

1564
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:53.630
and most accursed am I to be by oath enjoin'd to this.

1565
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.770
Farewell!

1566
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.430
The day frowns more and more:

1567
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:08.600
thou'rt like to have a lullaby too rough:

1568
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:15.430
I never saw the heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!

1569
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:20.830
Well may I get aboard!

1570
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:22.500
This is the chase:

1571
01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.430
I am gone for ever.

1572
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:50.700
I would there were no age

1573
01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:53.500
between ten and three-and-twenty,

1574
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.330
or that youth would sleep out the rest;

1575
01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:57.870
for there is nothing in the between

1576
01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:00.400
but getting wenches with child,

1577
01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.170
wronging the ancientry,

1578
01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:06.870
stealing, fighting--Hark you now!

1579
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:10.030
Would any but these boiled brains of nineteen

1580
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:13.330
and two-and-twenty hunt this weather?

1581
01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:16.830
They have scared away two of my best sheep,

1582
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:21.330
which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master:

1583
01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:22.830
if any where I have them,

1584
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:28.130
'tis by the seaside, browsing of ivy.

1585
01:17:30.130 --> 01:17:35.070
Good luck, an't be thy will what have we here!

1586
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:46.070
Mercy on 's, a barne a very pretty barne!

1587
01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:52.270
A boy or a child, I wonder?

1588
01:17:52.270 --> 01:18:02.730
A pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:

1589
01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:04.100
though I am not bookish,

1590
01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:07.600
yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman  in the 'scape.

1591
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.530
This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work,

1592
01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.200
some behind-door-work:

1593
01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:20.970
they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here.

1594
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:24.370
I'll take it up for pity:

1595
01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:27.500
yet I'll tarry till my son come;

1596
01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.870
he hallooed but even now.

1597
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.970
Hilloa, loa!

1598
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:33.900
What, art so near?

1599
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.470
If thou'lt see a thing to talk on

1600
01:18:35.470 --> 01:18:37.730
when thou art dead and rotten, come hither.

1601
01:18:37.730 --> 01:18:41.830
What ailest thou, man?

1602
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:46.430
I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!

1603
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:47.830
but I am not to say it is a sea,

1604
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:49.700
for it is now the sky:

1605
01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.200
betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkin's point.

1606
01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.400
Why, boy, how is it?

1607
01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.870
I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,

1608
01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:58.570
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the point.

1609
01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.630
O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!

1610
01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:02.670
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em;

1611
01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:04.800
now the ship boring the moon with her main-mast,

1612
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.100
and anon swallowed with yest and froth,

1613
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.670
as you'ld thrust a cork into a hogshead.

1614
01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:10.130
And then for the land-service,

1615
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:12.530
to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone;

1616
01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:13.870
how he cried to me for help

1617
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:16.330
and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman.

1618
01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:17.470
But to make an end of the ship,

1619
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:19.400
to see how the sea flap-dragoned it:

1620
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.970
but, first, how the poor souls roared,

1621
01:19:20.970 --> 01:19:21.870
and the sea mocked them;

1622
01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:23.270
and how the poor gentleman roared

1623
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:24.530
and the bear mocked him,

1624
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:27.370
both roaring louder than the sea or weather.

1625
01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:29.400
Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

1626
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.530
Now, now:

1627
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:32.830
I have not winked since I saw these sights:

1628
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:34.630
the men are not yet cold under water,

1629
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:36.930
nor the bear half dined on the gentleman:

1630
01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:38.570
he's at it now.

1631
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:40.730
Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

1632
01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:42.030
I would you had been by the ship side,

1633
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:43.170
to have helped her:

1634
01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:45.100
there your charity would have lacked footing.

1635
01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:49.630
Heavy matters! heavy matters!

1636
01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:51.000
but look thee here, boy.

1637
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.600
Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things dying,

1638
01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.100
I with things newborn. Here's a sight for thee;

1639
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:05.400
look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's child!

1640
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:12.870
look thee here; take up, take up, boy;

1641
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.570
open't. So, let's see:

1642
01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:18.000
it was told me I should be rich by the fairies.

1643
01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000
This is some changeling: open't. What's within, boy?

1644
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:30.100
You're a made old man:

1645
01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:31.870
if the sins of your youth are forgiven you,

1646
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:33.870
you're well to live.

1647
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:39.700
Gold! all gold!

1648
01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:44.670
This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so:

1649
01:20:44.670 --> 01:20:49.100
up with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.

1650
01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.130
We are lucky, boy;

1651
01:20:51.130 --> 01:20:55.230
and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy.

1652
01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:58.100
Let my sheep go: come, good boy,

1653
01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.830
the next way home.

1654
01:20:59.830 --> 01:21:02.770
Go you the next way with your findings.

1655
01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:05.100
I'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman

1656
01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:08.000
and how much he hath eaten: they are never curst

1657
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.170
but when they are hungry:

1658
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.530
if there be any of him left,

1659
01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:12.430
I'll bury it.

1660
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:14.130
That's a good deed.

1661
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:16.900
If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him

1662
01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:18.930
what he is,

1663
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:20.800
fetch me to the sight of him.

1664
01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:22.130
Marry, will I; and you shall help

1665
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:23.500
to put him i' the ground.

1666
01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:28.470
'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

1667
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:49.270
I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror

1668
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:52.630
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,

1669
01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:55.670
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,

1670
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:59.670
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime

1671
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:02.900
To me or my swift passage, that I slide

1672
01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:05.330
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried

1673
01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:08.600
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power

1674
01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:13.330
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour

1675
01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:17.670
To plant and o'erwhelm custom.

1676
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.900
Let me pass the same I am,

1677
01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.770
ere ancient'st order was

1678
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.800
Or what is now received:

1679
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.370
I witness to the times that brought them in;

1680
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:32.970
so shall I do to the freshest things now reigning

1681
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:37.430
and make stale the glistering of this present,

1682
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:40.300
as my tale now seems to it.

1683
01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:42.930
Your patience this allowing,

1684
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:48.570
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing

1685
01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:52.070
As you had slept between:

1686
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:56.370
Leontes leaving,

1687
01:22:56.370 --> 01:22:59.500
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving

1688
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:04.000
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,

1689
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.600
Gentle spectators,

1690
01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:10.000
that I now may be in fair Bohemia,

1691
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
and remember well,

1692
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.900
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel

1693
01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:17.630
I now name to you; and with speed so pace

1694
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:21.700
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace

1695
01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:26.500
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues

1696
01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:29.970
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news

1697
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:34.130
Be known when 'tis brought forth.

1698
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:36.170
A shepherd's daughter,

1699
01:23:36.170 --> 01:23:40.000
And what to her adheres, which follows after,

1700
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.530
Is the argument of Time.

1701
01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:45.600
Of this allow,

1702
01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.270
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;

1703
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:54.770
If never, yet that Time himself doth say

1704
01:23:54.770 --> 01:24:01.100
He wishes earnestly you never may.

1705
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.270
I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:

1706
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:09.630
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing;

1707
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:10.870
a death to grant this.

1708
01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:15.770
It is fifteen years since I saw my country:

1709
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:17.930
though I have for the most part been aired abroad,

1710
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:22.000
I desire to lay my bones there.

1711
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.730
Besides, the penitent king, my master,

1712
01:24:25.730 --> 01:24:26.830
hath sent for me;

1713
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:29.330
to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay,

1714
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:31.300
or I o'erween to think so,

1715
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.130
which is another spur to my departure.

1716
01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:36.600
As thou lovest me, Camillo,

1717
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:41.170
wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now:

1718
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:45.000
the need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made;

1719
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.970
better not to have had thee than thus to want thee:

1720
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:52.030
thou, having made me businesses

1721
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.930
which none without thee

1722
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:54.400
can sufficiently manage,

1723
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.730
must either stay to execute them thyself

1724
01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:59.470
or take away with thee the very services thou hast done;

1725
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:01.030
Of that fatal country, Sicilia,

1726
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.970
prithee speak no more;

1727
01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:06.500
whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance

1728
01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.670
of that penitent, as thou callest him,

1729
01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:11.230
and reconciled king, my brother;

1730
01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:14.230
whose loss of his most precious queen and children

1731
01:25:14.230 --> 01:25:18.800
are even now to be afresh lamented.

1732
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:27.130
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son?

1733
01:25:27.130 --> 01:25:30.170
Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious,

1734
01:25:30.170 --> 01:25:31.630
than they are in losing them

1735
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:32.800
when they have approved their virtues.

1736
01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.870
Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince.

1737
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.370
What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown:

1738
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:43.030
but I have missingly noted, he is of late much retired

1739
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:45.230
from court and is less frequent

1740
01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:47.270
to his princely exercises

1741
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:49.070
than formerly he hath appeared.

1742
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:50.870
I have considered so much, Camillo,

1743
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:51.930
and with some care;

1744
01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:54.470
so far that I have eyes under my service

1745
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:56.500
which look upon his removedness;

1746
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.200
from whom I have this intelligence,

1747
01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.670
that he is seldom from the house

1748
01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:03.070
of a most homely shepherd;

1749
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:05.830
a man, they say, that from very nothing,

1750
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:07.600
and beyond the imagination of his neighbours,

1751
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.500
is grown into an unspeakable estate.

1752
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:11.900
I have heard, sir, of such a man,

1753
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.630
who hath a daughter of most rare note:

1754
01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:17.330
the report of her is extended more

1755
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:19.430
than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

1756
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:21.500
That's likewise part of my intelligence;

1757
01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:29.130
but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither.

1758
01:26:30.630 --> 01:26:34.700
Thou shalt accompany us to the place; where we will,

1759
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.000
not appearing what we are,

1760

1933
01:34:57.670 --> 01:34:58.670
by some accident,

1934
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:03.200
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!

1935
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.200
How would he look,

1936
01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:08.330
to see his work so noble vilely bound up?

1937
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:11.430
What would he say? Or how should I,

1938
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:12.630
in these my borrow'd flaunts,

1939
01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:14.900
behold the sternness of his presence?

1940
01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:17.370
Apprehend nothing but jollity.

1941
01:35:17.370 --> 01:35:19.730
The gods themselves, Humbling their deities to love,

1942
01:35:19.730 --> 01:35:21.730
have taken the shapes of beasts upon them:

1943
01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:24.200
Jupiter became a bull, and bellow'd;

1944
01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:26.070
the green Neptune a ram, and bleated;

1945
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:28.370
and the fire-robed god, Golden Apollo,

1946
01:35:28.370 --> 01:35:30.230
a poor humble swain,

1947
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.630
As I seem now.

1948
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:34.170
Their transformations were never

1949
01:35:34.170 --> 01:35:35.770
for a piece of beauty rarer,

1950
01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:37.130
Nor in a way so chaste,

1951
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:39.430
since my desires run not before mine honour,

1952
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:41.570
nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith.

1953
01:35:41.570 --> 01:35:43.030
O, but, sir,

1954
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:45.230
Your resolution cannot hold,

1955
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:48.470
when 'tis opposed, as it must be,

1956
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:51.100
by the power of the king:

1957
01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:52.830
One of these two must be necessities,

1958
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:54.470
Which then will speak,

1959
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:56.470
that you must change this purpose,

1960
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:57.770
Or I my life.

1961
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:59.500
Thou dearest Perdita,

1962
01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.000
With these forced thoughts, I prithee,

1963
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.270
darken not the mirth o' the feast.

1964
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:04.370
Or I'll be thine, my fair,

1965
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:06.270
Or not my father's.

1966
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:08.400
For I cannot be mine own, nor any thing to any,

1967
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:12.230
if I be not thine. To this I am most constant,

1968
01:36:12.230 --> 01:36:16.600
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;

1969
01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.700
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing

1970
01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:22.530
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:

1971
01:36:22.530 --> 01:36:23.730
Lift up your countenance,

1972
01:36:23.730 --> 01:36:25.730
as it were the day of celebration of that nuptial

1973
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:27.930
which we two have sworn shall come.

1974
01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:31.630
O lady Fortune, Stand you auspicious!

1975
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.500
See, your guests approach:

1976
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.500
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,

1977
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.270
And let's be red with mirth.

1978
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:45.330
Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived,

1979
01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:48.900
upon this day she was both pantler, butler, cook,

1980
01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:53.570
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;

1981
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:57.100
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,

1982
01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.570
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;

1983
01:36:58.570 --> 01:37:01.400
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire

1984
01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.770
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,

1985
01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:09.030
She would to each one sip. You are retired,

1986
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:11.100
As if you were a feasted one

1987
01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:13.730
and not the hostess of the meeting:

1988
01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:18.530
pray you, bid these unknown friends to's welcome;

1989
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:22.100
for it is a way to make us better friends, more known.

1990
01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:26.430
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself

1991
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:30.770
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,

1992
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:33.800
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,

1993
01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.900
As your good flock shall prosper.

1994
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.930
Sir, welcome:

1995
01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:44.170
It is my father's will

1996
01:37:44.170 --> 01:37:47.300
I should take on me the hostess-ship o' the day.

1997
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.000
You're welcome, sir.

1998
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:52.970
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas.

1999
01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:05.100
Reverend sirs,

2000
01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:07.330
For you there's rosemary and rue;

2001
01:38:07.330 --> 01:38:10.800
these keep seeming and savour all the winter long:

2002
01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:13.300
Grace and remembrance be to you both,

2003
01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:16.030
And welcome to our shearing!

2004
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:20.000
Shepherdess, A fair one are you-

2005
01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.070
-well you fit our ages with flowers of winter.

2006
01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:27.370
Sir, the year growing ancient,

2007
01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:28.600
Not yet on summer's death,

2008
01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.700
nor on the birth of trembling winter,

2009
01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.430
the fairest flowers o' the season

2010
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:34.870
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors

2011
01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:37.800
Which some call nature's bastards:

2012
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.300
of that kind our rustic garden's barren;

2013
01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:43.470
and I care not to get slips of them.

2014
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:44.470
Wherefore, gentle maiden,

2015
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:46.330
Do you neglect them?

2016
01:38:46.330 --> 01:38:47.330
For I have heard it said

2017
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:49.270
There is an art which in their piedness

2018
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:52.170
shares with great creating nature.

2019
01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:53.970
Say there be;

2020
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.870
Yet nature is made better by no mean

2021
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:59.370
But nature makes that mean:

2022
01:38:59.370 --> 01:39:02.030
so, over that art which you say adds to nature,

2023
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:03.870
is an art that nature makes.

2024
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.800
You see, sweet maid,

2025
01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.600
we marry a gentler scion to the wildest stock,

2026
01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.930
And make conceive a bark of baser kind

2027
01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:13.200
By bud of nobler race:

2028
01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.430
this is an art which does mend nature,

2029
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:23.730
change it rather, but the art itself is nature.

2030
01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:25.700
So it is.

2031
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.030
Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,

2032
01:39:28.030 --> 01:39:30.730
And do not call them bastards.

2033
01:39:30.730 --> 01:39:32.530
I'll not put the dibble in earth

2034
01:39:32.530 --> 01:39:35.400
to set one slip of them;

2035
01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:38.400
No more than were I painted

2036
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.030
I would wish this youth should say

2037
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:44.970
'twere well and only therefore desire to breed by me.

2038
01:39:44.970 --> 01:39:46.900
Here's flowers for you;

2039
01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:51.130
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;

2040
01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:53.170
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun

2041
01:39:53.170 --> 01:39:55.830
And with him rises weeping:

2042
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:58.130
these are flowers of middle summer,

2043
01:39:58.130 --> 01:40:01.970
and I think they are given to men of middle age.

2044
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:03.370
You're very welcome.

2045
01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:06.830
I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,

2046
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:09.700
And only live by gazing.

2047
01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:10.770
Out, alas!

2048
01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:13.370
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January

2049
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:16.300
Would blow you through and through.

2050
01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:19.830
Now, my fair'st friend,

2051
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:22.400
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might

2052
01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.770
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,

2053
01:40:26.770 --> 01:40:29.030
That wear upon your virgin branches yet

2054
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:32.770
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,

2055
01:40:32.770 --> 01:40:35.900
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall

2056
01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:38.730
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,

2057
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:40.930
That come before the swallow dares, and take

2058
01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:45.470
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,

2059
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:48.070
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes

2060
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:51.470
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses

2061
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:54.100
That die unmarried, ere they can behold

2062
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:57.000
Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady

2063
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.500
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and

2064
01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:04.770
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,

2065
01:41:04.770 --> 01:41:09.470
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,

2066
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:13.070
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,

2067
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:15.270
To strew him o'er and o'er!

2068
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:16.230
What, like a corse?

2069
01:41:16.230 --> 01:41:19.770
No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;

2070
01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:24.400
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,

2071
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:34.670
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:

2072
01:41:34.670 --> 01:41:36.700
Methinks I play as I have seen them do

2073
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:39.600
In Whitsun pastorals:

2074
01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:42.470
sure this robe of mine does change my disposition.

2075
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:43.630
What you do

2076
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:46.800
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.

2077
01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.830
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,

2078
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:51.070
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,

2079
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:53.000
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,

2080
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.570
To sing them too: when you do dance,

2081
01:41:55.570 --> 01:41:57.170
I wish you a wave o' the sea, that you might

2082
01:41:57.170 --> 01:42:00.530
ever do nothing but that; move still, still so,

2083
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:03.270
And own no other function: each your doing,

2084
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:05.000
So singular in each particular,

2085
01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.930
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,

2086
01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:09.130
That all your acts are queens.

2087
01:42:09.130 --> 01:42:10.870
O Doricles,

2088
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:14.830
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,

2089
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:17.030
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,

2090
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:20.530
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,

2091
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:22.630
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,

2092
01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:24.500
You woo'd me the false way.

2093
01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.470
I think you have as little skill

2094
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:28.130
to fear as I have purpose to put you to't.

2095
01:42:28.130 --> 01:42:30.100
But come; our dance, I pray:

2096
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:33.300
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,

2097
01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:34.730
That never mean to part.

2098
01:42:34.730 --> 01:42:37.300
I'll swear for 'em.

2099
01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.530
This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever

2100
01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:45.330
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems

2101
01:42:45.330 --> 01:42:48.530
But smacks of something greater than herself,

2102
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:50.570
Too noble for this place.

2103
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:51.630
He tells her something

2104
01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:55.470
That makes her blood look out: good sooth,

2105
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:58.100
she is the queen of curds and cream.

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:07.830
marry, garlic, to mend her kissing with!

2109
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:09.630
Now, in good time!

2110

Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this

2114
01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:43.600
Which dances with your daughter?

2115
01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:46.400
They call him Doricles; and boasts himself

2116
01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.470
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it

2117
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:51.000
Upon his own report and I believe it;

2118
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.230
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:

2119
01:44:55.230 --> 01:44:58.570
I think so too; for never gazed the moon

2120
01:44:58.570 --> 01:45:01.430
Upon the water as he'll stand and read

2121
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:05.670
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.

2122
01:45:05.670 --> 01:45:08.130
I think there is not half a kiss to choose

2123
01:45:08.130 --> 01:45:10.300

2124
01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.870

2125
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:15.000

2126
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.970
That should be silent: if young Doricles

2127
01:45:17.970 --> 01:45:20.730
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that

2128
01:45:20.730 --> 01:45:24.000

2129
01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.770
O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door,

2130
01:45:58.770 --> 01:46:00.870
you would never dance again after a tabour and pipe;

2131
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:03.530
no, the bagpipe could not move you:

2132
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:06.300
he sings several tunes faster than you'll tell money;

2133
01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:08.030

2134
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:10.030
and all men's ears grew to his tunes.

2135
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:12.800
He could never come better; he shall come in.

2136
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.230
I love a ballad but even too well,

2137

2138
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:19.800
or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.

2139
01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:22.800
He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes;

2140
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.300

2143
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.270

2144
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:38.530
'jump her and thump her;'

2359
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:44.570
Knows he of this?

2360
01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:47.130
He neither does nor shall.

2361
01:55:47.130 --> 01:55:49.300

2363
01:55:50.570 --> 01:55:52.800
reason my son should choose himself a wife,

2364
01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:55.430

2365
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:57.170
all whose joy is nothing else but fair posterity,

2366
01:55:57.170 --> 01:55:59.530
should hold some counsel in such a business.

2367

O, my heart!

2391
01:56:42.230 --> 01:56:43.870
I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers,

2392
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:46.730
and made more homely than thy state.

2393

For thee, fond boy,

2395
01:56:54.370 --> 01:56:58.100
That thou no more shalt see this knack,

2396
01:56:58.100 --> 01:57:02.070
as never I mean thou shalt,

Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,

2399
01:57:08.600 --> 01:57:15.930
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:

2400
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:22.600
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,

2401
01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.570
Though full of our displeasure,

2402
01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:27.670
yet we free thee from the dead blow of it.

2403
01:57:27.670 --> 01:57:31.430
And you, enchantment.

2404
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:35.100
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,

Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,

Even here undone!

2413
01:58:03.230 --> 01:58:05.530
I was not much afeard;

2414
01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:07.600
for once or twice I was about to speak

2415
01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.370
and tell him plainly,

2416
01:58:09.370 --> 01:58:12.800
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court

2417
01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:14.830
Hides not his visage from our cottage

2418
01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:22.030
but looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?

2419
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:25.570
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,

2420
01:58:25.570 --> 01:58:29.830
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--

2421
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:33.830
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,

2422
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:36.370
But milk my ewes and weep.

2423
01:58:38.530 --> 01:58:41.070
Why, how now, father!

2424
01:58:41.070 --> 01:58:44.000
Speak ere thou diest.

2425
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.200
I cannot speak,

2426
01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:54.600
nor think nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!

2427
01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:57.000
You have undone a man of fourscore three,

2428
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.370
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,

2429
01:58:59.370 --> 01:59:01.530
To die upon the bed my father died,

2430
01:59:01.530 --> 01:59:03.870
To lie close by his honest bones:

2431
01:59:03.870 --> 01:59:07.270
but now some hangman must put on my shroud

2432
01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:11.500
and lay me where no priest shovels in dust.

2433
01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.370
O cursed wretch,

2434
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:15.300
That knew'st this was the prince,

2435
01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:18.470
and wouldst adventure to mingle faith with him!

2436
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:20.570
Undone! undone!

2437
01:59:20.570 --> 01:59:22.630
If I might die within this hour,

2438
01:59:22.630 --> 01:59:26.230
I have lived to die when I desire.

2439
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:29.370
Why look you so upon me?

2440
01:59:29.370 --> 01:59:31.670
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,

2441
01:59:31.670 --> 01:59:34.930
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;

2442
01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:36.400
More straining on for plucking back,

2443
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:38.000
not following my leash unwillingly.

2444
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.370
Gracious my lord,

2445
01:59:39.370 --> 01:59:41.500
You know your father's temper:

2446
01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:44.030
at this time he will allow no speech,

2447
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:46.770
which I do guess you do not purpose to him;

2448
01:59:46.770 --> 01:59:49.670
and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:

2449
01:59:49.670 --> 01:59:52.470
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,

2450
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:54.300
Come not before him.

2451
01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.030
I not purpose it.

2452
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:57.900
I think, Camillo?

2453
01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.070
Even he, my lord.

2454
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:05.700
How often have I told you 'twould be thus!

2455
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:06.700
How often said,

2456
02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:10.470
my dignity would last but till 'twere known!

2457
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:14.200
It cannot fail but by the violation of my faith;

2458
02:00:14.200 --> 02:00:16.530
and then let nature crush the sides o' the earth together

2459
02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:21.070
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:

2460
02:00:21.070 --> 02:00:23.100
From my succession wipe me, father;

2461
02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.630
I am heir to my affection.

2462
02:00:24.630 --> 02:00:25.830
Be advised.

2463
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:27.600
I am, and by my fancy:

2464
02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.100
if my reason will thereto be obedient,

2465
02:00:29.100 --> 02:00:30.500
I have reason;

2466
02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:32.170
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,

2467
02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:32.930
Do bid it welcome.

2468
02:00:32.930 --> 02:00:34.570
This is desperate, sir.

2469
02:00:34.570 --> 02:00:36.700
So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;

2470
02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:39.600
I needs must think it honesty.

2471
02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.570
Camillo, not for Bohemia,

2472
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:43.530
nor the pomp that may be thereat glean'd,

2473
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:46.000
for all the sun sees or the close earth wombs

2474
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.300
or the profound sea hides in unknown fathoms,

2475
02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:53.130
will I break my oath yo this my fair beloved:

2476
02:00:53.130 --> 02:00:54.670
therefore, I pray you,

2477
02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:56.130
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,

2478
02:00:56.130 --> 02:00:57.430
When he shall miss me,

2479
02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:58.730
as, in faith, I mean not to see him any more,

2480
02:00:58.730 --> 02:01:00.770
cast your good counsels upon his passion;

2481
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:04.000
let myself and fortune tug for the time to come.

2482
02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:07.100
This you may know and so deliver,

2483
02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:08.800
I am put to sea with her

2484
02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:11.100
whom here I cannot hold on shore;

2485
02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.230
And most opportune to our need

2486
02:01:12.230 --> 02:01:14.130
I have Aa vessel rides fast by,

2487
02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:16.230
but not prepared for this design.

2488
02:01:16.230 --> 02:01:17.100
What course I mean to hold

2489
02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:18.070
shall nothing benefit your knowledge,

2490
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:19.130
nor concern me the reporting.

2491
02:01:19.130 --> 02:01:20.170
O my lord!

2492
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:22.900
I would your spirit were easier for advice,

2493
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.530
Or stronger for your need.

2494
02:01:24.530 --> 02:01:26.130
Hark, Perdita

2495
02:01:26.130 --> 02:01:28.600
I'll hear you by and by.

2496
02:01:28.600 --> 02:01:30.100
He's irremoveable,

2497
02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:35.000
Resolved for flight.

2498
02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.870
Now were I happy,

2499
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:41.070
if his going I could frame to serve my turn,

2500
02:01:41.070 --> 02:01:45.030
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,

2501
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:47.770
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia

2502
02:01:47.770 --> 02:01:49.370
And that unhappy king, my master,

2503
02:01:49.370 --> 02:01:53.100
whom I so much thirst to see.

2504
02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:54.500
Now, good Camillo;

2505
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.270
I am so fraught with curious business

2506
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:58.400
that I leave out ceremony.

2507
02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:00.430
Sir,

2508
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:02.530
I think you have heard of my poor services,

2509
02:02:02.530 --> 02:02:05.030
i' the love that I have borne your father?

2510
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:06.830
Very nobly have you deserved:

2511
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:08.500
it is my father's music to speak your deeds,

2512
02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:09.930
not little of his care to have them recompensed

2513
02:02:09.930 --> 02:02:10.770
as thought on.

2514
02:02:10.770 --> 02:02:12.130
Well, my lord,

2515
02:02:12.130 --> 02:02:14.770
If you may please to think I love the king

2516
02:02:14.770 --> 02:02:16.230
And through him what is nearest to him,

2517
02:02:16.230 --> 02:02:18.830
which is your gracious self,

2518
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:20.330
embrace but my direction:

2519
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:22.370
If your more ponderous and settled project

2520
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:25.470
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,

2521
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:28.770
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving

2522
02:02:28.770 --> 02:02:31.100
As shall become your highness;

2523
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:33.170
where you may enjoy your mistress,

2524
02:02:33.170 --> 02:02:34.170
from the whom, I see,

2525
02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:35.600
There's no disjunction to be made,

2526
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.200
but by-- As heavens forefend!

2527
02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:40.530
--your ruin; marry her,

2528
02:02:40.530 --> 02:02:42.800
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,

2529
02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:47.000
Your discontenting father strive to qualify

2530
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.270
And bring him up to liking.

2531
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:50.430
How, Camillo,

2532
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:53.000
May this, almost a miracle, be done?

2533
02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:54.770
That I may call thee something more than man

2534
02:02:54.770 --> 02:02:56.270
And after that trust to thee.

2535
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:58.970
Have you thought on a place whereto you'll go?

2536
02:02:58.970 --> 02:03:00.500
Not any yet:

2537
02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:01.700
But as the unthought-

2538
02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:03.570
on accident is guilty to what we wildly do,

2539
02:03:03.570 --> 02:03:05.730
so we profess ourselves to be the slaves of chance

2540
02:03:05.730 --> 02:03:07.330
and flies of every wind that blows.

2541
02:03:07.330 --> 02:03:08.800
Then list to me:

2542
02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.000
This follows,

2543
02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.530
if you will not change your purpose

2544
02:03:11.530 --> 02:03:14.170
but undergo this flight,

2545
02:03:14.170 --> 02:03:16.670
make for Sicilia, and there present yourself

2546
02:03:16.670 --> 02:03:17.930
and your fair princess,

2547
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:21.300
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:

2548
02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:23.030
She shall be habited as it becomes

2549
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:25.200
The partner of your bed.

2550
02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.530
Methinks I see Leontes

2551
02:03:27.530 --> 02:03:29.730
opening his free arms and weeping

2552
02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:32.370
His welcomes forth;

2553
02:03:32.370 --> 02:03:35.400
asks thee the son forgiveness,

2554
02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.800
As 'twere i' the father's person;

2555
02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:40.500
kisses the hands of your fresh princess;

2556
02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:42.070
o'er and o'er divides him

2557
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:44.330
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness;

2558
02:03:44.330 --> 02:03:45.870
the one he chides to hell

2559
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:49.930
and bids the other grow faster than thought or time.

2560
02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.270
Worthy Camillo,

2561
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:52.400
What colour for my visitation

2562
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.470
shall I hold up before him?

2563
02:03:53.470 --> 02:03:54.870
Sent by the king your father

2564
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:57.400
To greet him and to give him comforts.

2565
02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:00.130
Sir, the manner of your bearing towards him,

2566
02:04:00.130 --> 02:04:02.270
with what you as from your father shall deliver,

2567
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:04.270
Things known betwixt us three,

2568
02:04:04.270 --> 02:04:05.870
I'll write you down:

2569
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:08.300
The which shall point you forth at every sitting

2570
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:09.700
What you must say;

2571
02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:10.830
that he shall not perceive

2572
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:13.770
but that you have your father's bosom there

2573
02:04:13.770 --> 02:04:16.200
And speak his very heart.

2574
02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:17.630
I am bound to you:

2575
02:04:17.630 --> 02:04:19.030
There is some sap in this.

2576
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:20.200
A cause more promising

2577
02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.870
than a wild dedication of yourselves

2578
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:26.470
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores,

2579
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:27.300
besides you know

2580
02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:29.300
prosperity's the very bond of love,

2581
02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:30.400
Whose fresh complexion

2582
02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.930
and whose heart together affliction alters.

2583
02:04:33.930 --> 02:04:35.770
One of these is true:

2584
02:04:35.770 --> 02:04:38.030
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,

2585
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:40.530
But not take in the mind.

2586
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:42.970
Yea, say you so?

2587
02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:44.570
There shall not at your father's house

2588
02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:45.600
these seven years

2589
02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:47.330
Be born another such.

2590
02:04:47.330 --> 02:04:48.130
My good Camillo,

2591
02:04:48.130 --> 02:04:49.330
She is as forward of her breeding

2592
02:04:49.330 --> 02:04:50.770
as she is i' the rear our birth.

2593
02:04:50.770 --> 02:04:51.770
I cannot say 'tis pity

2594
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:54.030
She lacks instructions,

2595
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:59.430
for she seems a mistress to most that teach.

2596
02:04:59.430 --> 02:05:01.200
Your pardon, sir;

2597
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:03.030
for this I'll blush you thanks.

2598
02:05:03.030 --> 02:05:04.830
My prettiest Perdita!

2599
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:07.030
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,

2600
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:08.400
Preserver of my father, now of me,

2601
02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.730
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?

2602
02:05:10.730 --> 02:05:12.330
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,

2603
02:05:12.330 --> 02:05:13.600
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

2604
02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.230
My lord,

2605
02:05:14.230 --> 02:05:15.330
Fear none of this:

2606
02:05:15.330 --> 02:05:17.870
I think you know my fortunes do all lie there:

2607
02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:21.230
it shall be so my care to have you royally appointed

2608
02:05:21.230 --> 02:05:23.830
as if the scene you play were mine.

2609
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:25.400
For instance, sir,

2610
02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:28.730
That you may know you shall not want, one word.

2611
02:05:35.730 --> 02:05:38.900
Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is!

2612
02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:40.800
and Trust, his sworn brother,

2613
02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:42.530
a very simple gentleman!

2614
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:45.100
I have sold all my trumpery;

2615
02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:46.330
not a counterfeit stone,

2616
02:05:46.330 --> 02:05:48.430
not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch,

2617
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:49.300
table-book, ballad,

2618
02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:50.330
knife, tape, glove,

2619
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:51.870
shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,

2620
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:54.330
to keep my pack from fasting:

2621
02:05:54.330 --> 02:05:56.900
they throng who should buy first,

2622
02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:58.370
as if my trinkets had been hallowed

2623
02:05:58.370 --> 02:06:01.170
and brought a benediction to the buyer:

2624
02:06:01.170 --> 02:06:04.300
by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture;

2625
02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:08.700
and what I saw, to my good use I remembered.

2626
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:12.030
My clown, who wants but something

2627
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:13.100
to be a reasonable man,

2628
02:06:13.100 --> 02:06:15.800
grew so in love with the wenches' song,

2629
02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:18.200
that he would not stir his pettitoes

2630
02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:20.270
till he had both tune and words;

2631
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:22.700
which so drew the rest of the herd to me

2632
02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:25.600
that all their other senses stuck in ears:

2633
02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:26.730
you might have pinched a placket,

2634
02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:27.830
it was senseless;

2635
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:30.500
'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse;

2636
02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:34.770
I could have filed keys off that hung in chains:

2637
02:06:34.770 --> 02:06:38.730
no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,

2638
02:06:38.730 --> 02:06:41.000
and admiring the nothing of it.

2639
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.500
So that in this time of lethargy

2640
02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:45.130
I picked and cut most of their festival purses;

2641
02:06:45.130 --> 02:06:47.330
and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub

2642
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:48.830
against his daughter and the king's son

2643
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:50.200
and scared my choughs from the chaff,

2644
02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:53.430
I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.

2645
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:54.530
Nay, but my letters,

2646
02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:57.200
by this means being there so soon as you arrive,

2647
02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:58.800
shall clear that doubt.

2648
02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.730
And those that you'll procure

2649
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:00.600
from King Leontes--

2650
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:02.900
Shall satisfy your father.

2651
02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:03.970
Happy be you!

2652
02:07:03.970 --> 02:07:07.400
All that you speak shows fair.

2653
02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:09.200
Who have we here?

2654
02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:10.730
We'll make an instrument of this,

2655
02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:13.070
omit nothing may give us aid.

2656
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:15.070
If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.

2657
02:07:15.070 --> 02:07:18.700
How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so?

2658
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:20.930
Fear not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

2659
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:22.530
I am a poor fellow, sir.

2660
02:07:22.530 --> 02:07:24.130
Why, be so still;

2661
02:07:24.130 --> 02:07:26.070
here's nobody will steal that from thee:

2662
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:28.530
yet for the outside of thy poverty

2663
02:07:28.530 --> 02:07:30.000
we must make an exchange;

2664
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.800
therefore discase thee instantly,

2665
02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:33.270
--thou must think there's a necessity in't,

2666
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:35.600
--and change garments with this gentleman:

2667
02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:37.800
though the pennyworth on his side be the worst,

2668
02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:40.570
yet hold thee, there's some boot.

2669
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:42.070
I am a poor fellow, sir.

2670
02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:43.370
I know ye well enough.

2671
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:44.600
Nay, prithee, dispatch:

2672
02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:46.400
the gentleman is half flayed already.

2673
02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:47.400
Are you in earnest, sir?

2674
02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:48.700
I smell the trick on't.

2675
02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:49.600
Dispatch, I prithee.

2676
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:50.930
Indeed, I have had earnest:

2677
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:53.030
but I cannot with conscience take it.

2678
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:55.400
Unbuckle, unbuckle.

2679
02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:57.330
Fortunate mistress,

2680
02:07:57.330 --> 02:07:59.900
--let my prophecy come home to ye!

2681
02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:02.270
--you must retire yourself into some covert:

2682
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:03.670
take your sweetheart's hat

2683
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:05.130
And pluck it o'er your brows,

2684
02:08:05.130 --> 02:08:06.370
muffle your face,

2685
02:08:06.370 --> 02:08:08.130
Dismantle you, and, as you can,

2686
02:08:08.130 --> 02:08:10.100
disliken the truth of your own seeming;

2687
02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:12.600
that you may-- for I do fear eyes over--

2688
02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.730
to shipboard get undescried.

2689
02:08:14.730 --> 02:08:16.000
I see the play so lies

2690
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:17.300
That I must bear a part.

2691
02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:18.670
No remedy.

2692
02:08:18.670 --> 02:08:19.870
Have you done there?

2693
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:20.930
Should I now meet my father,

2694
02:08:20.930 --> 02:08:22.100
He would not call me son.

2695
02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:23.730
Nay, you shall have no hat.

2696
02:08:23.730 --> 02:08:25.800
Come, lady, come.

2697
02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:26.970
What I do next,

2698
02:08:26.970 --> 02:08:28.430
shall be to tell the king of this escape

2699
02:08:28.430 --> 02:08:29.800
and whither they are bound;

2700
02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.830
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail

2701
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:34.900
to force him after:

2702
02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:38.330
in whose company I shall review Sicilia,

2703
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:42.100
for whose sight I have a woman's longing.

2704
02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:43.100
Farwell, my friend.

2705
02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:43.900
Adieu, sir.

2706
02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:44.970
Fortune speed us!

2707
02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:47.370
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

2708
02:08:47.370 --> 02:08:49.900
The swifter speed the better.

2709
02:08:52.070 --> 02:08:55.000
I understand the business, I hear it:

2710
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.870
to have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand,

2711
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:59.370
is necessary for a cut-purse;

2712
02:08:59.370 --> 02:09:01.630
a good nose is requisite also,

2713
02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:06.570
to smell out work for the other senses.

2714
02:09:06.570 --> 02:09:12.530
I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.

2715
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:16.100
What an exchange had this been without boot!

2716
02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:21.300
What a boot is here with this exchange!

2717
02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:24.900
Sure the gods do this year connive at us,

2718
02:09:24.900 --> 02:09:30.970
and we may do any thing extempore.

2719
02:09:30.970 --> 02:09:32.830
The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity,

2720
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:33.930
stealing away from his father

2721
02:09:33.930 --> 02:09:35.670
with his clog at his heels:

2722
02:09:35.670 --> 02:09:38.030
if I thought it were a piece of honesty

2723
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:39.970
to acquaint the king withal,

2724
02:09:39.970 --> 02:09:41.370
I would not do't:

2725
02:09:41.370 --> 02:09:43.300
I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;

2726
02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:47.800
and therein am I constant to my profession.

2727
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.870
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:

2728
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:54.330
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,

2729
02:09:54.330 --> 02:09:56.170
hanging, yields a careful man work.

2730
02:09:56.170 --> 02:10:00.970
See, see; what a man you are now!

2731
02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:02.970
There is no other way but to tell the king

2732
02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:04.230
she's a changeling

2733
02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:05.700
and none of your flesh and blood.

2734
02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:07.370
Nay, but hear me.

2735
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:08.370
Nay, but hear me.

2736
02:10:08.370 --> 02:10:09.670
Go to, then.

2737
02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:11.730
She being none of your flesh and blood,

2738
02:10:11.730 --> 02:10:13.670
your flesh and blood has not offended the king;

2739
02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:18.200
and so your flesh and blood

2740
02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:20.670
Show those things you found about her,

2741
02:10:20.670 --> 02:10:24.170
those secret things, all but what she has with her:

2742
02:10:24.170 --> 02:10:26.300
this being done, let the law go whistle:

2743
02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:30.270
I warrant you.

2744
02:10:30.270 --> 02:10:34.370
I will tell the king all, every word, yea,

2745
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:37.070
and his son's pranks too; who, I may say,

2746
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:38.130
is no honest man,

2747
02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:40.730
neither to his father nor to me,

2748
02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:44.470
to go about to make me the king's brother-in-law.

2749
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:46.300
Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off

2750
02:10:46.300 --> 02:10:47.670
you could have been to him

2751
02:10:47.670 --> 02:10:48.970
and then your blood had been the dearer

2752
02:10:48.970 --> 02:10:50.470
by I know how much an ounce.

2753
02:10:50.470 --> 02:10:51.800
Very wisely, puppies!

2754
02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.700
Well, let us to the king:

2755
02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:55.770
there is that in this fardel

2756
02:10:55.770 --> 02:10:58.830
will make him scratch his beard.

2757
02:10:58.830 --> 02:11:00.700
I know not what impediment this complaint

2758
02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:02.500
may be to the flight of my master.

2759
02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:04.400
Pray heartily he be at palace.

2760
02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:05.800
Though I am not naturally honest,

2761
02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:08.400
I am so sometimes by chance:

2762
02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:11.400
let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.

2763
02:11:16.930 --> 02:11:18.430
how now, rustics!

2764
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:20.930
whither are you bound?

2765
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:23.630
To the palace, an it like your worship.

2766
02:11:23.630 --> 02:11:25.430
Your affairs there, what, with whom,

2767
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:26.630
the condition of that fardel,

2768
02:11:26.630 --> 02:11:27.700
the place of your dwelling,

2769
02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:29.830
your names, your ages, of what having, breeding,

2770
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:32.200
and any thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

2771
02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:34.400
We are but plain fellows, sir.

2772
02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.730
A lie; you are rough and hairy.

2773
02:11:35.730 --> 02:11:39.500
Let me have no lying: it becomes none but tradesmen,

2774
02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:42.900
Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

2775
02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:46.500
Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier.

2776
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:49.500
Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?

2777
02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:52.030
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?

2778
02:11:52.030 --> 02:11:55.930
receives not thy nose court-odor from me?

2779
02:11:55.930 --> 02:11:59.630
reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt?

2780
02:11:59.630 --> 02:12:01.870
Thinkest thou, for that I insinuate,

2781
02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:03.170
or toaze from thee thy business,

2782
02:12:03.170 --> 02:12:05.270
I am therefore no courtier?

2783
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:08.530
I am courtier cap-a-pe;

2784
02:12:08.530 --> 02:12:10.070
and one that will either push on

2785
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:13.300
or pluck back thy business there:

2786
02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:17.200
whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.

2787
02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:19.200
My business, sir, is to the king.

2788
02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:21.670
What advocate hast thou to him?

2789
02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:24.430
I know not, an't like you.

2790
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:26.130
Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant:

2791
02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:28.000
say you have none.

2792
02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.670
None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

2793
02:12:34.770 --> 02:12:38.500
How blessed are we that are not simple men!

2794
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:40.500
Yet nature might have made me as these are,

2795
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:44.500
Therefore I will not disdain.

2796
02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.230
This cannot be but a great courtier.

2797
02:12:47.230 --> 02:12:48.630
His garments are rich,

2798
02:12:48.630 --> 02:12:51.200
but he wears them not handsomely.

2799
02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:53.670
He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:

2800
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:55.730
a great man, I'll warrant;

2801
02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:57.430
I know by the picking on's teeth.

2802
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:59.130
The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?

2803
02:12:59.130 --> 02:13:00.370
Wherefore that box?

2804
02:13:00.370 --> 02:13:04.130
Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,

2805
02:13:04.130 --> 02:13:06.770
which none must know but the king;

2806
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:09.130
and which he shall know within this hour,

2807
02:13:09.130 --> 02:13:12.430
if I may come to the speech of him.

2808
02:13:12.430 --> 02:13:15.170
Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

2809
02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:16.170
Why, sir?

2810
02:13:16.170 --> 02:13:19.070
The king is not at the palace;

2811
02:13:19.070 --> 02:13:22.530
he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy

2812
02:13:22.530 --> 02:13:24.200
and air himself:

2813
02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:25.830
for, if thou beest capable of things serious,

2814
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:28.630
thou must know the king is full of grief.

2815
02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:32.030
So 'tis said, sir; about his son,

2816
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:36.600
that should have married a shepherd's daughter.

2817
02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.770
If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:

2818
02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:41.730
the curses he shall have,

2819
02:13:41.730 --> 02:13:43.070
the tortures he shall feel,

2820
02:13:43.070 --> 02:13:45.830
will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

2821
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:48.200
Think you so, sir?

2822
02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:50.470
Not he alone shall suffer what wit

2823
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:52.200
can make heavy and vengeance bitter;

2824
02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.430
but those that are germane to him,

2825
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:55.230
though removed fifty times,

2826
02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:58.170
shall all come under the hangman:

2827
02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:02.830
which though it be great pity, yet it is necessary.

2828
02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:06.130
An old sheep-whistling rogue a ram-tender,

2829
02:14:06.130 --> 02:14:10.300
to offer to have his daughter come into grace!

2830
02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:12.570
Some say he shall be stoned;

2831
02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:14.370
but that death is too soft for him, say I

2832
02:14:14.370 --> 02:14:18.300
draw our throne into a sheep-cote!

2833
02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.300
all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

2834
02:14:21.300 --> 02:14:25.470
Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear.

2835
02:14:25.470 --> 02:14:27.530
an't like you, sir?

2836
02:14:27.530 --> 02:14:32.070
He has a son, who shall be flayed alive;

2837
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:33.970
then 'nointed over with honey,

2838
02:14:33.970 --> 02:14:35.870
set on the head of a wasp's nest;

2839
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:37.930
then stand till he be three quarters

2840
02:14:37.930 --> 02:14:40.200
and a dram dead;

2841
02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:42.400
then recovered again with aqua-vitae

2842
02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:44.270
or some other hot infusion;

2843
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:47.270
then, raw as he is,

2844
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:48.070
and in the hottest day

2845
02:14:48.070 --> 02:14:49.630
prognostication proclaims,

2846
02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:52.870
shall be be set against a brick-wall,

2847
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:54.670
the sun looking with a southward eye upon him,

2848
02:14:54.670 --> 02:15:00.830
where he is to behold him with flies blown to death.

2849
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:04.330
But what talk we of these traitorly rascals,

2850
02:15:04.330 --> 02:15:05.900
whose miseries are to be smiled at,

2851
02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.670
their offences being so capital?

2852
02:15:08.670 --> 02:15:10.530
Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain men,

2853
02:15:10.530 --> 02:15:12.330
what you have to the king:

2854
02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:14.870
being something gently considered,

2855
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:16.630
I'll bring you where he is aboard,

2856
02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:18.600
tender your persons to his presence,

2857
02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.930
whisper him in your behalfs;

2858
02:15:19.930 --> 02:15:23.370
and if it be in man besides the king

2859
02:15:23.370 --> 02:15:25.570
to effect your suits,

2860
02:15:25.570 --> 02:15:28.230
here is man shall do it.

2861
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:31.630
He seems to be of great authority: close with him,

2862
02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:32.770
give him gold;

2863
02:15:32.770 --> 02:15:34.230
and though authority be a stubborn bear,

2864
02:15:34.230 --> 02:15:37.200
yet he is oft led by the nose with gold:

2865
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.570
show the inside of your purse

2866
02:15:38.570 --> 02:15:39.770
to the outside of his hand,

2867
02:15:39.770 --> 02:15:40.770
and no more ado.

2868
02:15:40.770 --> 02:15:45.400
Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

2869
02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:52.670
An't please you, sir,

2870
02:15:52.670 --> 02:15:55.700
to undertake the business for us,

2871
02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:58.170
here is that gold I have:

2872
02:15:58.170 --> 02:16:01.400
I'll make it as much more and leave this young man

2873
02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:04.570
in pawn till I bring it you.

2874
02:16:04.570 --> 02:16:07.100
After I have done what I promised?

2875
02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:09.270
Ay, sir.

2876
02:16:09.270 --> 02:16:12.400
Well, give me the moiety.

2877
02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:16.100
Are you a party in this business?

2878
02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:20.300
In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one,

2879
02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:22.670
I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

2880
02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:29.630
O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,

2881
02:16:29.630 --> 02:16:31.970
he'll be made an example.

2882
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:33.800
Comfort, good comfort!

2883
02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.500
We must to the king and show our strange sights:

2884
02:16:36.500 --> 02:16:39.300
he must know 'tis none of your daughter nor my sister;

2885
02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:41.670
we are gone else.

2886
02:16:41.670 --> 02:16:44.770
Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does

2887
02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:46.930
when the business is performed, and remain,

2888
02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:47.730
as he says,

2889
02:16:47.730 --> 02:16:50.770
your pawn till it be brought you.

2890
02:16:55.470 --> 02:17:00.170
I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;

2891
02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:01.770
go on the right hand:

2892
02:17:01.770 --> 02:17:04.530
I will but look upon the hedge and follow you.

2893
02:17:04.530 --> 02:17:08.300
We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

2894
02:17:08.300 --> 02:17:11.830
Let's before as he bids us:

2895
02:17:14.130 --> 02:17:17.330
he was provided to do us good.

2896
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.130
If I had a mind to be honest,

2897
02:17:26.130 --> 02:17:28.770
I see Fortune would not suffer me:

2898
02:17:28.770 --> 02:17:31.600
she drops booties in my mouth.

2899
02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:33.330
I am courted now with a double occasion,

2900
02:17:33.330 --> 02:17:36.500
gold and a means to do the prince my master good;

2901
02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:40.270
which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement?

2902
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:45.070
I will bring these two moles, these blind ones,

2903
02:17:45.070 --> 02:17:46.600
aboard him:

2904
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:48.130
if he think it fit to shore them again

2905
02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:49.830
and that the complaint they have to the king

2906
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:50.900
concerns him nothing,

2907
02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:54.300
let him call me rogue for being so far officious;

2908
02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:55.770
for I am proof against that title

2909
02:17:55.770 --> 02:17:59.230
and what shame else belongs to't.

2910
02:17:59.230 --> 02:18:01.300
To him will I present them:

2911
02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:05.170
there may be matter in it.

2912
02:18:13.970 --> 02:18:15.770
Sir, you have done enough,

2913
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:19.100
and have perform'd a saint-like sorrow:

2914
02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:20.530
no fault could you make,

2915
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:22.430
Which you have not redeem'd;

2916
02:18:22.430 --> 02:18:24.200
indeed, paid down more penitence

2917
02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:26.870
than done trespass:

2918
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:28.600
at the last,

2919
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:32.270
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;

2920
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:34.930
With them forgive yourself.

2921
02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:38.200
Whilst I remember her and her virtues,

2922
02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:40.830
I cannot forget my blemishes in them,

2923
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:43.830
and so still think of the wrong I did myself;

2924
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:44.770
which was so much,

2925
02:18:44.770 --> 02:18:47.300
That heirless it hath made my kingdom

2926
02:18:47.300 --> 02:18:48.970
and destroy'd the sweet'st companion

2927
02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:51.300
that e'er man bred his hopes out of.

2928
02:18:51.300 --> 02:18:54.730
True, too true, my lord:

2929
02:18:54.730 --> 02:18:57.370
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,

2930
02:18:57.370 --> 02:18:59.230
Or from the all that are took something good,

2931
02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:00.830
To make a perfect woman,

2932
02:19:00.830 --> 02:19:03.470
she you kill'd would be unparallel'd.

2933
02:19:03.470 --> 02:19:05.770
I think so. Kill'd!

2934
02:19:05.770 --> 02:19:09.470
She I kill'd! I did so:

2935
02:19:09.470 --> 02:19:11.500
but thou strikest me sorely, to say I did;

2936
02:19:11.500 --> 02:19:13.970
it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought:

2937
02:19:13.970 --> 02:19:15.170
now, good now,

2938
02:19:15.170 --> 02:19:17.130
Say so but seldom.

2939
02:19:17.130 --> 02:19:18.600
Not at all, good lady:

2940
02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:20.100
You might have spoken a thousand things

2941
02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:21.800
that would have done the time more benefit

2942
02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:23.130
and graced your kindness better.

2943
02:19:23.130 --> 02:19:25.670
You are one of those would have him wed again.

2944
02:19:25.670 --> 02:19:26.270
If you would not so,

2945
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:27.630
You pity not the state,

2946
02:19:27.630 --> 02:19:29.900
nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name;

2947
02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:30.770
consider little what dangers,

2948
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:31.900
by his highness' fail of issue,

2949
02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:32.700
May drop upon his kingdom

2950
02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:35.670
and devour incertain lookers on.

2951
02:19:36.770 --> 02:19:37.700
What were more holy

2952
02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:40.300
than to rejoice the former queen is well?

2953
02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:41.870
What holier than, for royalty's repair,

2954
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:43.730
For present comfort and for future good,

2955
02:19:43.730 --> 02:19:45.330
To bless the bed of majesty again

2956
02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:46.970
with a sweet fellow to't?

2957
02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:48.830
There is none worthy,

2958
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:51.770
Respecting her that's gone.

2959
02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:53.730
Besides, the gods will

2960
02:19:53.730 --> 02:19:57.100
have fulfill'd their secret purposes;

2961
02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:59.500
For has not the divine Apollo said,

2962
02:19:59.500 --> 02:20:01.570
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,

2963
02:20:01.570 --> 02:20:03.470
That King Leontes shall not have an heir

2964
02:20:03.470 --> 02:20:07.130
till his lost child be found?

2965
02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:09.330
which that it shall, is all as monstrous

2966
02:20:09.330 --> 02:20:10.470
to our human reason

2967
02:20:10.470 --> 02:20:12.370
As my Antigonus to break his grave

2968
02:20:12.370 --> 02:20:14.930
and come again to me; who, on my life,

2969
02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:17.100
Did perish with the infant.

2970
02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:18.500
'Tis your counsel my lord

2971
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:20.230
should to the heavens be contrary,

2972
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:23.930
Oppose against their wills.

2973
02:20:23.930 --> 02:20:25.500
Care not for issue;

2974
02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:27.430
The crown will find an heir:

2975
02:20:27.430 --> 02:20:29.330
great Alexander left his to the worthiest;

2976
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:32.500
so his successor was like to be the best.

2977
02:20:32.500 --> 02:20:33.800
Good Paulina,

2978
02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:35.070
Who hast the memory of Hermione,

2979
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:37.670
I know, in honour,

2980
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:40.130
O, that ever I had squared me to thy counsel!

2981
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:41.130
then, even now,

2982
02:20:41.130 --> 02:20:43.630
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,

2983
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:45.230
Have taken treasure from her lips--

2984
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:47.900
And left them more rich for what they yielded.

2985
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:49.670
Thou speak'st truth.

2986
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:51.030
No more such wives;

2987
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:53.570
therefore, no wife: one worse,

2988
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:54.770
And better used,

2989
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:56.830
would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse,

2990
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:57.830
and on this stage,

2991
02:20:57.830 --> 02:21:00.800
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,

2992
02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:03.130
And begin, 'Why to me?'

2993
02:21:03.130 --> 02:21:04.970
Had she such power,

2994
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:06.770
She had just cause.

2995
02:21:06.770 --> 02:21:11.470
She had; and would incense me to murder her I married.

2996
02:21:11.470 --> 02:21:13.330
I should so.

2997
02:21:13.330 --> 02:21:14.570
Were I the ghost that walk'd,

2998
02:21:14.570 --> 02:21:16.630
I'ld bid you mark her eye,

2999
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:20.070
and tell me for what dull part in't you chose her;

3000
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:23.600
then I'ld shriek, that even your ears should rift

3001
02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:25.170
to hear me;

3002
02:21:25.170 --> 02:21:27.970
and the words that follow'd should be

3003
02:21:27.970 --> 02:21:29.900
'Remember mine.'

3004
02:21:29.900 --> 02:21:34.930
Stars, stars, And all eyes else dead coals!

3005
02:21:34.930 --> 02:21:37.100
Fear thou no wife;

3006
02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:40.130
I'll have no wife, Paulina.

3007
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:42.900
Will you swear never to marry

3008
02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:45.930
but by my free leave?

3009
02:21:45.930 --> 02:21:51.170
Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

3010
02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:54.830
Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

3011
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:56.200
You tempt him over-much.

3012
02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:57.730
Unless another,

3013
02:21:57.730 --> 02:21:59.770
As like Hermione as is her picture,

3014
02:21:59.770 --> 02:22:00.630
Affront his eye.

3015
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:01.270
Good madam,--

3016
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:02.930
I have done.

3017
02:22:02.930 --> 02:22:05.830
Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,

3018
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:08.330
No remedy, but you will,

3019
02:22:08.330 --> 02:22:11.000
--give me the office to choose you a queen:

3020
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.200
she shall not be so young as was your former;

3021
02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:14.800
but she shall be such

3022
02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:16.570
as,walk'd your first queen's ghost,

3023
02:22:16.570 --> 02:22:19.730
it should take joy to see her in your arms.

3024
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:21.370
My true Paulina,

3025
02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:24.400
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

3026
02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:29.200
That shall be when your first queen's again in breath;

3027
02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:31.600
Never till then.

3028
02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:34.300
One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,

3029
02:22:34.300 --> 02:22:36.970
Son of Polixenes, with his princess,

3030
02:22:36.970 --> 02:22:39.230
she the fairest I have yet beheld,

3031
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:42.100
desires access to your high presence.

3032
02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:43.570
What with him?

3033
02:22:43.570 --> 02:22:45.870
he comes not like to his father's greatness:

3034
02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:48.030
his approach, so out of circumstance and sudden,

3035
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:49.670
tells us 'Tis not a visitation framed,

3036
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:53.400
but forced by need and accident. What train?

3037
02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.400
But few, and those but mean.

3038
02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.530
His princess, say you, with him?

3039
02:22:57.530 --> 02:23:00.570
Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,

3040
02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:02.670
That e'er the sun shone bright on.

3041
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:04.170
O Hermione,

3042
02:23:04.170 --> 02:23:06.100
As every present time doth boast itself

3043
02:23:06.100 --> 02:23:07.470
above a better gone,

3044
02:23:07.470 --> 02:23:10.530
so must thy grave give way to what's seen now!

3045
02:23:10.530 --> 02:23:13.030
Sir, you yourself have said and writ so,

3046
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:15.800
but your writing now is colder than that theme,

3047
02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:18.800
'She had not been, Nor was not to be equall'd;'

3048
02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:21.070
--thus your verse flow'd with her beauty once:

3049
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:22.170
'tis shrewdly ebb'd,

3050
02:23:22.170 --> 02:23:23.770
to say you have seen a better.

3051
02:23:23.770 --> 02:23:24.900
Pardon, madam:

3052
02:23:24.900 --> 02:23:28.330
The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--

3053
02:23:28.330 --> 02:23:30.700
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,

3054
02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:34.000
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,

3055
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.100
Would she begin a sect,

3056
02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:37.670
might quench the zeal o f all professors else,

3057
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:39.930
make proselytes of who she but bid follow.

3058
02:23:39.930 --> 02:23:42.300
How! not women?

3059
02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:43.370
Women will love her,

3060
02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:45.570
that she is a woman more worth than any man; men,

3061
02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:48.870
that she is the rarest of all women.

3062
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:50.600
Go, Cleomenes;

3063
02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:52.300
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,

3064
02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:54.830
Bring them to our embracement.

3065
02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:00.500
Still, 'tis strange

3066
02:24:00.500 --> 02:24:02.800
He thus should steal upon us.

3067
02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:03.670
Had our prince,

3068
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:06.130
Jewel of children, seen this hour,

3069
02:24:06.130 --> 02:24:08.070
he had pair'd well with this lord:

3070
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:10.500
there was not full a month between their births.

3071
02:24:10.500 --> 02:24:12.500
Prithee, no more; cease;

3072
02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:15.370
thou know'st he dies to me again when talk'd of:

3073
02:24:15.370 --> 02:24:17.400
sure, When I shall see this gentleman,

3074
02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:19.000
thy speeches will bring me to consider

3075
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:22.130
that which may unfurnish me of reason.

3076
02:24:22.130 --> 02:24:24.030
They are come.

3077
02:24:40.700 --> 02:24:43.330
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;

3078
02:24:43.330 --> 02:24:44.970
For she did print your royal father off,

3079
02:24:44.970 --> 02:24:48.730
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,

3080
02:24:48.730 --> 02:24:50.770
Your father's image is so hit in you,

3081
02:24:50.770 --> 02:24:53.300
His very air, that I should call you brother,

3082
02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:54.230
As I did him,

3083
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:56.300
and speak of something wildly by us

3084
02:24:56.300 --> 02:24:58.530
perform'd before.

3085
02:24:58.530 --> 02:25:03.700
Most dearly welcome! and your fair princess,

3086
02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:07.630
--goddess!--O, alas!

3087
02:25:07.630 --> 02:25:08.400
I lost a couple,

3088
02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:09.370
that 'twixt heaven and earth

3089
02:25:09.370 --> 02:25:10.330
might thus have stood

3090
02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:13.470
begetting wonder as you, gracious couple, do:

3091
02:25:13.470 --> 02:25:14.200
and then I lost--

3092
02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:16.000
All mine own folly--the society,

3093
02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.300
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,

3094
02:25:18.300 --> 02:25:19.270
Though bearing misery,

3095
02:25:19.270 --> 02:25:22.730
I desire my life once more to look on him.

3096
02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:25.630
By his command have I here touch'd Sicilia

3097
02:25:25.630 --> 02:25:27.500
and from him give you all greetings

3098
02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:28.500
that a king, at friend,

3099
02:25:28.500 --> 02:25:30.370
Can send his brother:

3100
02:25:30.370 --> 02:25:32.830
and, but infirmity which waits upon worn times

3101
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:34.900
hath something seized his wish'd ability,

3102
02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:37.170
he had himself the lands and waters 'twixt your throne

3103
02:25:37.170 --> 02:25:40.030
and his measured to look upon you; whom he loves--

3104
02:25:40.030 --> 02:25:40.830
He bade me say so--

3105
02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:41.800
more than all the sceptres

3106
02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:44.700
and those that bear them living.

3107
02:25:44.700 --> 02:25:46.430
O my brother,

3108
02:25:46.430 --> 02:25:48.270
Good gentleman!

3109
02:25:48.270 --> 02:25:51.600
the wrongs I have done thee stir afresh within me,

3110
02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:54.030
and these thy offices, So rarely kind,

3111
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:58.600
are as interpreters of my behind-hand slackness.

3112
02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.200
Welcome hither, As is the spring to the earth.

3113
02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:05.030
And hath he too exposed this paragon

3114
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:06.030
to the fearful usage,

3115
02:26:06.030 --> 02:26:08.600
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,

3116
02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:10.900
To greet a man not worth her pains,

3117
02:26:10.900 --> 02:26:12.800
much less the adventure of her person?

3118
02:26:12.800 --> 02:26:13.470
Good my lord,

3119
02:26:13.470 --> 02:26:15.670
She came from Libya.

3120
02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:16.870
Where the warlike Smalus,

3121
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:18.870
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

3122
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:20.770
Most royal sir, from thence; from him,

3123
02:26:20.770 --> 02:26:22.230
whose daughter his tears proclaim'd his,

3124
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:24.870
parting with her: thence,

3125
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:27.130
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,

3126
02:26:27.130 --> 02:26:28.700
To execute the charge my father gave me

3127
02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:31.170
for visiting your highness:

3128
02:26:31.170 --> 02:26:33.800
my best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;

3129
02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:35.200
Who for Bohemia bend,

3130
02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.300
to signify not only my success in Libya, sir,

3131
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:38.670
But my arrival

3132
02:26:38.670 --> 02:26:44.030
and my wife's in safety here where we are.

3133
02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:55.070
The blessed gods purge all infection from our air

3134
02:26:55.070 --> 02:26:59.400
whilst you do climate here!

3135
02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:03.400
You have a holy father, A graceful gentleman;

3136
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:04.270
against whose person,

3137
02:27:04.270 --> 02:27:06.800
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:

3138
02:27:06.800 --> 02:27:08.430
For which the heavens, taking angry note,

3139
02:27:08.430 --> 02:27:11.170
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,

3140
02:27:11.170 --> 02:27:12.400
As he from heaven merits it,

3141
02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:15.600
with you worthy his goodness.

3142
02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:16.630
What might I have been,

3143
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:19.330
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,

3144
02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:21.500
Such goodly things as you!

3145
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:23.670
Most noble sir,

3146
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:26.070
That which I shall report will bear no credit,

3147
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:28.900
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,

3148
02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:31.630
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;

3149
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:34.430
Desires you to attach his son, who has--

3150
02:27:34.430 --> 02:27:36.630
His dignity and duty both cast off--

3151
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:38.930
Fled from his father, from his hopes,

3152
02:27:38.930 --> 02:27:42.130
and with a shepherd's daughter.

3153
02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:44.700
Where's Bohemia? speak.

3154
02:27:44.700 --> 02:27:47.900
Here in your city; I now came from him:

3155
02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:49.000
I speak amazedly;

3156
02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.800
and it becomes my marvel and my message.

3157
02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:54.030
To your court whiles he was hastening, in the chase,

3158
02:27:54.030 --> 02:27:55.800
it seems, of this fair couple,

3159
02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:58.070
meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady

3160
02:27:58.070 --> 02:27:59.270
and her brother,

3161
02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:01.900
having both their country quitted with this young prince.

3162
02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:03.500
Camillo has betray'd me;

3163
02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.630
Whose honour and whose honesty

3164
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:05.830
till now endured all weathers.

3165
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:07.230
Lay't so to his charge:

3166
02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:08.770
He's with the king your father.

3167
02:28:08.770 --> 02:28:10.630
Who? Camillo?

3168
02:28:10.630 --> 02:28:12.870
Camillo, sir; I spake with him;

3169
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:15.030
who now has these poor men in question.

3170
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:17.600
Never saw I wretches so quake: they kneel,

3171
02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:18.570
they kiss the earth;

3172
02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:20.570
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:

3173
02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:22.400
Bohemia stops his ears,

3174
02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:25.330
and threatens them with divers deaths in death.

3175
02:28:25.330 --> 02:28:27.670
O my poor father!

3176
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:29.530
The heaven sets spies upon us,

3177
02:28:29.530 --> 02:28:33.470
will not have our contract celebrated.

3178
02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:38.600
You are married?

3179
02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:42.670
We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;

3180
02:28:42.670 --> 02:28:44.900
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:

3181
02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:46.700
The odds for high and low's alike.

3182
02:28:46.700 --> 02:28:52.800
My lord, Is this the daughter of a king?

3183
02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.270
She is, when once she is my wife.

3184
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:58.170
That 'once' I see by your good father's speed

3185
02:28:58.170 --> 02:29:00.530
will come on very slowly.

3186
02:29:00.530 --> 02:29:02.230
I am sorry,

3187
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:04.470
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking

3188
02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:06.400
Where you were tied in duty,

3189
02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:09.730
and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,

3190
02:29:09.730 --> 02:29:11.870
That you might well enjoy her.

3191
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:14.500
Dear, look up:

3192
02:29:14.500 --> 02:29:16.170
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,

3193
02:29:16.170 --> 02:29:18.130
Should chase us with my father,

3194
02:29:18.130 --> 02:29:21.970
power no jot hath she to change our loves.

3195
02:29:24.030 --> 02:29:27.630
Beseech you, sir, remember since you owed no more

3196
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:28.730
to time than I do now:

3197
02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:30.970
with thought of such affections,

3198
02:29:30.970 --> 02:29:33.970
Step forth mine advocate; at your request

3199
02:29:33.970 --> 02:29:38.300
my father will grant precious things as trifles.

3200
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:41.170
Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,

3201
02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:43.230
Which he counts but a trifle.

3202
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:44.770
Sir, my liege,

3203
02:29:44.770 --> 02:29:47.170
Your eye hath too much youth in't:

3204
02:29:47.170 --> 02:29:49.170
not a month 'Fore your queen died,

3205
02:29:49.170 --> 02:29:50.530
she was more worth such gazes

3206
02:29:50.530 --> 02:29:52.370
than what you look on now.

3207
02:29:52.370 --> 02:29:53.330
I thought of her,

3208
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:56.330
Even in these looks I made.

3209
02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:58.670
But your petition is yet unanswer'd.

3210
02:29:58.670 --> 02:30:00.930
I will to your father:

3211
02:30:00.930 --> 02:30:02.770
your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,

3212
02:30:02.770 --> 02:30:05.070
I am friend to them and you:

3213
02:30:05.070 --> 02:30:07.800
upon which errand I now go toward him;

3214
02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:12.530
therefore follow me and mark what way I make:

3215
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:14.730
come, good my lord.

3216
02:30:25.700 --> 02:30:29.100
Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

3217
02:30:29.100 --> 02:30:31.800
I was by at the opening of the fardel,

3218
02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:33.500
heard the old shepherd deliver the manner

3219
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:34.800
how he found it:

3220
02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:37.570
whereupon, after a little amazedness,

3221
02:30:37.570 --> 02:30:40.300
we were all commanded out of the chamber;

3222
02:30:40.300 --> 02:30:43.300
only this methought I heard the shepherd say,

3223
02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:45.130
he found the child.

3224
02:30:45.130 --> 02:30:47.630
I would most gladly know the issue of it.

3225
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:50.270
I make a broken delivery of the business;

3226
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:53.200
but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo

3227
02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:55.770
were very notes of admiration:

3228
02:30:55.770 --> 02:30:58.870
they seemed almost, with staring on one another,

3229
02:30:58.870 --> 02:31:01.930
to tear the cases of their eyes;

3230
02:31:01.930 --> 02:31:03.570
there was speech in their dumbness,

3231
02:31:03.570 --> 02:31:06.030
language in their very gesture;

3232
02:31:06.030 --> 02:31:08.130
they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed,

3233
02:31:08.130 --> 02:31:10.730
or one destroyed:

3234
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:13.830
a notable passion of wonder appeared in them;

3235
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:15.470
but the wisest beholder,

3236
02:31:15.470 --> 02:31:17.430
that knew no more but seeing,

3237
02:31:17.430 --> 02:31:21.070
could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow;

3238
02:31:21.070 --> 02:31:24.100
but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.

3239
02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:27.200
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.

3240
02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:28.730
The news, Rogero?

3241
02:31:28.730 --> 02:31:32.130
Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled;

3242
02:31:32.130 --> 02:31:34.070
the king's daughter is found:

3243
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:36.170
such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour

3244
02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:39.200
that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.

3245
02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:40.600
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward:

3246
02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:43.870
he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir?

3247
02:31:43.870 --> 02:31:45.430
this news which is called true

3248
02:31:45.430 --> 02:31:46.900
is so like an old tale

3249
02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:49.270
that the verity of it is in strong suspicion:

3250
02:31:49.270 --> 02:31:51.500
has the king found his heir?

3251
02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:55.230
Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance:

3252
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:58.000
that which you hear you'll swear you see,

3253
02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.300
there is such unity in the proofs.

3254
02:32:00.300 --> 02:32:01.900
The mantle of Queen Hermione's,

3255
02:32:01.900 --> 02:32:03.370
her jewel about the neck of it,

3256
02:32:03.370 --> 02:32:05.200
the letters of Antigonus found with it

3257
02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:07.170
which they know to be his character,

3258
02:32:07.170 --> 02:32:10.070
the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother,

3259
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:11.330
the affection of nobleness

3260
02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:13.270
which nature shows above her breeding,

3261
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:16.800
and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty

3262
02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.770
to be the king's daughter.

3263
02:32:20.770 --> 02:32:22.670
Did you see the meeting of the two kings?

3264
02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:23.700
No.

3265
02:32:23.700 --> 02:32:24.930
Then have you lost a sight,

3266
02:32:24.930 --> 02:32:26.000
which was to be seen,

3267
02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.870
cannot be spoken of.

3268
02:32:27.870 --> 02:32:30.530
There might you have beheld one joy crown another,

3269
02:32:30.530 --> 02:32:32.800
so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow

3270
02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:34.130
wept to take leave of them,

3271
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:36.730
for their joy waded in tears.

3272
02:32:36.730 --> 02:32:38.130
There was casting up of eyes,

3273
02:32:38.130 --> 02:32:39.670
holding up of hands,

3274
02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:41.530
with countenances of such distraction

3275
02:32:41.530 --> 02:32:43.030
that they were to be known by garment,

3276
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:44.770
not by favour.

3277
02:32:44.770 --> 02:32:47.700
Our king, being ready to leap out of himself

3278
02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:49.530
for joy of his found daughter,

3279
02:32:49.530 --> 02:32:51.670
as if that joy were now become a loss,

3280
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:54.670
cries 'O, thy mother, thy mother!'

3281
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:56.370
then asks Bohemia forgiveness;

3282
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:58.100
then embraces his son-in-law;

3283
02:32:58.100 --> 02:33:01.070
then again worries he his daughter with clipping her;

3284
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:02.700
now he thanks the old shepherd,

3285
02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:04.670
which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit

3286
02:33:04.670 --> 02:33:06.800
of many kings' reigns.

3287
02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:08.930
I never heard of such another encounter,

3288
02:33:08.930 --> 02:33:10.770
which lames report to follow it

3289
02:33:10.770 --> 02:33:13.070
and undoes description to do it.

3290
02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:14.830
What, pray you, became of Antigonus,

3291
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:16.870
that carried hence the child?

3292
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:18.600
Like an old tale still,

3293
02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:20.330
which will have matter to rehearse,

3294
02:33:20.330 --> 02:33:23.730
though credit be asleep and not an ear open.

3295
02:33:23.730 --> 02:33:27.130
He was torn to pieces with a bear:

3296
02:33:27.130 --> 02:33:28.500
this avouches the shepherd's son;

3297
02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:30.100
who has not only his innocence,

3298
02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:32.100
which seems much, to justify him,

3299
02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:33.370
but a handkerchief and rings

3300
02:33:33.370 --> 02:33:35.330
of his that Paulina knows.

3301
02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:37.870
What became of his bark and his followers?

3302
02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:41.130
Wrecked the same instant of their master's death

3303
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:42.800
and in the view of the shepherd:

3304
02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:44.070
so that all the instruments

3305
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:45.630
which aided to expose the child

3306
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:48.600
were even then lost when it was found.

3307
02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:52.970
But O, the noble combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow

3308
02:33:52.970 --> 02:33:54.830
was fought in Paulina!

3309
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:56.270
She had one eye declined

3310
02:33:56.270 --> 02:33:57.830
for the loss of her husband,

3311
02:33:57.830 --> 02:34:01.400
another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled:

3312
02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:04.030
she lifted the princess from the earth,

3313
02:34:04.030 --> 02:34:05.700
and so locks her in embracing,

3314
02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:08.030
as if she would pin her to her heart

3315
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:10.870
that she might no more be in danger of losing.

3316
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:13.400
The dignity of this act was worth the audience

3317
02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:16.900
of kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

3318
02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:19.130
One of the prettiest touches of all

3319
02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:20.530
and that which angled for mine eyes,

3320
02:34:20.530 --> 02:34:22.570
caught the water though not the fish, was when,

3321
02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:24.530
at the relation of the queen's death,

3322
02:34:24.530 --> 02:34:27.170
with the manner how she came to't bravely confessed

3323
02:34:27.170 --> 02:34:29.070
and lamented by the king,

3324
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:32.070
how attentiveness wounded his daughter;

3325
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:34.030
till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did,

3326
02:34:34.030 --> 02:34:36.530
with an 'Alas,'

3327
02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:39.570
I would fain say, bleed tears,

3328
02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:42.300
for I am sure my heart wept blood.

3329
02:34:42.300 --> 02:34:45.170
Who was most marble there changed colour;

3330
02:34:45.170 --> 02:34:47.830
some swooned, all sorrowed:

3331
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:50.900
if all the world could have seen 't,

3332
02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:53.270
the woe had been universal.

3333
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:55.230
Are they returned to the court?

3334
02:34:55.230 --> 02:34:57.830
No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,

3335
02:34:57.830 --> 02:34:59.700
which is in the keeping of Paulina,

3336
02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:03.000
--a piece many years in doing and now newly performed

3337
02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:04.830
by that rare Italian master,

3338
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:08.730
Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity

3339
02:35:08.730 --> 02:35:10.830
and could put breath into his work,

3340
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:12.630
would beguile Nature of her custom,

3341
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:15.130
so perfectly he is her ape:

3342
02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:17.970
he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione

3343
02:35:17.970 --> 02:35:20.800
that they say one would speak to her

3344
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:23.270
and stand in hope of answer:

3345
02:35:23.270 --> 02:35:24.900
thither with all greediness of affection

3346
02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:25.600
are they gone,

3347
02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:27.130
and there they intend to sup.

3348
02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:29.870
I thought she had some great matter there in hand;

3349
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:31.870
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day,

3350
02:35:31.870 --> 02:35:33.630
ever since the death of Hermione,

3351
02:35:33.630 --> 02:35:35.730
visited that removed house.

3352
02:35:35.730 --> 02:35:39.030
Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing?

3353
02:35:39.030 --> 02:35:42.400
Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?

3354
02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:46.270
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:

3355
02:35:46.270 --> 02:35:49.170
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.

3356
02:35:49.170 --> 02:35:50.230
Let's along.

3357
02:35:56.700 --> 02:36:01.100
Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,

3358
02:36:01.100 --> 02:36:04.430
would preferment drop on my head.

3359
02:36:04.430 --> 02:36:06.600
I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince:

3360
02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:10.000
told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what:

3361
02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.500
but he at that time, overfond

3362
02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:13.200
of the shepherd's daughter,

3363
02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:15.070
so he then took her to be,

3364
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:16.630
who began to be much sea-sick,

3365
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:17.800
and himself little better,

3366
02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:19.830
extremity of weather continuing,

3367
02:36:19.830 --> 02:36:23.470
this mystery remained undiscovered.

3368
02:36:23.470 --> 02:36:27.500
But 'tis all one to me; for had I been

3369
02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:29.400
the finder out of this secret,

3370
02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:34.330
it would not have relished among my other discredits.

3371
02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:36.930
Here come those I have done good to against my will,

3372
02:36:36.930 --> 02:36:40.270
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

3373
02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:45.000
Come, boy; I am past moe children,

3374
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:50.270
but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.

3375
02:36:52.430 --> 02:36:54.930
You are well met, sir.

3376
02:36:55.930 --> 02:36:57.730
You denied to fight with me this other day,

3377
02:36:57.730 --> 02:37:00.730
because I was no gentleman born.

3378
02:37:00.730 --> 02:37:02.870
See you these clothes?

3379
02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:03.730
say you see them not

3380
02:37:03.730 --> 02:37:05.900
and think me still no gentleman born:

3381
02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:06.830
you were best say these robes

3382
02:37:06.830 --> 02:37:08.070
are not gentlemen born:

3383
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:09.370
give me the lie, do,

3384
02:37:09.370 --> 02:37:11.470
and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

3385
02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:13.530
I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

3386
02:37:13.530 --> 02:37:16.300
Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

3387
02:37:16.300 --> 02:37:18.300
And so have I, boy.

3388
02:37:18.300 --> 02:37:19.530
So you have:

3389
02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:21.400
but I was a gentleman born before my father;

3390
02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:22.900
for the king's son took me by the hand,

3391
02:37:22.900 --> 02:37:24.330
and called me brother;

3392
02:37:24.330 --> 02:37:26.330
and then the two kings called my father brother;

3393
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:27.400
and then the prince my brother

3394
02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:30.770
and the princess my sister called my father father;

3395
02:37:30.770 --> 02:37:34.830
and so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like tears

3396
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:36.300
that ever we shed.

3397
02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:38.970
We may live, son, to shed many more.

3398
02:37:38.970 --> 02:37:41.800
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck,

3399
02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:44.400
being in so preposterous estate as we are.

3400
02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:45.730
I humbly beseech you, sir,

3401
02:37:45.730 --> 02:37:47.630
to pardon me all the faults I have committed

3402
02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:48.500
to your worship

3403
02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:49.530
and to give me your good report

3404
02:37:49.530 --> 02:37:51.600
to the prince my master.

3405
02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:55.770
Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle,

3406
02:37:55.770 --> 02:37:58.600
now we are gentlemen.

3407
02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:00.430
Thou wilt amend thy life?

3408
02:38:00.430 --> 02:38:03.170
Ay, an it like your good worship.

3409
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:04.700
Give me thy hand:

3410
02:38:04.700 --> 02:38:06.130
I will swear to the prince thou art

3411
02:38:06.130 --> 02:38:08.630
as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

3412
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:11.430
You may say it, but not swear it.

3413
02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:13.400
Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?

3414
02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:15.670
Let boors and franklins say it, I'll swear it.

3415
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:17.170
How if it be false, son?

3416
02:38:17.170 --> 02:38:18.400
If it be ne'er so false,

3417
02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:21.330
a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend:

3418
02:38:21.330 --> 02:38:24.300
and I'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands

3419
02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:26.430
and that thou wilt not be drunk;

3420
02:38:26.430 --> 02:38:28.700
but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands

3421
02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:32.700
and that thou wilt be drunk: but I'll swear it,

3422
02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:37.100
and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.

3423
02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:39.430
I will prove so, sir, to my power.

3424
02:38:39.430 --> 02:38:42.400
Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow:

3425
02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:44.570
if I do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk,

3426
02:38:44.570 --> 02:38:48.370
not being a tall fellow, trust me not.

3427
02:38:48.370 --> 02:38:54.570
Hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred,

3428
02:38:54.570 --> 02:38:57.700
are going to see the queen's picture.

3429
02:38:57.700 --> 02:39:03.200
Come, follow us: we'll be thy good masters.

3430
02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:57.800
O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort

3431
02:39:57.800 --> 02:39:59.500
That I have had of thee!

3432
02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:00.370
What, sovereign sir,

3433
02:40:00.370 --> 02:40:01.530
I did not well I meant well.

3434
02:40:01.530 --> 02:40:04.070
All my services you have paid home:

3435
02:40:04.070 --> 02:40:05.570
but that you have vouchsafed,

3436
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:06.900
With your crown'd brother

3437
02:40:06.900 --> 02:40:09.300
and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms,

3438
02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:10.700
my poor house to visit,

3439
02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:12.370
It is a surplus of your grace,

3440
02:40:12.370 --> 02:40:15.000
which never my life may last to answer.

3441
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:15.830
O Paulina,

3442
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:17.700
We honour you with trouble:

3443
02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:20.030
but we came to see the statue of our queen:

3444
02:40:20.030 --> 02:40:21.630
your gallery have we pass'd through,

3445
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:24.230
not without much content in many singularities;

3446
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:27.600
but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon,

3447
02:40:27.600 --> 02:40:29.430
The statue of her mother.

3448
02:40:29.430 --> 02:40:31.770
As she lived peerless,

3449
02:40:31.770 --> 02:40:33.900
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,

3450
02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:36.170
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon

3451
02:40:36.170 --> 02:40:38.430
Or hand of man hath done;

3452
02:40:38.430 --> 02:40:43.430
therefore I keep it lonely, apart.

3453
02:40:44.530 --> 02:40:46.530
But here it is:

3454
02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:52.930
prepare to see the life

3455
02:40:52.930 --> 02:40:58.430
as lively mock'd as ever still sleep mock'd death:

3456
02:41:11.570 --> 02:41:18.630
behold, and say 'tis well.

3457
02:41:22.270 --> 02:41:23.730
I like your silence,

3458
02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:28.530
it the more shows off your wonder: but yet speak;

3459
02:41:28.530 --> 02:41:30.730
first, you, my liege,

3460
02:41:30.730 --> 02:41:35.170
Comes it not something near?

3461
02:41:35.170 --> 02:41:37.970
Her natural posture!

3462
02:41:37.970 --> 02:41:39.100
Chide me, dear stone,

3463
02:41:39.100 --> 02:41:41.900
that I may say indeed thou art Hermione; or rather,

3464
02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:44.630
thou art she in thy not chiding,

3465
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:48.530
for she was as tender as infancy and grace.

3466
02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:51.900
But yet, Paulina, Hermione was not so much wrinkled,

3467
02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:53.730
nothing so aged as this seems.

3468
02:41:53.730 --> 02:41:55.100
O, not by much.

3469
02:41:55.100 --> 02:41:57.070
So much the more our carver's excellence;

3470
02:41:57.070 --> 02:41:59.100
Which lets go by some sixteen years

3471
02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:01.270
and makes her as she lived now.

3472
02:42:01.270 --> 02:42:04.170
As now she might have done,

3473
02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:05.400
So much to my good comfort,

3474
02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:10.200
as it is now piercing to my soul.

3475
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.800
O, thus she stood, even with such life of majesty,

3476
02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:16.900
warm life,

3477
02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:21.900
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!

3478
02:42:23.300 --> 02:42:26.100
I am ashamed:

3479
02:42:26.100 --> 02:42:27.130
does not the stone rebuke me

3480
02:42:27.130 --> 02:42:31.130
for being more stone than it?

3481
02:42:31.130 --> 02:42:35.900
O royal piece, there's magic in thy majesty,

3482
02:42:35.900 --> 02:42:39.300
which has my evils conjured to remembrance

3483
02:42:39.300 --> 02:42:42.030
and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits,

3484
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:45.030
Standing like stone with thee.

3485
02:42:45.030 --> 02:42:46.970
And give me leave,

3486
02:42:46.970 --> 02:42:50.130
And do not say 'tis superstition,

3487
02:42:50.130 --> 02:42:56.200
that I kneel and then implore her blessing.

3488
02:42:56.200 --> 02:43:04.470
Lady, Dear queen, that ended when I but began,

3489
02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:06.830
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

3490
02:43:06.830 --> 02:43:08.370
O, patience!

3491
02:43:08.370 --> 02:43:15.370
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's not dry.

3492
02:43:15.370 --> 02:43:20.730
My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,

3493
02:43:20.730 --> 02:43:23.800
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,

3494
02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:26.430
So many summers dry;

3495
02:43:26.430 --> 02:43:28.930
scarce any joy did ever so long live;

3496
02:43:28.930 --> 02:43:32.770
no sorrow but kill'd itself much sooner.

3497
02:43:32.770 --> 02:43:36.500
Dear my brother,

3498
02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:39.900
Let him that was the cause of this have power

3499
02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:42.330
to take off so much grief from you

3500
02:43:42.330 --> 02:43:44.530
as he will piece up in himself.

3501
02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:45.970
Indeed, my lord,

3502
02:43:45.970 --> 02:43:47.070
If I had thought the sight

3503
02:43:47.070 --> 02:43:49.100
of my poor image would thus have wrought you,

3504
02:43:49.100 --> 02:43:50.400
--for the stone is mine--

3505
02:43:50.400 --> 02:43:51.530
I'ld not have show'd it.

3506
02:43:51.530 --> 02:43:52.570
Do not draw the curtain.

3507
02:43:52.570 --> 02:43:54.530
No longer shall you gaze on't,

3508
02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:56.800
lest your fancy may think anon it moves.

3509
02:43:56.800 --> 02:43:58.470
Let be, let be.

3510
02:43:58.470 --> 02:43:59.570
Would I were dead, but that,

3511
02:43:59.570 --> 02:44:01.530
methinks, already--

3512
02:44:01.530 --> 02:44:03.830
What was he that did make it?

3513
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:05.930
See, my lord,

3514
02:44:05.930 --> 02:44:07.000
Would you not deem it breathed?

3515
02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.970
and that those veins did verily bear blood?

3516
02:44:08.970 --> 02:44:11.270
Masterly done:

3517
02:44:11.270 --> 02:44:14.270
The very life seems warm upon her lip.

3518
02:44:14.270 --> 02:44:16.700
The fixture of her eye has motion in't,

3519
02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:18.300
As we are mock'd with art.

3520
02:44:18.300 --> 02:44:19.700
I'll draw the curtain:

3521
02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:21.600
My lord's almost so far transported

3522
02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:23.170
that he'll think anon it lives.

3523
02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:24.100
O sweet Paulina,

3524
02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:26.300
Make me to think so twenty years together!

3525
02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:27.830
No settled senses of the world

3526
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:29.900
can match the pleasure of that madness.

3527
02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:31.070
Let 't alone.

3528
02:44:31.070 --> 02:44:34.730
I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you:

3529
02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:36.800
but I could afflict you farther.

3530
02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:38.700
Do, Paulina;

3531
02:44:38.700 --> 02:44:39.930
For this affliction has a taste

3532
02:44:39.930 --> 02:44:43.000
as sweet as any cordial comfort.

3533
02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.870
Still, methinks, there is an air comes from her:

3534
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:49.600
what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath?

3535
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.970
Let no man mock me, for I will kiss her.

3536
02:44:52.970 --> 02:44:54.270
Good my lord, forbear:

3537
02:44:54.270 --> 02:44:55.830
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;

3538
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:56.900
You'll mar it if you kiss it,

3539
02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.230
stain your own with oily painting.

3540
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:01.500
Shall I draw the curtain?

3541
02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:04.070
No, not these twenty years.

3542
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:07.530
So long could I stand by, a looker on.

3543
02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:09.270
Either forbear,

3544
02:45:09.270 --> 02:45:10.800
Quit presently the chapel,

3545
02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:14.670
or resolve you for more amazement.

3546
02:45:14.670 --> 02:45:19.800
If you can behold it, I'll make the statue move indeed,

3547
02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:23.330
descend and take you by the hand;

3548
02:45:23.330 --> 02:45:25.070
but then you'll think-- Which I protest against--

3549
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:27.700
I am assisted by wicked powers.

3550
02:45:27.700 --> 02:45:28.570
What you can make her do

3551
02:45:28.570 --> 02:45:31.100
I am content to look on: what to speak,

3552
02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:32.900
I am content to hear;

3553
02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:36.000
for 'tis as easy to make her speak as move.

3554
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.170
It is required

3555
02:45:37.170 --> 02:45:39.930
You do awake your faith.

3556
02:45:39.930 --> 02:45:42.230
Then all stand still;

3557
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:45.100
On: those that think it is unlawful business I am about,

3558
02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:46.230
let them depart.

3559
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:47.570
Proceed:

3560
02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:50.330
No foot shall stir.

3561
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:55.530
Music, awake her; strike!

3562
02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:09.000
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;

3563
02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.400
Strike all that look upon with marvel.

3564
02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:22.900
Come, I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,

3565
02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:26.270
Bequeath to death your numbness,

3566
02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:31.970
for from him dear life redeems you.

3567
02:46:31.970 --> 02:46:33.370
You perceive she stirs:

3568
02:46:33.370 --> 02:46:35.930
Start not; her actions shall be holy

3569
02:46:35.930 --> 02:46:39.330
as you hear my spell is lawful:

3570
02:46:39.330 --> 02:46:43.600
do not shun her until you see her die again;

3571
02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:46.870
for then you kill her double.

3572
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:49.470
Nay, present your hand:

3573
02:46:49.470 --> 02:46:52.230
When she was young you woo'd her;

3574
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:56.430
now in age is she become the suitor?

3575
02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:09.130
O, she's warm!

3576
02:47:10.930 --> 02:47:13.800
If this be magic, let it be an art

3577
02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:16.100
Lawful as eating.

3578
02:47:30.730 --> 02:47:32.070
She embraces him.

3579
02:47:32.870 --> 02:47:35.870
She hangs about his neck:

3580
02:47:36.430 --> 02:47:41.530
If she pertain to life let her speak too.

3581
02:47:41.530 --> 02:47:45.670
Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,

3582
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:48.300
Or how stolen from the dead.

3583
02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:49.400
That she is living,

3584
02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.430
Were it but told you,

3585
02:47:50.430 --> 02:47:54.000
should be hooted at like an old tale:

3586
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.830
but it appears she lives,

3587
02:47:55.830 --> 02:48:01.170
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.

3588
02:48:01.170 --> 02:48:04.430
Please you to interpose, fair madam:

3589
02:48:04.430 --> 02:48:08.400
kneel and pray your mother's blessing.

3590
02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:11.270
Turn, good lady;

3591
02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:14.070
Our Perdita is found.

3592
02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:21.530
You gods, look down and from your sacred vials

3593
02:48:21.530 --> 02:48:24.830
pour your graces upon my daughter's head!

3594
02:48:27.270 --> 02:48:32.000
Tell me, mine own.

3595
02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.900
Where hast thou been preserved?

3596
02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:35.870
where lived?

3597
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:38.500
how found thy father's court?

3598
02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.000
for thou shalt hear that I,

3599
02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:41.300
Knowing by Paulina

3600
02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:45.100
that the oracle gave hope thou wast in being,

3601
02:48:45.100 --> 02:48:49.130
have preserved myself to see the issue.

3602
02:48:49.130 --> 02:48:51.470
There's time enough for that;

3603
02:48:51.470 --> 02:48:53.070
Lest they desire upon this push

3604
02:48:53.070 --> 02:48:55.500
to trouble your joys with like relation.

3605
02:48:55.500 --> 02:48:59.300
Go together, you precious winners all;

3606
02:48:59.300 --> 02:49:02.900
your exultation partake to every one.

3607
02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:06.400
I, an old turtle,

3608
02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:08.630
will wing me to some wither'd bough and there

3609
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:12.700
My mate, that's never to be found again,

3610
02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:15.600
Lament till I am lost.

3611
02:49:17.070 --> 02:49:20.770
O, peace, Paulina!

3612
02:49:20.770 --> 02:49:22.900
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,

3613
02:49:22.900 --> 02:49:25.730
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,

3614
02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:28.230
And made between's by vows.

3615
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:29.700
Thou hast found mine;

3616
02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:32.170
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,

3617
02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:34.370
As I thought, dead,

3618
02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:38.070
and have in vain said many a prayer upon her grave.

3619
02:49:38.070 --> 02:49:39.130
I'll not seek far--

3620
02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:41.070
For him, I partly know his mind

3621
02:49:41.070 --> 02:49:43.870
--to find thee An honourable husband.

3622
02:49:43.870 --> 02:49:47.600
Come, Camillo, and take her by the hand,

3623
02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:50.700
whose worth and honesty is richly noted

3624
02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:51.570
and here justified

3625
02:49:51.570 --> 02:49:53.500
By us, a pair of kings.

3626
02:50:03.170 --> 02:50:05.170
Let's from this place.

3627
02:50:07.800 --> 02:50:10.100
What! look upon my brother:

3628
02:50:11.870 --> 02:50:12.670
both your pardons,

3629
02:50:12.670 --> 02:50:14.200
that e'er I put between your holy

3630
02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:16.900
looks my ill suspicion.

3631
02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:18.330
This is your son-in-law,

3632
02:50:18.330 --> 02:50:19.800
And son unto the king, who,

3633
02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:20.600
heavens directing,

3634
02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:22.900
Is troth-plight to your daughter.

3635
02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:30.170
Good Paulina, lead us from hence,

3636
02:50:30.170 --> 02:50:31.500
where we may leisurely each one

3637
02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:33.300
demand an answer to his part

3638
02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:35.730
Perform'd in this wide gap of time

3639
02:50:35.730 --> 02:50:41.400
since first we were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

3640
02:53:07.970 --> 02:53:10.970
