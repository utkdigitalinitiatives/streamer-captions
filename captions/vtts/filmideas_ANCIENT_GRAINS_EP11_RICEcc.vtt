(gentle music)

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.375
- [Voiceover] There
are things a man cannot

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:27.917
simply live without.

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.999
Even something as
tiny as a grain.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.083
For 8,000 years,
rice or oryza sativa,

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:38.250
has endured as a major
source of nourishment,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.999
of life, for the vast populous

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.125
of the Asian continent.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:47.999
While maize is the number
one crop cultivated today,

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.667
it can be said that rice
is an important food crop,

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.041
because it's
cultivation is largely,

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.999
if not mainly,
dedicated to human

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.542
consumption and nutrition.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.125
Rice is a very diverse crop,

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:11.834
with thousands of
varieties around the world.

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:14.959
This is probably the
reason why its origin

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:17.999
has been debated upon for years.

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:23.333
But a 2011 study, conducted
by New York University

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.875
published in the
precedings of the National

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.417
Academy of Sciences,
established what

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.375
Japonica and Indica,
the two major subspecies

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.625
of rice, have the
same origin due to the

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:38.999
many genetic similarities
they possess.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.041
They study also
strongly believes

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.750
that rice came about
around 8,200 years ago,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.000
and genetic
diversification happened

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.709
3,900 years ago, resulting
in the subspecies

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.792
Japonica, and Indica.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.250
The results also
corroborated archaeological

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.792
evidence, showing that
domestication began

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.000
in the Yongtze Valley in China

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.999
approximately 8,000
to 9,000 years ago.

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.625
And in the Ganges
region in India

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.291
some 4,000 years ago.

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.250
Rice then traveled
further into Europe

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.125
via several routes.

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:18.959
It reached the
roman empire during

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.667
Alexander the Great's
expedition to India,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:25.625
though the Romans imported
it mostly to make wine.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.041
Then it entered the
Balkan peninsula,

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.417
and then Italy from Turkey.

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.750
And it could have
reached Spain through

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.999
Greece or Egypt.

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.125
From Europe, particularly Spain,

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:40.458
rice then voyaged to
Central and South America

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:43.542
during the 16th
and 18th centuries.

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:46.625
It continued to spread
throughout the new world,

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.959
that by 1690 there
was already a steady

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.583
production in South Carolina.

00:02:52.583 --> 00:02:54.709
It expanded into nearby states

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.999
such as Mississippi,
southwest Louisiana,

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.999
Texas, central Arkansas,
and even as far as

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:05.000
California by 1909.

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.500
Chinese immigrants
brought rice with them

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.875
to Hawaii between 1853 and 1862,

00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.792
but it did not fair
well against the more

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:18.999
popular industries of
sugarcane and pineapple.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:23.250
Rice needs an ample amount
of water to survive.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.999
It can be grown in
high elevations,

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.999
granted that irrigation
and water controlling

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.166
systems are in place.

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:34.000
It also thrives well
in hot climates such as

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in the Philippines,
Indonesia, and Brazil.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.792
It grows from three
to six feet tall,

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:43.709
with long slender
leaves that are 20

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.792
to 39 inches in length,

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.250
and a pendulous
inflorescence that is

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.208
12 to 20 inches long.

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:54.667
Cultivation is rather
labor extensive,

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.917
due it its specific
irrigation requirements.

00:03:57.917 --> 00:04:00.542
During its early
vegetation stage,

00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:02.917
water depth must
be at two to three

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:07.125
centimeters to help
its roots hold ground.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:08.875
During its reproductive stage,

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:12.458
water should be between
five and seven centimeters,

00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:14.999
and must be kept
at this level until

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.208
the grains are milky.

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:19.250
Only one to two
weeks before harvest

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.500
can the rice paddy
be drained of water.

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:28.041
Rice under goes milling,
or refining processes.

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:31.041
The first milling
removes the outer husks,

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:33.333
producing brown rice.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.709
The second milling
removes the bran,

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:38.125
the rest of the
husk, and the germ,

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.250
producing white rice.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.999
White rice is the most
popular form of this

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.959
grain because of its
longer shelf life.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:49.208
Though many now
prefer brown rice

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:51.583
because of its
higher, and quality

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:53.375
nutritional profile.

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:55.999
Rice is a true global grain.

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.250
From China, it has
conquered the world

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.875
by proving its
value for mankind's

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.333
nourishment and survival.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:06.667
Rice is a true global grain.

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:10.125
(gentle music)

00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:18.333
Rice is one of today's
major food crops.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:21.667
As a matter of fact, in 2009

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:24.709
531.6 million metric tons

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:28.250
of rice was consumed
around the world.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.959
Over the years, many
have gradually shifted

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.999
from white rice to brown rice

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.709
due to belief that
the latter has

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:38.125
far better benefits.

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:41.999
Here is a comparison of
their nutritional profile

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.999
based on a 100 gram serving.

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:51.999
White rice has 28.17
grams of carbohydrates,

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.999
2.69 grams of protein,

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.375
130 kilocalories,

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:59.875
and .4 grams of fiber.

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:03.250
Brown rice has lower
carbohydrates and protein

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.834
at 22.96, and 2.58
grams respectively,

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:11.625
but it is better
in terms of fiber

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:12.959
and calorie content

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:17.375
at 1.8 grams, and
111 kilocalories.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:21.417
Both may have ten
milligrams of calcium,

00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:26.709
and white rice has higher
iron at 1.2 milligrams,

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:29.166
but brown rice out wins white

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:31.458
when it comes to other minerals.

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:35.125
Brown rice has 43
milligrams of magnesium,

00:06:35.125 --> 00:06:37.625
and white rice only has 12.

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:41.542
Brown rice has 83
milligrams of phosphorous,

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:44.291
and white rice only has 43.

00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:48.000
Brown rice has 43
milligrams of potassium,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.959
white rice only has 35.

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.875
Brown rice has .63
milligrams of zinc,

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:58.542
and white rice only has .49.

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.709
Brown rice also
has slightly higher

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:04.834
B vitamin values.

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:08.917
It has .025 milligrams
of riboflavin,

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:11.834
and white rice has .013.

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:15.041
It has 1.53
milligrams of niacin,

00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:17.999
and white rice has 1.48.

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:22.583
It has .145 milligrams
of vitamin B6,

00:07:22.583 --> 00:07:25.583
and white rice only has .093.

00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:27.999
White rice, however,
has significant levels

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.999
of folate, at 97 micrograms,

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:34.291
compared to brown
rice's four micrograms.

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:38.500
And it has .163
milligrams of thiamin,

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.959
while brown rice has .096.

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:46.291
(upbeat music)

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:56.999
Diabetic patients
are often encouraged

00:07:56.999 --> 00:08:00.166
to eat brown rice
instead of white.

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:01.959
According to numerous studies,

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:04.792
consumption of half a
cup of brown rice a day

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:07.208
can help reduce the
risks of developing

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:10.625
diabetes by 60 percent.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.041
It can also provide 80
percent of a person's

00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.375
daily manganese requirement,

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.999
which helps in keeping
good blood sugar levels

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:27.417
by regulating the
synthesis and secretion

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.999
of insulin in the body.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.709
The significant
amount of magnesium

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:36.959
in brown rice can
also act as the body's

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:39.792
natural calcium channel blocker,

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:42.125
which can reduce
frequency of migraines,

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:45.333
asthma, and lower
risks of heart attacks

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:47.000
and strokes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.625
How?

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:50.125
Calcium can over
activate nerve cells,

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:53.250
and cause them to
contract and become tense.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.750
Magnesium helps balance
the activity of calcium

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.834
and prevents it from rushing
into the nerve cells.

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:03.959
When nerve and
muscle contraction,

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:06.667
especially in the
heart, is regulated,

00:09:06.667 --> 00:09:09.999
spasms, cramps,
tension, soreness,

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:14.500
asthma, and fatigue
can be alleviated.

00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.166
Brown rice also has
top marks in weight

00:09:19.166 --> 00:09:22.417
management, due to
its fiber content.

00:09:22.417 --> 00:09:25.166
Combining brown rice
with other high fiber,

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:28.041
low-fat foods, and
plenty of water

00:09:28.041 --> 00:09:31.834
can effectively curb
a person's appetite.

00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:34.667
And together with its
antioxidant properties,

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:37.999
like phenolic, and
flavanoid compounds,

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:40.458
it can help eliminate
free radicals

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:43.083
before they mutate
into cancerous cells

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.999
and cause damage to organs.

00:09:46.999 --> 00:09:48.834
It's a good thing
that the nutritional

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:52.583
benefits of rice,
particularly brown rice,

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:55.041
are becoming
increasingly recognized

00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:56.625
outside of Asia.

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.999
Because it can then
offer those struggling

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.208
with diabetes and
coronary heart diseases

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.709
with an alternative
to better manage

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:06.834
their health conditions.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:10.750
(gentle music)

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:17.999
As a native of the
Asian continent,

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:20.999
rice is deeply
embedded in rituals

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:23.959
and customs of the Asian people.

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:26.208
Like amaranth and
maize, which were used

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:29.667
in various ceremonies
in South America,

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:33.208
rice also has multifaceted roles

00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:35.999
in Asian culture.

00:10:35.999 --> 00:10:37.999
In most western countries,

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:40.709
rice is thrown at
a newly wed couple

00:10:40.709 --> 00:10:42.750
after the wedding ceremony,

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.999
as a sign of fertility.

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:47.999
In India, rice is used in
several wedding rituals.

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:51.667
In some regions, couples
stand on a pile of rice

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:54.625
during the ceremony
as a form of prayer

00:10:54.625 --> 00:10:57.083
for sustenance and prosperity.

00:10:57.083 --> 00:11:00.083
The Hindu's also
believe that rice has

00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:01.999
powers against demons,

00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:04.208
so the bride and groom
usually pour rice

00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:09.625
into a wedding bonfire to
keep bad entities away.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:14.999
In Kerala, a state
in southern India,

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:18.417
farmers celebrate
makam, or October fifth

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:22.250
in the modern calender,
as the birthday of rice.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.999
Five rice grains are
anointed with sacred ashes,

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:28.999
sandalwood paste,
and ground turmeric

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:31.999
called coom coom and
are placed on a sacred

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:34.083
platter called taalam.

00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:36.999
The taalam is then
placed in a traditional

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:39.125
chamber called thekkepura,

00:11:39.125 --> 00:11:42.583
as an offering to the
Hindu goddess Parvati.

00:11:42.583 --> 00:11:46.375
Parvati loves a rice
pudding called paachoru,

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:48.125
which is made from boiled rice,

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:52.208
milk, sugar, jaggery, coconut,

00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:54.250
and turmeric.

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:57.583
Household women in
a state of purity,

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:00.125
cook this pudding
and after offering it

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:03.250
to Parvati they
serve it to farmers

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.125
and family members.

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:07.999
When Kerala farmers
started giving up rice

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:10.542
to grow other crops in the 70's,

00:12:10.542 --> 00:12:12.792
this birthday
tradition unfortunately

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:15.875
also started to
fade, with only a few

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:19.375
isolated places
left celebrating it.

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:24.999
In China, there is
a myth that rice is

00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:26.999
not a boon from the gods,

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:30.208
but rather a gift from animals.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:33.125
According to the story,
after a series of floods

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:36.041
devastated low lying
lands and farms,

00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:39.542
people were left
with nothing to eat.

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:41.917
Hunting was difficult
because even

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:43.583
animals were scarce.

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:46.083
Until one day they saw a dog,

00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:49.875
and hanging on its tail
were long, yellow seeds.

00:12:49.875 --> 00:12:52.417
They planted the
seeds, and soon enough

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:56.542
they harvested rice
and eradicated hunger.

00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:02.291
And finally, water
reservoirs and dams

00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:04.041
designed to hold and store water

00:13:04.041 --> 00:13:07.000
collected during the high
tide were constructed

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.834
during the Tang and
Song dynasties between

00:13:10.834 --> 00:13:15.917
1618 and 1279 BC.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:20.291
The Philippines is also
a large producer of rice.

00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:22.834
Then and now, the 3,000 year old

00:13:22.834 --> 00:13:25.999
Banaue Rice Terraces
in the Cordillera

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:27.625
mountain range of Luzon,

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:31.208
is ancient proof of
rice's long history

00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:32.458
in the country.

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:36.083
It is believed that the
terraces, 1,500 meters

00:13:36.083 --> 00:13:39.125
meters in height
and 10,360 square

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:44.125
kilometers in length, were
carved largely by hand.

00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.750
Today, the Banaue Rice Terraces

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.166
is an acknowledged
world heritage site,

00:13:49.166 --> 00:13:51.417
by the United
Nations Educational,

00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:54.125
Scientific, and
Cultural Organization,

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.291
or UNESCO, and is considered the

00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:59.291
eighth wonder of the world.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.667
In certain Asian
countries like China,

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.083
Bangladesh, and Thailand,

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:08.834
instead of, "How are you?",

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:10.583
"Have you eaten
your rice today?",

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.834
is a more common greeting.

00:14:12.834 --> 00:14:16.000
(gentle piano music)

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:20.291
In China too, "happy
new year" is not

00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:23.250
typically used,
instead they say,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.291
"May your rice never burn",

00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:28.125
to wish someone of prosperity.

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:33.500
If you are traveling
to Taiwan and China,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.583
do not poke your
chopsticks into a mound

00:14:35.583 --> 00:14:39.583
of rice, because that
symbolizes death.

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:47.709
It is undeniable
that rice has major

00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:50.291
contributions to the
wonderful and colorful

00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:53.458
tapestry of
traditions and customs

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:54.917
all around Asia.

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:57.291
And it will continue to
add interesting layers

00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.250
to that tapestry in
the years to come.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.999
(gentle music)

00:15:21.125 --> 00:15:24.999
China is the widely
known cradle of rice,

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:25.999
followed by India.

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:29.750
Since its early cultivation
some 8,000 years ago,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:32.999
rice remains to be the
predominant crop planted,

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:36.999
grown, and exported by
these two countries.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:40.417
Based on data gathered
by the United Nations'

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:42.709
Food and Agricultural
Organization,

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:46.834
or FAO, these are the
top ten rice producing

00:15:46.834 --> 00:15:50.709
countries in the world in 2012.

00:15:52.375 --> 00:15:55.125
Number one is mainland China,

00:15:55.125 --> 00:15:59.999
with 204,285,000 metric tons.

00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:02.083
Number two is India,

00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:06.875
with 152,600,000 metric tons.

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:09.083
Number three is Indonesia,

00:16:09.083 --> 00:16:14.792
with 69,045,141 metric tons.

00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:16.999
Number four is Vietnam,

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:22.583
with 43,661,569 metric tons.

00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:25.999
Number five is Thailand,

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:30.041
with 37,800,000 metric tons.

00:16:30.041 --> 00:16:33.333
Followed by Bangladesh
at number six,

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:35.250
Myanmar at number seven,

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.208
Philippines at number eight,

00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:38.999
Brazil at number nine,

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:41.917
and Japan at number ten.

00:16:42.709 --> 00:16:46.208
Manual harvesting and
lack of modern farming

00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:47.999
technology and knowledge

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:50.750
is a post harvest
problem the FAO,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.125
and the world bank
is looking into

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:54.999
and aiming to solve.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:16:57.750
According to a World
Bank-FAO study,

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.375
eight to 26 percent of
rice is lost each year

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:03.875
in rice producing
developing countries

00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:06.834
because of poor
transportation infrastructure,

00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:08.959
inadequate storage technology,

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:12.792
and supply chains, and
farmers' lack of access

00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:14.917
to retail markets.

00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:19.041
These post harvest
losses pose a threat

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:21.458
to global food security.

00:17:21.458 --> 00:17:24.792
The World Bank-FAO study
also estimates that

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:27.542
these green losses
experienced by developing

00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:31.041
countries such as India,
is already equivalent

00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:34.667
to 89 billion US
dollars worth of income.

00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:37.333
Also, if these grain
losses are collected

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:39.999
and saved, India alone
will have enough rice

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:44.417
grains to feed 70 million
to 100 million people

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:46.125
for a year.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.999
Rice is a major key in
global food security

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:53.375
since it is a staple food
in many Asian countries,

00:17:53.375 --> 00:17:55.999
and especially now
that consumption in the

00:17:55.999 --> 00:17:58.999
United States has
seen a steady increase

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.999
in the last 25 years.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.959
Aside from being a staple
carbohydrate source

00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:11.291
of Asian people, rice
also has other uses.

00:18:11.417 --> 00:18:14.083
Ground rice, or rice
flower, is used in beer

00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:16.542
and wine production,
and in other traditional

00:18:16.542 --> 00:18:20.500
beverages such as
the Japanese amazake,

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.959
and the South American horchata.

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.999
Rice is also now
rivaling maize and wheat

00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:32.999
in the production of
infant food and formula,

00:18:32.999 --> 00:18:36.417
snack food, and
breakfast cereals.

00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:42.583
Rice is gluten free,
so it's a very good

00:18:42.583 --> 00:18:45.750
substitute for people
with gluten intolerance,

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.792
and it is now used
as a main ingredient

00:18:48.792 --> 00:18:51.333
for face powders.

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:57.417
Rice powder is also
now used as a polishing

00:18:57.417 --> 00:19:01.250
agent for camera
lenses and jewelry.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.250
Discarded rice
straws are still used

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:05.875
in rope and paper making,

00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:09.291
and as cattle feed in
many parts of Asia.

00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:14.999
Though it is used in
some non-food items,

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:18.333
rice remains to be an
important food crop,

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:20.333
but according to the
International Rice

00:19:20.333 --> 00:19:23.291
Research Institute
in the Philippines,

00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:25.667
in order for mankind
to benefit from this

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:27.917
grain in the years to come,

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.291
it needs to be biofortified with

00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:32.583
essential nutrients and minerals

00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:34.792
such as iron, and zinc.

00:19:34.792 --> 00:19:36.583
The institute is
currently conducting

00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:39.999
biofortification projects,
not just to increase

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:43.458
rice's micronutrient
value, but to also

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:46.999
develop high-yielding varieties.

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:51.999
Rice may not be as
versatile as wheat

00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:54.667
in terms of end products
and by-products,

00:19:54.667 --> 00:19:57.166
but the daily meals of
the majority of Asian

00:19:57.166 --> 00:19:59.542
families will never
be complete without

00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:03.999
a bowl of hot, steamy rice
on their dinner tables.

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:09.999
(gentle music)

00:20:13.709 --> 00:20:16.333
Aside from its
color, white, brown,

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:20.125
or red, rice is also
distinguished according to its

00:20:20.125 --> 00:20:24.999
grain length, long,
medium, and short.

00:20:25.375 --> 00:20:28.250
The long grains tend to
retain their individual

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.999
shape after cooking,
and the medium grains

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:34.083
become sticky.

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:38.000
Because of the sticky
texture of medium grains,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.750
they are commonly used
in risotto in Italy,

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.583
in arros negre in Spain,

00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:47.166
and in sushi in Japan.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.999
Short grains are
usually cooked into

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:51.999
rice puddings.

00:20:51.999 --> 00:20:54.500
Since many are
switching to brown rice,

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.875
here is its basic
cooking method.

00:20:57.875 --> 00:20:59.750
Combine one cup of brown rice

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.999
and two cups of
water in a sauce pan.

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:05.583
Cover it and bring it to a boil.

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:07.375
Once boiling, reduce the heat

00:21:07.375 --> 00:21:11.250
and let it simmer
for 44 to 50 minutes.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.250
Unless you're making a risotto,

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.500
do not stir, because
stirring will

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.125
release extra starch.

00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:20.333
Aside from the
conventional risotto,

00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:21.999
and porridge recipes,

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:25.375
here are two unique
recipes you can try

00:21:25.375 --> 00:21:27.542
using rice.

00:21:27.667 --> 00:21:30.166
The first is Rice Mango Pudding.

00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.999
For this recipe you will need

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.542
100 grams of short grain rice,

00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:36.999
50 grams of castor sugar,

00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:39.875
800 milliliters of coconut milk,

00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.250
one ripe mango,

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.041
three table spoons of
dairy-free margarine,

00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:47.083
three table spoons
of light brown sugar,

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:49.999
and two tablespoons
of orange juice.

00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:53.333
First, in an ovenproof dish,

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:57.917
combine rice, castor
sugar, and coconut milk,

00:21:57.917 --> 00:22:00.999
and bake at 120 degrees Celcius,

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:03.667
or 250 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:22:03.667 --> 00:22:05.999
for two and a half hours.

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:09.583
Sir every half hour
to avoid clumping.

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:13.542
Second, while the
rice is in the oven

00:22:13.542 --> 00:22:15.125
you can make the sauce.

00:22:15.125 --> 00:22:18.709
Peel the mango, and
slice into small cubes,

00:22:18.709 --> 00:22:20.041
then set aside.

00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:22.375
In a small saucepan,
put the margarine,

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.750
brown sugar, and orange juice,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.250
and put it over
low heat until the

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.875
margarine melts.

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:31.375
Add the mango cubes,
and let the mixture

00:22:31.375 --> 00:22:33.709
simmer for ten minutes.

00:22:33.709 --> 00:22:36.000
Cool it, transfer to a bowl,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.625
and use a stick
blender to transform

00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:41.333
into a smooth sauce.

00:22:43.083 --> 00:22:45.667
And third, remove
the rice pudding

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:48.999
from the oven, stir
well, and spoon into

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:50.667
small serving bowls.

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.542
Pour the mango
sauce on each bowl,

00:22:53.542 --> 00:22:55.875
and serve.

00:22:56.999 --> 00:22:58.959
The second recipe is a cooling

00:22:58.959 --> 00:23:01.417
Colombian Rice Beverage.

00:23:01.417 --> 00:23:03.875
You will need 50 grams of rice,

00:23:03.875 --> 00:23:05.166
one cup of water,

00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:06.959
three cinnamon sticks,

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:08.999
four table spoons of sugar,

00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:10.333
one liter of water,

00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:13.583
and 150 grams of
sliced pineapple.

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:17.333
Making it is very easy.

00:23:17.999 --> 00:23:20.625
First, cook the rice
in one cup of water

00:23:20.625 --> 00:23:24.291
with the cinnamon
sticks to infuse flavor.

00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:28.083
One cooked, removed
the cinnamon sticks,

00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:30.917
and transfer rice to a blender.

00:23:30.917 --> 00:23:33.417
Add the sugar and
one liter of water,

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:35.709
and then blend until smooth.

00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:38.000
In a tall glass,
put some ice cubes,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.875
pieces of pineapple,
and pour the rice

00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.999
mixture up to the brim.

00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:44.750
This can be served with cookies,

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.792
cornbread, and cheese breads.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.583
Different countries may
have varying recipes

00:23:52.583 --> 00:23:56.999
using rice, but one fact
is common for all of them.

00:23:56.999 --> 00:23:59.375
And that is they owe
their daily strength

00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:02.083
and nourishment to
this ancient grain

00:24:02.083 --> 00:24:03.583
called rice.

00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:07.999
